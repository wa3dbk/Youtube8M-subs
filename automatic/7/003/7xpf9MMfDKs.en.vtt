00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
synthesizer photos you usually need a

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.750 
synthesizer photos you usually need a
dedicated<00:02:02.410> pickup<00:02:02.890> in<00:02:03.040> order<00:02:03.220> to<00:02:03.340> use<00:02:03.550> those

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
dedicated pickup in order to use those

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.510 
dedicated pickup in order to use those
units<00:02:04.180> so<00:02:04.780> it<00:02:04.900> does<00:02:05.110> not<00:02:05.320> mimic<00:02:05.590> keyboards<00:02:06.370> or

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
units so it does not mimic keyboards or

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.370 
units so it does not mimic keyboards or
read<00:02:06.729> instrument<00:02:07.300> string<00:02:07.690> stuff<00:02:08.020> like<00:02:08.200> that

read instrument string stuff like that

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.910 
read instrument string stuff like that
this<00:02:08.920> gives<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:09.520> analog<00:02:10.420> granular<00:02:11.230> synthesis

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
this gives you analog granular synthesis

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.820 
this gives you analog granular synthesis
and<00:02:12.190> what<00:02:12.850> that<00:02:13.030> means<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.930> when<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.620> play

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
and what that means is when you play

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:15.930 
and what that means is when you play
your<00:02:15.010> guitar<00:02:15.100> that's<00:02:15.520> going<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.790> produce

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
your guitar that's going to produce

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.120 
your guitar that's going to produce
sound<00:02:16.420> waves<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:16.959> then<00:02:17.320> the<00:02:17.440> panel<00:02:17.770> takes<00:02:17.980> a

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
sound waves and then the panel takes a

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.580 
sound waves and then the panel takes a
tiny<00:02:18.430> slice<00:02:18.850> of<00:02:19.090> that<00:02:19.120> sound<00:02:19.570> tiny<00:02:20.170> grains

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
tiny slice of that sound tiny grains

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.250 
tiny slice of that sound tiny grains
hence<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.459> name<00:02:21.670> granular<00:02:22.330> synthesis<00:02:22.990> and

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
hence the name granular synthesis and

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.680 
hence the name granular synthesis and
freezes<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:24.040> over<00:02:24.370> time<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:24.970> then<00:02:25.330> using

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
freezes that over time and then using

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.970 
freezes that over time and then using
the<00:02:25.810> knobs<00:02:26.080> on<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.410> pedal<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:26.739> can

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
the knobs on the pedal you can

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.880 
the knobs on the pedal you can
manipulate<00:02:27.360> that<00:02:28.360> frozen<00:02:28.720> send<00:02:29.200> you<00:02:29.470> can<00:02:29.680> use

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
manipulate that frozen send you can use

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.180 
manipulate that frozen send you can use
the<00:02:30.040> glissando<00:02:30.489> effect<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.690> morph<00:02:32.320> notes<00:02:32.920> and

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
the glissando effect to morph notes and

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.890 
the glissando effect to morph notes and
chords<00:02:33.459> in<00:02:33.700> and<00:02:33.970> out<00:02:34.120> of<00:02:34.239> each<00:02:34.330> other<00:02:34.600> and<00:02:34.840> you

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
chords in and out of each other and you

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.530 
chords in and out of each other and you
can<00:02:35.500> also<00:02:35.650> use<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.100> speed<00:02:36.400> layer<00:02:36.640> knob<00:02:36.970> to

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
can also use the speed layer knob to

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.170 
can also use the speed layer knob to
layer<00:02:37.959> different<00:02:38.350> frozen<00:02:39.250> sounds<00:02:39.640> on<00:02:39.760> top<00:02:39.970> of

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
layer different frozen sounds on top of

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.750 
layer different frozen sounds on top of
each<00:02:40.239> other<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:41.200> has<00:02:41.500> three<00:02:41.920> modes<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.430> first

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
each other it has three modes the first

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.080 
each other it has three modes the first
mode<00:02:43.090> is<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:44.020> latch<00:02:44.650> mode<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.610> means<00:02:45.880> that

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
mode is a latch mode and that means that

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.880 
mode is a latch mode and that means that
whenever<00:02:46.239> you<00:02:46.570> play<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.840> chord<00:02:47.140> and<00:02:47.350> then<00:02:47.620> press

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
whenever you play a chord and then press

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.610 
whenever you play a chord and then press
the<00:02:48.070> pedal<00:02:48.430> that<00:02:49.180> sounds<00:02:49.690> going<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:49.989> be<00:02:50.110> frozen

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
the pedal that sounds going to be frozen

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.890 
the pedal that sounds going to be frozen
and<00:02:50.770> then<00:02:50.890> you<00:02:51.040> can<00:02:51.220> layer<00:02:51.459> those<00:02:51.760> sends<00:02:52.239> the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
and then you can layer those sends the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.470 
and then you can layer those sends the
second<00:02:53.410> mode<00:02:53.650> is<00:02:53.890> called<00:02:54.220> momentary<00:02:54.940> mode<00:02:55.209> and

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
second mode is called momentary mode and

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.350 
second mode is called momentary mode and
what<00:02:55.959> that<00:02:56.140> does<00:02:56.440> is<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:57.459> freezes<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.120> notes

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
what that does is it freezes the notes

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.420 
what that does is it freezes the notes
that<00:02:58.510> you're<00:02:58.750> playing<00:02:59.019> when<00:02:59.890> you<00:03:00.010> press<00:03:00.280> the

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
that you're playing when you press the

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.490 
that you're playing when you press the
pedal<00:03:00.610> but<00:03:01.209> only<00:03:01.690> when<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:01.989> press<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.350> pedal

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
pedal but only when you press the pedal

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.830 
pedal but only when you press the pedal
so<00:03:02.799> when<00:03:03.010> you<00:03:03.130> release<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.580> foot<00:03:04.000> switch<00:03:04.239> the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
so when you release the foot switch the

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.870 
so when you release the foot switch the
notes<00:03:05.049> going<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.320> die<00:03:05.590> away<00:03:05.860> then<00:03:06.670> there's

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
notes going to die away then there's

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.970 
notes going to die away then there's
also<00:03:07.060> Auto<00:03:07.450> mode<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.170> that<00:03:08.260> automatically

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
also Auto mode and that automatically

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.650 
also Auto mode and that automatically
detects<00:03:09.370> when<00:03:09.640> you're<00:03:09.760> playing<00:03:10.000> hard<00:03:10.360> and

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
detects when you're playing hard and

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.780 
detects when you're playing hard and
then<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.410> superego<00:03:11.739> case<00:03:12.220> in<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:12.640> that's

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
then the superego case in and that's

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.270 
then the superego case in and that's
great<00:03:13.000> for<00:03:13.239> triggering<00:03:13.600> effects<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:14.410> that

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
great for triggering effects and that

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.250 
great for triggering effects and that
sit<00:03:15.730> in<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.090> super-ego<00:03:16.450> is<00:03:16.630> effects<00:03:17.019> loop

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
sit in the super-ego is effects loop

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.110 
sit in the super-ego is effects loop
because<00:03:17.799> that's<00:03:17.980> also<00:03:18.160> a<00:03:18.310> very<00:03:18.400> heat<00:03:18.820> little

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
because that's also a very heat little

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.990 
because that's also a very heat little
feature<00:03:19.360> you<00:03:20.080> can<00:03:20.230> actually<00:03:20.380> plug<00:03:20.830> in<00:03:21.070> a<00:03:21.310> facts

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
feature you can actually plug in a facts

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.300 
feature you can actually plug in a facts
into<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.660> superego<00:03:23.049> pedal<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:23.769> those<00:03:24.190> are

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
into the superego pedal and those are

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.150 
into the superego pedal and those are
going<00:03:24.459> to<00:03:24.610> influence<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.989> effected<00:03:26.709> signal

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
going to influence the effected signal

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.890 
going to influence the effected signal
so<00:03:27.340> not<00:03:27.519> your<00:03:27.700> dry<00:03:27.940> sound<00:03:28.239> you<00:03:28.480> also<00:03:28.720> heard

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900

me to have this Pelin demo it for them
and<00:06:49.820> so<00:06:50.270> I<00:06:50.300> did<00:06:50.570> and<00:06:50.720> I<00:06:50.810> think<00:06:50.870> it's<00:06:51.470> the

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:51.800 
and so I did and I think it's the

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.680 
and so I did and I think it's the
coolest<00:06:52.130> well<00:06:52.580> you<00:06:52.670> have<00:06:52.820> no<00:06:53.060> preconceived

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:53.690 
coolest well you have no preconceived

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.570 
coolest well you have no preconceived
notion<00:06:54.260> as<00:06:54.410> to<00:06:54.440> what<00:06:54.740> you're<00:06:54.890> supposed<00:06:55.040> to<00:06:55.370> do

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.580 
notion as to what you're supposed to do

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.550 
notion as to what you're supposed to do
with<00:06:55.700> it<00:06:55.760> just<00:06:56.060> plug<00:06:56.330> it<00:06:56.480> in<00:06:56.570> and<00:06:56.750> see<00:06:56.930> see

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 
with it just plug it in and see see

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.650 
with it just plug it in and see see
where<00:06:57.800> you<00:06:57.980> end<00:06:58.010> up<00:06:58.400> alright<00:06:58.940> I<00:06:59.090> think<00:06:59.570> it's

00:06:59.650 --> 00:06:59.660 
where you end up alright I think it's

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.840 
where you end up alright I think it's
great<00:06:59.960> for<00:07:00.230> scoring<00:07:00.710> movies<00:07:01.100> I<00:07:01.310> think<00:07:01.730> it's

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:01.850 
great for scoring movies I think it's

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.780 
great for scoring movies I think it's
also<00:07:01.970> really<00:07:02.570> cool<00:07:02.920> using<00:07:03.920> its<00:07:04.100> effects<00:07:04.520> loop

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:04.790 
also really cool using its effects loop

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.570 
also really cool using its effects loop
and<00:07:05.060> plugging<00:07:05.450> in<00:07:05.540> flanger<00:07:06.200> or<00:07:06.470> reverb<00:07:06.950> in

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:07.580 
and plugging in flanger or reverb in

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.670 
and plugging in flanger or reverb in
there<00:07:07.880> and<00:07:08.150> making<00:07:08.570> cool<00:07:08.750> sound<00:07:09.050> scapes<00:07:09.410> and

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 
there and making cool sound scapes and

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.560 
there and making cool sound scapes and
what<00:07:10.220> I<00:07:10.250> found<00:07:10.490> really<00:07:10.760> surprising<00:07:11.420> was<00:07:11.540> the

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:11.570 
what I found really surprising was the

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.450 
what I found really surprising was the
military<00:07:11.930> mode<00:07:12.470> where<00:07:12.680> you<00:07:12.860> can<00:07:13.010> use<00:07:13.160> it<00:07:13.310> on<00:07:13.400> a

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:13.460 
military mode where you can use it on a

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.640 
military mode where you can use it on a
lead<00:07:13.760> guitar<00:07:14.180> and<00:07:14.510> freeze<00:07:14.780> certain<00:07:15.140> notes<00:07:15.380> for

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:15.650 
lead guitar and freeze certain notes for

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.850 
lead guitar and freeze certain notes for
very<00:07:15.830> surprising<00:07:16.550> effects<00:07:17.060> I<00:07:17.230> think<00:07:18.230> a<00:07:18.620> really

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860 
very surprising effects I think a really

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.070 
very surprising effects I think a really
good<00:07:19.130> pal<00:07:19.430> usually<00:07:19.670> sparks<00:07:20.330> some<00:07:20.720> sort<00:07:20.960> of

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 
good pal usually sparks some sort of

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.050 
good pal usually sparks some sort of
creativity<00:07:21.440> in<00:07:21.860> that<00:07:22.040> and<00:07:22.280> and<00:07:22.490> that<00:07:22.670> this

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:23.060 
creativity in that and and that this

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.850 
creativity in that and and that this
pedal<00:07:23.390> absolutely<00:07:23.960> does<00:07:24.170> that<00:07:24.410> it<00:07:24.620> really

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:24.860 
pedal absolutely does that it really

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.860 
pedal absolutely does that it really
sparked<00:07:25.250> my<00:07:25.430> creativity<00:07:26.030> and<00:07:26.360> made<00:07:26.540> me<00:07:26.660> play

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:26.870 
sparked my creativity and made me play

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.960 
sparked my creativity and made me play
the<00:07:27.080> guitar<00:07:27.410> in<00:07:27.560> a<00:07:27.680> different<00:07:28.070> way<00:07:28.220> and<00:07:28.520> go

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:28.970 
the guitar in a different way and go

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.270 
the guitar in a different way and go
places<00:07:29.210> I<00:07:29.480> hadn't<00:07:29.870> gone<00:07:30.050> before<00:07:30.500> so<00:07:30.800> that's

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 
places I hadn't gone before so that's
