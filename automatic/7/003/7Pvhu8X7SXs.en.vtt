00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.820
 first time 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.269
 in January when they say 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.269
 in September 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.929
 installation process 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.380
 10th of November 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.140
 this project 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.130
 Baku 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:33.219
 there really does not discriminate 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:36.049
 injuries 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.609
 commented 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.609
 But those who do not want 

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:45.149
 Mama 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.619
 I think 

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:51.849
 so what 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.549
 then 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.539
 so option 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:58.539
 like this 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.099
 five 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.259
 by 4 1 percent
