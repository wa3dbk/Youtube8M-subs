00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.580
 the team did not resist 

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.560
 the team did not show what 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.920
 We have been introducing for weeks 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.920
 you have it right 

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:14.279
 would you say the team is 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:16.390
 very insecure there is normal in 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:17.730
 Of course, such a phase is not 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.830
 self-confidence because that's logical 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.600
 are you also unsettled me yes 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.100
 why, because of the one or the other 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.380
 other people are not the safest 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.630
 impression made that made that one is 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.190
 not used to them 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.140
 area uncertain 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.910
 at 1 0 they would have the ball through 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.910
 can endure with the left hand and 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.269
 One comes out and the other 20 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.360
 results to live normally 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:49.530
 shit runs shit so you give it 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.530
 already guilty of being outnumbered 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.140
 I can hold the concentration like that 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.210
 I am here somehow got in in 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.159
 The stadium has sold poster 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.920
 read by any people there 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.420
 I've been sitting there, I believe 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.890
 fc bavaria you are what does not know one 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.409
 mercenaries or as any 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.869
 shit where they say that alone 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.600
 It motivates me because it is already 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.640
 sad what you have to experience then if 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.409
 so the team is so big 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.479
 has done in recent years the 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.899
 Fans have so much fun and joy 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:28.210
 who like a strange example now 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.500
 here completely something motivates me 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.170
 twice and three times I have to completely 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.729
 to say honestly is always about seeing you 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.979
 even with manual new it's all about 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.810
 I try always to the 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.500
 It is also possible for young people to pass on 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.300
 That's why I always say the worse ones 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.830
 games or the mistakes you make 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.770
 It is completely normal today 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:51.789
 no more that you flawless that you 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.840

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:59.039

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.039
