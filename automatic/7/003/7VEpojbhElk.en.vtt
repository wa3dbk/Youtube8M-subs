other type of building material redstone

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.430 
other type of building material redstone
redstone<00:00:39.660> torches<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:41.390> piston<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.660> bucket<00:00:43.350> of

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
redstone torches a piston a bucket of

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.250 
redstone torches a piston a bucket of
water<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:45.030> last<00:00:45.270> you'll<00:00:45.539> need<00:00:45.719> some

water and the last you'll need some
cocoa<00:00:46.590> beans<00:00:46.920> now<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.280> first<00:00:47.730> step<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.210> to

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
cocoa beans now the first step is to

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.630 
cocoa beans now the first step is to
build<00:00:48.570> up<00:00:48.870> your<00:00:48.899> jungle<00:00:49.649> wood<00:00:49.800> blocks<00:00:50.100> 11

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
build up your jungle wood blocks 11

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.310 
build up your jungle wood blocks 11
block<00:00:50.850> size<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.420> 1<00:00:51.690> 2<00:00:52.350> 3<00:00:52.680> 4<00:00:53.280> 5<00:00:54.090> 6<00:00:54.420> 7<00:00:55.110> 8<00:00:55.320> 9<00:00:55.949> 10<00:00:56.550> 11

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
block size so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.840 
block size so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
after<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.800> done<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.399> are<00:00:59.670> going

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
after you have that done you are going

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.250 
after you have that done you are going
to<00:01:00.090> either<00:01:00.180> have<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.480> fall<00:01:00.719> or<00:01:00.930> get<00:01:01.079> down

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
to either have to fall or get down

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.560 
to either have to fall or get down
somehow<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.070> count<00:01:02.730> out<00:01:02.850> six<00:01:03.149> blocks<00:01:03.449> from

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
somehow and count out six blocks from

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.200 
somehow and count out six blocks from
this<00:01:03.780> block<00:01:04.049> 1<00:01:04.379> 2<00:01:04.710> 3<00:01:05.010> 4<00:01:05.880> 5<00:01:06.330> 6<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.580> on<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.880> six

tell you how you're going to do that but
you<00:02:06.360> get<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.600> idea<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:07.229> now<00:02:08.039> make<00:02:08.340> sure<00:02:08.369> you

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
you get the idea and now make sure you

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.020 
you get the idea and now make sure you
break<00:02:09.420> these<00:02:09.929> few<00:02:10.770> blocks<00:02:11.310> right<00:02:11.580> here<00:02:11.849> or

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
break these few blocks right here or

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.430 
break these few blocks right here or
else<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.420> water<00:02:12.629> will<00:02:12.959> not<00:02:13.170> be

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
else the water will not be

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.280 
else the water will not be
fall<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:14.070> build<00:02:15.030> up<00:02:15.210> this<00:02:15.630> some<00:02:16.110> right<00:02:16.380> here

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
fall and build up this some right here

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.140 
fall and build up this some right here
so<00:02:19.290> now<00:02:19.710> that<00:02:19.740> this<00:02:20.070> is<00:02:20.130> built<00:02:20.490> up<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.910> have

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
so the cocoa bean farm is now complete

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.940 
so the cocoa bean farm is now complete
is<00:03:33.090> an<00:03:33.270> easy<00:03:33.780> thing<00:03:34.080> to<00:03:34.230> do<00:03:34.350> I'd<00:03:34.470> recommend<00:03:34.770> you

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
wields this yields a lot of cocoa beans

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.240 
wields this yields a lot of cocoa beans
now<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.300> replant<00:03:42.810> them<00:03:43.019> I<00:03:43.230> recommend<00:03:44.010> just

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
now to replant them I recommend just

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.820 
now to replant them I recommend just
doing<00:03:44.550> this<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:46.260> may<00:03:46.440> not<00:03:46.560> be<00:03:46.680> able<00:03:46.739> to

doing this and you may not be able to
reach<00:03:46.980> up<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.340> top<00:03:47.519> so<00:03:47.700> you<00:03:47.760> may<00:03:47.910> have<00:03:47.940> to

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
reach up to the top so you may have to

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.150 
reach up to the top so you may have to
build<00:03:48.269> some<00:03:48.420> blocks<00:03:48.660> up<00:03:48.930> but<00:03:49.530> yeah<00:03:49.800> this<00:03:50.010> is

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.970 
build some blocks up but yeah this is
your<00:03:50.310> basic<00:03:50.640> cocoa<00:03:50.820> bean<00:03:51.090> farm<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.810> i'm<00:03:52.800> going

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
your basic cocoa bean farm and i'm going

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.770 
your basic cocoa bean farm and i'm going
to<00:03:53.040> show<00:03:53.220> you<00:03:53.250> guys<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.550> one<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.269> built<00:03:54.510> that

to show you guys that one I built that

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.780 
to show you guys that one I built that
was<00:03:55.080> huge<00:03:55.590> just<00:03:56.040> showing<00:03:56.430> how<00:03:56.640> many

was huge just showing how many

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.310 
was huge just showing how many
possibilities<00:03:57.209> there<00:03:57.540> are<00:03:57.570> with<00:03:57.840> this<00:03:57.989> design

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
possibilities there are with this design

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.180 
possibilities there are with this design
so<00:03:59.220> yeah<00:03:59.610> I<00:03:59.640> be<00:03:59.880> right<00:04:00.000> back<00:04:00.150> when<00:04:00.360> that<00:04:00.570> is
