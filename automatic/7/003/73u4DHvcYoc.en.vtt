an<00:00:31.920> older<00:00:32.340> German<00:00:32.759> violin<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:34.230> don't<00:00:35.040> know<00:00:35.219> it's

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
an older German violin I don't know it's

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.569 
an older German violin I don't know it's
aged<00:00:35.700> but<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.090> has<00:00:36.450> an<00:00:36.899> on<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.380> inside<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.219> the

top<00:00:38.940> when<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.420> had<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.930> apart<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.469> found

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
top when I had it apart I found

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.020 
top when I had it apart I found
pencilled<00:00:42.950> handwriting<00:00:43.950> saying<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.910> had

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
been repaired in New York in 1911 so

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.260 
been repaired in New York in 1911 so
it's<00:00:50.250> definitely<00:00:50.789> somewhat<00:00:51.360> older<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.219> it's

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
it's definitely somewhat older and it's

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.069 
it's definitely somewhat older and it's
similar<00:00:54.530> maple<00:00:55.579> figure<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.420> neck<00:00:57.840> on

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
similar maple figure and the neck on

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.430 
similar maple figure and the neck on
this<00:00:58.410> instrument<00:00:59.030> has<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.539> think<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:01.230> more

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
this instrument has I think a more

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:09.670 
this instrument has I think a more
pronounced<00:01:02.600> figure<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.170> grain<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:07.340> then

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
pronounced figure in the grain and then

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.780 
pronounced figure in the grain and then
the<00:01:10.680> other<00:01:10.860> violin<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.549> my<00:01:11.729> French<00:01:12.060> violin<00:01:12.659> and

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
the other violin is my French violin and

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.749 
the other violin is my French violin and
here<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:17.060> figure<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.299> more<00:01:18.780> subtle<00:01:19.759> it's

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
here the the figure is more subtle it's

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.999 
here the the figure is more subtle it's
still<00:01:21.210> visible<00:01:22.430> but<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.670> more<00:01:23.909> subtle<00:01:25.100> and

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
still visible but it is more subtle and

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.800 
still visible but it is more subtle and
violin<00:01:29.009> makers<00:01:31.009> developed<00:01:32.299> different<00:01:33.299> sort

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
violin makers developed different sort

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.440 
violin makers developed different sort
of<00:01:33.920> signature<00:01:34.920> styles<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:37.610> altering<00:01:38.610> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
of signature styles of altering the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.310 
of signature styles of altering the
colouring<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:41.460> varnish<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:43.049> some

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
colouring of the varnish and in some

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.609 
colouring of the varnish and in some
cases<00:01:43.560> they<00:01:43.920> did<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.310> an<00:01:44.430> extreme<00:01:45.380> this<00:01:46.380> was

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
cases they did it to an extreme this was

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.280 
cases they did it to an extreme this was
referred<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.240> commercial<00:01:48.780> violin

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
referred to in the commercial violin

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.880 
referred to in the commercial violin
trade<00:01:49.950> as<00:01:50.810> imitation<00:01:51.810> old<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:54.770> it<00:01:55.770> was

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
trade as imitation old and it was

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.530 
trade as imitation old and it was
thought<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.670> believe<00:01:57.140> that<00:01:58.140> an<00:01:58.909> older<00:01:59.909> violin

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
thought I believe that an older violin

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.459 
thought I believe that an older violin
would<00:02:01.079> have<00:02:01.369> better<00:02:02.369> tone<00:02:03.200> would<00:02:04.200> have<00:02:04.290> also

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
would have better tone would have also

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.340 
would have better tone would have also
wood<00:02:04.799> stood<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.219> test<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.610> time<00:02:05.670> and

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
wood stood the test of time and

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.839 
wood stood the test of time and
therefore<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.619> could<00:02:07.799> increase<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.429> value

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
therefore you could increase the value

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:09.620 
therefore you could increase the value
of<00:02:08.879> an

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
of an

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.620 
of an
violin<00:02:10.080> if<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.350> made<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.590> look<00:02:10.980> old<00:02:11.630> now

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
violin if you made it look old now

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.190 
violin if you made it look old now
whether<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.260> really<00:02:14.510> made<00:02:15.510> any<00:02:15.720> difference

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
whether that really made any difference

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.230 
whether that really made any difference
in<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.620> value<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.160> violins<00:02:17.580> I'm<00:02:17.970> not

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
in the value of the violins I'm not

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.560 
in the value of the violins I'm not
prepared<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.750> say<00:02:19.020> but<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.940> result<00:02:21.330> is

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
prepared to say but it the result is

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.460 
prepared to say but it the result is
that<00:02:21.600> that<00:02:22.380> violins<00:02:23.070> have<00:02:23.340> very<00:02:23.670> interesting

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
that that violins have very interesting

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.810 
that that violins have very interesting
appearances<00:02:25.470> that<00:02:26.460> I<00:02:26.700> think<00:02:27.060> arise<00:02:27.630> from<00:02:28.170> the

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
appearances that I think arise from the

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.900 
appearances that I think arise from the
ways<00:02:29.820> that<00:02:30.420> individual<00:02:31.290> violin<00:02:31.830> makers<00:02:32.370> tried

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
ways that individual violin makers tried

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.700 
ways that individual violin makers tried
to<00:02:33.120> apply<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:34.110> concept<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:36.420> so<00:02:37.350> a<00:02:37.380> lot<00:02:37.680> of

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
to apply that concept and so a lot of

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.870 
to apply that concept and so a lot of
the<00:02:37.980> violins<00:02:38.490> don't<00:02:39.000> have<00:02:39.650> uniform<00:02:40.880> coloring

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
the violins don't have uniform coloring

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.480 
the violins don't have uniform coloring
and<00:02:42.260> uniform<00:02:43.260> varnish<00:02:43.830> but<00:02:44.340> but<00:02:45.180> actually

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
and uniform varnish but but actually

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.160 
and uniform varnish but but actually
deliberate<00:02:50.450> changes<00:02:51.450> in<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.690> varnish<00:02:52.020> or

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
deliberate changes in the varnish or

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.050 
deliberate changes in the varnish or
differences<00:02:52.590> in<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.830> varnish<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.460> are

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
differences in the varnish that are

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.350 
differences in the varnish that are
related<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.540> making<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:55.230> look<00:02:55.580> older<00:02:56.580> more

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360
