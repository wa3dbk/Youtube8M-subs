they increase the health a little bit

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.280

more<00:01:12.299> in<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.450> game<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.780> actually<00:01:13.110> take<00:01:13.260> a

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
more in this game it actually take a

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.870 
more in this game it actually take a
little<00:01:13.470> bit<00:01:13.619> more<00:01:13.799> skill<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.189> kill<00:01:14.369> people<00:01:14.700> and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
little bit more skill to kill people and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.789 
little bit more skill to kill people and

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
I think competitive players would enjoy

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.170 
I think competitive players would enjoy
it<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.009> little<00:01:17.130> bit<00:01:17.310> more<00:01:17.430> because<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:18.030> game

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
it a little bit more because this game

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.149 
it a little bit more because this game
is<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.390> lot<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.689> pre<00:01:18.930> aim<00:01:19.140> hold<00:01:19.799> your<00:01:19.920> trigger

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
is a lot of pre aim hold your trigger

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.710 
is a lot of pre aim hold your trigger
down<00:01:20.340> kill<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> person<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.360> there's<00:01:21.570> really

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
down kill a person and there's really

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.690 
down kill a person and there's really
almost<00:01:22.140> everybody<00:01:23.130> can<00:01:23.280> kill<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.580> this

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
almost everybody can kill you in this

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.249 
almost everybody can kill you in this
game<00:01:23.880> because<00:01:24.060> there's<00:01:24.540> no<00:01:24.659> recoil<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
game because there's no recoil and the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.440 
game because there's no recoil and the
gun<00:01:25.380> skills<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:25.740> quickly<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.759> think<00:01:27.090> if<00:01:27.330> they

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
gun skills so quickly so I think if they

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.569 
gun skills so quickly so I think if they
added<00:01:27.810> more<00:01:27.960> hell<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.470> game<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:29.369> player

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
added more hell to the game that player

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.770 
added more hell to the game that player
would<00:01:29.729> have<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.970> keep<00:01:30.150> on<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> little<00:01:30.689> bit

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
would have to keep on you a little bit

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.630 
would have to keep on you a little bit
longer<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.770> make<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.159> little<00:01:32.280> bit<00:01:32.430> more

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
longer and it make it a little bit more

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.100 
longer and it make it a little bit more
difficult<00:01:32.880> for<00:01:33.420> them<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.540> kill<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.020> you

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
difficult for them to kill you if you

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.719 
difficult for them to kill you if you

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
a couple I think they nerfed the MSBs

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.710 
a couple I think they nerfed the MSBs
because<00:04:06.700> everybody<00:04:07.030> complained<00:04:07.360> about<00:04:07.450> it
