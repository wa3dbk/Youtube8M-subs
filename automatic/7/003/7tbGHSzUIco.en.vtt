headlight plugs to make otherwise when

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.420 
headlight plugs to make otherwise when

it's time to take the battery out what

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.189 
it's time to take the battery out what
you<00:01:02.609> see<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.030> sitting<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.480> here<00:01:03.750> behind<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
you see is sitting in here behind the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.710 
you see is sitting in here behind the
seat<00:01:05.540> on<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.659> backside<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> cab<00:01:08.420> it<00:01:09.420> just

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
seat on the backside of the cab it just

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.359 
seat on the backside of the cab it just
slides<00:01:10.080> out<00:01:10.400> after<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.520> unplug<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.119> course

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
slides out after you unplug it of course

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:20.030 
slides out after you unplug it of course
and<00:01:14.369> easy<00:01:15.360> enough<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.750> replace<00:01:18.259> so<00:01:19.259> once<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:19.979> do

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
and easy enough to replace so once I do

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.480 
and easy enough to replace so once I do
get<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.520> lights<00:01:20.729> rigged<00:01:21.119> up<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.720> cab<00:01:22.490> I'm

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
get the lights rigged up on the cab I'm

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.280 
get the lights rigged up on the cab I'm
I'm<00:01:24.360> figuring<00:01:24.930> I'll<00:01:25.920> probably<00:01:26.220> end<00:01:26.490> up

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
I'm figuring I'll probably end up

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.870 
I'm figuring I'll probably end up
setting<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.380> down<00:01:28.409> like<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.130> when<00:01:29.670> it's<00:01:29.820> time

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
setting it down like so when it's time

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.690 
setting it down like so when it's time
to<00:01:30.030> change<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.509> battery<00:01:31.729> or<00:01:34.460> worst<00:01:35.460> case

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
to change the battery or worst case

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.300 
to change the battery or worst case
scenario<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.450> could<00:01:36.600> probably<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:37.310> kind

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
scenario is I could probably just kind

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.440 
scenario is I could probably just kind
of<00:01:38.490> leave<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:39.600> like<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.880> do<00:01:41.880> my<00:01:42.030> battery

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
of leave it on like so do my battery

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.060 
of leave it on like so do my battery
switch<00:01:43.040> and<00:01:44.040> then<00:01:44.220> as<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.180> said<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:46.110> easy<00:01:46.500> it

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
switch and then as I said it's easy it

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.050 
switch and then as I said it's easy it
is<00:01:47.659> that's<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.899> folks

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
is that's it folks

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
but the fact that everything stays out

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.949 
but the fact that everything stays out
of<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.099> way<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.730> I'm<00:02:34.030> able<00:02:34.239> to<00:02:34.480> put<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.720> cab

the broken the brake lights are

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.650 
the broken the brake lights are
programmable<00:04:00.010> as<00:04:01.010> to<00:04:01.700> how<00:04:02.030> long<00:04:02.060> you<00:04:02.420> want

so<00:04:46.030> yeah<00:04:46.180> it's<00:04:46.360> coming<00:04:46.570> along<00:04:47.340> just<00:04:48.340> to<00:04:48.520> power

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
so yeah it's coming along just to power

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:55.620 
so yeah it's coming along just to power
back<00:04:49.120> off<00:04:49.860> the<00:04:50.860> lights<00:04:51.100> oh<00:04:54.450> and<00:04:55.450> the<00:04:55.510> other

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
of reges dump truck builds and the way

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.030 
of reges dump truck builds and the way
he<00:05:04.540> designs<00:05:05.050> the<00:05:05.410> lift<00:05:06.130> mechanism<00:05:07.830> is<00:05:08.830> it

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
he designs the lift mechanism is it

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.960 
he designs the lift mechanism is it
turns<00:05:09.310> into<00:05:09.580> an<00:05:09.850> instantaneous<00:05:12.570> great<00:05:13.570> way<00:05:13.810> to

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
turns into an instantaneous great way to

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.670 
turns into an instantaneous great way to
elevate<00:05:15.970> your<00:05:16.450> truck<00:05:16.750> and<00:05:16.960> actually<00:05:17.320> work<00:05:17.500> on

listen<00:05:19.290> obviously<00:05:20.290> you<00:05:20.350> can<00:05:20.530> change<00:05:20.770> the

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
listen obviously you can change the

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.219 
listen obviously you can change the
angle<00:05:21.160> all<00:05:21.550> you<00:05:21.729> want<00:05:22.000> this<00:05:22.810> is<00:05:22.960> pretty<00:05:23.139> much

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229

that<00:05:23.910> full<00:05:24.910> up<00:05:25.350> it<00:05:26.350> allows<00:05:26.620> me<00:05:26.979> access<00:05:27.550> to<00:05:27.910> the

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
that full up it allows me access to the

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.440 
that full up it allows me access to the
servos<00:05:28.630> here<00:05:29.020> adjusting<00:05:29.530> steering<00:05:29.979> and<00:05:30.450> yes

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
linkage in there's my switches

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:43.620 
linkage in there's my switches
well<00:05:37.479> homemade<00:05:38.229> mfu<00:05:38.830> if<00:05:39.400> you<00:05:39.610> will<00:05:41.820> and<00:05:42.820> then

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
well homemade mfu if you will and then

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.750 
well homemade mfu if you will and then
all<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:45.000> wiring<00:05:46.000> to<00:05:46.330> the<00:05:46.360> back<00:05:46.630> tail<00:05:46.930> lights

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.820 
all the wiring to the back tail lights
which<00:05:48.760> yeah<00:05:49.000> that<00:05:49.450> works<00:05:49.630> great<00:05:49.870> as<00:05:50.229> a<00:05:50.460> stand

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
which yeah that works great as a stand

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.350 
which yeah that works great as a stand
you<00:05:53.830> know<00:05:53.979> a<00:05:54.100> lot<00:05:54.370> of<00:05:54.400> times<00:05:54.760> with<00:05:55.060> my<00:05:55.210> other

trucks it'd be nice to be able to flip
them<00:05:57.370> upside<00:05:57.760> down<00:05:57.789> but<00:05:58.240> there's<00:05:58.479> no<00:05:59.140> safe<00:05:59.440> way

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
them upside down but there's no safe way

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:09.270 
them upside down but there's no safe way
to<00:05:59.710> do<00:06:00.010> so<00:06:03.750> so<00:06:04.750> that's<00:06:04.960> about<00:06:05.110> it<00:06:08.010> dump<00:06:09.010> truck

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280
