00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
my spectrum radio and Phenix flight

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.360 
my spectrum radio and Phenix flight
simulator<00:00:11.519> that<00:00:12.500> I<00:00:13.500> hooked<00:00:13.769> up<00:00:13.980> through<00:00:14.219> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
simulator that I hooked up through the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.540 
simulator that I hooked up through the
laptop<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.299> TV<00:00:17.660> so<00:00:18.859> the<00:00:19.859> way<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.070> just<00:00:20.369> do

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
laptop to the TV so the way you just do

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.929 
laptop to the TV so the way you just do
it<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.840> wire<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.230> comes<00:00:22.470> for<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.039> radio

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
it is the wire that comes for the radio

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.320 
it is the wire that comes for the radio
the<00:00:24.210> USB<00:00:25.050> cable<00:00:25.640> you<00:00:26.640> hook<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.970> up<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.300> your

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
the USB cable you hook it up to your

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.870 
the USB cable you hook it up to your
laptop<00:00:27.949> through<00:00:28.949> USB<00:00:30.830> then<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:32.099> need<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.430> VGA

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
laptop through USB then you need the VGA

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.940 
laptop through USB then you need the VGA
cable<00:00:33.800> the<00:00:34.800> VGA<00:00:35.160> cable<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:36.260> used<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.469> output

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
cable the VGA cable is used to output

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.940 
cable the VGA cable is used to output
the<00:00:38.190> video<00:00:38.930> so<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.020> just<00:00:40.230> hook<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.590> up<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.860> your

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
the video so you just hook it up to your

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.000 
the video so you just hook it up to your
laptop<00:00:41.219> or<00:00:41.790> your<00:00:42.450> computer<00:00:42.570> or<00:00:43.079> whatever<00:00:43.200> and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
laptop or your computer or whatever and

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.779 
laptop or your computer or whatever and
run<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.180> your<00:00:45.300> TV<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.160> all<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.579> them<00:00:47.760> should

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
run it to your TV and all of them should

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.810 
run it to your TV and all of them should
have<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.480> VGA<00:00:49.110> input<00:00:49.350> or<00:00:49.920> at<00:00:50.190> least<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.640> ones

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
have this VGA input or at least the ones

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.260 
have this VGA input or at least the ones
that<00:00:51.590> support<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:53.660> PC<00:00:54.660> output<00:00:55.050> basically<00:00:56.270> so

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
that support the PC output basically so

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.950 
that support the PC output basically so
what<00:00:57.570> means<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.260> can<00:00:58.440> hook<00:00:59.010> up<00:00:59.160> your<00:00:59.219> PC<00:00:59.960> to

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
what means is you can hook up your PC to

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.070 
what means is you can hook up your PC to
your<00:01:00.989> TV<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.680> all<00:01:02.550> HD<00:01:02.910> TV<00:01:03.390> should<00:01:03.600> have<00:01:03.870> this

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
your TV and all HD TV should have this

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.560 
your TV and all HD TV should have this
so<00:01:05.150> a<00:01:06.150> lot<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.689> em<00:01:06.869> HDMI<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.150> recently<00:01:09.150> more

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
so a lot of em HDMI is and recently more

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.010 
so a lot of em HDMI is and recently more
laptops<00:01:09.840> have<00:01:10.290> HDMI<00:01:11.060> outputs<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.510> can<00:01:12.869> use

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
laptops have HDMI outputs so you can use

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.399 
laptops have HDMI outputs so you can use
HDMI<00:01:13.470> or<00:01:13.860> VGA<00:01:13.950> whatever<00:01:14.939> I'm<00:01:15.659> using<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.140> g8

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
HDMI or VGA whatever I'm using the g8

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.570 
HDMI or VGA whatever I'm using the g8
because<00:01:17.159> my<00:01:17.460> laptop<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.909> little<00:01:18.180> bit<00:01:18.270> older<00:01:18.720> so

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
because my laptop a little bit older so

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.420 
because my laptop a little bit older so
even<00:01:20.580> here<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.000> says<00:01:21.240> PC<00:01:23.420> so<00:01:24.420> again<00:01:24.900> if<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.170> had

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
even here it says PC so again if you had

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.230 
even here it says PC so again if you had
HDMI<00:01:26.430> from<00:01:27.030> your<00:01:27.240> laptop<00:01:28.490> from<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.670> video<00:01:29.939> card

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
HDMI from your laptop from a video card

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.240 
HDMI from your laptop from a video card
you<00:01:30.450> just<00:01:30.689> hook<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.229> up<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.590> HDMI<00:01:32.369> here<00:01:34.250> would

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
you just hook it up to HDMI here would

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.100 
you just hook it up to HDMI here would
do<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.520> same<00:01:35.700> thing<00:01:36.770> then<00:01:37.850> one<00:01:38.850> thing<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.420> it

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
do the same thing then one thing that it

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.580 
do the same thing then one thing that it
won't<00:01:40.350> do<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.770> output<00:01:41.280> your<00:01:41.430> sound<00:01:42.409> or<00:01:43.409> your

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
won't do is output your sound or your

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.749 
won't do is output your sound or your
audio<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.729> we<00:01:44.759> have<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.210> do<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:46.340> look<00:01:47.340> for

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
audio so we have to do is just look for

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.840 
audio so we have to do is just look for
the<00:01:48.079> audio<00:01:49.079> cable<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:50.000> think<00:01:51.000> it's<00:01:51.149> called<00:01:51.420> RCA

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.510 

and<00:01:55.850> then<00:01:56.060> hook<00:01:56.510> it<00:01:56.660> up<00:01:59.410> to<00:02:00.410> the<00:02:00.860> laptop<00:02:01.100> and

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
and then hook it up to the laptop and

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.710 
and then hook it up to the laptop and
the<00:02:01.610> way<00:02:02.300> it<00:02:02.420> looks<00:02:02.480> is<00:02:03.070> at<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:04.310> end<00:02:04.520> it<00:02:05.420> should

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
the way it looks is at the end it should

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.040 
the way it looks is at the end it should
have<00:02:07.540> red<00:02:08.540> and<00:02:08.780> white<00:02:09.340> plugs<00:02:10.690> so<00:02:11.690> you<00:02:11.780> just

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
have red and white plugs so you just

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.980 
have red and white plugs so you just
hook<00:02:12.530> up<00:02:12.740> those<00:02:13.030> plugs<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.270> your<00:02:14.420> TV<00:02:14.600> and

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
hook up those plugs to your TV and

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.460 
hook up those plugs to your TV and
you'll<00:02:15.800> see<00:02:16.100> it<00:02:16.250> says<00:02:16.550> I<00:02:17.320> would<00:02:18.320> do<00:02:18.440> a

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
you'll see it says I would do a

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.750 
you'll see it says I would do a
component<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:21.530> that's<00:02:21.890> what<00:02:22.190> you<00:02:22.580> need

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
component and and that's what you need

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.690 
component and and that's what you need
and<00:02:23.540> that<00:02:23.990> will<00:02:24.140> output<00:02:25.240> audio<00:02:26.240> to<00:02:26.450> your<00:02:26.720> TV<00:02:27.700> so

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
and that will output audio to your TV so

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.260 
and that will output audio to your TV so
yeah<00:02:28.910> it<00:02:29.090> looks<00:02:29.800> nice<00:02:30.800> it's<00:02:31.370> a<00:02:31.550> big<00:02:31.730> screen<00:02:32.090> so
