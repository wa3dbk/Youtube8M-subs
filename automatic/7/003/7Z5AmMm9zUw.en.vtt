beginning<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> game<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.790> as<00:00:36.300> Devin<00:00:37.230> makes

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
beginning of the game so as Devin makes

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.990 
beginning of the game so as Devin makes
his<00:00:37.530> way<00:00:37.649> down<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:37.980> bottom<00:00:38.190> here<00:00:38.370> he's

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
his way down to the bottom here he's

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.520 
his way down to the bottom here he's
going<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.270> crash<00:00:39.629> through<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.989> glass<00:00:40.140> with<00:00:40.500> a

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
going to crash through this glass with a

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.920 
going to crash through this glass with a
huge<00:00:40.890> impact<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.329> all<00:00:42.450> thanks<00:00:42.690> to

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
huge impact and this is all thanks to

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.569 
huge impact and this is all thanks to
our<00:00:43.320> three<00:00:43.590> physics<00:00:43.950> systems<00:00:44.280> which<00:00:44.460> are

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
our three physics systems which are

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.479 
our three physics systems which are
havoc<00:00:45.329> which<00:00:46.200> governs<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.100> underlying

havoc which governs the underlying

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.279 
havoc which governs the underlying

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.869 
physics of every object digital
molecular<00:00:49.680> matter<00:00:49.920> which<00:00:50.160> creates<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.550> very

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
molecular matter which creates a very

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.459 
molecular matter which creates a very
believable<00:00:51.300> shattering<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.020> breaking<00:00:52.379> of

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
believable shattering and breaking of

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.770 
believable shattering and breaking of
glass<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:53.039> euphoria<00:00:53.940> which<00:00:54.149> simulates<00:00:54.449> those

glass and euphoria which simulates those

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.840 
glass and euphoria which simulates those
bodies<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.320> motion<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:56.309> one<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.699> biggest

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
bodies in motion so one of the biggest

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.340 
bodies in motion so one of the biggest
changes<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.329> can<00:00:57.420> see<00:00:57.600> right<00:00:57.629> away<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:57.989> that

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
changes you can see right away is that

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.080 
changes you can see right away is that
there's<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.559> tues<00:00:58.859> lightsaber<00:00:59.370> fighting<00:00:59.670> style

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
there's a tues lightsaber fighting style

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.180 
there's a tues lightsaber fighting style
now<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.840> much<00:01:01.050> more<00:01:01.230> acrobatic<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.949> lot<00:01:02.070> more

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
now it's much more acrobatic a lot more

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.070 
now it's much more acrobatic a lot more
of<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.399> flourish<00:01:02.789> we've<00:01:03.300> redesigned<00:01:03.660> all<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
of a flourish we've redesigned all the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.109 
of a flourish we've redesigned all the
combos<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.530> all<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> saber<00:01:05.129> combos<00:01:05.640> to

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
combos and all the saber combos to

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.789 
combos and all the saber combos to
really<00:01:06.299> take<00:01:06.479> advantage<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.409> paying<00:01:07.650> off

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
really take advantage of and paying off

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.170 
really take advantage of and paying off
on<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.100> really<00:01:08.340> great<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.760> lightsaber

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
on that really great to lightsaber

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.690 
on that really great to lightsaber
fighting<00:01:09.450> style<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.530> Devin<00:01:11.189> here<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.430> showing

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
fighting style so Devin here is showing

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.640 
fighting style so Devin here is showing
off<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.939> power<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.330> force<00:01:12.540> grip<00:01:12.810> force<00:01:13.439> grip

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
off the power of force grip force grip

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.590 
off the power of force grip force grip
is<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.890> power<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:14.939> was<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.210> original<00:01:15.299> game

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
is a power that was in the original game

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.480 
is a power that was in the original game
but<00:01:16.229> we've<00:01:16.320> really<00:01:16.560> worked<00:01:16.590> very<00:01:17.460> hard

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
but we've really worked very hard

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.120 
but we've really worked very hard
improving<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.240> targeting<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
improving the targeting and the the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.649 
improving the targeting and the the
ability<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.549> be<00:01:20.640> very<00:01:20.820> accurate<00:01:21.000> with<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.479> you

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
ability to be very accurate with it you

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.270 
ability to be very accurate with it you
can<00:01:21.689> pick<00:01:21.960> up<00:01:22.080> any<00:01:22.229> object<00:01:22.650> move<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.950> around<00:01:23.009> in

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
can pick up any object move it around in

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.100 
can pick up any object move it around in
three<00:01:23.460> dimensions<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.150> then<00:01:24.509> toss<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.780> with<00:01:24.990> a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
three dimensions and then toss it with a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.320 
three dimensions and then toss it with a
high<00:01:25.229> degree<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.560> accuracy<00:01:26.330> including
