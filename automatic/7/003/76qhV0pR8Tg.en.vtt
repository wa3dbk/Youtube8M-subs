00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.979
 diot people so physical team and 

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.259
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.850
 totally useless video sorry for the 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.500
 sound quality g by a microphone ouf the 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.010
 perpetrators final of his like this 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.330
 attack 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.469
 you've understood this video will you 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.000
 learn how to transform yourself into 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.830
 vanilla block in minecraft that's 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.599
 magic this tutorial will feature three 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.990
 steps firstly the construction of 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.430
 the machine 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.439
 secondly the demonstration in the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.840
 machine and thirdly the explanation 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.300
 of the machine also let's move on to the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.859
 construction here is the machine that's all 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.730
 little look at the sites or minutes stoma 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.900
 no one and that 3com en bloc first 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.600
 look closely at this command you are doing 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.250
 this schryve your nickname minecraft two 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.989
 glock in common and then in 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.620
 height and you have a blog commando 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.000
 it's magic 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.770
 you will then bring a block 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.120
 of watson and in the vÃ®mes you put 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.079
 a commando on the ground you stick the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.789
 first order that in the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.960
 description you put a block of the app 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.200
 store at the very top of the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.940
 to put 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.730
 after then you will put two 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.989
 block 1 commands here and here one here's lo 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.160
 you're going to put on a folder of 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.930
 buck commands the first foot command 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.100
 in the description and then on that 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.109
 remaining the second order which is 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.940
 in the description you see this @ 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.620
 it will serve you to choose the one or 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.110
 players who are going to be transformed into 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.970
 block for example I can put the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.189
 pseudo of the player who will be transformed 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.970
 or so @ to to transform all 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.920
 block players 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.049
 @ peace to turn the player the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.220
 closer together and if you have more 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.850
 experience in the field of 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.320
 block commands 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.750
 you can put a selector over 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.759
 precise for example wood here I put a 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.500
 score board we will be easy 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.880
 put our username here so suddenly 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.830
 we put here we have to put exactly 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.020
 the same thing on the other side so the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.890
 suddenly we replace the arobase by physics 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.170
 team up 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.670
 here and now I'm a block the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.900
 machine is constantly walking for 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.500
 stop it just put a 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.579
 lever here and activate it here's for 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.810
 change the block type 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.939
 you just have to change the ouch says 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.860
 that here is the number for example here 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.810
 for the melon his 103 if I want to choose 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.829
 an example for example here moaning hasna 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.619
 he says at the peak what am I going 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.189
 to have I am transformed into ores 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.170
 of redstone 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.360
 I put you in the description a 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.280
 site with a list of all the blocks and 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.140
 for example, told them if you 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.119
 want to turn you into TNT yourself 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.290
 go get the tnt blog and then he 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.939
 there will be a number in the way you go 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.140
 mark this figure finally there is 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.399
 not really need demonstration 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.110
 you know what it does I wanted 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.160
 test by yourself and now 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.780
 how it works 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.459
 let's look at for example the blog that is in 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.920
 below what is it used for when we put a 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.660
 redstone block above 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.160
 it's no longer a bowl of normal redstone 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.830
 in fact it's an asean block that 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.270
 in quotation marks flash very very very 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.860
 very quickly 20 times a second 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.480
 once left of play for those who 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.840
 know a little bit more about 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.950
 evidence 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.750
 this is what this command does 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.980
 when it is activated it sends that 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.660
 is one in the chat 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.430
 now if we put his block commands 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.670
 there next to the dream stone block is con 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.420
 but that's it's test 2 then look at the 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.069
 speed of the cat 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.290
 so we see now what does 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.819
 this log commands are commanded block but 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.950
 the player you chose in 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.140
 the occurrence here me in visible hand 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.790
 for a second without particles 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.050
 as we saw are ordering block is 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.489
 activated 20 times per second 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.049
 so suddenly you're constantly in 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.760
 invisible is what makes that when 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.060
 the system is activated by pressing 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.700
 them 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.260
 you will see a visibility 2 0 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.340
 seconds and it will flash sometimes from 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.290
 do stuff like that it'll go into 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.180
 makes 2 0 to one second all the time 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.670
 constantly and finally order it 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.739
 duo block makes appear on the player 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.180
 or the players you chose a 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.250
 font-type entity in fact this is 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.959
 of entities of the sand that falls with the 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.310
 texture that you chose actually 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.230
 you are disguised as a block but you have 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.060
 movements quite normal thank you 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.380

 vanilla so suddenly fully managed 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.870
 by block commands 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.970
 otherwise you can follow me on 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.530
