particularly<00:01:54.540> at<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> end<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.229> war<00:01:55.439> as

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
particularly at the end of the war as

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.039 
particularly at the end of the war as
the<00:01:55.710> Allies<00:01:56.130> were<00:01:56.340> advancing<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.479> Soviets

this<00:02:16.010> train<00:02:16.430> could<00:02:16.700> be<00:02:16.850> found<00:02:17.150> was<00:02:17.990> formerly

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
this train could be found was formerly

claimed<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.620> have<00:02:24.710> found<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.250> wants<00:02:26.120> a<00:02:26.300> piece

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
claimed to have found it wants a piece

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.200 
claimed to have found it wants a piece
of<00:02:27.640> what<00:02:28.640> it's<00:02:28.820> worth<00:02:28.940> but<00:02:29.780> who<00:02:30.110> would<00:02:30.860> really

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
of what it's worth but who would really

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.250 
of what it's worth but who would really
benefit<00:02:32.210> from<00:02:32.240> this<00:02:32.570> I<00:02:32.690> mean<00:02:32.840> could<00:02:33.080> the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
benefit from this I mean could the

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.980 
benefit from this I mean could the
original<00:02:33.890> owners<00:02:34.190> end<00:02:35.180> up<00:02:35.360> in<00:02:35.480> possession<00:02:35.930> of

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
original owners end up in possession of

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.440 
original owners end up in possession of
what<00:02:36.140> was<00:02:36.260> stolen<00:02:36.560> from<00:02:36.710> them<00:02:37.060> we<00:02:38.060> would<00:02:38.240> hope

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
what was stolen from them we would hope

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.630 
what was stolen from them we would hope
so<00:02:38.750> if<00:02:38.930> this<00:02:39.140> does<00:02:39.410> turn<00:02:39.440> out<00:02:39.740> to<00:02:40.010> be<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.340> find

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
so if this does turn out to be the find

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.150 
so if this does turn out to be the find
that<00:02:40.880> it<00:02:41.090> is<00:02:41.480> claiming<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:42.020> be<00:02:42.320> if<00:02:42.770> these<00:02:43.010> are

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
that it is claiming to be if these are

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.590 
that it is claiming to be if these are
objects<00:02:43.670> that<00:02:43.820> were<00:02:43.940> dispossessed<00:02:44.300> from

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
objects that were dispossessed from

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.500 
objects that were dispossessed from
victims<00:02:45.140> of<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:45.800> Nazi<00:02:46.160> regime<00:02:46.310> we<00:02:47.060> do<00:02:47.210> have<00:02:47.390> an

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
victims of the Nazi regime we do have an

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.590 
victims of the Nazi regime we do have an
example<00:02:47.840> of<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.380> Hungarian<00:02:49.010> gold<00:02:49.280> train<00:02:49.670> that

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
example of the Hungarian gold train that

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.840 
example of the Hungarian gold train that
is<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.780> more<00:02:51.380> well-known<00:02:51.560> example<00:02:52.340> that<00:02:52.580> had

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
is a more well-known example that had

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.910 
is a more well-known example that had
been<00:02:53.360> on<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:53.510> similar<00:02:53.930> route<00:02:54.110> back<00:02:54.320> to<00:02:54.380> Germany

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
been on a similar route back to Germany

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.280 
been on a similar route back to Germany
and<00:02:55.070> then<00:02:55.130> was<00:02:55.880> stopped<00:02:56.210> by<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.480> Allies<00:02:56.990> and

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
and then was stopped by the Allies and

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.580 
and then was stopped by the Allies and
this<00:02:58.010> train<00:02:58.340> was<00:02:58.670> missed<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.590> dealing

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
this train was missed the the dealing

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.290 
this train was missed the the dealing
with<00:03:00.710> this<00:03:00.830> train<00:03:01.130> and<00:03:01.370> its<00:03:01.550> objects<00:03:02.120> was

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
with this train and its objects was

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.630 
with this train and its objects was
mishandled<00:03:02.660> by<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.440> Allies<00:03:04.070> particularly<00:03:04.550> by

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
mishandled by the Allies particularly by

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.610 
mishandled by the Allies particularly by
the<00:03:04.700> United<00:03:05.060> States<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:05.600> a<00:03:06.080> settlement<00:03:06.410> was

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
the United States and a settlement was

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.700 
the United States and a settlement was
reached<00:03:06.650> only<00:03:07.220> in<00:03:07.310> 2005<00:03:08.120> that<00:03:08.560> benefited<00:03:09.560> the

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
reached only in 2005 that benefited the

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.910 
reached only in 2005 that benefited the
victims<00:03:10.100> of<00:03:10.520> Nazi<00:03:11.210> persecution<00:03:11.390> in<00:03:12.320> Hungary

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
victims of Nazi persecution in Hungary

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.010 
victims of Nazi persecution in Hungary
so<00:03:13.190> we<00:03:13.340> would<00:03:13.490> hope<00:03:13.670> that<00:03:13.940> if<00:03:14.330> these<00:03:14.510> objects

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
so we would hope that if these objects

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.290 
so we would hope that if these objects
are<00:03:15.290> in<00:03:15.440> fact<00:03:15.710> from<00:03:16.400> victims<00:03:16.850> of<00:03:17.030> Nazi

persecution in Poland or in other places
in<00:03:19.820> Eastern<00:03:20.180> Europe<00:03:20.480> that<00:03:20.900> they<00:03:21.140> could<00:03:21.440> be

in Eastern Europe that they could be

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.980 
in Eastern Europe that they could be
