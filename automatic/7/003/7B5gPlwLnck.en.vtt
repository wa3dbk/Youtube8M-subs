right it's ergonomic it plays easy it's

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.030 
right it's ergonomic it plays easy it's
in<00:03:16.480> tune<00:03:16.810> all<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.319> way<00:03:17.409> to<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.590> sound<00:03:17.799> hole

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
in tune all the way to the sound hole

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.309 
in tune all the way to the sound hole
because<00:03:18.459> of<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:19.180> way<00:03:19.329> they<00:03:19.510> do<00:03:19.569> their

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
because of the way they do their

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.140 
because of the way they do their
construction<00:03:20.950> and<00:03:21.190> these<00:03:21.910> particular

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
construction and these particular

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.240 
construction and these particular
guitars<00:03:22.840> something<00:03:23.500> I<00:03:23.560> haven't<00:03:23.739> talked<00:03:24.069> about

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
guitars something I haven't talked about

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.099 
guitars something I haven't talked about
in<00:03:24.519> some<00:03:24.549> of<00:03:24.730> them<00:03:24.970> this<00:03:25.420> has<00:03:25.540> got<00:03:25.750> two

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
in some of them this has got two

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.319 
in some of them this has got two
supporting<00:03:26.620> rods<00:03:26.890> about<00:03:27.670> here<00:03:27.940> from<00:03:28.209> the

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
supporting rods about here from the

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:29.910 
supporting rods about here from the
ninth<00:03:28.750> fret<00:03:29.019> all<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.319> way<00:03:29.440> to<00:03:29.500> about<00:03:29.650> the

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
ninth fret all the way to about the

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.460 
ninth fret all the way to about the
about<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:30.849> 17th<00:03:31.420> fret<00:03:31.660> and<00:03:31.989> they<00:03:32.290> basically

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
about the 17th fret and they basically

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.080 
about the 17th fret and they basically
support<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.099> neck<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.400> stabilizing<00:03:33.909> neck

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
support the neck and stabilizing neck

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.899 
support the neck and stabilizing neck
and<00:03:34.540> so<00:03:34.930> it<00:03:35.019> keeps<00:03:35.170> it<00:03:35.409> in<00:03:35.500> tune<00:03:35.769> longer<00:03:36.549> keeps

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:36.909 
and so it keeps it in tune longer keeps

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.089 
and so it keeps it in tune longer keeps
it<00:03:37.060> just<00:03:37.569> stabilizes<00:03:38.440> things<00:03:38.680> gives<00:03:38.920> it<00:03:39.040> a

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
it just stabilizes things gives it a

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.800 
it just stabilizes things gives it a
great<00:03:39.280> tone<00:03:39.609> well<00:03:39.970> when<00:03:40.090> you<00:03:40.180> go<00:03:40.299> from<00:03:40.450> Bangor

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
great tone well when you go from Bangor

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.349 
great tone well when you go from Bangor
Maine<00:03:40.840> to<00:03:41.109> Yakima<00:03:41.500> Washington<00:03:42.359> Yokohama

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
Maine to Yakima Washington Yokohama

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.119 
Maine to Yakima Washington Yokohama
Japan<00:03:43.450> I<00:03:44.049> mean<00:03:44.230> you're<00:03:44.440> back<00:03:44.590> and<00:03:44.769> forth<00:03:44.980> and

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
Japan I mean you're back and forth and

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:46.649 
Japan I mean you're back and forth and
back<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:45.250> forth<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.760> necks<00:03:46.060> are<00:03:46.239> so<00:03:46.390> stable

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
back and forth the necks are so stable

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.690 
back and forth the necks are so stable
and<00:03:47.079> I<00:03:47.349> think<00:03:47.560> that's<00:03:47.709> one<00:03:47.890> reason<00:03:48.040> why<00:03:48.280> I<00:03:48.310> love

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
and I think that's one reason why I love

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.099 
and I think that's one reason why I love
the<00:03:49.000> basic<00:03:49.480> it<00:03:49.569> let's<00:03:49.750> say<00:03:49.840> we<00:03:49.930> took
