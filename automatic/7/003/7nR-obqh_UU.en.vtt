00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
fact be able to break through bedrock

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.380

hopefully hopefully we can get through
it<00:01:31.710> maybe<00:01:32.070> uh<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.670> update<00:01:33.030> will<00:01:33.180> bring<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
it maybe uh the update will bring the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.670 
it maybe uh the update will bring the
new<00:01:33.570> trees<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:33.930> then<00:01:34.200> we'll<00:01:34.290> be<00:01:34.380> able<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.560> do

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
new trees and then we'll be able to do

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.700 
new trees and then we'll be able to do
it<00:01:34.799> easy<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:35.549> we'll<00:01:36.090> see<00:01:36.299> here<00:01:36.540> anyway<00:01:37.350> we're

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
see we'll figure it out but on we'll see

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.069 
see we'll figure it out but on we'll see
in<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.799> second<00:01:56.130> here<00:01:56.280> we<00:01:56.790> will<00:01:57.090> be<00:01:57.420> able<00:01:57.659> to

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
in just a second here we will be able to

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.149 
in just a second here we will be able to
break<00:01:58.439> through<00:01:59.659> the<00:02:00.659> bedrock<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.829> it's<00:02:01.950> very

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
break through the bedrock and it's very

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.410 
break through the bedrock and it's very
important<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.670> keep<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.969> grass<00:02:03.210> there

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
important that you keep the grass there

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.760 
important that you keep the grass there
I've<00:02:03.570> tried<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.840> with<00:02:03.960> other<00:02:04.110> blocks<00:02:04.500> like

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
I've tried it with other blocks like

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.560 
I've tried it with other blocks like
I've<00:02:04.890> tried<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.189> with<00:02:05.310> dirt<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.880> for<00:02:06.420> whatever

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
I've tried it with dirt and for whatever

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.619 
I've tried it with dirt and for whatever
reason<00:02:07.049> dirt<00:02:07.350> didn't<00:02:07.649> actually<00:02:07.890> work<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.629> make

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
reason dirt didn't actually work so make

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.240 
reason dirt didn't actually work so make
sure<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.869> have<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.080> grass<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:11.009> lot<00:02:11.220> of

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
sure you have the grass and a lot of

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.699 
sure you have the grass and a lot of
carpet<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.849> you<00:02:12.180> should<00:02:12.420> be<00:02:12.540> able<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.780> break

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
carpet and you should be able to break

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.319 
carpet and you should be able to break
through<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.040> bedrock<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:16.849> here<00:02:17.849> we<00:02:17.969> go<00:02:18.120> in

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
through the bedrock so here we go in

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.030 
through the bedrock so here we go in
just<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.659> second<00:02:19.019> there<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.230> go<00:02:19.379> there<00:02:19.859> you<00:02:20.010> go

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
just a second there you go there you go

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.740 
just a second there you go there you go
right<00:02:20.340> there<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.700> can't<00:02:20.879> actually<00:02:21.060> fall<00:02:21.480> down

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
right there you can't actually fall down

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.589 
right there you can't actually fall down
it<00:02:21.989> but<00:02:22.170> there<00:02:22.469> you<00:02:22.530> go<00:02:22.849> definitely<00:02:23.849> leave<00:02:24.359> a

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
it but there you go definitely leave a

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.059
