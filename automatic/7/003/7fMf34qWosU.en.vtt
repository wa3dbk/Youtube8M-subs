they are all connected together you need
to<00:04:08.190> be<00:04:08.340> able<00:04:08.490> to<00:04:08.670> focus<00:04:09.390> on<00:04:09.600> your<00:04:10.200> cheek

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
to be able to focus on your cheek

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:25.120 
to be able to focus on your cheek
muscles<00:04:11.250> only<00:04:11.540> so<00:04:12.540> let's<00:04:12.690> try<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:12.900> go

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.240 

now<00:04:25.730> the<00:04:25.820> whole<00:04:26.150> exercise<00:04:26.830> depends<00:04:27.830> on<00:04:27.980> how

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
now the whole exercise depends on how

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.860 
now the whole exercise depends on how
you<00:04:28.310> move<00:04:28.670> your<00:04:28.730> lips<00:04:29.030> now<00:04:29.600> we've<00:04:29.720> just<00:04:29.750> got

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
you move your lips now we've just got

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.500 
you move your lips now we've just got
something<00:04:30.170> in<00:04:30.260> the<00:04:30.380> corner<00:04:30.590> of<00:04:30.710> my<00:04:30.770> lip<00:04:31.510> sorry

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
something in the corner of my lip sorry

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.020 
something in the corner of my lip sorry
so<00:04:33.320> the<00:04:33.410> whole<00:04:33.590> exercise<00:04:34.040> depends<00:04:34.550> on<00:04:34.640> how<00:04:34.970> you

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
so the whole exercise depends on how you

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.830 
so the whole exercise depends on how you
move<00:04:35.450> your<00:04:35.660> lips<00:04:35.810> it<00:04:36.650> depends<00:04:37.160> on<00:04:37.280> how

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
move your lips it depends on how

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.270 
move your lips it depends on how
strongly<00:04:38.840> you<00:04:39.200> bring<00:04:39.620> your<00:04:39.890> lips<00:04:40.070> together

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
strongly you bring your lips together

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.370 
strongly you bring your lips together
because<00:04:41.090> what<00:04:41.240> it's<00:04:41.360> doing<00:04:41.450> is<00:04:41.780> it's<00:04:41.960> pulling

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
because what it's doing is it's pulling

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.970 
because what it's doing is it's pulling
the<00:04:42.560> muscles<00:04:43.280> on<00:04:43.460> an<00:04:43.790> inward<00:04:44.030> motion<00:04:44.800> now<00:04:45.800> as

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
the muscles on an inward motion now as

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.130 
the muscles on an inward motion now as
I've<00:04:46.130> said<00:04:46.340> to<00:04:46.490> you<00:04:46.750> when<00:04:47.750> you<00:04:47.870> do<00:04:47.990> your

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
I've said to you when you do your

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.840 
I've said to you when you do your
exercises<00:04:48.350> you<00:04:48.830> need<00:04:48.950> to<00:04:49.100> change<00:04:49.370> them<00:04:49.580> about

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
exercises you need to change them about

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.850 
exercises you need to change them about
so<00:04:50.480> what<00:04:50.690> this<00:04:50.840> is<00:04:50.960> going<00:04:51.170> to<00:04:51.320> be<00:04:51.410> doing<00:04:51.740> is

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
so what this is going to be doing is

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.430 
so what this is going to be doing is
changing<00:04:52.220> the<00:04:52.490> muscle<00:04:52.970> movement<00:04:53.960> in<00:04:54.080> a<00:04:54.170> whole

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
changing the muscle movement in a whole

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.850 
changing the muscle movement in a whole
different<00:04:54.880> configuration<00:04:55.880> to<00:04:56.090> tone<00:04:56.390> it<00:04:56.860> okay

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
different configuration to tone it okay

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.850 
different configuration to tone it okay
I<00:04:57.890> do<00:04:58.130> this<00:04:58.400> exercise<00:04:58.910> a<00:04:59.120> lot<00:04:59.360> I<00:05:00.320> do<00:05:00.560> this

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
I do this exercise a lot I do this

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.800 
I do this exercise a lot I do this
exercise<00:05:01.010> let's<00:05:01.490> say<00:05:01.790> laying<00:05:02.060> in<00:05:02.210> bed<00:05:02.390> a<00:05:02.570> lot

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
exercise let's say laying in bed a lot

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.140 
exercise let's say laying in bed a lot
and<00:05:03.080> when<00:05:03.650> you<00:05:03.770> know<00:05:04.040> the<00:05:04.310> exercise<00:05:04.730> is<00:05:04.940> going

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
cheek muscles moving back and forth

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.100 
cheek muscles moving back and forth
across<00:05:10.370> the<00:05:10.670> bones<00:05:10.880> it's<00:05:11.600> actually<00:05:11.870> quite<00:05:12.080> a

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
across the bones it's actually quite a

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.720 
across the bones it's actually quite a
pleasant<00:05:12.410> feeling<00:05:12.770> to<00:05:13.100> be<00:05:13.130> honest<00:05:13.430> with<00:05:13.610> you

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:15.920 
and that's why I do it a lot but that's

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.380 
and that's why I do it a lot but that's
what<00:05:16.190> that's<00:05:16.460> how<00:05:16.580> you<00:05:16.640> know<00:05:16.880> you've<00:05:17.090> done<00:05:17.270> it

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
what that's how you know you've done it

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.540 
what that's how you know you've done it
right<00:05:17.570> is<00:05:17.840> you<00:05:18.020> can<00:05:18.140> feel<00:05:18.350> the<00:05:18.560> muscles<00:05:18.950> moving

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
right is you can feel the muscles moving

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.760 
right is you can feel the muscles moving
backwards<00:05:20.180> and<00:05:20.330> forwards<00:05:20.750> it's<00:05:21.200> a<00:05:21.260> really

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
backwards and forwards it's a really

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.460 
backwards and forwards it's a really
good<00:05:22.010> toning<00:05:22.610> exercise<00:05:23.210> so<00:05:24.050> let's<00:05:24.080> try<00:05:24.440> it

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.130 

now<00:05:31.730> as<00:05:31.910> you're<00:05:32.060> sitting<00:05:32.240> up<00:05:32.480> you<00:05:32.750> may<00:05:32.930> not

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
now as you're sitting up you may not

feel it as I said you need to be laying
down<00:05:35.720> when<00:05:35.930> you<00:05:36.230> do<00:05:36.350> this<00:05:36.530> exercise<00:05:36.790> it's

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
down when you do this exercise it's

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.330 
down when you do this exercise it's
really<00:05:38.210> important<00:05:38.660> so<00:05:39.410> you<00:05:39.890> start<00:05:40.220> this

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
really important so you start this

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.750 
really important so you start this
exercise<00:05:41.020> with<00:05:42.020> 50<00:05:42.320> repetitions<00:05:42.500> move<00:05:43.490> up<00:05:43.640> to

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
exercise with 50 repetitions move up to

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.000 
exercise with 50 repetitions move up to
a<00:05:43.820> hundred<00:05:44.060> repetitions<00:05:44.390> and<00:05:44.990> if<00:05:45.590> you<00:05:45.740> can

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
a hundred repetitions and if you can

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.150 
a hundred repetitions and if you can
move<00:05:46.370> up<00:05:46.550> to<00:05:46.730> 150<00:05:47.480> and<00:05:47.660> as<00:05:48.290> I've<00:05:48.740> explained

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
move up to 150 and as I've explained

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.570 
move up to 150 and as I've explained
many<00:05:49.280> times<00:05:49.580> I<00:05:49.820> do<00:05:50.330> only<00:05:50.540> 100<00:05:51.050> because<00:05:51.710> I<00:05:52.010> find

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
many times I do only 100 because I find

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.210 
many times I do only 100 because I find
it<00:05:52.730> hard<00:05:52.970> to<00:05:53.150> do<00:05:53.450> even<00:05:53.480> today<00:05:54.320> it<00:05:54.920> too<00:05:55.130> this

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
it hard to do even today it too this

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.490 
it hard to do even today it too this
time<00:05:55.490> after<00:05:55.880> doing<00:05:56.090> it<00:05:56.180> all<00:05:56.330> this<00:05:56.540> time<00:05:56.780> doing

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
time after doing it all this time doing

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.550 
time after doing it all this time doing
150<00:05:58.160> repetitions<00:05:58.910> some<00:05:59.570> people<00:05:59.870> can<00:05:59.990> do<00:06:00.140> it<00:06:00.170> so

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
150 repetitions some people can do it so

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.710 
150 repetitions some people can do it so
that's<00:06:00.710> why<00:06:00.920> I<00:06:00.950> say<00:06:01.220> you<00:06:01.280> can<00:06:01.490> go<00:06:01.670> to<00:06:01.730> 150<00:06:02.540> if

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 
that's why I say you can go to 150 if

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.340 
that's why I say you can go to 150 if
you<00:06:02.930> can<00:06:03.460> then<00:06:04.460> remember<00:06:05.060> to<00:06:05.090> hold<00:06:05.600> and<00:06:05.960> freeze

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
you can then remember to hold and freeze

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.970 
you can then remember to hold and freeze
at<00:06:06.740> the<00:06:06.800> end<00:06:07.340> feel<00:06:08.180> the<00:06:08.390> burn<00:06:08.600> when<00:06:08.960> you<00:06:09.710> feel

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:09.980 
at the end feel the burn when you feel

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.700 
at the end feel the burn when you feel
that<00:06:10.190> burn<00:06:10.460> after<00:06:11.240> 20<00:06:11.570> seconds<00:06:11.960> you<00:06:12.350> release

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
that burn after 20 seconds you release

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.280 
that burn after 20 seconds you release
all<00:06:13.090> right<00:06:14.090> now<00:06:14.540> I'm<00:06:14.630> going<00:06:14.780> to<00:06:14.840> do<00:06:14.930> this<00:06:15.050> once

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
all right now I'm going to do this once
