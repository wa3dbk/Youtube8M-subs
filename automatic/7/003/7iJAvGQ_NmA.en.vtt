00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:05.659 
was big in in England so as a result

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:08.050 
was big in in England so as a result
this<00:05:06.080> album<00:05:06.469> was<00:05:06.650> just<00:05:06.889> blew<00:05:07.430> up<00:05:07.639> over<00:05:07.909> there

like<00:05:13.069> I<00:05:13.190> said<00:05:13.250> I<00:05:13.430> think<00:05:13.520> it's<00:05:13.789> only<00:05:13.879> more

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
like I said I think it's only more

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.430 
like I said I think it's only more
recently<00:05:15.699> that<00:05:16.699> they've<00:05:16.879> kind<00:05:17.120> of<00:05:17.440> been

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
recently that they've kind of been

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.930 
recently that they've kind of been
getting<00:05:18.770> their<00:05:18.919> do<00:05:19.159> I<00:05:19.460> mean<00:05:21.460> funny<00:05:22.460> thing<00:05:22.699> too

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
getting their do I mean funny thing too

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.140 
getting their do I mean funny thing too
is<00:05:23.090> that<00:05:23.120> Tom<00:05:24.020> Verlaine<00:05:24.409> was<00:05:24.740> uh<00:05:24.770> grew<00:05:25.669> up<00:05:25.879> and

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
is that Tom Verlaine was uh grew up and

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.409 
is that Tom Verlaine was uh grew up and
was<00:05:26.240> good<00:05:26.449> friends<00:05:26.810> with<00:05:26.870> Richard<00:05:27.439> hell<00:05:27.620> and

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
was good friends with Richard hell and

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:32.920 
was good friends with Richard hell and
I've<00:05:29.419> reached<00:05:29.659> heard<00:05:29.840> Helen<00:05:30.199> the<00:05:30.349> voids<00:05:31.930> and

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
I've reached heard Helen the voids and

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.570 
I've reached heard Helen the voids and
he<00:05:33.080> was<00:05:33.229> actually<00:05:33.409> in<00:05:33.860> this<00:05:34.009> group<00:05:34.219> he<00:05:34.340> is<00:05:34.430> one

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
he was actually in this group he is one

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.790 
he was actually in this group he is one
of<00:05:34.610> the<00:05:34.729> founding<00:05:35.090> members<00:05:35.270> and<00:05:35.690> I<00:05:36.020> guess

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
of the founding members and I guess

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.350 
of the founding members and I guess
after<00:05:36.979> a<00:05:37.129> while<00:05:37.159> him<00:05:37.639> and<00:05:37.819> Tom<00:05:38.000> for<00:05:38.150> letting

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
after a while him and Tom for letting

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.480 
after a while him and Tom for letting
just<00:05:38.539> didn't<00:05:38.810> get<00:05:38.900> along<00:05:39.129> Tom<00:05:40.129> Verlaine

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
just didn't get along Tom Verlaine

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.390 
just didn't get along Tom Verlaine
wasn't<00:05:40.940> too<00:05:41.180> crazy<00:05:41.330> about<00:05:41.599> the<00:05:41.870> songs<00:05:42.169> and<00:05:42.620> you

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
wasn't too crazy about the songs and you

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.800 
wasn't too crazy about the songs and you
know<00:05:43.520> Richard<00:05:43.849> Hale<00:05:44.000> was<00:05:44.120> kind<00:05:44.330> of<00:05:44.419> even<00:05:44.569> going

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
know Richard Hale was kind of even going

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.459 
know Richard Hale was kind of even going
in<00:05:45.050> that<00:05:45.610> more<00:05:46.610> Punk<00:05:47.180> direction<00:05:47.870> more<00:05:48.020> energy

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:48.469 
in that more Punk direction more energy

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:51.670 
in that more Punk direction more energy
and<00:05:48.620> things<00:05:48.740> like<00:05:48.949> that<00:05:50.110> and<00:05:51.110> I<00:05:51.229> think<00:05:51.289> Tom

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
and things like that and I think Tom

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.490 
and things like that and I think Tom
Verlaine<00:05:52.009> felt<00:05:52.339> that<00:05:52.930> that<00:05:53.930> kind<00:05:54.169> of<00:05:54.229> stuff

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
Verlaine felt that that kind of stuff

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.209 
Verlaine felt that that kind of stuff
took<00:05:54.800> away<00:05:55.129> from<00:05:55.159> his<00:05:55.789> his<00:05:56.690> song<00:05:56.960> so<00:05:57.589> he<00:05:57.830> was

00:05:58.209 --> 00:05:58.219 
took away from his his song so he was

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:59.409 
took away from his his song so he was
out<00:05:58.339> of<00:05:58.490> the<00:05:58.550> crew<00:05:58.759> Pritchard<00:05:59.150> hell<00:05:59.270> actually

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
out of the crew Pritchard hell actually

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:02.439

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
after that joined the Heartbreakers and

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:07.469 
after that joined the Heartbreakers and
then<00:06:02.599> he<00:06:02.719> was<00:06:02.839> out<00:06:02.930> of<00:06:03.080> that<00:06:03.229> group<00:06:03.560> so<00:06:04.719> anyway
