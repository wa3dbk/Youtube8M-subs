gig<00:00:08.330> SSD<00:00:09.330> upgrade<00:00:09.540> kit<00:00:10.139> so<00:00:11.040> my<00:00:11.519> mom<00:00:11.670> dad<00:00:11.940> they

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
gig SSD upgrade kit so my mom dad they

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.430 
gig SSD upgrade kit so my mom dad they
lapped<00:00:12.269> they<00:00:12.480> both<00:00:12.630> have<00:00:12.809> their<00:00:12.840> own<00:00:12.960> laptop

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
lapped they both have their own laptop

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.539 
lapped they both have their own laptop
that<00:00:13.650> basically<00:00:13.920> have<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.160> dual<00:00:14.370> core

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
that basically have a dual core

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.490 
that basically have a dual core
processor<00:00:14.610> with<00:00:15.540> four<00:00:15.809> gigs<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.139> RAM<00:00:16.289> and

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
processor with four gigs and RAM and

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.970 
processor with four gigs and RAM and
about<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> 250<00:00:17.670> gig<00:00:17.699> hard<00:00:18.029> drive<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.980> they're

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
about a 250 gig hard drive and they're

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.920 
about a 250 gig hard drive and they're
quite<00:00:20.130> slow<00:00:20.640> especially<00:00:21.270> when<00:00:21.390> booting<00:00:21.689> up<00:00:21.750> of

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
quite slow especially when booting up of

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.090 
quite slow especially when booting up of
course<00:00:22.140> Windows<00:00:22.500> takes<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.890> long<00:00:23.070> time

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
course Windows takes a long time

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.400 
course Windows takes a long time
especially<00:00:23.550> on<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.939> hard<00:00:24.150> drive<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.109> decided

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
especially on a hard drive so I decided

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.640 
especially on a hard drive so I decided
to<00:00:25.529> buy<00:00:25.710> them<00:00:25.920> their<00:00:26.099> own<00:00:26.130> SSDs<00:00:27.349> now<00:00:28.349> luckily

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
to buy them their own SSDs now luckily

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.990 
to buy them their own SSDs now luckily
they<00:00:28.920> don't<00:00:29.099> really<00:00:29.250> have<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.490> much<00:00:29.760> on

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
they don't really have that much on

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.910 
they don't really have that much on
their<00:00:30.269> hard<00:00:30.420> drive<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:30.929> these<00:00:31.140> SSDs<00:00:31.679> are

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
their hard drive so these SSDs are

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.490 
their hard drive so these SSDs are
plenty<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.520> terms<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.910> capacity<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.690> it

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
plenty in terms of capacity and it

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.530 
plenty in terms of capacity and it
should<00:00:34.680> speed<00:00:34.950> things<00:00:34.980> up<00:00:35.370> quite<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.790> bit<00:00:36.149> even

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
should speed things up quite a bit even

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.229 
should speed things up quite a bit even
on<00:00:36.690> sort<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.380> low-end<00:00:37.829> laptops<00:00:38.610> with<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.149> know

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
on sort of low-end laptops with you know

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.920 
on sort of low-end laptops with you know
just<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.540> basic<00:00:39.809> dual<00:00:40.170> core<00:00:40.379> processor<00:00:41.899> so<00:00:42.899> I

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
just the basic dual core processor so I

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
just the basic dual core processor so I
picked<00:00:43.200> these<00:00:43.290> up<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.620> other<00:00:43.770> day<00:00:43.800> from

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.250 
comes with the SSD itself and a and a
little<00:01:11.909> CD<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.510> has<00:01:12.720> some<00:01:12.990> cloning

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
little CD and that has some cloning

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.660 
little CD and that has some cloning
software<00:01:13.530> installed<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.549> could

to your new solid state drive so let's
go<00:01:20.970> ahead<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.240> unbox<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.960> real<00:01:22.170> quick<00:01:22.700> I'm<00:01:23.700> not

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
go ahead and unbox it real quick I'm not

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.310 
go ahead and unbox it real quick I'm not

about<00:02:25.450> I<00:02:25.630> do<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:25.810> little<00:02:25.959> more<00:02:26.140> research<00:02:26.380> on

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
about I do a little more research on

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.030 
about I do a little more research on
that<00:02:26.740> in<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.130> little<00:02:27.370> while<00:02:27.550> but<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:29.860> think

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
that in a little while but you think

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.380 
that in a little while but you think
that<00:02:30.160> they<00:02:30.280> would<00:02:30.370> have<00:02:30.489> wrapped<00:02:30.670> up<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:30.970> SSD

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
that they would have wrapped up the SSD

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.570 
that they would have wrapped up the SSD
like<00:02:31.600> they<00:02:31.750> did<00:02:31.959> the<00:02:32.290> enclosure<00:02:32.890> but<00:02:33.160> oh<00:02:33.400> well

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
like they did the enclosure but oh well

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.070 
like they did the enclosure but oh well
as<00:02:33.850> long<00:02:34.030> as<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.209> works<00:02:34.330> that's<00:02:34.600> all<00:02:34.930> I'm

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
as long as it works that's all I'm

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.290 
as long as it works that's all I'm
worried<00:02:35.319> about<00:02:35.640> so<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:36.760> was<00:02:36.880> just<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:37.120> quick

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
worried about so that was just a quick

both<00:02:45.400> these<00:02:45.580> showed<00:02:45.850> up<00:02:46.000> I<00:02:46.120> was<00:02:46.150> actually

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
both these showed up I was actually

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.060 
both these showed up I was actually
thinking<00:02:46.600> about<00:02:46.900> putting<00:02:47.050> these<00:02:47.739> into<00:02:47.920> my

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
thinking about putting these into my

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.410 
thinking about putting these into my
gaming<00:02:48.280> desktop<00:02:48.550> and<00:02:48.970> putting<00:02:49.209> them<00:02:49.360> into

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
gaming desktop and putting them into

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.449 
gaming desktop and putting them into
raid<00:02:49.930> 0<00:02:50.230> mode<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.620> seeing<00:02:50.890> how<00:02:50.950> they<00:02:51.100> perform

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
raid 0 mode and seeing how they perform

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.120 
raid 0 mode and seeing how they perform
but<00:02:51.900> I<00:02:52.900> guess<00:02:53.320> I'll<00:02:53.440> just<00:02:53.470> pass<00:02:53.769> on<00:02:53.980> that

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
but I guess I'll just pass on that

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.440 
but I guess I'll just pass on that
because<00:02:54.459> that<00:02:54.760> would<00:02:54.880> have<00:02:54.910> been<00:02:55.030> pretty<00:02:55.239> cool

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
because that would have been pretty cool

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.470 
because that would have been pretty cool
but<00:02:55.660> oh<00:02:55.870> well<00:02:56.880> looks<00:02:57.880> like<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.060> nice<00:02:58.239> upgrade

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
but oh well looks like a nice upgrade
