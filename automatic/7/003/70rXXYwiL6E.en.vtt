00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
covered and nothing on that side so it's

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:06.880 
covered and nothing on that side so it's
very<00:01:05.600> simple<00:01:05.840> let's<00:01:06.110> just<00:01:06.229> pop<00:01:06.380> it<00:01:06.500> in<00:01:06.590> a

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
very simple let's just pop it in a

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.180 
very simple let's just pop it in a
little<00:01:07.670> bottom<00:01:08.000> first<00:01:08.240> is<00:01:08.539> a<00:01:08.570> thin<00:01:08.899> TPU<00:01:09.649> style

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
little bottom first is a thin TPU style

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.080 
little bottom first is a thin TPU style
case<00:01:10.460> and<00:01:10.759> it<00:01:11.570> actually<00:01:11.899> looks<00:01:12.320> pretty<00:01:12.830> good<00:01:13.430> I

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
case and it actually looks pretty good I

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.059 
case and it actually looks pretty good I
actually<00:01:14.600> like<00:01:14.930> this<00:01:15.170> I<00:01:16.780> like<00:01:17.780> it<00:01:17.990> it's<00:01:18.740> black

00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:19.069 
actually like this I like it it's black

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:21.279 
actually like this I like it it's black
goes<00:01:19.940> well<00:01:20.149> with<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:20.450> blue<00:01:20.630> just<00:01:20.899> like<00:01:20.990> the

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
goes well with the blue just like the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.010 
goes well with the blue just like the
otterbox<00:01:22.009> except<00:01:22.369> this<00:01:22.520> is<00:01:22.729> obviously<00:01:23.420> a<00:01:23.780> lot

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
otterbox except this is obviously a lot

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.180 
otterbox except this is obviously a lot
thinner<00:01:24.319> so<00:01:25.450> I'm<00:01:26.450> going<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:26.660> have<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:27.800> octopus

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
thinner so I'm going to have the octopus

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.460 
thinner so I'm going to have the octopus
in<00:01:28.340> my<00:01:28.429> pocket<00:01:28.759> a<00:01:28.819> lot<00:01:29.000> easier<00:01:29.240> now<00:01:29.660> it's<00:01:30.170> matt

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
in my pocket a lot easier now it's matt

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.180 
in my pocket a lot easier now it's matt
on<00:01:30.649> the<00:01:30.770> back<00:01:30.979> and<00:01:31.399> it's<00:01:31.580> got<00:01:31.789> like<00:01:31.970> a<00:01:32.000> shiny

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
TPU style grip around the edges kind of

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.900 
TPU style grip around the edges kind of
gripping<00:01:38.959> it's<00:01:39.319> a<00:01:39.849> shiny<00:01:40.849> color<00:01:42.550> not<00:01:43.550> my<00:01:43.700> first

gripping it's a shiny color not my first

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.160 
gripping it's a shiny color not my first
choice<00:01:44.030> I<00:01:44.330> would<00:01:44.420> have<00:01:44.509> had<00:01:44.630> it<00:01:44.750> all<00:01:44.810> mad

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
choice I would have had it all mad

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.449 
choice I would have had it all mad
around<00:01:45.470> they're<00:01:45.649> actually<00:01:45.950> on<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.069> website

00:01:46.449 --> 00:01:46.459 
around they're actually on the website

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:48.100 
around they're actually on the website
on<00:01:46.670> Amazon<00:01:47.060> actually<00:01:47.360> looks<00:01:47.569> like<00:01:47.720> it's<00:01:47.899> matt

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
on Amazon actually looks like it's matt

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.359 
on Amazon actually looks like it's matt
but<00:01:48.289> maybe<00:01:48.440> I<00:01:48.500> just<00:01:48.679> didn't<00:01:48.950> look<00:01:49.009> at<00:01:49.160> it<00:01:49.190> but

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
but maybe I just didn't look at it but

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.589 
but maybe I just didn't look at it but
let's<00:01:49.819> check<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.920> buttons<00:01:51.970> buttons<00:01:52.970> work

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:53.599 
let's check the buttons buttons work

00:01:53.599 --> 00:02:01.600 
let's check the buttons buttons work
very<00:01:54.140> well<00:01:55.119> volume<00:01:56.119> rocker

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.350 

works<00:02:01.970> good<00:02:03.160> so<00:02:04.160> the<00:02:04.280> I<00:02:04.310> blazing<00:02:04.820> up<00:02:05.180> eight

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
works good so the I blazing up eight

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.690 
works good so the I blazing up eight
nine<00:02:05.600> dollars<00:02:05.960> of<00:02:06.080> this<00:02:07.210> on<00:02:08.210> Amazon<00:02:08.990> obviously

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
nine dollars of this on Amazon obviously

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.410 
nine dollars of this on Amazon obviously
so<00:02:10.700> it's<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.510> very<00:02:12.070> thin<00:02:13.070> TPU<00:02:13.370> case<00:02:13.760> compared<00:02:14.300> to

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
so it's a very thin TPU case compared to

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.180 
so it's a very thin TPU case compared to
the<00:02:14.510> other<00:02:14.660> TPU<00:02:15.050> case<00:02:15.290> that<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.560> first<00:02:15.920> reveal

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
the other TPU case that I first reveal

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.630 
the other TPU case that I first reveal
any<00:02:16.370> grab<00:02:16.580> it<00:02:16.700> real<00:02:16.820> quick<00:02:18.340> compared<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.370> this

any grab it real quick compared to this

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.870 
any grab it real quick compared to this
TPU<00:02:20.150> case<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:21.350> kind<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:21.940> it<00:02:22.940> kind<00:02:23.000> of<00:02:23.300> feels

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.320 
see this is the biggest of them all is
that's<00:02:36.290> four<00:02:36.500> total<00:02:36.709> protection<00:02:37.330> the

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
that's four total protection the

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:45.040 
that's four total protection the
defender<00:02:38.780> series<00:02:39.489> but<00:02:40.930> this<00:02:41.930> case<00:02:42.680> feels<00:02:44.050> and

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
defender series but this case feels and

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.840 
defender series but this case feels and
they're<00:02:45.200> pretty<00:02:45.739> much<00:02:45.770> the<00:02:46.100> same<00:02:46.370> I<00:02:46.670> mean

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
they're pretty much the same I mean

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.330 
they're pretty much the same I mean
they're<00:02:47.450> built<00:02:47.810> almost<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.320> same<00:02:48.560> this<00:02:49.190> one

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
they're built almost the same this one

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.300 
they're built almost the same this one
has<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.459> bigger<00:02:49.790> lip<00:02:50.380> they're<00:02:51.380> both<00:02:51.530> mat<00:02:51.920> on<00:02:52.100> the

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
has a bigger lip they're both mat on the

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.890 
has a bigger lip they're both mat on the
back<00:02:54.820> but<00:02:55.820> this<00:02:55.940> black<00:02:56.239> I<00:02:56.270> guess<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.690> black

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
back but this black I guess the black

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.510 
back but this black I guess the black
just<00:02:57.110> looks<00:02:57.320> a<00:02:57.410> little<00:02:57.500> bit<00:02:57.680> more<00:02:57.830> sleek<00:02:58.250> I

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
just looks a little bit more sleek I

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.580 
just looks a little bit more sleek I
guess<00:02:59.090> I<00:02:59.180> want<00:02:59.360> to<00:02:59.420> say<00:02:59.600> I<00:02:59.810> went<00:03:00.410> with<00:03:00.500> the

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
guess I want to say I went with the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.500 
guess I want to say I went with the
smoke<00:03:00.890> on<00:03:01.100> here<00:03:01.430> because<00:03:01.580> I<00:03:01.850> want<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.239> see<00:03:02.390> how

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
smoke on here because I want to see how

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.400 
smoke on here because I want to see how
it<00:03:02.660> will<00:03:02.810> look<00:03:02.840> with<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.350> with<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.130> blue<00:03:05.410> but

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
it will look with the with the blue but

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.160 
it will look with the with the blue but
the<00:03:07.370> dimples<00:03:07.730> could<00:03:07.910> not<00:03:08.150> cut<00:03:08.360> out<00:03:08.390> as<00:03:08.600> well<00:03:08.810> so

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
the dimples could not cut out as well so

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.620 
the dimples could not cut out as well so
I<00:03:09.440> guess<00:03:10.040> what<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.310> dimple<00:03:10.700> name<00:03:10.850> cut<00:03:11.120> out<00:03:11.299> on

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
I guess what the dimple name cut out on

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.320 
I guess what the dimple name cut out on
the<00:03:12.470> I<00:03:12.500> blazing<00:03:13.100> it's<00:03:13.580> actually<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.970> pretty

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
the I blazing it's actually a pretty

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.560 
the I blazing it's actually a pretty
sleek<00:03:15.040> device<00:03:16.040> it<00:03:16.400> just<00:03:16.760> started<00:03:16.970> case<00:03:17.420> it

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
sleek device it just started case it

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.350 
sleek device it just started case it
just<00:03:17.750> feels<00:03:18.049> thinner<00:03:18.560> than<00:03:19.519> this<00:03:19.820> particular

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
just feels thinner than this particular

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.560 
just feels thinner than this particular
case<00:03:21.640> but<00:03:22.640> nonetheless<00:03:22.820> this<00:03:23.269> is<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.540> I

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
case but nonetheless this is the I

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.910 
case but nonetheless this is the I
blazing<00:03:24.350> case<00:03:25.010> for<00:03:25.580> the<00:03:25.730> Moto<00:03:26.000> X<00:03:26.239> 2014<00:03:27.019> I<00:03:27.260> like

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
blazing case for the Moto X 2014 I like

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.350 
blazing case for the Moto X 2014 I like
how<00:03:27.950> you<00:03:28.100> can<00:03:28.310> see<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:28.640> blue<00:03:28.790> speaker<00:03:29.060> grills

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
how you can see the blue speaker grills

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.500 
how you can see the blue speaker grills
I<00:03:29.480> like<00:03:29.630> how<00:03:29.720> that<00:03:29.750> looks<00:03:29.930> on<00:03:30.170> this<00:03:30.380> one<00:03:30.530> too<00:03:30.739> I

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
I like how that looks on this one too I

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.100 
I like how that looks on this one too I
with<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.630> black<00:03:33.220> microphone<00:03:34.220> cutouts<00:03:34.549> are

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
with the black microphone cutouts are

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
with the black microphone cutouts are
lined<00:03:36.110> up<00:03:36.290> perfectly<00:03:36.860> and<00:03:41.860> it<00:03:42.860> looks<00:03:43.040> like

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
lined up perfectly and it looks like

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.039 
lined up perfectly and it looks like
everything<00:03:43.760> is<00:03:43.910> going<00:03:44.540> to<00:03:44.570> work<00:03:44.630> out<00:03:44.870> well

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
everything is going to work out well

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.229 
everything is going to work out well
with<00:03:45.200> this<00:03:45.320> one<00:03:45.500> this<00:03:45.590> might<00:03:45.799> be<00:03:45.980> a<00:03:46.190> daily<00:03:46.970> case

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
with this one this might be a daily case

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.110 
with this one this might be a daily case
for<00:03:47.540> me<00:03:47.690> since<00:03:48.650> it's<00:03:48.860> black<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.940> you<00:03:50.030> can

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
for me since it's black and you can

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.610 
for me since it's black and you can
pretty<00:03:50.239> much<00:03:50.330> match<00:03:50.630> the<00:03:50.810> black<00:03:51.049> leg<00:03:51.320> with

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
pretty much match the black leg with

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.479 
pretty much match the black leg with
anything<00:03:52.660> new<00:03:53.660> logos<00:03:54.019> got<00:03:54.920> my<00:03:55.010> new<00:03:55.130> logos

finally but yeah anyway you can match

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.830 
finally but yeah anyway you can match
this<00:03:58.489> black<00:03:58.820> pretty<00:03:59.120> much<00:03:59.360> you<00:03:59.600> can<00:03:59.720> watch

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840
