00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
this is a video demonstration on the CP

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.050 
this is a video demonstration on the CP
428<00:00:03.389> s2<00:00:04.220> we're<00:00:05.220> going<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.400> show<00:00:05.580> you<00:00:05.640> how<00:00:05.879> this

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
428 s2 we're going to show you how this

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.960 
428 s2 we're going to show you how this
machine<00:00:06.390> operates<00:00:06.830> the<00:00:07.830> beauty<00:00:08.189> about<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.610> CP

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
machine operates the beauty about the CP

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.030 
machine operates the beauty about the CP
428<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:09.840> that<00:00:10.080> it<00:00:10.230> can<00:00:10.349> produce<00:00:10.469> two<00:00:10.889> different

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
428 is that it can produce two different

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.580 
428 is that it can produce two different
types<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.670> material<00:00:12.120> either<00:00:12.540> pre<00:00:13.200> cushion

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
types of material either pre cushion

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.189 
types of material either pre cushion
material<00:00:14.099> or<00:00:14.429> straight<00:00:14.880> flat<00:00:15.150> sheets<00:00:15.480> over

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
material or straight flat sheets over

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.019 
material or straight flat sheets over
here<00:00:16.590> this<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.070> exit<00:00:17.550> side<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.940> the

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
here this is the exit side of the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.740 
here this is the exit side of the
machine<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.920> flat<00:00:20.220> which<00:00:20.880> when

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
machine this is the the flat which when

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.320 
machine this is the the flat which when
engaged<00:00:22.380> will<00:00:22.890> produce<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.490> pre<00:00:23.880> cushion

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
engaged will produce the pre cushion

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.990 
engaged will produce the pre cushion
material<00:00:24.810> or<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.740> type<00:00:25.890> 1<00:00:26.099> material<00:00:26.609> if<00:00:26.910> you

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
material or the type 1 material if you

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.060 
material or the type 1 material if you
want<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.390> produce<00:00:27.510> straight<00:00:28.260> or<00:00:28.500> flat<00:00:28.710> sheets

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
want to produce straight or flat sheets

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.490 
want to produce straight or flat sheets
you<00:00:29.490> have<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.789> disengage<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.420> flap<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:31.380> do

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
you have to disengage the flap to do

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.350 
you have to disengage the flap to do
that<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.800> just<00:00:31.830> lift<00:00:32.279> open<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.640> flap<00:00:32.910> and

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
that you just lift open the flap and

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.500 
that you just lift open the flap and
slide<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.960> over<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.860> let<00:00:35.070> go<00:00:35.300> now<00:00:36.300> that

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
slide it over and you let go now that

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.389 
slide it over and you let go now that
the<00:00:36.660> door<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.620> open

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
the door is open

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.280 
the door is open
it'll<00:00:38.790> produce<00:00:39.000> straight<00:00:39.420> flat<00:00:39.629> sheets<00:00:39.930> which

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
it'll produce straight flat sheets which

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.880 
it'll produce straight flat sheets which
will<00:00:40.590> fall<00:00:41.579> out<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.120> machine<00:00:42.890> another

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
will fall out of the machine another

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.369 
will fall out of the machine another

width of the cutting cylinders while the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.420 
width of the cutting cylinders while the
machine<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:18.900> running<00:01:19.050> this<00:01:19.710> will<00:01:19.890> help<00:01:20.100> clear

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
machine is running this will help clear

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.910 
machine is running this will help clear
up<00:01:20.460> any<00:01:20.760> debris<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.750> helps<00:01:22.050> clean<00:01:22.680> the

up any debris and it helps clean the
cutting<00:01:23.220> cylinders

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
cutting cylinders

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.980 
cutting cylinders
now<00:01:25.229> let's<00:01:25.470> shred<00:01:25.710> some<00:01:25.890> cardboard<00:01:26.990> this

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
now let's shred some cardboard this

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.800 
now let's shred some cardboard this
machine<00:01:28.409> has<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:29.090> sixteen<00:01:30.090> point<00:01:30.390> nine<00:01:30.600> inch

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
machine has a sixteen point nine inch

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.800 
machine has a sixteen point nine inch
opening<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.680> can<00:01:31.890> take<00:01:32.009> up<00:01:32.190> to<00:01:32.369> 0.78<00:01:33.240> inch<00:01:33.509> of

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
opening and can take up to 0.78 inch of

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.899 
opening and can take up to 0.78 inch of
material<00:01:34.100> so<00:01:35.100> here<00:01:35.280> I've<00:01:35.369> got<00:01:35.399> a<00:01:35.520> flattened

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
material so here I've got a flattened

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.650 
material so here I've got a flattened
box<00:01:36.090> I'm<00:01:36.360> going<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.540> process<00:01:36.750> through

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.810 

as<00:01:40.660> you<00:01:40.810> can<00:01:40.990> see<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.290> machine<00:01:41.440> will<00:01:42.400> cut<00:01:42.640> off

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
as you can see the machine will cut off

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.140 
as you can see the machine will cut off
this

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
this

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.930 
this
and<00:01:44.570> so<00:01:44.750> this<00:01:45.080> part<00:01:45.410> was<00:01:45.860> crossing<00:01:46.340> so<00:01:46.580> now

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
and so this part was crossing so now

00:01:46.940 --> 00:02:00.219 
and so this part was crossing so now
when<00:01:47.120> I<00:01:47.150> run<00:01:47.180> this<00:01:47.330> part<00:01:47.720> group

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.469

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
the beauty of the open with' design is

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.450 
the beauty of the open with' design is
that<00:02:02.630> you<00:02:02.810> can<00:02:02.960> put<00:02:03.140> in<00:02:03.259> different<00:02:03.439> widths<00:02:04.310> of

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
that you can put in different widths of

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.919 
that you can put in different widths of
materials<00:02:05.619> here<00:02:06.619> I've<00:02:06.979> got<00:02:07.159> another<00:02:07.369> boss

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
materials here I've got another boss

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.160 
materials here I've got another boss
let's<00:02:08.929> run<00:02:09.110> this<00:02:09.259> through

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
let's run this through

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.850 
let's run this through
