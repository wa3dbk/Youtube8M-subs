00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.340 
give you they'll end up giving you the
second<00:01:20.820> code<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.210> need<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.689> then<00:01:22.229> he

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
second code that you need and then he

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.630 
second code that you need and then he
just<00:01:22.380> kind<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.740> confirms<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.280> first<00:01:23.490> get

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
console had to be the most important

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.660 
console had to be the most important
still<00:01:33.270> it's<00:01:33.780> only<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.049> matter<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.380> time<00:01:34.670> right

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
still it's only a matter of time right

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
after that go behind them through this

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.550 
after that go behind them through this
door<00:01:38.400> go<00:01:38.670> outside<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.420> two<00:01:39.540> computers<00:01:39.900> the

door go outside to the two computers the
first<00:01:40.799> computer<00:01:41.310> has<00:01:41.400> got<00:01:41.549> some<00:01:41.700> traps<00:01:42.060> it's

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
first computer has got some traps it's

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.190

computer<00:02:31.690> I<00:02:32.610> didn't<00:02:33.610> do<00:02:33.700> this<00:02:33.850> at<00:02:34.090> first<00:02:34.270> of

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
computer I didn't do this at first of

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.930 
computer I didn't do this at first of
course<00:02:34.600> because<00:02:35.380> I'm<00:02:35.920> an<00:02:36.100> idiot<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:36.610> I<00:02:36.700> like

do this there is a water fountain here
that<00:02:44.920> you<00:02:44.980> can<00:02:45.100> kind<00:02:45.310> of<00:02:45.340> crouched<00:02:45.580> behind<00:02:45.790> and

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
that you can kind of crouched behind and

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.120 
that you can kind of crouched behind and
reup<00:02:47.950> on<00:02:48.130> health<00:02:48.370> there's<00:02:49.000> three<00:02:49.420> turrets<00:02:50.320> a

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
reup on health there's three turrets a

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.360 
reup on health there's three turrets a
robo<00:02:52.000> brain<00:02:52.300> and<00:02:52.720> then<00:02:53.260> downstairs<00:02:53.709> is<00:02:54.670> a

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
robo brain and then downstairs is a

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.180 
robo brain and then downstairs is a
center<00:02:57.370> got<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:58.780> Sentry<00:02:59.170> box<00:02:59.200> have<00:02:59.560> a<00:02:59.590> lot<00:02:59.980> of

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
center got the Sentry box have a lot of

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.420 
center got the Sentry box have a lot of
armor<00:03:00.700> so<00:03:01.690> you<00:03:01.750> need<00:03:01.959> to<00:03:02.170> kind<00:03:03.100> of<00:03:03.190> do<00:03:03.400> some

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
armor so you need to kind of do some
