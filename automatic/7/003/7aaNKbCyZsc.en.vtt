00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.660
 gentlemen good morning let's start here 

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:07.100
 with a caddy on a bicycle but so much 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.309
 You asked me this time from San 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.820
 fernando see what we have there the 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.530
 hydrographic institute no 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.140
 so we are on the island of Leon ' 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.260
 a part of each design was unique and 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.400
 we go 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.500
 to C치diz but being C치diz it seems that 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.020
 We are abroad because there 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.790
 you have a public parking lot and there 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.430
 you have a public car park we come 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.000
 to rake to the craft like a 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.070
 corpse bartillo not the rake 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.450
 but I want to make the comparison never 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.010
 different than they have the poor 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.450
 Rumbia boys today on the verge of 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.210
 Mira park reminds me of the park the 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.460
 pine is the have yesterday heading to the vera 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.309

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.500
 road on a sidewalk there thrown away 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.270
 means badly 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.940
 he arrived in san fernando and I find myself 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.260
 done to make the comparative them 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.650
 They put the boys in a parking lot 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.330
 completely free public that we have 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.870
 arrived and we parked 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:07.660
 wonderful understand me then 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.400
 they have a cafeteria there in just hit 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.170
 and they are in a public square where 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.479
 they can come with your site and I follow it and 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.340
 I was playing and others are celebrated 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.060
 other events we will pass on so that 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.990
 see the site carefully set 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.430

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.840
 City Council of C치diz can not do 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.810
 something similar not that in C치diz there is no 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.620
 site by looking for cojones let's go a 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.360
 little more spirit 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.950
 the monda because I think that if I give the 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.740
 pause as I do not know the camera is 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.310
