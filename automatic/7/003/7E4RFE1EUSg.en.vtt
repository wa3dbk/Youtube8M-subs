thing you're going to want to do is

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.649 
thing you're going to want to do is
connect<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.040> hot<00:01:11.340> wire<00:01:11.549> piece<00:01:11.970> because<00:01:12.540> it

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
connect the hot wire piece because it

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.500 
connect the hot wire piece because it
doesn't<00:01:12.960> come

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
doesn't come

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.620 
doesn't come
there<00:01:13.770> there's<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.890> loop<00:01:15.160> on<00:01:15.460> the<00:01:15.910> cap<00:01:16.120> that<00:01:16.570> you

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
there there's a loop on the cap that you

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.810 
there there's a loop on the cap that you
slip<00:01:17.080> the<00:01:17.200> wire<00:01:17.380> through<00:01:17.650> move<00:01:18.070> it<00:01:18.220> around<00:01:18.310> and

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
slip the wire through move it around and

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.290 
slip the wire through move it around and
twist<00:01:19.540> it<00:01:19.750> around<00:01:19.840> itself<00:01:21.150> string<00:01:22.150> the<00:01:22.270> wire

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
twist it around itself string the wire

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.010 
twist it around itself string the wire
up<00:01:22.690> over<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:23.650> top<00:01:23.860> of<00:01:24.250> the<00:01:24.370> bar<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:25.720> want<00:01:25.900> to

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
up over the top of the bar you want to

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.770 
up over the top of the bar you want to
squeeze<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.950> bar<00:01:27.160> a<00:01:27.190> little<00:01:27.580> bit<00:01:27.760> to<00:01:28.390> put<00:01:28.600> some

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
squeeze the bar a little bit to put some

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.390 
squeeze the bar a little bit to put some
tension<00:01:28.990> on<00:01:29.290> it<00:01:29.350> and<00:01:29.740> while<00:01:29.860> you're<00:01:30.040> wrapping

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
tension on it and while you're wrapping

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.160 
tension on it and while you're wrapping
it<00:01:30.520> and<00:01:30.670> once<00:01:31.360> you<00:01:31.480> have<00:01:31.630> it<00:01:31.660> wrapped<00:01:31.930> around

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
it and once you have it wrapped around

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.580 
it and once you have it wrapped around
you<00:01:32.590> can<00:01:32.920> let<00:01:33.130> go<00:01:33.310> of<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.550> bar<00:01:33.850> and<00:01:34.170> get<00:01:35.170> into

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
you can let go of the bar and get into

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.280 
you can let go of the bar and get into
it<00:01:35.650> some<00:01:35.860> tension<00:01:36.250> on<00:01:36.370> the<00:01:36.580> wire<00:01:37.050> and<00:01:38.050> make<00:01:38.170> it

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
it some tension on the wire and make it

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.580 
it some tension on the wire and make it
nice<00:01:38.410> and<00:01:38.470> tight<00:01:38.830> so<00:01:38.860> you<00:01:39.130> get<00:01:39.280> straight<00:01:39.610> cuts

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
nice and tight so you get straight cuts

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.040 
nice and tight so you get straight cuts
once<00:01:41.590> you<00:01:41.710> have<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.070> wire<00:01:42.310> in<00:01:42.640> place

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
once you have the wire in place

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.150 
once you have the wire in place
basically<00:01:44.050> all<00:01:44.200> you<00:01:44.320> need<00:01:44.350> to<00:01:44.560> do<00:01:44.680> is<00:01:44.860> take<00:01:45.040> the

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
basically all you need to do is take the

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.640 
basically all you need to do is take the
two<00:01:45.340> batteries<00:01:46.290> insert<00:01:47.290> them<00:01:48.150> and<00:01:49.380> next<00:01:50.380> goes

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
two batteries insert them and next goes

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:59.850 
two batteries insert them and next goes
in<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.010> screen<00:01:56.580> and<00:01:57.580> just<00:01:58.290> screw<00:01:59.290> the<00:01:59.440> cap<00:01:59.650> on

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
in the screen and just screw the cap on

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.480 
in the screen and just screw the cap on
all<00:02:00.100> this<00:02:00.280> burn

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.870 

and<00:02:05.970> all<00:02:06.630> put<00:02:06.990> together<00:02:07.140> now<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:08.729> to

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
and all put together now and just to

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.520 
and all put together now and just to
turn<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.209> on<00:02:09.390> all<00:02:09.600> you<00:02:09.720> need<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.959> do<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.289> flip

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
turn it on all you need to do is flip

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.410 
turn it on all you need to do is flip
the<00:02:10.800> switch<00:02:11.039> over<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.490> that<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.730> makes<00:02:11.940> contact

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
the switch over so that it makes contact

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.780 
the switch over so that it makes contact
with<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.780> back<00:02:12.990> cap<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:14.010> basically<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.760> just

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
with the back cap and basically it just

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.460 
with the back cap and basically it just
completes<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.540> circuit<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.050> short<00:02:16.080> stout

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
completes the circuit and short stout

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.800 
completes the circuit and short stout
and<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.220> power<00:02:17.490> will<00:02:17.610> run<00:02:17.819> from<00:02:18.630> the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
and the power will run from the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.390 
and the power will run from the
batteries<00:02:19.170> through<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.500> wire<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:20.069> back

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
out also and the wire will get hot we're

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.960 
out also and the wire will get hot we're
going<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.650> go<00:02:46.769> ahead<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.370> turn<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.700> video<00:02:47.850> off

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
going to go ahead and turn the video off

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.570 
going to go ahead and turn the video off
and<00:02:48.300> I'm<00:02:48.360> going<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.570> position<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.650> foam<00:02:50.160> so

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
and I'm going to position the foam so

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.860 
and I'm going to position the foam so
that<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:50.760> can<00:02:50.940> go<00:02:51.090> ahead<00:02:51.209> and<00:02:51.450> do<00:02:51.630> an<00:02:51.780> example

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
that I can go ahead and do an example

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:00.470 
that I can go ahead and do an example
and<00:02:52.470> show<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:52.739> how<00:02:53.040> this<00:02:53.250> actually<00:02:53.489> works

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.720 

okay<00:03:01.290> we're<00:03:01.530> going<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.680> go<00:03:01.860> ahead<00:03:02.099> and<00:03:02.250> use<00:03:02.430> the

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
okay we're going to go ahead and use the

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.540 
okay we're going to go ahead and use the
handheld<00:03:03.030> Hotwire<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:04.440> bibble<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.160> trailing

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
handheld Hotwire to bibble the trailing

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.640 
handheld Hotwire to bibble the trailing
edge<00:03:05.790> on<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.090> swing<00:03:06.360> so<00:03:07.080> all<00:03:07.170> we<00:03:07.290> have<00:03:07.379> to<00:03:07.470> do

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
edge on the swing so all we have to do

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.830 
edge on the swing so all we have to do
is<00:03:07.800> put<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.400> switch<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.910> on<00:03:09.030> position<00:03:09.060> and

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
is put the switch to the on position and

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.640 
is put the switch to the on position and
now<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:10.860> wires<00:03:11.190> hot<00:03:11.780> and<00:03:12.780> we're<00:03:13.379> going<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.560> go

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
now the wires hot and we're going to go

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:23.330 
now the wires hot and we're going to go
ahead<00:03:13.769> and<00:03:15.709> make<00:03:16.709> our<00:03:16.739> cut<00:03:22.040> basically<00:03:23.040> just

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
ahead and make our cut basically just

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.460 
ahead and make our cut basically just
take<00:03:23.760> your<00:03:23.970> time<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:25.620> go<00:03:26.549> out<00:03:26.580> a<00:03:26.730> nice<00:03:26.970> steady

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
take your time and go out a nice steady

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.039 
take your time and go out a nice steady
even<00:03:28.470> pace<00:03:28.769> I<00:03:31.760> like<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.880> try<00:03:33.120> an<00:03:33.180> ease<00:03:33.420> ahead<00:03:33.870> to

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
even pace I like to try an ease ahead to

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.370 
even pace I like to try an ease ahead to
the<00:03:34.140> table<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.970> help<00:03:35.970> guide<00:03:36.269> it<00:03:36.299> so<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:36.900> can

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
the table that help guide it so I can

00:03:37.380 --> 00:04:22.909 
the table that help guide it so I can
get<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.680> nice<00:03:37.950> straight<00:03:38.430> cut

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.820 

okay<00:04:23.699> and<00:04:24.419> once<00:04:24.749> you<00:04:24.840> cut<00:04:25.139> through<00:04:25.409> go<00:04:25.800> ahead

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
okay and once you cut through go ahead

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.890 
okay and once you cut through go ahead
and<00:04:26.009> turn<00:04:26.249> it<00:04:26.280> off<00:04:26.490> by<00:04:26.789> breaking<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.419> contact

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
and turn it off by breaking the contact

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.980 
and turn it off by breaking the contact
and<00:04:28.110> flipping<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.710> switch<00:04:28.860> to<00:04:29.129> the<00:04:29.249> side<00:04:29.990> then

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
and flipping the switch to the side then

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.390 
and flipping the switch to the side then
go<00:04:31.229> ahead<00:04:31.289> and<00:04:31.409> set<00:04:31.650> it<00:04:31.680> down<00:04:31.770> somewhere<00:04:32.129> but

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
go ahead and set it down somewhere but

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.159 
go ahead and set it down somewhere but
be<00:04:32.520> careful<00:04:33.060> not<00:04:33.180> to<00:04:33.360> set<00:04:33.539> it<00:04:33.659> on<00:04:33.810> to<00:04:34.080> the

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
be careful not to set it on to the

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.330 
be careful not to set it on to the
switch<00:04:34.409> because<00:04:34.590> you<00:04:34.710> could<00:04:34.860> accidentally

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
switch because you could accidentally

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.230 
switch because you could accidentally
bump<00:04:35.669> it<00:04:35.819> back<00:04:36.300> on<00:04:36.509> to<00:04:36.629> the<00:04:36.689> on<00:04:36.810> position<00:04:36.990> and

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
bump it back on to the on position and

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.899 
bump it back on to the on position and
once<00:04:39.240> you've<00:04:39.389> got<00:04:39.569> it<00:04:39.599> cut<00:04:39.930> just<00:04:40.699> feel<00:04:41.699> the

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
also with the way the switch worked on

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.240

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
version is much more reliable and switch

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.659
