 Dear friends, I am very touched. 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.350

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.260
 popularity and of course huge 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.600
 thanks for such a warm chat in 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.820

 love on the track also want to wish 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.350
 a lot of personal success in everything absolutely 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.810
 in everything and before I want to note that this 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.689
 video will be the last of the year 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.240
 well let's get started very recently 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:17.240
 She is lying on the couch and the baby klatsat channel 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.460
 on the body of ki and accidentally noticed an interesting 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.100
 a fairy tale and it was electronic 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:26.389
 who does not know this great-great-grandfather 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.249
 Terminator damn as far as a fairy tale 

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:29.389
 was kind and correct and watch 

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:31.369
 current cartoons 

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:34.429
 it's like teaching your child 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.950
 how to kill correctly humiliate well and 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:39.259
 so on and here we see as a robot 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.499
 wants to be just a living person so 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.789
 say sensible homosapiens 

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:46.609
 really this film is in my weight 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:49.729
 was one of the best who taught goodness and 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:53.090
 true love for all the values â€‹â€‹that 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.639
 we are so terrible not so c 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.090
 what I want to notice friends value friend 

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:59.270
 friend 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.939
 for only together we are as in a game 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.549
 the team so in life I certainly will not 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.139
 you retell the whole movie here 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.240
 it is unnecessary that the only 

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:11.060
 I would advise it to watch it and 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.580
 take for yourself the kindness that we 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.250
 have shown because my subscribers do not 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.040
 only adults who have seen this 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.050
 a fairy tale but also young guys who thought 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.510
 what our domestic 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.350
 picture sucks for nothing you think so 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.380
 the guys are still very, very many tales 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:34.340
 from which you can take different different 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:37.010
 lives things but what if you remember 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.920
 then maybe those films are really 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.710
 on which we grew up remember the first films 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.620
 Jack Chan Va oh my God I aspired 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.930
 imitate him it 's just kapets i 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.050
 I wanted to do a lot of training in training 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:55.700
 martial arts but of course I understand that 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:58.190
 as the movie does not happen but it was however 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.280
 everything is done for a reason and in my life it is 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.790
 it was useful to repeatedly remember the movie 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:09.020
 involving steven signal what kind of 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:13.100
 eating my law is always calm right 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.800
 plus straight hair with pigtails fought 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.380
 also that the fur coat wrapped 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.050
 I remember how we guys went to watch 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.350
 these films in the club for the cinema from that 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.160
 that few people did not go were forced 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.790
 close 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:32.600
 what kind of club ask this is a regular room 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.760
 where is the TV stand on the stand 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.950
 planted kinescope and with large 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.650
 windows which are absolutely nothing 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.040
 curtain telly and so the fig is not visible 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.760
 plus still the sun shines scary what's up 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.860
 blindness 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.110
 but despite that people don't care 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.430
 crowded there we watched all these films 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.830
 who went out not in the cinema and then 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.250
 coming out of such an institution was all 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:01.310
 these tricks work on each other 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:04.010
 fight then I think it all went 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.140
 Of course the childhood that I had and 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.350
 those guys who grew up in those days 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.260
 already with the current but can not be compared 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:15.020
 so that the younger generation appreciate what 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:18.080
 you have and take from your childhood 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:21.780
 maximum and then there will be nothing to remember 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:24.240
 still remember the first ema VCRs 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.940
 not real sizes they could by the way 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.250
 rent and along with 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:33.180
 he had to grab a videotape with 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.710
 Indian movies to call everyone 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.020
 neighbors and cry 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.570
 I remember from school you come and I 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.430
 apartment full room mother's girlfriends 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.900
 who together fill the cloth with 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:48.990
 tears there for the film which is filled 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.010
 just one song and a phrase to mind 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.970
 comes so sad that you want to sing 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:58.700
 yes it was certainly not argue 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:02.400
 remember what battles we are Indian 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:05.910
 kinomanam rozario coffin just smoke 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.300
 the nervous side of the mithun chakraborty power 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:12.660
 without touching the face could scatter 30 people 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:15.300
 eyes closed yet however paper 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.140
 Honestly it was interesting. 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.440
 by and large friends of these topics 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:24.240
 endless ones can be discussed forever 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.419
 better not sitting near the monitor in 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.919
 some cafe for a beer and 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.500
 salty fish in their team 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:34.080
 friends but the problem is probably that we 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.990
 far apart and Russia is scary 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.650
 huge country but i'm glad that we are so 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.360
 we can even talk well friends 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.840
 tell me honestly, you have a little dip in 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:48.169
 childhood and remember yourself if yes then 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.729
 then like and subscription will say everything for themselves 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:53.510
 all with the coming to new meetings 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.510
 Dear friends 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.460
 left 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.690
 capturing. 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.370
 rules running 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.919
 I found a start in the air
