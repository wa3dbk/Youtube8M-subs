00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.750
 entirely here in our country and that 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.480
 the truth will feel scared a movie

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.780
 any promising aerators is 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.660
 they were also exactly galliani daughter 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.850
 sergio galliani right and incursion 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.590
 in the cinema and also with jürgen gómez he 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.970
 He is a Colombian actor who was 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.710
 saying that during the recording of 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.160
 this movie had a paranormal presence 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.160
 close 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.590
 this movie has been recorded in iquitos 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.119
 in fact the avant premiere was the day of 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.009
 yesterday not true you just arrived 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.600
 of travel and this cemetery was chosen 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.479
 precisely because of the demonstrations 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.550
 paranormals exist animation except 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.259
 the movie is based on something that happened 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.869
 really in that same cemetery in the 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.840
 2002 of some girls who went to play the 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:26.440
 Ouija between 11 and 12 years old 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.720
 they ended all possessed and the director 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.789
 has the newspaper where the news comes out 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.860
 and that was based on making the movie 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.980
 and he wanted to do exactly where 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.740
 played 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.750
 and also it has been a furor is the 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.450
 presentation of the film and the liquid 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.970
 they have not paralyzed the city not us 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.580
 we expected that was something that really 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.980
 exceeded our expectations I think 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.510
 the expectations of all we are all 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.310
 very happy and very shocked too 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.620
 for the welcome that people had 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.260
 digits really everything different is 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.360
 I was outside the cinema waiting and 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.940
 also they waited until she finished 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.560
 movie we went out people were still there from 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.960
 truth is a movie that I feel it in 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.310
 own show your merits and urge you 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.050
 you told me you had some kind 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.610
 of paranormal contact right in the middle 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.800
 movie recording tell us a 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.900
 little of that wow oh several times 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.700
 really in the movie because the 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.220
 director to us forced us and gave 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.660
 strict order that the first time that 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.910
 we arrived at the cemetery we all had 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.900
 to enter blindfolded 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.850
 then we were all in the truck 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.890
 outside when he says everyone has to 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.780
 blindfold when a lot because 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.960
 I wanted to come true the first time 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.730
 we stepped on a place that we did not know 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.950
 really that expression in our 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.390
 faces be real 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.670

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.220
 completely alone and sent us to this 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.290
 the middle you do not know where the output is 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:55.670
