00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
year i don't really think that that's a

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.800 
year i don't really think that that's a
fair<00:03:49.500> assessment<00:03:49.880> it<00:03:50.880> certainly<00:03:51.420> is<00:03:51.540> true

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
fair assessment it certainly is true

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.060 
fair assessment it certainly is true
that<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.079> app<00:03:52.200> situation<00:03:52.680> could<00:03:52.829> be<00:03:52.920> better

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
that the app situation could be better

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.440 
that the app situation could be better
and<00:03:53.310> it's<00:03:53.430> certainly<00:03:53.579> true<00:03:53.880> that<00:03:53.970> i<00:03:54.150> wish<00:03:54.420> that

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
and it's certainly true that i wish that

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.840 
and it's certainly true that i wish that
there<00:03:54.900> were<00:03:55.049> apps<00:03:55.620> such<00:03:55.980> as<00:03:56.010> Instagram<00:03:56.489> or

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
there were apps such as Instagram or

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.520

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
that spotify was was working correctly

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.860 
that spotify was was working correctly
on<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.609> phone<00:03:59.790> and<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.209> dropbox<00:04:00.630> had<00:04:00.840> a

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
on the phone and the dropbox had a

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.500 
on the phone and the dropbox had a
native<00:04:01.170> app<00:04:01.290> already<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.910> app<00:04:03.000> situations<00:04:03.450> a

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
native app already the app situations a

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
native app already the app situations a
lot<00:04:03.570> better<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.900> night<00:04:04.019> that<00:04:04.200> i<00:04:04.230> thought<00:04:04.380> it

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
lot better the night that i thought it

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.599 
lot better the night that i thought it
would<00:04:04.620> be<00:04:04.739> and<00:04:04.890> it's<00:04:05.010> certainly<00:04:05.160> a<00:04:05.310> lot<00:04:05.400> better

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
would be and it's certainly a lot better

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.009 
would be and it's certainly a lot better

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
got to buy the full thing but that's a

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.610 
got to buy the full thing but that's a
really<00:05:22.330> great<00:05:22.510> option<00:05:22.900> that<00:05:23.050> the<00:05:23.500> other

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
really great option that the other

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.500 
really great option that the other
platforms<00:05:24.070> don't<00:05:24.250> have<00:05:24.460> you<00:05:24.730> know<00:05:24.850> android

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.060 
platforms don't have you know android
has<00:05:25.540> a<00:05:25.660> great<00:05:25.870> return<00:05:26.140> window<00:05:26.380> but<00:05:26.950> that

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
has a great return window but that

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.070 
has a great return window but that
window<00:05:27.190> it<00:05:27.520> used<00:05:27.910> to<00:05:28.060> be<00:05:28.150> like<00:05:28.330> 24<00:05:28.750> hours<00:05:28.990> and

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
window it used to be like 24 hours and

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.750 
window it used to be like 24 hours and
that<00:05:29.200> was<00:05:29.350> way<00:05:29.470> too<00:05:29.500> much<00:05:29.740> keyword<00:05:30.310> using<00:05:30.670> that

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
that was way too much keyword using that

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.210 
that was way too much keyword using that
and<00:05:30.970> now<00:05:31.030> i<00:05:31.060> think<00:05:31.180> it's<00:05:31.450> the<00:05:31.480> 15<00:05:31.870> minutes<00:05:32.220> but

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
and now i think it's the 15 minutes but

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.130 
and now i think it's the 15 minutes but
sometimes<00:05:33.640> you<00:05:34.330> know<00:05:34.450> just<00:05:34.720> having<00:05:34.870> a<00:05:34.990> way<00:05:35.080> to

sometimes you know just having a way to

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.840 
sometimes you know just having a way to
kind<00:05:35.290> of<00:05:35.410> use<00:05:35.620> a<00:05:35.650> nap<00:05:35.920> and<00:05:36.130> get<00:05:36.280> a<00:05:36.310> feel<00:05:36.520> for<00:05:36.820> it

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
kind of use a nap and get a feel for it
