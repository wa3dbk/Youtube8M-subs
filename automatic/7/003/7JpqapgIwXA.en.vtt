00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.199
 shopping recently in my city I don’t 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.800
 could find some products from the company 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.810
 revlon 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.180
 in general, we have never been anywhere before 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.340
 Presented cosmetic brand Revlon 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.590
 I mean, you know a wide selection 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.320
 so that you come to one place and all at once 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.489
 I bought and recently I accidentally 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.649
 stumbled in our city in one 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.260
 a big store where they sell a lot 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.579
 different cosmetics of different brands is 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.739
 noname store 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.390
 and they found a huge tester stand 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.550
 a huge selection of cosmetics revlon 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.760
 quite recently they are 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.629
 brought this to Maca to themselves and steel 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.030
 sell it 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.820
 that is, before they had a small selection 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.309
 and now they just have a huge selection 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.050
 I could not pass it stands I 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.050
 Of course I bought something for myself 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.670
 Here is a beautiful bag I have with 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.670
 shopping 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:14.850
 Now I will show you everything the first thing I wanted 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.820
 show you this mascara mascara called 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.830
 double twist it for lengthening volume 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.490
 In general, the maximum it pulls your 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.159
 eyelashes all that can be pulled from them and 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.310
 she's just so awesome 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.740
 the tassel is very big and when you do it 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.170
 pull out you hear such a crash even 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.770
 you probably heard his attacks now 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.880
 the net is pretty big and she 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.280
 performs two functions that is she 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.320
 stains your eyelashes before giving 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.869
 im the volume of clay and plus it combs 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.240
 immediately at the same time that is you can her 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.549
 comb and pull that is it 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.159
 cool that's the way today put 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.899
 this mascara is pretty good if 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.750
 principle, you can try at all here 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.530
 such lashes make huge and good 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.799
 good effect 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.620
 by the way the vision already go with this mascara and 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.680
 she does not showered him 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.120
 all beautiful eyelashes do not know how she 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.400
 it is washed off as if I only once 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.450
 number carried us in the II century on their 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.000
 eyelashes and I will generally check 2 very 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.150
 interesting purchase is a roll rub and 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.830
 compact cup this 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.720
 tonal foundation compact she too 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.720
 so you know funny could not by 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.590
 her pass because 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.030
 interesting thing such a box 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.270
 pretty big 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.450
 the design is very very simple and well inside 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:45.170
 by the way uneasy inside is such 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.320
 see the cat compartment on top is 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.500
 such a fine mesh as small as a sieve 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.440
 sieve and under this sieve 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.710
 there is a tonal basis when 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.660
 touch this screen then 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.210
 squeezed tonally becomes again 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.510
 liquid and that is how much you 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.880
 necessary you do not overdo it calmly 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.220
 take as much as you need with 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.410

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.250

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.000
 also special some parts 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.820
 which also surround the light and 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.640
 that is, when these particles reflect light 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.910
 your skin defects they sort of 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.560
 hiding and plus it says here that 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.630

 staunchly and by the way lip it doesn’t dry much 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.040
 usual from his team after all 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.620
 after all, they dry the popular prints this fudge 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.410
 No it. as if to learn moisturizes 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.240
 here as part of another acacia vitamins I 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.460

 average latitude 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.789
 he really likes this shade i think 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:25.810
 that you like him too and 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:28.360
 too, as it is now fashionable this season so 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.939
 try it too 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.039
 by the way so as not to have such a trick 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:36.430
 so that matte lipstick does not dry the sponge 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:37.960
 applied to brush her and thereby 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.300
 the web on a thick layer 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.370
 put it on her lips and she won't be like that 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.930
 much dry you and lips and in general even 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.419

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.419
 Liked here, too, and reflective 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:04.120
 the particles alone do not reflect the color and 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:07.569
 hide skin defects in principle 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.990
 normal foundation and protection too 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:12.520
 20 cm 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.529

 Well, in general, satisfied with this foundation 

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:28.710
 the following is also what I generally love 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:31.589
 it is very lip gloss 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:35.949
