00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:17.779
 yesterday we planted raspberries with you 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:23.180
 and today we will plant cucumbers 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:26.630
 seedlings like that yesterday I dug 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:30.769
 dug two grooves flooded them with water 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:34.550
 set doodie to cover with spunbond 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:41.040
 why did I do this to 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:41.910
 guaranteed to avoid protect my 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.809
 cucumbers 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.500
 from possible return later than spring 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.949
 frosts and create warmer 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.590
 conditions more comfortable conditions for them 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.870
 so they could not better 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.219
 acclimatize and take root well 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.250
 then not ten after landing I 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.990
 I will remove these spirits here in the middle of two 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.650
 these rows will be installed on 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:15.420
 wooden poles here is such a grid 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.500
 on which cucumbers will grow up well 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.049
 naturally bear fruit i think that 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:26.310
 growing cucumbers on the grid more 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:30.329
 effectively than land shoots that is 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.220
 the vines are better well ventilated better 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.909
 sunshine yields 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.150
 rises 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.780
 among other things, what I want 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.450
 pay attention here to these grooves in 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.490
 soil where I will plant cucumbers i don't 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.250
 add mineral fertilizers how much 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.340
 I have been glued vegetable 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.119
 remnants well this is fallen leaves 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:59.090
 which was treated under baikal 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.770
 m1 100 grams per 10 liters of water and 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.399
 dug into the ground 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:09.599
 during the winter this foliage turned into 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.970
 m compost compost that was produced 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.910
 using effective 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.280
 micro 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.990
 nismo and totem compost activates 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.350
 useful soil activity 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.880
 microflora also it provides 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.620
 accumulation of nutrients in the soil 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.960
 why I won't use 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.630
 mineral fertilizers additionally 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.030
 it also accelerates the start of the growing season and 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.170
 bloom increases the amount of envy 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.760
 also stimulates 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:43.060
 m compost root system development 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.990
 improves plant immunity 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.450
 so i recommend you use 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:53.670
 microbiological fertilizer baikal em1 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:56.590
 and now we drop with you 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.380
 cucumbers by the way they are with me 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:04.200
 peat-humus pots planted 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:09.430
 see what is the root system outside 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:13.620
 roots sprouted through the pot and now 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:17.740
 root will be damaged during planting 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.020
 the way the least 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.280
 the best time to disembark is 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.459
 such a seedling is a seedling at the age 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.459
 three weeks 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:37.380
 but for now we land our cucumbers 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:41.020
 Actually, I have long been convinced that 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:46.180
 use baikal em1 instead 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:48.360
 Baikal EM1 chemical fertilizers 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.160
 its derivatives such as m5 it 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:59.970
 disease protection 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:59.970
 as well as m compost they greatly increase 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:09.580
 soil fertility 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:14.989
 improve the amount of fruit produced 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:16.359
 or the same cucumbers and allow 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.870
 receive 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:25.010
 organic crop here I will plant 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.790
 and cucumbers are staggered and then 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.830
 in the middle here the grid will be stretched 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:37.130
 and planted cucumbers can be long 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:39.080
 grind dry dry ground when 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:45.530
 a little bit of a little bitch must grow here 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:49.060
 she's on the plot i'm narva mustard and 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:52.750
 chum , all good luck to you 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.750
 work good harvests for you
