00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.149
 after the mayor I never saw him here in the 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.279
 channel 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.750
 Today I'm going to make a lot of people happy. 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.090
 that since the third quarter video 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.219
 He has showed a video about the genius term 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.710
 today I can see, then let's search 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.929
 see how these products 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.119
 documents that works clear 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.189
 Thermogenic comes from thermogenics that 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.250
 process through which the body produces 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.900
 heat then the main function 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.880
 thermogenic is to increase the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.609
 body up to one genes or by 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.500
 other words increase metabolism 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.020
 then as a consequence of this increase 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.829
 not so legitimate the body will spend more 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.600
 and how you are going to get resources 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.270
 to be able to respond to this greater 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.680
 energy demand by lifting the taxes 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.390
 fat reserves 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.039
 both main function of the generic theme 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.760
 are also known to burn 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.680
 fat you need to burn more fat 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.899
 some ways to have a manager too 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.270
 have ingredients that favor 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.010
 equity lighting that reduce 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.379
 this title is not 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.750
 for weight loss 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.700
 however in this video I will stay the days 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.560
 especially this function of the moment 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.590
 so even since it is the main 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.750
 objective of this product to the street 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.140
 very common ingredients found 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.689
 in thermogenic forms are caffeine 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.369
 fire keychain was max as well 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.409
 we have many other ingredients like 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.750
 for example black pepper 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.100
 giba if at last brakes the mucus 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.850
 programs is creatine is from 77 to 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.119
 etc 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.710
 like the body on the fat board 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.960
 we have in various parts of our 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.329
 two types of receptors of one 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.680
 side the medical alpharadin sectors that 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.530
 can be subdivided into three sectors 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.020
 to alpha-2 hunger on the other side we have to 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.479
 beta sectors is to see doctors can be 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.770
 subdivided in which the concrete sector b2 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.020
 and b3 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.420
 then that kind of certain alpha sector 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.820
 the alpha-2 thoughts convey the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.100
 message to the body to save a day 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.299
 I compared the day to not 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.340
 burn fat 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.170
 on the other side turn 1 7 beta 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.060
 transmit the message the body not to 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.119
 increase energy expenditure provides the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.890
 burn more fat and therefore a point 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.650
 view of fat burning 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.709
 considered to be alpha bad sectors and 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.480
 beta sub sectors good medical sectors 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.880
 determines the type and quantity of 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.800
 sectors that each person has an individual 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.810
 to me as a debt that they have 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.900
 difficulty in gaining weight has many 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.850
 more peta sectors in target sectors 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.830
 that's why they can eat can 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.500
 every day until the organ becomes difficult 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.320
 goal that will accumulate with fat 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.930
 on the other hand the amorphous ocean possesses 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.610
 more the alpha sectors than the beta 7 and 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.980
 that 's why it 's extremely difficult 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.920
 to see if beneficial fat free 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.660
 also determines the distribution of these 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.420
 sectors in our body 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.030
 people who are more likely as 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.620
 in the area of curtains needs to be 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.690
 example a large proportion of women are 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.000
 because it has many more sectors as it was 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.430
 in these regions of the body how do these 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.720
 sectors are activated their bodies with 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.090
 the beginning of the video is the word 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.920
 internet coming in from the inside in the urine 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.250
 well this sector is activated 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.320
 whenever the adrenaline in the mine line 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.720
 sur yon in homs 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.370
 there are some anabolic trotting 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.519
 consumed by professional athletes of the 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.400
 which has the function of blocking the 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.049
 expression of alpha receptors exist 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.000
 also a steroid that has the function of 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.790
 activate the entire industry 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.530
 so what they do is through 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.170
 blocking of the alpha sector and also 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.500
 maximization of the beta sector and 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.090
 ideal profile to maximize 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.190
 fat and therefore the 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.220
 achieve mass percentage 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.070
 very small fat of 45 7% 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.140
 the cost of the networks do as their 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.420
 legal ingredients in most 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.250
 cases and allowed us to seek 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.440
 stimulate the production of 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.360
 neurotransmitter I said adrenaline 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.130
 noradrenaline abhors to 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.700
 later on when they connect to the 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.680
 betat several beta sectors and therefore 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.420
 to maximize fat burning to give 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.500
 classes in some examples like this 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.720
 incidents work for example the 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.020
 caffeine is that it was in the 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.840
 adenosine receptors plant 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.270
 the balance of adrenaline production 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.220
 so for 12 years it has not can not 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:22.210
 use the order to inhibit the production of 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.040
 adrenaline and deep into the urn is 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.810
 maximized turn for example is the 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.090
 other event very plant find 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.190
 thermogenics is a precursor to 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.690
 noradrenaline and dopamine 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.910
 that is necessary for the production 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.430
 these two minutes me comes another 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.100
 example Ukrainian trap of this plant 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.050
 yesterday is a dock is a business too 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.580
 necessary for the production of dopamine 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.410
 just a few examples to show how it is 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.530
 that these ingredients you as the 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.870
 thermogens intend to work 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.860
 therefore the goal is always 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.290
 maximize the expression of actors 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.390
 poets to this way gives order to the 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.200
 body to increase the combustion of 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.060
 fats 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.620
 now the pro- million euro question and 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.360
 do they work 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.850
 well it will depend very very far 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.560
 for each person that people need and 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.840
 that you also know that you have 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.550
 very well how to train thermogenic and 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.980
 know someone else with the same theme 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.870
 there was no hospital effect 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.600
 this is quite subjective enough 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.120
 the principle behind what 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.270
 were people are studied 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.190
 of course there are more effective ingredients in the 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.890
 that other segments with greater support 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.090
 than others and also now 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.790
 It's part of our homework 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.740
 have done every research and and try 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.470
 to find out what ingredients are worth 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.400
 worth finding not have a lot of 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.040
 scientific studies 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.690
 there are some studies that have 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.910
 form the thermogenics, however the largest 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.340
 part of them were sponsored by 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:49.010
 nutritional brands and the product used in 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.810
 study was a product of these 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.180
 I'll leave it here in description link 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.980
 for an article that the end of trafficking in 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.860
 all references 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.470
 bibliographies on this topic 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.450
 in the video only a few guidelines one 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.550
 thermogenics 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.320
 stimulating properties will increase the 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.510
 heart rate and of course this 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.520
 product is not reconcilable individuals who 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.160
 have already had a problem 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.560
 the heart 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.270
 of hypertension and are also 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.140
 not recommended for people with 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.600
 in the thyroid 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:22.420
 some possible side effects are 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.430
 insomnia headaches feeling of 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.470
 malaise nervousness 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.910
 if you are in any of these three 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.760
 was difficult to achieve the 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.920
 document is always important to you 31 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.740
 to vote the product are consuming read 

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.000
 the vote sea and these powers ok 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.660
 the documents can be a good help 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.670
 but have to be taken into conscious 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.080
 everyone is in this video already know that 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.450
 can leave your questions here in the
