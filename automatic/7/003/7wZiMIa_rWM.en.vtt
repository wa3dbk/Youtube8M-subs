00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.090
 There were 161 several hundred motorcycle accidents in NRW this year alone 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.330
 Tote for bikers is just the right weather at the moment but still will be 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.780
 more fun fast becoming a deadly danger and often because of me the passenger 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:14.999
 wrong 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:18.460
 a man from Neuss therefore offers a special driving safety training 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.260
 our reporter Berliner Jens Christ has that for the first time herself 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.179
 at the rear on a motorcycle 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.010
 at pace 250 as a passenger 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.010
 a real thrill Dr 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.150
 but precisely because he or the situation of the country can be real 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.260
 Be relief 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.280
 therefore, such feats should 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.320
 only absolute professionals make 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.630
 Roland the charts on new Germany only race taxi 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.940
 dangerous training for front passenger 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.320
 without the proper protective Vestberg one because on the bike 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.120
 also back protector of the leather suit and gloves that the 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.910
 real heroes are not missing 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.220
 what is the most important things that I have to respect as one but now 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.060
 when they see the two most important things that we do not know how they look 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.090
 hold on to it around me 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.310
 and some people appreciate it 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.980
 and whoever the second would be please always over the inside of my shoulder 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.680
 Look what's going on in the left-hander's turn to look over your shoulder 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.400
 Export brakes then is the automatic sitting position of the upper body 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.660
 at this booth, the others did everything wrong 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.830
 If you are not sure, do not wear protective clothing 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.870
 luckily this ride did not go well, fortunately the accident did not end fatally 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.080
 only on the racetrack extreme situations can be 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.840
 without dangerous oncoming traffic and with enough run-off areas you drive to 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.840
 second, it depends mainly on 1 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.890
 if the driver and the passenger were a lie 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.390
 then it is very easy to move the bike by a 4 though 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.940
 the passenger does not do that 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.930
 you do that legally you can never have learned that 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.760
 then that has extremely negative influences on the curves in extreme cases 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.290
 that too to fall 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.260
 Now it comes to baking movements 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.480
 and forces that the driver can only balance with difficulty 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.479
 Safety training takes one to two days 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.040
 Further information can be found on our website www RTL de 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:20.699
 the subsequent power 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:22.530
 Stay up to date until stiff 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.809
 but at the end it was ok 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:27.649
 because the feeling that you are together on a body of water 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:29.469
 Hundreds of thousands for the normal case 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.430
 as a passenger on the account it is not dangerous 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.339
 if you stick to the rules 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:37.439
 From my point of view, active driving is exhausting 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:42.359
 but then you can also drive on the racetrack with 250 km / h 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:43.840
 really enjoy
