this<00:02:51.569> one<00:02:51.780> because<00:02:51.930> think<00:02:52.530> about<00:02:52.590> ollie

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
this one because think about ollie

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.819 
this one because think about ollie
he<00:02:53.849> he<00:02:54.569> was<00:02:54.720> leaning<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.140> soar<00:02:55.349> for<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.590> long

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
he he was leaning to soar for a long

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.069 
he he was leaning to soar for a long
time<00:02:56.129> he<00:02:56.879> didn't<00:02:57.030> really<00:02:57.180> do<00:02:57.299> that<00:02:57.329> much<00:02:57.480> when

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
time he didn't really do that much when

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.160 
time he didn't really do that much when
he<00:02:58.170> was<00:02:58.260> leading<00:02:58.440> soar<00:02:58.970> so<00:02:59.970> max<00:03:00.540> he<00:03:00.870> actually

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
he was leading soar so max he actually

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.869 
he was leading soar so max he actually
takes<00:03:01.319> the<00:03:01.410> password<00:03:01.799> away<00:03:01.950> from<00:03:02.129> him<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.459> I

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
takes the password away from him and I
