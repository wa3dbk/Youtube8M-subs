00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.099
 dvd criticism in another trailer 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.070
 jack and to the sequel of planet the 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.790
 monkey prevolution that is called planet 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.790
 the monkey prevolution 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.279
 we are together through hell 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.720
 went 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:32.340
 We have four years four years 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.750
 needed to fight the virus and 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.750
 more here to fight us 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.809
 but here you all know how to do it 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.809
 do have 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.289
 I have to know this 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:04.470
 and I want you to know that's here 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.770
 It's not just about power 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.780
 to give us the hope that we 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.780
 rebuild that we have lost 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.649
 I do not know about you but me 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.700
 think the trailer pretty cool 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.079
 I also like planet of the monkeys 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.950
 prevolution and knows that many 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.780
 maybe say okay 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.490
 the planet of the monkeys reidy existed 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.170
 ever why do you need the remake though 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.340
 I think that this first part is one 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.830
 wonderful look and history 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.049
 great before the invasion of the monkeys 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.909
 tells has that in all andy circus 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.770
 somewhere as a leading actor of the same 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.179
 This monkey embodies the one knows 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.130
 also as gollum from lord of the rings one 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.960
 very special kind with the help of 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.119
 motion capturing these animals so too 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.500
 they study half animal half 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.509
 act human and the whole thing 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.250
 I think that looks really unbelievable 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.509
 great and in planet of the monkeys 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.549
 Now prevolution becomes the 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.680
 story 15 years after part of the 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.690
 previous year is now one is this 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.370
 leader of a huge fighting force 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.209
 and the world had as good as conquered it 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.950
 are a few scattered 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.480
 Scientists and people who have it 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.650
 managed to survive this time 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.390
 the earth now looks like one 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.310
 postapocalyptic place not love 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.810
 these scenarios as well as many others where 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.489
 the world simply destroyed that is still 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.560
 There are only a few survivors 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.910
 art the quotes final fight 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.230
 between these monkeys and these 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.930
 man on the one hand endeavors man 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.920
 somehow a peace deal is over 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.720
 created and on the other side 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.430
 there are enough hardliners 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.260
 each one wants to try 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.630
 page extinguish actually a clock 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.239
 human war scenario us 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.590
 packed a year almost 2 fantasy world 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.359
 with a great look like i think if 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.310
 you look alone in trailer and me 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.049
 I think the film can be quite a planet 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.519
 the monkey prevolution brings the century 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.340
 fox expected from 14 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.989
 August 2014 in German cinemas and 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.910
 I am already looking forward to it 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.200
 I really like this one on the strip 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.940
 look and guess that I too 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.290
 not at all wrong with the broad 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.120
 Mass and am therefore very curious what 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.980
 you have to say in the comments whether 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.660
 he also had the feeling with the predecessor 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.859
 I should have thought okay planet 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.510
 the monkey I have to see that now and 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.709
 bavaria from the movie and away because he 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.780
 with optically good was a great 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.250
 had tempo that I hope that there 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.170
 here this successor as well 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.239
 can not keep up with trying too much 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.010
 as a blockbuster therefore to come and to 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.200
 to hug the twelve I liked 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.329
 This year they acs characterize them 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.950
 that there was just this level the deb 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.109
 the night level always there but that 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.799
 just any 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.450
 interpersonal ties the 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.910
 try somewhere deeper into the 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.800
 soul 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.760
 I hope that this part of that 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.390
 Also, I am glad that we can 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.040
 on the 14th 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.390
 august where I am still there a long time 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.220
 but in any case I will be the 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.840
 watch movie in the cinema to tell you if 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.430
 it is worth it or not and until then 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.900
 I want to finish with my trailer now 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.730
 check you like a downline 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.020
 Keep that motto when I am 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.400
 otherwise there are still cinema reviews 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.620
