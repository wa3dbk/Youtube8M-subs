00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.589 
so the nutrients are not gonna be a
hundred<00:02:55.160> percent<00:02:55.459> accurate<00:02:55.550> so<00:02:56.360> don't<00:02:56.510> go

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
hundred percent accurate so don't go

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.180 
hundred percent accurate so don't go
crazy<00:02:56.780> about<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.170> hundred<00:02:57.380> percent<00:02:57.440> we're

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
crazy about the hundred percent we're

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.440 
crazy about the hundred percent we're
not<00:02:58.310> going<00:02:58.550> for<00:02:58.640> perfect<00:02:59.000> here<00:02:59.150> this<00:02:59.300> is<00:02:59.420> a

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
not going for perfect here this is a

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.020 
not going for perfect here this is a
ballpark<00:02:59.930> this<00:03:00.230> is<00:03:00.350> just<00:03:00.560> so<00:03:00.680> you<00:03:00.709> know<00:03:01.069> what

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
ballpark this is just so you know what

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.970 
ballpark this is just so you know what
you're<00:03:02.209> getting<00:03:02.360> roughly<00:03:02.780> because<00:03:03.769> if<00:03:03.890> you

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
you're getting roughly because if you

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.050 
you're getting roughly because if you
don't<00:03:04.069> know<00:03:04.220> where<00:03:04.400> how<00:03:04.489> much<00:03:04.640> fear<00:03:04.880> you<00:03:05.000> are
