 Shootout does not shit castles you want 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.420
 You can kid yourself 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.800

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.800
 if I'm lying 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:38.190
 we had two low at the beginning I will 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.410
 stay in bed but I think I will 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.079
 I will not see where they died from. 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.829
 pen had tried to turn the board 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:51.920
 I said I 'm sorry, I think 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:56.760
 maybe phishing caracas and if it were 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:01:00.199
 if it were mwm www3 stay squeezing and to 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.699
 pretending he's dead could work 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.619
 Good, I'll be paying attention to the 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.350
 steps we'll see if we can 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.229
 listen to something flimsy enemies 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.530
 but I'm not very confident that it will 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.530
 succeed 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:21.689
 Good, I 'm just listening to the crowd. 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:24.840
 from our team and my god started playing 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.880

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.520
 that someone dying I do not know where but what 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:36.590
 they are dying in the position everyone 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.590
 Think of staying here I will not stay here 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:43.340
 button or calm calm and killed the two of us 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.229
 know not only was calm with calm 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.850
 dollar forced to run away 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.680
 oh my god, I'm here 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.079
 You are here and seen and reviewed also behind 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.759
 I'm very afraid of me, very afraid, I'm afraid 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.409
 I will die I will die I will die 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.060
 I'm going to die, too, my God. 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.130
 I'm going to die too for the love of god. 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.920
 kill me does not kill me the way it was 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.850
 fire in the euro zone continues 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.439
 behind me I'm going to have to take him 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.890
 It's because someone goes to someone. 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.890
 it's not common 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.819
 even more relaxing to me someone right but 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.980
 Never know how new I was treated like 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:21.069
 so he has the team still behind 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:23.989
 me even though I'm sure here 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.920
 calm he was a father more it got 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.319
 to function 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.420
 My tactic worked, excuse me more. 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:38.599
 never confirmed a serious thief ever 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:41.569
 Trust the thief I 'm still here. 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.489
 I'm going to stay here, I'm going to focus on 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:48.799
 footsteps will focus on listening to 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:52.660
 see if it will work or penny rum 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:56.080

00:02:52.660 --> 00:03:01.209

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.160
 complicated that I'm a little nervous 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.160
 but the same phenomenon left 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:20.329
 calm calm I do not see anything I 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:23.440
 I'm listening to my left but it's 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:30.650
 very low heat a little too far 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:33.200
 It was in my God, my God, my ear. 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.180

00:03:33.200 --> 00:04:00.620

00:03:35.180 --> 00:04:08.959

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:11.090
