here is where your drills going to go
you<00:00:21.600> can<00:00:21.869> use<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.109> diamond<00:00:22.470> drill<00:00:22.710> like<00:00:23.460> if<00:00:23.580> we

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
you can use the diamond drill like if we

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.700 
you can use the diamond drill like if we
take<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.850> look<00:00:24.119> here<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.990> use<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.350> diamond

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
take a look here and use the diamond

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.250 
take a look here and use the diamond
drill<00:00:25.920> or<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.160> mining<00:00:26.970> drill<00:00:27.240> over<00:00:27.810> here<00:00:28.170> is

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
drill or a mining drill over here is

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.810 
drill or a mining drill over here is
going<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.470> be<00:00:28.560> your<00:00:28.710> scanner<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.519> if<00:00:29.609> we<00:00:29.670> look

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
going to be your scanner so if we look

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.240 
going to be your scanner so if we look
at<00:00:29.910> scanner<00:00:30.179> real<00:00:30.480> quick<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:31.410> can<00:00:31.560> use<00:00:31.710> an<00:00:31.830> avi

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
at scanner real quick you can use an avi

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.299 
at scanner real quick you can use an avi
scanner<00:00:32.640> or<00:00:33.059> an<00:00:33.300> OD<00:00:34.110> scanner<00:00:34.469> an<00:00:34.620> OD<00:00:34.980> scanner

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
scanner or an OD scanner an OD scanner

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.020 
scanner or an OD scanner an OD scanner
takes<00:00:36.120> less<00:00:36.360> energy<00:00:36.600> but<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.800> only<00:00:37.980> does<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.219> 5x5

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
takes less energy but it only does a 5x5

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.770 
takes less energy but it only does a 5x5
area<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.719> then<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.739> V<00:00:41.219> scanner<00:00:41.579> does<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.210> 9<00:00:42.510> by<00:00:42.750> 9

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
area and then a V scanner does a 9 by 9

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.440 
area and then a V scanner does a 9 by 9
area<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.070> put<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.340> scanner<00:00:44.610> here<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
area so you put the scanner here the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.540 
area so you put the scanner here the
drill<00:00:45.690> here<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.140> then<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.620> put<00:00:46.829> mining<00:00:47.280> pipes

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
drill here and then you put mining pipes

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.880 
drill here and then you put mining pipes
in<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.090> middle<00:00:48.450> one<00:00:48.570> right<00:00:50.870> here<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.050> it's

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
in this middle one right here and it's

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.729 
in this middle one right here and it's
six<00:00:53.340> iron<00:00:53.550> plates<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.960> tree<00:00:55.199> tap<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:55.649> eight

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
six iron plates and a tree tap for eight

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.500 
six iron plates and a tree tap for eight
of<00:00:55.890> them<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.760> put<00:00:56.910> those<00:00:57.030> right<00:00:57.270> there<00:00:57.300> in

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
of them and you put those right there in

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.400 
of them and you put those right there in
the<00:00:57.570> middle<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.680> will<00:00:58.890> get<00:00:59.039> going<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.640> the

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
the middle and it will get going so the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.590 
the middle and it will get going so the
actual<00:01:01.410> recipe<00:01:01.890> for<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.399> two<00:01:03.030> circuits<00:01:03.480> a

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
actual recipe for this is two circuits a

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.450 
actual recipe for this is two circuits a
basic<00:01:04.199> machine<00:01:04.470> casing<00:01:04.830> which<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.070> eight<00:01:05.250> iron

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
basic machine casing which is eight iron

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.179 
basic machine casing which is eight iron
plates<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.060> into<00:01:06.390> mining<00:01:06.930> pipes<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.500> then

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
plates and into mining pipes and then

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.120 
plates and into mining pipes and then
for<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.430> OD<00:01:08.700> scanner<00:01:09.140> it's<00:01:10.140> kind<00:01:11.100> of

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
for the OD scanner it's kind of

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.160 
for the OD scanner it's kind of
expensive<00:01:11.580> but<00:01:11.640> takes<00:01:12.210> two<00:01:12.390> gold<00:01:12.630> item

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170

drill is just in mine and drill with
three<00:01:40.650> diamonds<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.250> that's<00:01:42.090> pretty<00:01:42.450> much<00:01:42.630> it

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
three diamonds and that's pretty much it

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.109 
three diamonds and that's pretty much it
for<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.200> recipes<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.549> machine<00:01:44.759> is

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
for the recipes so this machine is

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.770 
for the recipes so this machine is
powered<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:46.079> course<00:01:46.320> by<00:01:46.590> EU<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.450> basic

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
powered of course by EU so the basic

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.920 
powered of course by EU so the basic
setup<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.200> have<00:01:49.229> here<00:01:49.710> now<00:01:50.280> there<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.970> some<00:01:51.600> kind

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
setup I have here now there is some kind

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.780 
setup I have here now there is some kind
of<00:01:52.140> differences<00:01:53.040> with<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.310> different<00:01:53.579> drills

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
of differences with the different drills

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.730 
of differences with the different drills
you<00:01:53.939> can<00:01:54.090> use<00:01:54.210> because<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.869> can<00:01:55.470> use<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
you can use because you can use the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.830 
you can use because you can use the
mining<00:01:56.070> drill<00:01:56.310> or<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.030> diamond<00:01:57.240> drill<00:01:57.659> and

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
mining drill or the diamond drill and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.840 
mining drill or the diamond drill and
how<00:01:58.259> much<00:01:58.409> power<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.890> uses<00:01:59.100> will<00:01:59.460> depend<00:01:59.790> on

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
how much power it uses will depend on

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.030 
how much power it uses will depend on
which<00:01:59.969> drill<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.390> use<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.649> setup<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.009> have

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
which drill you use so the setup I have

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.510 
which drill you use so the setup I have
here<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.460> just<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.880> solar<00:02:03.299> panel<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.840> MFE<00:02:04.710> an<00:02:04.890> MV

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
here is just a solar panel and MFE an MV

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.370 
here is just a solar panel and MFE an MV
transformer<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.390> then<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.840> miner

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
transformer and then a miner

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.360 
transformer and then a miner
so<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.459> env<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.300> can<00:02:09.450> see<00:02:09.660> does<00:02:10.229> 128<00:02:11.039> EU

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
so the env like you can see does 128 EU

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.490 
so the env like you can see does 128 EU
per<00:02:11.640> tick<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.090> that's<00:02:12.780> pretty<00:02:13.080> much<00:02:13.260> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
per tick and that's pretty much the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.910 
per tick and that's pretty much the
least

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
least

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.980 
least
this<00:02:14.099> thing<00:02:14.280> can<00:02:14.490> use<00:02:14.670> for<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.180> diamond<00:02:15.720> drill

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
this thing can use for a diamond drill

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.290 
this thing can use for a diamond drill
it<00:02:16.980> was<00:02:17.099> actually<00:02:17.370> getting<00:02:17.459> charged<00:02:17.880> up<00:02:18.060> there

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
it was actually getting charged up there

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.180 
it was actually getting charged up there
it'll<00:02:18.959> automatically<00:02:19.380> charge<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.770> items<00:02:20.010> for

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
it'll automatically charge the items for

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.070 
it'll automatically charge the items for
you<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.520> don't<00:02:20.640> have<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.790> swap<00:02:21.599> them<00:02:21.810> out<00:02:21.870> or

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
you you don't have to swap them out or

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.380 
you you don't have to swap them out or
anything<00:02:22.230> like<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.860> charge<00:02:23.099> them<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:24.180> if

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
anything like that to charge them so if

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.030 
anything like that to charge them so if
you're<00:02:24.540> using<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.810> regular<00:02:25.140> drill<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.680> can<00:02:25.860> get

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
you're using a regular drill it can get

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.520 
you're using a regular drill it can get
by<00:02:26.190> with<00:02:26.400> about<00:02:26.489> 128<00:02:27.239> you<00:02:27.569> per<00:02:27.720> tick<00:02:27.930> if<00:02:28.080> you're

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
by with about 128 you per tick if you're

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.720 
by with about 128 you per tick if you're
using<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.800> diamond<00:02:29.160> drill<00:02:29.280> you'll<00:02:29.489> probably

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
using a diamond drill you'll probably

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.390 
using a diamond drill you'll probably
want<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.060> supply<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.450> about<00:02:30.630> 256<00:02:31.560> so<00:02:32.130> if<00:02:32.280> we

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
want to supply it about 256 so if we

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.220 
want to supply it about 256 so if we
take<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.580> look<00:02:32.790> at<00:02:33.060> kind<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.569> automation<00:02:33.959> or

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
take a look at kind of the automation or

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.370 
take a look at kind of the automation or
the<00:02:34.290> basic<00:02:34.680> kind<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:35.040> use<00:02:35.459> of<00:02:35.489> this<00:02:35.910> machine

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
the basic kind of use of this machine

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.780 
the basic kind of use of this machine
it's<00:02:37.380> pretty<00:02:37.620> simple<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:38.010> got<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.310> same<00:02:38.520> power

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
it's pretty simple I got the same power

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.030 
it's pretty simple I got the same power
set<00:02:39.030> up<00:02:39.150> here<00:02:39.420> going<00:02:40.050> into<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.350> miner<00:02:40.650> so<00:02:41.010> a

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
set up here going into the miner so a

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.990 
set up here going into the miner so a
solar<00:02:41.489> panel<00:02:41.700> MFE<00:02:42.569> amv<00:02:43.349> transformer<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.310> here

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
solar panel MFE amv transformer and here

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.280 
solar panel MFE amv transformer and here
i<00:02:45.030> have<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.239> chest<00:02:45.569> where<00:02:45.750> it'll<00:02:45.870> actually<00:02:45.989> put

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
i have a chest where it'll actually put

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.170 
i have a chest where it'll actually put
the<00:02:46.410> items<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:46.950> collects<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.550> if<00:02:48.090> we

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
the items that it collects and if we

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.180 
the items that it collects and if we
actually<00:02:48.330> look<00:02:48.600> under<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:48.959> you<00:02:48.989> can<00:02:49.260> see<00:02:49.530> it's

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
actually look under it you can see it's

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.309 
actually look under it you can see it's
making<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.670> little<00:02:50.880> hole<00:02:51.150> all<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.510> way<00:02:51.989> down

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
making a little hole all the way down

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.259 
making a little hole all the way down
and<00:02:53.010> it's<00:02:53.190> going<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.370> go<00:02:53.519> all<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.090> way<00:02:54.120> to

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
and it's going to go all the way to

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.789 
and it's going to go all the way to
until<00:02:55.019> it<00:02:55.140> hits<00:02:55.319> bedrock<00:02:57.290> as<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.500> can<00:02:58.620> see

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
until it hits bedrock as you can see

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.880 
until it hits bedrock as you can see
there<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.900> as<00:03:00.900> it's<00:03:01.200> doing<00:03:01.410> stuff<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.739> will

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
there and as it's doing stuff it will

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.710 
there and as it's doing stuff it will
put<00:03:02.100> items<00:03:02.370> into<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.850> chest<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.330> have<00:03:03.480> next

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
put items into the chest you have next

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.490 
put items into the chest you have next
to<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.069> so<00:03:05.069> that's<00:03:05.280> kind<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:05.790> how<00:03:05.910> you<00:03:05.970> use<00:03:06.269> it

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
to it so that's kind of how you use it

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.690 
to it so that's kind of how you use it
then<00:03:07.500> it's<00:03:07.650> going<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.799> be<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.040> for<00:03:08.400> today's
