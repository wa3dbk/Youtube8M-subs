like you to bring it to media to a

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.399 
like you to bring it to media to a
campaign<00:01:02.039> but<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.760> one<00:01:02.940> we<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:03.840> use<00:01:04.140> them

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
campaign but the one we have we use them

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.270 
campaign but the one we have we use them
but<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.010> not<00:01:05.159> effective<00:01:06.439> the<00:01:07.439> people<00:01:07.770> whatever

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
but is not effective the people whatever

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.179 
but is not effective the people whatever
even<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> president<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:10.530> involved<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.100> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
even the president is involved in the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.330 
even the president is involved in the
campaign<00:01:11.520> but<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:13.020> effects<00:01:13.380> are<00:01:13.560> only<00:01:13.979> five

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
campaign but the effects are only five

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.870 
campaign but the effects are only five
percent<00:01:14.520> or<00:01:14.880> less<00:01:15.090> than<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:16.500> if<00:01:17.189> there<00:01:17.729> is

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
percent or less than that so if there is

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.700 
percent or less than that so if there is
a<00:01:17.909> everything<00:01:18.780> they<00:01:18.930> would<00:01:19.290> be<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.619> other

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
a everything they would be on the other

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.050 
a everything they would be on the other
way<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.310> maybe<00:01:20.580> we<00:01:20.820> could<00:01:21.090> use<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:23.000> can<00:01:24.000> I

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
way so maybe we could use that can I

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.120 
way so maybe we could use that can I
just<00:01:24.270> make<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.780> point<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.140> Sanjeev<00:01:25.619> made<00:01:25.890> I

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
just make a point that Sanjeev made I

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.120 
just make a point that Sanjeev made I
think<00:01:26.490> even<00:01:26.790> Adi<00:01:27.240> made<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.720> earlier<00:01:27.750> but<00:01:28.259> I

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
think even Adi made that earlier but I

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.370 
think even Adi made that earlier but I
think<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.610> whole<00:01:29.820> point<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.509> conveying

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
think the whole point to conveying

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.609 
think the whole point to conveying
information<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:33.060> make<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.570> interesting<00:01:34.140> is

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
information is to make it interesting is

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.679 
information is to make it interesting is
to<00:01:35.430> make<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.880> profitable<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.740> make<00:01:38.040> it

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
to make it profitable and is to make it

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.770 
to make it profitable and is to make it
applicable<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:40.579> whoever<00:01:41.579> whosoever<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.540> are

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
applicable to whoever whosoever you are

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.039 
applicable to whoever whosoever you are
conveying<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.560> information<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.049> when

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
conveying that information to so when

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.420 
conveying that information to so when
you're<00:01:46.170> talking<00:01:46.320> about<00:01:46.530> people<00:01:46.890> when<00:01:47.310> you're

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
you're talking about people when you're

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.620

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
of a problem in this because of you

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.470

being<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.410> temperate<00:02:31.860> country<00:02:32.340> compared<00:02:33.330> to

being a temperate country compared to

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.570 
being a temperate country compared to
most<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.990> India<00:02:34.290> being<00:02:34.470> tropical<00:02:35.010> most<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.460> the

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
most of India being tropical most of the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.340 
most of India being tropical most of the
year<00:02:35.790> so<00:02:35.970> because<00:02:36.270> of<00:02:36.420> your<00:02:36.540> altitude<00:02:36.870> and

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
year so because of your altitude and

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.580 
year so because of your altitude and
your<00:02:37.950> latitude<00:02:38.720> you'll<00:02:39.720> have<00:02:39.870> less<00:02:40.110> problems

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
your latitude you'll have less problems

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.870 
your latitude you'll have less problems
with<00:02:42.350> lack<00:02:43.350> of<00:02:43.590> cleanliness<00:02:43.890> affecting

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
with lack of cleanliness affecting

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.180 
with lack of cleanliness affecting
health<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.720> doesn't<00:02:46.110> mean<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.590> if<00:02:47.070> you

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
health that doesn't mean that if you

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.470 
health that doesn't mean that if you
don't<00:02:47.580> if<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:48.030> do<00:02:48.900> clean<00:02:49.200> up<00:02:49.230> you'll<00:02:49.890> also

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
don't if you do clean up you'll also

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.000 
don't if you do clean up you'll also
have<00:02:51.480> great<00:02:51.780> advantages<00:02:52.110> but<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:52.680> think

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
have great advantages but I think

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.770 
have great advantages but I think
temperate<00:02:53.400> countries<00:02:53.850> tend<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.209> have<00:02:54.420> fewer

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
temperate countries tend to have fewer

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.600 
temperate countries tend to have fewer
problems<00:02:55.080> of<00:02:56.900> of<00:02:57.900> this<00:02:58.200> sort<00:02:58.500> than<00:02:59.100> tropical

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
problems of of this sort than tropical

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.270 
problems of of this sort than tropical
countries<00:03:00.000> like<00:03:00.180> India<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.860> don't

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
countries like India and and and don't

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.920 
countries like India and and and don't
worry<00:03:02.489> even<00:03:02.730> if<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:03.150> don't<00:03:03.330> have<00:03:03.480> film<00:03:03.690> stars

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
worry even if you don't have film stars

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.449 
worry even if you don't have film stars
