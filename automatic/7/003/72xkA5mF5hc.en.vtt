00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.850
 next we will be carbon 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:09.160
 the each player is the one in charge of 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.100
 administers the correct amount of 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.810
 fuel to the engine 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.810
 powered by the accelerator 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.789
 As you can see, it 's trimmed to 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.300
 can adjust the motor to the frame of the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.300
 bike 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.620
 near players and it's one that no 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.620
 very easy 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.990
 we remove the air filter 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.539
 We can see 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.769
 the sponge that enters the air of 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:49.769
 Exterior 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.210
 so that the engine can get 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.210
 no one more pure 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.990
 and prevent particles from entering 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:08.270
 in the system we can see the lever 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:11.409
 motor boom 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.409
 its operation 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.689
 be up because motors the cold leave 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.130
 spend less air and cut down 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:23.850
 pass all the complete air 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.840
 I can see the entry of 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.840
 gasoline 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.550
 where does the gasoline enter the carburetor 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.020
 We can see 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.090
 that's pretty simple 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.350
 a float and the tub inlet 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.730
 fuel and here we have a screw 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.810
 to clean the carburetor 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.020
 then fuel 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.570
 they go up 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.360
 and to lecture this closes the key 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.040
 then we can see the 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.310
 mechanism 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.830
 between fuel for ski 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.239
 then to fill the float triggers 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.150
 this and it will be the key so that it does not enter 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:31.129
 more fuel 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.129
 meanwhile the fuel 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:41.540
 it's flowing because it's here it goes up and 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:44.439
 plugged in by the engine along with the air 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.439
 towards this side 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.850
 now the accelerator system 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.850
 it's simple too 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.580
 consist of the opening door 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.520
 the carburetor needle 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.520
 and they hover us in training 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.659
 is going to haunt a way to have this 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.659
 mode 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.470
 and on the needle 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.750
 of this magician 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.360
 but for the moment 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.140
 without peeling off the accelerator 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.370
 to light them equal simple 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.490
 but not 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:15.210
 we simply coordinate this the 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.210
 gate with the filter 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.790
 note 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:40.500
 we do consider 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.530
 in charge of the simplest 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.450
 is we reflect the engine a little bit to 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.880
 to be able to make ice cream in very 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.900
 compact then we have one side the 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.770
 motor removed 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.770
 the truly 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.660
 Y 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.410
 and draw it is very important to push up 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.690
 the bottom of the carburetor so there's no 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.690
 air leaks between the engine carbon 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.620
 we place the heart 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.140
 and it's just as important that the 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.040
 carburetor work as vertical 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.410
 possible 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.570
 since how it works by gravity 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.910
 go down near the exit of the creator of 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:02.650
 gas without cargo we go exactly 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.650
 Vertical can the oil leaks 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.930
 we put the plane 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:41.620
 once with the carburetor installed already 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:43.659
 we can say and secure the engine by 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.470
 the walls we tighten all the plates 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:46.470
 that insure the engine 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.759
 appreciate the integrating engine 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:04.830
 can observe at all points 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.900
 where there is metal by mental put a 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.020
 little rubber to reduce the 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.020
 vibrations
