I<00:00:13.139> did<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.500> little<00:00:13.679> Overhaulin<00:00:14.400> on<00:00:14.580> my<00:00:14.929> 450<00:00:15.929> l

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
I did a little Overhaulin on my 450 l

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.090 
I did a little Overhaulin on my 450 l
this<00:00:17.340> also<00:00:17.699> will<00:00:18.000> apply<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.359> any<00:00:18.840> other

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
helicopter or brand and down here I have

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.849 
helicopter or brand and down here I have
a<00:00:24.240> couple<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.689> bearings<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.410> was<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:25.769> the

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
a couple of bearings this was in the

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.509 
a couple of bearings this was in the
main<00:00:26.070> bearing<00:00:26.550> block<00:00:26.880> on<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.630> top<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.519> this

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
main bearing block on the top and this

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.749 
main bearing block on the top and this
one<00:00:29.760> was<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.240> detail<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.470> if<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.160> take<00:00:32.369> your

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
one was in detail and if you take your

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.520 
one was in detail and if you take your
finger<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.360> hold<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.780> mean<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.050> turn<00:00:34.290> them

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
finger and you hold I mean you turn them

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.990 
finger and you hold I mean you turn them
and<00:00:34.829> I'm<00:00:34.980> not<00:00:35.130> going<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.340> bother<00:00:35.489> doing<00:00:35.820> it

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
and I'm not going to bother doing it

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.950 
and I'm not going to bother doing it
because<00:00:36.180> you're<00:00:36.300> not<00:00:36.329> going<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.690> be<00:00:36.750> able<00:00:36.809> to

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
because you're not going to be able to

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.229 
because you're not going to be able to
hear<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.320> through<00:00:37.770> them<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.280> microphone<00:00:38.910> here

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
hear it through them the microphone here

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.110 
hear it through them the microphone here
on<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.450> camera<00:00:39.719> but<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:41.100> might<00:00:41.520> be<00:00:41.670> able<00:00:41.790> to

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
on the camera but you might be able to

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.470 
on the camera but you might be able to
but<00:00:42.390> anyways<00:00:42.809> I'm<00:00:42.989> holding<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.410> camera<00:00:43.440> so

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
but anyways I'm holding the camera so

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.000 
but anyways I'm holding the camera so
take<00:00:45.480> my<00:00:45.660> word<00:00:45.899> these<00:00:46.140> are<00:00:46.289> no<00:00:46.440> good<00:00:46.710> there

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
take my word these are no good there

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.190 
take my word these are no good there
they<00:00:47.340> have<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> crunchy<00:00:48.300> sound<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.899> them<00:00:49.050> and

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
they have a crunchy sound to them and

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.600 
they have a crunchy sound to them and
when<00:00:49.320> they're<00:00:49.440> not<00:00:49.590> smooth<00:00:50.010> when<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.370> take

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
when they're not smooth when you take

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.040 
when they're not smooth when you take
them<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:50.969> move<00:00:51.149> them<00:00:51.360> with<00:00:51.480> your<00:00:51.660> finger

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
them and you move them with your finger

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.500 
them and you move them with your finger
the<00:00:52.379> inside<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.699> can<00:00:53.730> hear<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.180> making<00:00:54.449> a

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
the inside and you can hear it making a

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.130 
the inside and you can hear it making a
crunching<00:00:54.989> sound<00:00:55.050> or<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.890> hear<00:00:56.100> odd<00:00:56.340> sounds

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
crunching sound or you hear odd sounds

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.049 
crunching sound or you hear odd sounds
in<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.260> helicopter<00:00:58.949> sometimes<00:00:59.399> guys<00:00:59.699> think

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
in the helicopter sometimes guys think

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.959 
in the helicopter sometimes guys think
that<00:01:00.120> torque<00:01:00.570> tube<00:01:01.100> gears<00:01:02.100> are<00:01:02.309> stripped<00:01:02.340> or

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
that torque tube gears are stripped or

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.520 
that torque tube gears are stripped or
missing<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.390> tooth<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.989> that's<00:01:04.170> why<00:01:04.350> you're

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
missing a tooth and that's why you're

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.020 
missing a tooth and that's why you're
getting<00:01:04.769> those<00:01:04.860> sounds<00:01:05.309> but<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> lot<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.820> time

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
getting those sounds but a lot of time

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.980 
getting those sounds but a lot of time
it's<00:01:06.240> because<00:01:06.600> these<00:01:06.750> are<00:01:06.930> no<00:01:07.049> good<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:09.030> you

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
it's because these are no good and you

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.039 
it's because these are no good and you
can<00:01:10.350> definitely<00:01:11.270> you<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.420> definitely<00:01:12.840> hear

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
can definitely you can definitely hear

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.060 
can definitely you can definitely hear
by<00:01:13.290> turning<00:01:13.770> them<00:01:13.890> guys<00:01:15.619> let<00:01:16.619> me<00:01:16.710> put<00:01:16.920> this

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
by turning them guys let me put this

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.580 
by turning them guys let me put this
camera<00:01:17.400> down<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.060> see<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.950> don't<00:01:19.950> think<00:01:21.590> might

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
camera down and see I don't think might

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.010 
camera down and see I don't think might
be<00:01:22.799> able<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.250> hear<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.729> put<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.570> right<00:01:24.600> near<00:01:24.900> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
be able to hear it put it right near the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.210 
be able to hear it put it right near the
microphone<00:01:30.110> you<00:01:31.110> might<00:01:31.619> be<00:01:31.799> able<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.979> hear

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
microphone you might be able to hear

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.929 
microphone you might be able to hear
that<00:01:32.400> little<00:01:32.610> bit<00:01:32.850> of

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.779 

I'll<00:01:39.749> puke<00:01:39.929> a<00:01:40.229> little<00:01:40.259> see<00:01:41.219> when<00:01:41.399> it's<00:01:41.549> up<00:01:41.670> a

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
I'll puke a little see when it's up a

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.200 
I'll puke a little see when it's up a
little<00:01:41.939> bit<00:01:43.130> they<00:01:44.130> are<00:01:44.189> making<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.759> crunching

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
little bit they are making a crunching

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.809 
little bit they are making a crunching
sound<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.780> they're<00:01:45.929> no<00:01:46.109> good<00:01:46.140> but<00:01:46.890> anyways<00:01:47.310> to

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819 
sound so they're no good but anyways to

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:52.789 
sound so they're no good but anyways to
not<00:01:47.969> drag<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.299> video<00:01:48.810> out<00:01:49.280> I<00:01:51.500> upgraded<00:01:52.500> those

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
not drag this video out I upgraded those

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.800 
not drag this video out I upgraded those
bearings<00:01:53.340> both<00:01:53.969> of<00:01:54.209> them<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.479> bearing

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
bearings both of them in the bearing

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.449 
bearings both of them in the bearing
blocks<00:01:55.109> and<00:01:55.969> back<00:01:56.969> here<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.920> in<00:01:58.920> either<00:01:59.159> side

00:01:59.449 --> 00:01:59.459 
blocks and back here and in either side

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.740 
blocks and back here and in either side
of<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.759> tail<00:01:59.969> casing<00:02:00.569> and<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.409> upgraded<00:02:01.890> those

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
of the tail casing and I upgraded those

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.109 
of the tail casing and I upgraded those
with<00:02:04.039> ceramic<00:02:05.039> bearings<00:02:05.280> I've<00:02:05.670> been<00:02:05.819> wanting

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
with ceramic bearings I've been wanting

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.990 
with ceramic bearings I've been wanting
to<00:02:06.149> try<00:02:06.299> them<00:02:06.599> for<00:02:06.840> years<00:02:07.369> I've<00:02:08.369> heard<00:02:08.640> very

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
to try them for years I've heard very

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.699 
to try them for years I've heard very
good<00:02:09.060> things<00:02:09.239> about<00:02:09.569> them<00:02:09.929> they<00:02:10.080> last<00:02:10.349> longer

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
good things about them they last longer

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.080 
good things about them they last longer
they<00:02:10.890> can<00:02:10.950> withstand<00:02:11.250> heat

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
they can withstand heat

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:21.309 
bearing blocks and then the tailback
they're<00:03:16.250> in<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.459> book<00:03:17.669> here<00:03:18.000> those<00:03:18.419> are<00:03:19.880> three

times eight times three millimeter okay
and<00:03:26.489> I'm<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.299> spoiled<00:03:27.930> this<00:03:28.109> thing<00:03:28.349> a<00:03:28.410> little

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
and I'm I spoiled this thing a little

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.530 
and I'm I spoiled this thing a little
bit<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:28.919> boy<00:03:29.010> is<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:29.400> quiet<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.060> boy<00:03:30.329> is<00:03:30.510> it

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.250 
bit and boy is it quiet and boy is it
smooth<00:03:31.049> guys<00:03:31.410> so<00:03:32.540> definitely<00:03:33.540> something<00:03:34.079> to

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
smooth guys so definitely something to

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.759 
smooth guys so definitely something to
think<00:03:34.290> about

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
think about

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.520 
think about
I<00:03:35.040> got<00:03:35.430> themed<00:03:35.810> let's<00:03:36.810> see<00:03:36.989> those<00:03:37.200> were<00:03:37.379> from

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
I got themed let's see those were from

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.789 
I got themed let's see those were from
Healy<00:03:37.889> direct<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.910> I<00:03:39.030> think<00:03:39.299> that<00:03:39.510> each<00:03:39.799> set

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
Healy direct and I think that each set

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.190 
Healy direct and I think that each set
of<00:03:41.010> two<00:03:41.280> was<00:03:41.609> about<00:03:41.730> seven<00:03:42.269> dollars<00:03:42.450> so<00:03:42.959> for

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
of two was about seven dollars so for

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.719 
of two was about seven dollars so for
$14<00:03:44.099> you<00:03:44.280> can<00:03:44.459> do<00:03:44.639> it<00:03:45.349> this<00:03:46.349> the<00:03:46.739> stock<00:03:47.340> ones

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:47.729 
$14 you can do it this the stock ones

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:49.460 
$14 you can do it this the stock ones
that<00:03:48.000> come<00:03:48.180> in<00:03:48.329> or<00:03:48.449> a<00:03:48.479> little<00:03:48.780> bit<00:03:48.930> cheaper

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
that come in or a little bit cheaper

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.199 
that come in or a little bit cheaper
there<00:03:49.620> maybe<00:03:49.769> two<00:03:50.100> three<00:03:50.430> think<00:03:51.000> these<00:03:51.150> are

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
there maybe two three think these are

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.470 
there maybe two three think these are
like<00:03:51.389> $4.99

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
like $4.99

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.729 
like $4.99
and<00:03:52.690> those<00:03:52.870> are<00:03:53.050> like<00:03:53.200> $2.99<00:03:53.440> but<00:03:55.709> where<00:03:56.709> I

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
and those are like $2.99 but where I

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.430 
and those are like $2.99 but where I
work<00:03:57.190> in<00:03:57.400> the<00:03:57.550> aircraft<00:03:57.670> industry<00:03:58.260> overall<00:03:59.260> in

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
jet engines guys we use ceramic inserts

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.890 
jet engines guys we use ceramic inserts
to<00:04:07.090> cut<00:04:07.300> steel<00:04:07.780> and<00:04:08.400> ceramic<00:04:09.400> it<00:04:10.120> can<00:04:10.420> get<00:04:10.660> like

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
to cut steel and ceramic it can get like

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.759 
to cut steel and ceramic it can get like
as<00:04:11.290> hot<00:04:11.620> as<00:04:11.800> the<00:04:11.950> Sun<00:04:12.280> I<00:04:12.670> mean<00:04:13.239> glowing<00:04:13.840> red-hot

and keep on cutting right through steel

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.680 
and keep on cutting right through steel
it's<00:04:17.859> it's<00:04:18.250> tougher<00:04:18.790> it's<00:04:19.209> an<00:04:19.450> awesome
