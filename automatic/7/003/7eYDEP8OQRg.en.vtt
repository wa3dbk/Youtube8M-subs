00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.490
 simple master class on making 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.490
 biphasic makeup remover 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.790
 The main components of this tool are 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.950
 water and base oil as water 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:35.100

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.640

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.040
 roses 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.989
 be careful some hydrolat 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.920
 can pinch their eyes so first they 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.500
 need to try

 faith dry extracts and so on in 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.180
 quality base oils are great 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.550

 sesame seed and so on that 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.329
 As for the preservative, the best 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.430
 use water soluble because 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.080
 it should be added to the aqueous phase 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.899
 where bacteria usually grows 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.850
 can make funds without preservative 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.640
 but be sure to observe 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.680
 make sterility of instruments and containers 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.110

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.410

 dissolves in water and does not float 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.869

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.709
 one bottle 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.950
