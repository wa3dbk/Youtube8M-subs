00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.090
 hello to all of you 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.660
 sorry for the delay to measure this 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.010
 week really so from 30 to 30 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.779
 January to February 1st 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.490
 I did a little bit late I had 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.859
 small worries of insomnia and it's 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.240
 that they have shifted all this so he 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.499
 is 18 o'clock I make you the video on 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.789
 youtube so normally there is not 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:27.320
 badly of them who already know where he 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.480
 is but in case you do it when 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.849
 even so on this week 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.060
 he's here and unfortunately it's a 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:37.850
 bad week so that on so who 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.720
 sells the dragon's breath so their 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.830
 quest I told you about 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.110
 by the way last Sunday we have 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.540
 tribal tendencies and asked my opinion my 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.310
 opinion has not changed except that it 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.440
 may contain three ammunition and that it 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.510
 is very funny it's a good weapon 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.830
 funny if we have it on the win but 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.660
 buy it is another story 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.550
 if you have if you have plenty of 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.960
 parts do not bother you there is no 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.210
 worries buy there if you have not 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.330
 but otherwise keep your pieces since 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.980
 it's a rocket that's more 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.170
 who will do like the grenades of 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.880
 the arca even that and it's kind of fat 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.640
 fireball that stays in place 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.520
 and suddenly it's very it's a rock and 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.340
 strategic that separates offensive quest 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.080
 as we would like as we would like with 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.640
 a rocket launcher or just one by 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.190
 compared to a feint of krypton a gala 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.900
 barnes has nothing to do so it's funny 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.420
 it's very funny to have fun 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.710
 even the art design but funny in 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.400
 more if they smoke when you have it in 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.620
 the back etc 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.180
 it's funny but outside of that 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.450
 it's not it's not a good your quests 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.610
 as in the sense of the rocket launcher 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.320
 knows then the fire protocol 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.450
 stellar arcana is still a 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.610
 once we decidedly that increases the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.000
 ammunition capacity of heavy weapons 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.470
 that's a good thing do not touch me 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.409
 not so take it if you do not have 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.990
 the gloves for for the hunter who 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.580
 allow for this lot very easily 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.630
 the first stage of the raid even in 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.210
 difficult 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.670
 I'm doing them the day before yesterday so 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.320
 there are no worries you take this and 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.110
 then suddenly if you have the helmet of the 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.369
 raid it's perfect of course I hope that 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.450
 you have loot and I do not have 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.909
 so again I have to go 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.500
 31 and so you become invisible when 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:14.060
 you are affected by for example by 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.770
 a slave is really the typical case 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.220
 who puts you a claw 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.540
 you will pass 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.250
 if you have increase in duration 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.560
 invisibility effects it's going to be 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.260
 perfect so really these wines are very 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.110
 very well and then the mk 44 we got 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.460
 already seen so not so long ago that they 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.360
 increase to capesterre ammunition 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.740
 weapons and no I even believe they 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.140
 were last week even at 44 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.760
 etc or polders longer is 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.830
 not the most armor piece 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.280
 interesting of the world especially that it is 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.460
 boots 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.910
 So I do not recommend this purchase the 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.830
 really do not touch me without 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.990
 the most interesting element of this 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.370
 week in gram of two arms so 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.450
 do not hesitate if you want to have a 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.810
 little bit of luck maybe that can 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.610
 pass 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.800
 you see I have not enough particular 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.630
 to test exotic shine for this 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.950
 strange piece 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.640
 then we come to the improvements 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.320
 equipment 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.270
 so I repeat since asked me to 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.670
 repeat you must have the equipment 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.170
 more for example for this channel so the 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.490
 third man mas the exotic shine 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.410
 and to that humans will be able 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.330
 improve that is to say make it 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.770
 a level of light 36 which was 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.240
 not the case before the dlc if you have it 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.709
 had before the gall know but that's it 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.550
 the interest of these improvements 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.170
 so we have the arms dadame carats for the 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.670
 hunter and the helmet of the third man 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.830
 which is also very good for the 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.910
 last step of croo opta the box of 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.560
 family inside again very 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.160
 well for the last stage of group 1 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.730
 and the crest of alpha lupi the skull lady 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.050
 carats for the arcana east elegant 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.190
 solar milk that you must know everything 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.410
 if you play arca because they are 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.690
 released 4 billion times before dlc 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.920
 a bit like the fire protocol 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.209
 stellar they really want some 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.580
 stellar fire protocols on us 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.470
 I do not know rising sweat 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.720
 the thistle the universal remote 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.700
 eternity in your pocket the icebreaker at that 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.840
 is going to be very practical and supreme council 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.459
 so on to the thistles and icebreaker this 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.380
 would be interesting to increase if you 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.690
 have them and are still in 302 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.000
 damage for the passes and 1 331 do not need 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.220
 hesitate telemetry so telemetry 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.549
 rifle revolvers the fusion of 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.560
 blue and green motor rocket launcher me 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.739
 I 'm just taking a small telemetry 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.669
 two shot revolvers because it can 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.669
 to be very practical 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.710
 so here is rather a week not 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.360
 not top top for gurs 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.889
 the breath of the dragon he has it in addition 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.449
 already sold since if it was the 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.100
 first time why not that helps 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.300
 do the collection there is not the case 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.220
 the dragon's breath I think it's 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.090
 first item he had sold to the 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.220
 exit from the dlc 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.300
 so it's not it's not crazy and then 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.740
 for the people we talk about it is 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.330
 it's starting to get a bit complicated 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.460
 since it is true that there for example 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.740
 it is that the equipment of the dlc is 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.539
 not very cool for people 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.669
 compare the dlc and I hope they go 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.139
 they will settle this for the next I 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.940
 I'm not sure it's not in their 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.440
 optics in my opinion huh they want that 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.150
 you buy aces and it makes sense 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.789
 and how it works 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.349
 he does not miss it unfortunately so 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:59.759
 so here I hope that this video you 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:02.490
 will have given a little more info study 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:04.919
 less the opinion on the breath of the dragon that 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.110
 so I do not recommend you buy it not 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.699
 if you can imagine it's good if you 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.139
 have enough rooms it's fine but 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.970
 otherwise we did not spend your coins 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.680
 station deadlines and I find again from the 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.680
 next week for the next 15h
