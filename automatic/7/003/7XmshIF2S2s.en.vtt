00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.610
 hello everyone I am elena of engadget and today 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.390
 we have in our operating table 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.130
 to the galaxy knots this terminal was 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.290
 submitted we passed September live 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.030
 has been willing to demonstrate that second 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.210
 parts and that can be good 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.210
 do not 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.560
 arguments for it certainly does not 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.210
 so the new Korean power is missing 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.250
 He comes to us with a data sheet 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.780
 thought to detail so you do not miss 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.970
 of nothing perhaps the most obvious change 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.379
 of its renewed design that brings it 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.350
 much more to stress than in a car 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.000
 original a decision that may not be 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.530
 everyone's taste but at least follow 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.210
 contributes to blind 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.110
 since now he has lost some 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.380
 millimeters in thickness and also in width 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.380
 do not 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.900
 our protagonist also seems to have 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.000
 born with the firm intention of 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.680
 respond to the order that another pocket does not 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.610
 only for its imposing size percent 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.270
 with five inches 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.570
 but also for an optimistic price of 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.570
 659 euros 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.630
 as always we are going to take a little step 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.160
 where is everything and in its part 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.740
 frontal because we find ourselves with a 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.010
 105-inch super amoled hd screen 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.100
 with white polos and a resolution of 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.659
 1280 x 720 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.250
 up we have a new led 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.560
 notifications a couple of action on if 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.149
 the front camera of the ship 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.790
 and finally a little bit below 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:36.020
 we have the classic android button panel 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.759
 true to his style of always samsung has 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.009
 I preferred not to overburden if 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.850
 laterals having only here 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.850
 the volume control 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.320
 in the lower part of the cargo port 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.320
 and the slot to insert your stem 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.380
 power button 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:05.300
 and the port and finally its part 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.179
 back receives its main camera of 8 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.179
 megapixels with led flash as well as 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.740
 the most juicy of the team is in 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.380
 its interior since it mounts a processor 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.770
 Exynos quad-core two chairs 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.120
 Mali 400 graphics and doors a combo that 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.120
 it was absolutely with everything 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.959
 the rudder of the lime boat knows how to dine 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:45.120
 411 and the camouflage email of the dance amen of 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.120
 portable and subtitling naturalists 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.980
 like good galactic is not imputable this 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.819
 he forgets to include a good 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.819
 collection of gestures 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.830
 voice knowledge through gestures 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.230
 nor his acquaintance capable of video 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.549
 do not believe that the sea ​​never maría 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.480
 deductions presented by the car cen 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.480
 we forgot to take a look 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.290
 And there are many improvements and 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.340
 uses that can show the new this that 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.980
 we would almost need an analysis 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.569
 exclusive for the lonely and advance is 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.670
 all the crusades in the text of the 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.870
 analysis of advances since and what 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.180
 same is going to serve you to perform 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.180
 catch that to write 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.150
 improvised on the boat 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.349
 after having had 'the knots with 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:02.569
 Header team for a few days

 and you think he has defended the 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.290
 charms of a hundred cars or that of having a 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.960
