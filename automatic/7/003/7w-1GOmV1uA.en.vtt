in the last 30 days alone we have

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
a trillion dollar deficit it was

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.670 
a trillion dollar deficit it was
actually<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.270> billion<00:02:00.780> dollar<00:02:00.960> deficit<00:02:01.530> and

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
actually a billion dollar deficit and

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.380 
actually a billion dollar deficit and

not only did he not make cuts but he

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.090 
not only did he not make cuts but he
