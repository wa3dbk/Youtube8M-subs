00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 Hi everyone guys and welcome this 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:09.540
 brand new video today we are here with the 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:11.219
 review of my galaxy s 4 first 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.349
 what we see unboxing that by the way 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.299
 of I can not do because it is not new is 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.279
 one of my phone for about a year 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.199
 what heaven I cannot give considerations 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.199
 on the box that contains this galaxy 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.000
 s 4 is a box like most 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.500
 samsung devices such as le 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.519
 its three as well as the telephone operators 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.160
 economic that they have to this 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.660
 faux wood covering 100 by 100 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.850
 recyclable inside we find 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.010
 headphone charger instructions 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.899
 obviously it's the warranty considerations 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.399
 aesthetic of this smartphone and let's see 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.420
 on the front the thing that you 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.760
 I like the thing that struck me most 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.820
 more than this phone is that it 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.230
 screen covers the whole body almost 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.629
 all its caramants there are some 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.399
 a few millimeters from the right side 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.320
 of the left side in the part in 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.629
 low instead we find the capacitive keys 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.460
 that I am the one for ie for the least and 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.770
 the right one to turn back the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.449
 our android system at the center 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.100
 we find the home button and above 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.180
 we find various sensors and there are and 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.949
 to the camera 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.240
 let's talk about dimensions as height 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:12.900
 we have 136.6 mm as we have width 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.729
 69.8 mm as thickness we have 729 mm one 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.680
 once turned the phone we can see 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.960
 immediately flash the camera and in 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.970
 low on the left we find the speaker 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.750
 open the back cover we find one 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.729
 slot for microsd expandable up to 64gb 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.770
 a nigro card of your operator 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.409
 and the battery that has a battery of di 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.200
 political autonomy of conversation and 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.799
 1020 minutes standby time around 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.840
 320 hours and 2600 milian how memory 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.610
 we have an internal memory of 32gb and 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.869
 as already mentioned that can be expanded up 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.490
 at 64 gb 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.500
 the big display I was talking about 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.320
 at the beginning we have a super amoled of 5 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.930
 1920 x 1080 inches here we have one 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.159
 full hd screen with 16 million colors 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.350
 but let's move on to the ignition of 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.799
 device as operating system but 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.270
 we have an android 4.2.2 jelly bean that 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.140
 leaves the factory 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.140
 but this is what this is me 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.119
 updated to 4.4 which is the kat kit 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.310
 the touchwiz graphic setup e 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.530
 let's do a cpi ze for immediately 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.319
 check our can the ram 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.720
 we have a qualcomm snapdragon 600 from 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.209
 1.9 gigahertz quad core 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.430
 the minimum clock speed is 384 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.340
 mega hertz instead the maximum obviously 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.430
 of 1.9 gigahertz in total we have 2 gb 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.350
 of ram though that would be real 1817 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.690
 mega comes a rear camera from 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.430
 13 megapixel with LED flash 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.850
 the maximum resolution beautiful photos and 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:41.420
 3.096 for 4 thousand 128 pixels the resolution 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.760
 maximum for videos and 1920 x 1080 fps 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.390
 maximum for videos and 30 frames per 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.010
 second 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.720
 now let's go with the test of the 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.880
 rear camera practically 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.290
 let's take an interior photo like this 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.830
 what you are seeing is a picture in 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.830
 external 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.750
 then we do a live test inside 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:22.330
 this is an indoor video with light 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.110
 natural light bulb how much is coming 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:34.299
 external 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:38.459
 this instead a video in a starry liso 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.459
 automatic automatic exposure 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.670
 this instead a video recorded with the 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.670
 inter camera 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.100
 instead we make two other texts that are 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.080
 videos in love light then pd con 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.960
 poor light this is a video shot with 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.480
 low quantity of lights and I take this opportunity 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.180
 to make you feel like the microphone of 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.510
 64 and then we take a picture with little 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.510
 light 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.880
 I must say that it is really excellent 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.800
 quality both video and photos that anyway 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.260
 has been greatly improved in the galaxy s 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.109
 5 final consideration is the price 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.000
 this is a very good phone only 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.130
 however the battery that you know that sins 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.230
 in all smartphones that does not last long 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.550
 however, at the end of the day it is possible 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.860
 to arrive obviously without with 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.750
 additional boxes that I don't even have 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.430
 wanted to talk about it because I didn't even 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.830
 never used 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.360
 like the nfc I used this 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:38.190
 sometimes then there is the wifi router sb 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.940
 the intelligent sliding and managers 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.860
 are pretty nice things though that me 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.810
 however, I consider them less important 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.310
 to have in a 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.780
 a cell phone because things no longer 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.970
 however important to navigate on 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.700
 internet for five research a 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:57.990
 read emails shopping on amazon 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:00.180
 ebay these we say my use of 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.460
 this smartphone to match from 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.710
 match the 64 jig the memory of santa 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.080
 4gb laughing the phone becomes 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.850
 its super-fast responses 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.490
 all the apps what you can 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.919
 move to external memory and then 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.540
 to have a much more system 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.540
 quickly 2gb of ram 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.010
 this makes the difference in the price of 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.770
 when I'm recording the video it's from 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.540
 about 370 euro price has been taken 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.160
 from hamas but could vary in various 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.900
 stores such as the expert 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.010
 euronics etc. 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.120
 no kids i thank you for 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.770
 attention and I hope this 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.930
 review was helpful 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.220
 see a beautiful I like for this 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.990
 first review because the first 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.360
 review I do from tips topics 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.970
 in the comments if I did something wrong though 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.250
 there is something more to say and nothing 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:47.930
 supported the boys by writing the channel 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.930
 is the see you next video bye
