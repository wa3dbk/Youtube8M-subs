comic-con I guess and if you don't vote
for<00:00:21.480> Barack<00:00:21.689> Obama<00:00:22.080> you're<00:00:22.320> insane<00:00:22.740> because

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
for Barack Obama you're insane because

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.250 
for Barack Obama you're insane because
without<00:00:23.850> him<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.390> think<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:24.779> middle<00:00:25.050> class

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
without him I think that middle class

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.470 
without him I think that middle class
will<00:00:25.500> completely<00:00:25.949> disappear<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.240> look

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
will completely disappear and you look

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.210 
will completely disappear and you look
at<00:00:27.689> Romney<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.529> I'm<00:00:28.619> sure<00:00:28.800> he's<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.010> nice<00:00:29.160> guy

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
at Romney and I'm sure he's a nice guy

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.460 
at Romney and I'm sure he's a nice guy
but<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.670> think<00:00:30.000> he's<00:00:30.119> like<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.480> thing<00:00:30.779> he<00:00:31.320> only
