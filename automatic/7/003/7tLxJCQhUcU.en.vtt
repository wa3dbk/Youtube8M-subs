00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.120 

reason<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:09.780> think<00:00:09.960> dinosaur<00:00:10.380> State<00:00:10.590> Park<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:10.980> so

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
reason I think dinosaur State Park is so

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.799 
reason I think dinosaur State Park is so
important<00:00:11.550> is<00:00:11.639> because<00:00:11.700> it's<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.179> very<00:00:12.210> unique

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
important is because it's a very unique

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.550 
important is because it's a very unique
Park<00:00:13.969> it's<00:00:14.969> unlike<00:00:15.389> any<00:00:15.660> other<00:00:15.900> Park<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.470> it's

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
Park it's unlike any other Park and it's

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.990 
Park it's unlike any other Park and it's
one<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.890> few<00:00:17.130> places<00:00:17.340> where<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.760> can

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
one of the few places where you can

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.679 
one of the few places where you can
actually<00:00:18.029> see<00:00:18.949> dinosaur<00:00:19.949> footprints<00:00:20.689> exactly

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
actually see dinosaur footprints exactly

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.320 
actually see dinosaur footprints exactly
in<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.900> place<00:00:22.109> where<00:00:22.920> they<00:00:23.010> were<00:00:23.070> made

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
in the place where they were made

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.550 
in the place where they were made
usually<00:00:24.330> when<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.570> go<00:00:24.689> into<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.990> museum<00:00:25.109> you

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
usually when you go into a museum you

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.960 
usually when you go into a museum you
see<00:00:25.769> things<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.160> have<00:00:26.279> been<00:00:26.400> collected<00:00:26.880> from

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
see things that have been collected from

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.700 
see things that have been collected from
many<00:00:27.150> different<00:00:27.420> places<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.140> they're<00:00:28.590> all

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
many different places and they're all

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.980 
many different places and they're all
brought<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.250> place<00:00:29.580> but<00:00:30.210> dinosaur<00:00:30.779> State

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
brought to a place but dinosaur State

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.380 
brought to a place but dinosaur State
Park<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.380> about<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.980> place<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:33.000> it's<00:00:33.120> one<00:00:33.300> of

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
Park is about the place so it's one of

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.660 
Park is about the place so it's one of
the<00:00:33.480> few<00:00:33.600> places<00:00:33.840> where<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.200> can<00:00:34.440> actually

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
the few places where you can actually

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.430 
the few places where you can actually
see<00:00:35.670> dinosaur<00:00:36.210> footprints<00:00:36.809> where<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
see dinosaur footprints where the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.410 
see dinosaur footprints where the
dinosaurs<00:00:37.950> left<00:00:38.250> them<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.149> have<00:00:39.300> an

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
dinosaurs left them so you have an

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.330 
dinosaurs left them so you have an
opportunity<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.200> sort<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.500> as<00:00:40.710> we<00:00:40.860> like<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.160> say

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
opportunity to sort of as we like to say

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.549 
opportunity to sort of as we like to say
step<00:00:41.820> back<00:00:42.030> into<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.510> early<00:00:42.809> Jurassic<00:00:43.140> and

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
step back into the early Jurassic and

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.200 
step back into the early Jurassic and
get<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> sense<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.430> what<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> environment<00:00:44.820> was

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
get a sense of what the environment was

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.180 
get a sense of what the environment was
like<00:00:45.450> when<00:00:46.079> dinosaurs<00:00:46.379> actually<00:00:46.920> lived<00:00:47.129> here

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
like when dinosaurs actually lived here

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.549 
like when dinosaurs actually lived here
and<00:00:47.430> walked<00:00:48.030> around<00:00:48.270> Connecticut<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.350> kind

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
and walked around Connecticut it's kind

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.959 
and walked around Connecticut it's kind
of<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.710> unique<00:00:49.920> thing<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.250> lot<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.460> people<00:00:50.579> have<00:00:50.940> a

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
of a unique thing a lot of people have a

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.910 
of a unique thing a lot of people have a
very<00:00:51.210> hard<00:00:51.420> time<00:00:51.629> believing<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
very hard time believing that the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.650 
very hard time believing that the
footprints<00:00:53.370> are<00:00:53.489> real<00:00:53.670> because<00:00:54.300> we're<00:00:54.570> not

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
footprints are real because we're not

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:08.990 
footprints are real because we're not
really<00:00:54.899> used<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.110> seeing<00:00:55.379> things<00:00:55.530> like<00:00:55.739> that

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
1966 instead of having a park here this

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.190 
1966 instead of having a park here this
was<00:01:11.950> a<00:01:11.979> construction<00:01:12.520> site<00:01:12.670> and<00:01:13.150> a<00:01:13.210> bulldozer

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
was a construction site and a bulldozer

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.990 
was a construction site and a bulldozer

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
even though dinosaur footprints had been

even though dinosaur footprints had been
discovered<00:01:43.420> in<00:01:43.509> the<00:01:43.540> Connecticut<00:01:44.020> Valley

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
discovered in the Connecticut Valley

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.280 
discovered in the Connecticut Valley
since<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:45.700> early<00:01:46.000> 1800s<00:01:46.509> they<00:01:46.810> knew<00:01:46.930> this<00:01:47.080> was

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
since the early 1800s they knew this was

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.380 
since the early 1800s they knew this was
a<00:01:47.320> special<00:01:47.770> site<00:01:48.009> so<00:01:48.550> the<00:01:48.729> right<00:01:48.880> people<00:01:49.270> got

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
a special site so the right people got

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.150 
a special site so the right people got
the<00:01:49.540> ear<00:01:49.690> of<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:49.960> governor<00:01:50.410> and<00:01:50.619> in<00:01:50.740> less<00:01:50.950> than

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
the ear of the governor and in less than

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.120 
the ear of the governor and in less than
three<00:01:51.430> weeks<00:01:51.460> after<00:01:52.470> McCarthy<00:01:53.470> flipped<00:01:53.979> over

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
three weeks after McCarthy flipped over

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.950 
three weeks after McCarthy flipped over
that<00:01:54.280> piece<00:01:54.610> of<00:01:54.759> sandstone<00:01:55.300> this<00:01:55.750> was

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
that piece of sandstone this was

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.260 
that piece of sandstone this was
declared<00:01:56.350> a<00:01:56.470> state<00:01:56.740> park<00:01:57.039> and<00:01:57.280> we've<00:01:58.119> been

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
declared a state park and we've been

one thing that the designers of the park

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.270 
one thing that the designers of the park
had<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:23.050> do<00:02:23.170> was<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.470> make<00:02:23.590> sure<00:02:23.800> that<00:02:23.980> the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
had to do was to make sure that the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.490 
had to do was to make sure that the
footprints<00:02:24.760> were<00:02:25.060> covered<00:02:25.420> over<00:02:25.569> so<00:02:26.230> that<00:02:26.380> the

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
footprints were covered over so that the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.320 
footprints were covered over so that the
stone<00:02:26.740> didn't<00:02:27.190> become<00:02:27.430> eroded<00:02:27.880> from<00:02:27.910> being

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
stone didn't become eroded from being

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.570 
stone didn't become eroded from being
subjected<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.230> weather<00:02:29.410> so<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.370> first

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
subjected to the weather so the first

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.250 
subjected to the weather so the first
thing<00:02:30.850> they<00:02:31.000> did<00:02:31.209> was<00:02:31.420> a<00:02:31.480> quick<00:02:31.720> fix<00:02:31.989> and<00:02:32.140> they

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
thing they did was a quick fix and they

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.050 
thing they did was a quick fix and they
put<00:02:32.440> up<00:02:32.560> what<00:02:32.739> was<00:02:32.890> called<00:02:33.100> a<00:02:33.370> bubble<00:02:33.670> building

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
put up what was called a bubble building

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.410 
put up what was called a bubble building
so<00:02:34.810> it<00:02:34.900> was<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.080> plastic<00:02:35.350> dome<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:36.760> see<00:02:36.970> similar

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
so it was a plastic dome you see similar

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.550 
so it was a plastic dome you see similar
things<00:02:37.450> now<00:02:37.900> although<00:02:38.080> I<00:02:38.170> think<00:02:38.260> they're<00:02:38.530> a

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
things now although I think they're a

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.320 
things now although I think they're a
little<00:02:38.709> sturdier<00:02:39.069> than<00:02:39.310> our<00:02:39.550> dome<00:02:39.790> was<00:02:40.030> where

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
little sturdier than our dome was where

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.020 
little sturdier than our dome was where
you<00:02:40.420> have<00:02:40.770> soccer<00:02:41.770> games<00:02:42.100> you'll<00:02:42.670> see<00:02:42.850> things

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
you have soccer games you'll see things

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.360 
you have soccer games you'll see things

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
like that on the highway today where

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.759
