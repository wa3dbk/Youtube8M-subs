00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
to two different styles the first is a

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.690 
to two different styles the first is a
warrior<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:57.260> if<00:02:57.709> you're<00:02:57.890> a<00:02:57.920> warrior<00:02:58.280> your

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
warrior and if you're a warrior your

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.460 
warrior and if you're a warrior your
character<00:02:59.150> requires<00:02:59.540> strength<00:03:00.140> and

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
character requires strength and

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.490 
character requires strength and
endurance<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:01.730> that<00:03:02.420> basically<00:03:02.690> allows<00:03:03.170> you

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
endurance and that basically allows you

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.650 
endurance and that basically allows you
to<00:03:03.590> wear<00:03:03.770> heavier<00:03:04.190> armor<00:03:04.640> use<00:03:05.209> stronger

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
to wear heavier armor use stronger

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.199 
to wear heavier armor use stronger
weapons<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:06.470> your<00:03:06.920> melee<00:03:07.340> attacks<00:03:07.760> will<00:03:08.030> do<00:03:08.180> a

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
weapons and your melee attacks will do a

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.110 
weapons and your melee attacks will do a
lot<00:03:08.510> more<00:03:08.540> damage<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:10.190> second<00:03:10.700> type<00:03:10.880> is<00:03:11.060> a

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
lot more damage the second type is a

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.690 
lot more damage the second type is a
spell<00:03:11.600> caster<00:03:11.870> which<00:03:12.800> means<00:03:13.070> you<00:03:13.250> can't<00:03:13.489> build

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
spell caster which means you can't build

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.310 
spell caster which means you can't build
up<00:03:13.880> your<00:03:13.910> strength<00:03:14.330> because<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:14.930> have<00:03:15.050> to<00:03:15.140> put

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
up your strength because you have to put

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.400 
up your strength because you have to put
your<00:03:15.440> points<00:03:15.830> in<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.040> major<00:03:16.310> E<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.760> willpower

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
your points in the major E and willpower

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.570 
your points in the major E and willpower
so<00:03:18.410> your<00:03:18.590> armor<00:03:18.920> is<00:03:18.980> going<00:03:19.130> to<00:03:19.190> be<00:03:19.280> a<00:03:19.310> lot

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
so your armor is going to be a lot

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.790 
so your armor is going to be a lot
weaker<00:03:19.850> and<00:03:20.180> your<00:03:20.720> melee<00:03:21.110> attacks<00:03:21.500> are<00:03:21.680> going

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
weaker and your melee attacks are going

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.949 
weaker and your melee attacks are going
to<00:03:21.860> be<00:03:21.950> pretty<00:03:22.160> weak<00:03:22.489> but<00:03:23.330> if<00:03:23.450> you're<00:03:23.600> a<00:03:23.630> mage

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
to be pretty weak but if you're a mage

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.600 
to be pretty weak but if you're a mage
you're<00:03:24.260> going<00:03:24.380> to<00:03:24.440> attack<00:03:24.709> from<00:03:24.769> a<00:03:25.100> distance

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
you're going to attack from a distance

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.370 
you're going to attack from a distance
so<00:03:26.150> you<00:03:26.209> don't<00:03:26.480> have<00:03:26.600> to<00:03:26.750> be<00:03:26.900> in<00:03:27.050> close

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
so you don't have to be in close

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.729 
so you don't have to be in close

beginning of the game decide which style

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.190 
beginning of the game decide which style

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
you would like your character to have

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.650 
you would like your character to have
and<00:03:39.730> choose<00:03:40.730> those<00:03:40.940> skills<00:03:41.300> from<00:03:41.480> the

beginning<00:03:41.810> of<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:42.320> game<00:03:42.500> so<00:03:42.800> that<00:03:42.950> you<00:03:43.040> don't

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
beginning of the game so that you don't

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.870 
beginning of the game so that you don't
waste<00:03:43.489> them<00:03:43.790> and<00:03:43.970> regret<00:03:44.330> it<00:03:44.450> later<00:03:44.600> on<00:03:45.880> that

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
going to say about this game is that it

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.180 
going to say about this game is that it

is extremely difficult I haven't played
a<00:04:01.310> game<00:04:01.550> that<00:04:01.790> was<00:04:01.910> this<00:04:02.180> hard<00:04:02.480> and<00:04:02.780> required<00:04:03.590> a

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
a game that was this hard and required a

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.850 
a game that was this hard and required a
lot<00:04:03.950> of<00:04:03.980> strategy<00:04:04.880> in<00:04:05.030> an<00:04:05.150> RPG<00:04:05.660> in<00:04:05.870> a<00:04:06.320> long<00:04:06.530> time

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
lot of strategy in an RPG in a long time

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.900 
lot of strategy in an RPG in a long time
as<00:04:07.720> you<00:04:08.720> progress<00:04:08.930> through<00:04:09.170> each<00:04:09.709> area<00:04:10.130> you're

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
as you progress through each area you're

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.300 
as you progress through each area you're

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
you have to start from the very

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.620 
you have to start from the very
beginning<00:04:21.530> of<00:04:21.889> this<00:04:21.980> stage<00:04:22.280> so<00:04:23.240> as<00:04:23.360> you<00:04:23.510> go

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
beginning of this stage so as you go

corpse you can click on it and collect
all<00:04:28.100> your<00:04:28.130> souls<00:04:28.670> but<00:04:29.360> if<00:04:29.480> you<00:04:29.600> die<00:04:29.840> before<00:04:29.870> you

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.930 
style of gameplay where you have to make
it<00:04:39.050> back<00:04:39.260> to<00:04:39.320> your<00:04:39.560> corpse<00:04:40.040> and<00:04:40.220> then<00:04:40.700> progress

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
it back to your corpse and then progress

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.450 
it back to your corpse and then progress
a<00:04:41.210> little<00:04:41.450> bit<00:04:41.690> farther<00:04:41.990> so<00:04:42.740> every<00:04:43.010> time<00:04:43.250> that

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
a little bit farther so every time that

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.030 
a little bit farther so every time that
you<00:04:43.520> die<00:04:43.910> you<00:04:44.630> slowly<00:04:45.080> make<00:04:45.440> it<00:04:45.590> farther<00:04:45.830> and

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
you die you slowly make it farther and

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.410 
you die you slowly make it farther and
farther<00:04:46.310> and<00:04:46.580> eventually<00:04:47.000> you<00:04:47.120> make<00:04:47.300> it

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
farther and eventually you make it

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.300 
farther and eventually you make it
through<00:04:47.600> the<00:04:47.720> game<00:04:47.930> kind<00:04:48.710> of<00:04:48.800> reminded<00:04:49.160> me<00:04:49.220> of

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
through the game kind of reminded me of

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.220 
through the game kind of reminded me of
a<00:04:49.490> lot<00:04:49.610> of<00:04:49.730> the<00:04:49.820> old<00:04:50.000> NES<00:04:50.510> games<00:04:50.840> and<00:04:51.110> things

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
a lot of the old NES games and things

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.810 
a lot of the old NES games and things
like<00:04:51.440> that<00:04:51.500> where<00:04:52.250> you<00:04:52.310> kind<00:04:52.520> of<00:04:52.580> had<00:04:52.730> to

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
like that where you kind of had to

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.460 
like that where you kind of had to
memorize<00:04:53.000> a<00:04:53.270> couple<00:04:53.690> patterns<00:04:54.170> and<00:04:54.440> then

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
memorize a couple patterns and then

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.010 
memorize a couple patterns and then
after<00:04:55.460> you<00:04:55.580> were<00:04:55.730> started<00:04:56.120> to<00:04:56.270> memorize<00:04:56.750> them

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
after you were started to memorize them

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.930 
after you were started to memorize them
you<00:04:57.530> can<00:04:57.680> make<00:04:57.860> it<00:04:57.889> farther<00:04:58.280> and<00:04:58.490> farther<00:04:58.790> into

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
you can make it farther and farther into

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.590 
you can make it farther and farther into
the<00:04:59.180> stage<00:04:59.570> until<00:04:59.990> you<00:05:00.110> can<00:05:00.290> complete<00:05:00.710> it<00:05:00.860> a

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
the stage until you can complete it a

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.300 
the stage until you can complete it a

too difficult you would die too many
times<00:05:12.490> however<00:05:13.490> for<00:05:13.880> some<00:05:14.090> reason<00:05:14.570> the<00:05:14.750> game

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
times however for some reason the game

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.320 
times however for some reason the game
isn't<00:05:15.290> nearly<00:05:15.800> as<00:05:15.919> frustrating<00:05:16.610> as<00:05:16.700> it<00:05:16.760> sounds

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
isn't nearly as frustrating as it sounds

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.510 
isn't nearly as frustrating as it sounds
whatever<00:05:18.200> you're<00:05:18.380> playing<00:05:18.740> it<00:05:18.980> even<00:05:19.280> if<00:05:19.370> you

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
whatever you're playing it even if you

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.000 
whatever you're playing it even if you
die<00:05:19.700> a<00:05:19.730> bunch<00:05:20.090> of<00:05:20.210> times<00:05:20.480> still<00:05:21.350> satisfying

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
die a bunch of times still satisfying

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.530 
die a bunch of times still satisfying
because<00:05:22.250> you<00:05:22.520> make<00:05:22.730> it<00:05:22.880> a<00:05:22.940> little<00:05:23.090> bit<00:05:23.300> farther

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
because you make it a little bit farther

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.840 
because you make it a little bit farther
in<00:05:23.750> the<00:05:23.870> level<00:05:24.169> so<00:05:24.830> every<00:05:25.130> time<00:05:25.160> I<00:05:25.340> was<00:05:25.580> playing

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
in the level so every time I was playing

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.820 
in the level so every time I was playing
a<00:05:25.940> stage<00:05:26.210> and<00:05:26.419> I<00:05:26.450> would<00:05:26.600> die<00:05:26.840> and<00:05:27.169> lose<00:05:27.590> all<00:05:27.770> of

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
a stage and I would die and lose all of

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.250 
a stage and I would die and lose all of
my<00:05:27.950> soul's<00:05:28.370> I<00:05:28.580> would<00:05:28.700> get<00:05:28.820> mad<00:05:29.060> but<00:05:30.020> then<00:05:30.230> I

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
my soul's I would get mad but then I

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.200 
my soul's I would get mad but then I
could<00:05:30.980> make<00:05:31.160> it<00:05:31.280> right<00:05:31.460> back<00:05:31.610> to<00:05:31.820> that<00:05:31.880> level

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
could make it right back to that level

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.850 
could make it right back to that level
and<00:05:32.389> I<00:05:32.510> actually<00:05:32.720> felt<00:05:33.169> like<00:05:33.320> I<00:05:33.440> was<00:05:33.590> learning

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
and I actually felt like I was learning

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.940 
and I actually felt like I was learning
how<00:05:34.250> to<00:05:34.310> play<00:05:34.490> through<00:05:34.760> the<00:05:34.940> game<00:05:35.740> one<00:05:36.740> thing

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
how to play through the game one thing

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.350 
how to play through the game one thing
that<00:05:36.980> I<00:05:37.130> really<00:05:37.160> enjoyed<00:05:37.700> about<00:05:37.730> this<00:05:38.150> game<00:05:38.330> is

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
that I really enjoyed about this game is

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.409 
that I really enjoyed about this game is
how<00:05:38.600> they<00:05:38.720> incorporated<00:05:39.350> online<00:05:39.919> play<00:05:40.280> as<00:05:40.550> I

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
how they incorporated online play as I

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:42.820 
how they incorporated online play as I
would<00:05:41.570> play<00:05:41.750> through<00:05:41.990> a<00:05:42.050> level<00:05:42.410> I<00:05:42.470> would<00:05:42.620> see<00:05:42.800> a

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
would play through a level I would see a

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.100 
would play through a level I would see a
white<00:05:43.160> outline<00:05:43.460> of<00:05:43.730> another<00:05:44.120> character<00:05:44.900> and

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
white outline of another character and

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.500 
white outline of another character and
what<00:05:45.620> that<00:05:45.800> was<00:05:45.980> is<00:05:46.040> the<00:05:46.580> remnants<00:05:47.120> of<00:05:47.210> another

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
what that was is the remnants of another

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.629 
what that was is the remnants of another
online<00:05:48.080> player<00:05:48.380> playing<00:05:48.770> the<00:05:48.950> same<00:05:49.190> part<00:05:49.520> as

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 
online player playing the same part as

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:52.870 
online player playing the same part as
me<00:05:49.850> and<00:05:50.080> it<00:05:51.080> was<00:05:51.530> pretty<00:05:52.010> much<00:05:52.190> their<00:05:52.430> soul

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
me and it was pretty much their soul

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.510 
me and it was pretty much their soul
overlapping<00:05:53.510> into<00:05:53.930> my<00:05:54.080> world<00:05:54.380> and<00:05:54.680> also<00:05:55.340> i

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
overlapping into my world and also i

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.430 
overlapping into my world and also i
could<00:05:55.790> see<00:05:56.000> messages<00:05:56.570> on<00:05:56.750> the<00:05:56.870> ground<00:05:57.139> or

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
could see messages on the ground or

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.920 
could see messages on the ground or
blood<00:05:58.160> piles<00:05:58.520> and<00:05:58.970> if<00:05:59.210> i<00:05:59.330> clicked<00:05:59.630> on<00:05:59.810> the

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
blood piles and if i clicked on the

pretty much I'm being summoned into

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.890 
that message and I decided to join in
so<00:06:22.130> it's<00:06:22.340> summoned<00:06:22.700> me<00:06:22.850> into<00:06:23.150> their<00:06:23.300> world<00:06:23.540> and

now I can help them out for the level

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.940

it<00:06:28.700> here<00:06:29.630> I'm<00:06:29.810> showing<00:06:30.050> footage<00:06:30.410> where<00:06:30.770> a

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:30.950 
it here I'm showing footage where a

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.370 
it here I'm showing footage where a
black<00:06:31.280> phantom<00:06:31.940> has<00:06:32.120> broken<00:06:32.570> into<00:06:32.840> this<00:06:33.110> world

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 
black phantom has broken into this world

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.620 
black phantom has broken into this world
and<00:06:33.650> basically<00:06:34.610> that<00:06:34.910> means<00:06:34.940> that<00:06:35.450> they

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
and basically that means that they

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.480 
and basically that means that they
forced<00:06:36.200> their<00:06:36.380> way<00:06:36.410> into<00:06:36.770> this<00:06:36.950> world<00:06:37.220> without

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
forced their way into this world without

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.910 
forced their way into this world without
being<00:06:37.970> invited<00:06:38.270> and<00:06:38.660> they're<00:06:39.380> able<00:06:39.500> to<00:06:39.680> come

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:39.920 
being invited and they're able to come

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.640 
being invited and they're able to come
in<00:06:40.100> and<00:06:40.310> they're<00:06:40.850> able<00:06:41.000> to<00:06:41.150> attack<00:06:41.690> us<00:06:41.960> and<00:06:42.170> if

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
in and they're able to attack us and if

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.260 
in and they're able to attack us and if
they<00:06:42.710> kill<00:06:43.100> us<00:06:43.250> then<00:06:43.460> they<00:06:43.580> get<00:06:43.730> all<00:06:44.000> of<00:06:44.180> our

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
they kill us then they get all of our

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.380 
they kill us then they get all of our
souls<00:06:45.250> so<00:06:46.250> this<00:06:46.400> pretty<00:06:46.580> much<00:06:46.700> forced<00:06:47.150> us<00:06:47.360> to

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:47.390 
souls so this pretty much forced us to

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.600 
souls so this pretty much forced us to
stop<00:06:47.870> progressing<00:06:48.320> through<00:06:48.680> the<00:06:48.800> level<00:06:49.130> and

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
stop progressing through the level and

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.950 
stop progressing through the level and
we<00:06:49.700> have<00:06:49.850> to<00:06:49.970> go<00:06:50.060> back<00:06:50.090> and<00:06:50.300> defeat<00:06:50.750> this

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 
we have to go back and defeat this

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.810 
we have to go back and defeat this
person<00:06:51.380> who's<00:06:51.500> broken<00:06:51.770> into<00:06:52.100> our<00:06:52.250> world<00:06:52.490> and

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:52.820 
person who's broken into our world and

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.050 
person who's broken into our world and
this<00:06:53.720> was<00:06:53.900> a<00:06:53.930> nice<00:06:54.290> way<00:06:54.680> for<00:06:54.710> them<00:06:55.040> to<00:06:55.100> add<00:06:55.340> PPP

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.060 
this was a nice way for them to add PPP

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.180 
this was a nice way for them to add PPP
into<00:06:56.300> the<00:06:56.390> game<00:06:56.570> without<00:06:57.200> changing<00:06:57.890> it<00:06:58.010> into

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.190
