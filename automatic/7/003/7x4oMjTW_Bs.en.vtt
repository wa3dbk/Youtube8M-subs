some of that is strength and some of it

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.479 
some of that is strength and some of it
since<00:03:45.599> this<00:03:45.780> video<00:03:46.139> was<00:03:46.319> shot<00:03:46.560> i<00:03:46.620> did<00:03:47.069> have<00:03:47.340> him

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:54.860 
Kai road so he did he did have a rear
belt<00:03:51.659> at<00:03:52.019> the<00:03:52.079> time<00:03:52.500> as<00:03:52.859> well<00:03:53.669> as<00:03:53.849> he<00:03:54.030> was<00:03:54.239> a<00:03:54.269> out

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.659 
of take him back and forth and I'm just
asking<00:04:06.989> him<00:04:07.109> to<00:04:07.229> balance<00:04:07.709> back<00:04:07.979> a<00:04:08.010> little<00:04:08.430> bit

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
asking him to balance back a little bit

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:11.059 
asking him to balance back a little bit
and<00:04:08.819> you'll<00:04:08.940> see<00:04:09.150> him<00:04:09.329> sit<00:04:09.569> back<00:04:09.810> on<00:04:10.139> his<00:04:10.769> hock

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
and you'll see him sit back on his hock

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.319 
and you'll see him sit back on his hock
and<00:04:11.370> push<00:04:12.150> from<00:04:12.359> behind<00:04:12.949> and<00:04:13.949> free<00:04:14.699> up<00:04:14.849> in<00:04:15.090> the

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
and push from behind and free up in the

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.839 
and push from behind and free up in the
face<00:04:15.599> now<00:04:16.229> when<00:04:16.440> he<00:04:16.650> gets<00:04:16.919> this<00:04:17.190> figured<00:04:17.699> out

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
face now when he gets this figured out

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.520 
face now when he gets this figured out
which<00:04:18.180> I<00:04:18.359> figure<00:04:18.810> it's<00:04:18.989> only<00:04:19.260> going<00:04:19.409> to<00:04:19.470> take

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
which I figure it's only going to take

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.830 
which I figure it's only going to take
about<00:04:19.739> another<00:04:20.190> week<00:04:20.639> week<00:04:20.940> and<00:04:21.120> a<00:04:21.209> half<00:04:21.239> and

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
about another week week and a half and

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.570 
about another week week and a half and
he'll<00:04:22.349> have<00:04:22.560> that<00:04:22.710> figured<00:04:22.950> out<00:04:23.190> pretty<00:04:23.460> well

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
he'll have that figured out pretty well

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.230 
he'll have that figured out pretty well
he<00:04:24.510> should<00:04:24.779> have<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:25.830> same<00:04:26.070> top<00:04:26.430> line<00:04:26.789> in<00:04:27.120> the

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
he should have the same top line in the

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.500 
he should have the same top line in the
low

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
low

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.400 
low
that<00:04:28.110> he<00:04:28.320> has<00:04:28.560> in<00:04:28.950> the<00:04:28.980> jog<00:04:29.780> that<00:04:30.780> is<00:04:31.050> like<00:04:31.320> I

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
that he has in the jog that is like I

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.860 
that he has in the jog that is like I
said<00:04:31.620> according<00:04:31.920> to<00:04:32.250> what<00:04:32.460> I<00:04:32.640> know<00:04:32.760> my<00:04:33.270> program

said according to what I know my program

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.680 
said according to what I know my program
will<00:04:34.170> do<00:04:34.650> for<00:04:34.890> this<00:04:35.070> horse<00:04:35.400> now<00:04:36.120> I<00:04:36.150> can't<00:04:36.480> say

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.640 
he is trying to find himself he is
trying<00:05:56.340> to<00:05:56.430> figure<00:05:56.610> out<00:05:56.790> how<00:05:57.090> to<00:05:57.150> be<00:05:58.080> confident

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
trying to figure out how to be confident

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.490 
trying to figure out how to be confident
in<00:05:58.800> the<00:05:58.950> nose<00:05:59.160> and<00:05:59.580> take<00:06:00.330> that<00:06:00.570> nose<00:06:00.840> out<00:06:01.140> as

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
in the nose and take that nose out as

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.790 
in the nose and take that nose out as
well<00:06:02.010> as<00:06:02.220> carry<00:06:02.610> his<00:06:02.850> balance<00:06:03.360> on<00:06:04.200> his<00:06:04.590> hind

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
well as carry his balance on his hind

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.060 
well as carry his balance on his hind
quarters<00:06:05.340> so<00:06:06.200> that<00:06:07.200> is<00:06:07.530> what<00:06:07.710> we're<00:06:07.860> working

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
quarters so that is what we're working

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:13.390 
quarters so that is what we're working
on<00:06:08.400> right<00:06:08.460> now

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.210 

I<00:06:13.490> figure<00:06:14.360> that<00:06:14.660> like<00:06:15.199> I<00:06:15.320> said<00:06:15.380> he<00:06:15.830> will<00:06:16.040> be

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
I figure that like I said he will be

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.990 
I figure that like I said he will be
able<00:06:16.370> to<00:06:16.729> if<00:06:17.720> I<00:06:18.020> keep<00:06:18.530> him<00:06:18.740> in<00:06:19.040> training<00:06:19.820> and

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
able to if I keep him in training and

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.540 
able to if I keep him in training and
going<00:06:20.540> to<00:06:20.630> lon<00:06:20.810> like<00:06:21.080> I<00:06:21.110> have<00:06:21.470> I<00:06:21.830> figure<00:06:22.520> a

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
going to lon like I have I figure a

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.810 
going to lon like I have I figure a
month<00:06:22.880> from<00:06:23.060> now<00:06:23.150> if<00:06:23.630> I'm<00:06:24.199> able<00:06:24.500> to<00:06:24.830> find<00:06:25.639> the

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.820 
month from now if I'm able to find the

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.510 
month from now if I'm able to find the
show<00:06:26.000> where<00:06:26.330> I<00:06:26.360> don't<00:06:26.870> have<00:06:27.050> to<00:06:27.169> do<00:06:27.520> client

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 
show where I don't have to do client

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.640 
show where I don't have to do client
horses<00:06:28.970> so<00:06:29.150> much<00:06:29.389> I'm<00:06:29.690> going<00:06:29.930> to<00:06:29.990> try<00:06:30.199> to<00:06:30.289> get

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
horses so much I'm going to try to get

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.520 
horses so much I'm going to try to get
him<00:06:30.770> into<00:06:30.979> the<00:06:31.070> Chopin<00:06:31.639> and<00:06:32.199> take<00:06:33.199> him<00:06:33.350> through

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
him into the Chopin and take him through

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.290 
him into the Chopin and take him through
there<00:06:33.770> put<00:06:34.130> him<00:06:34.220> in<00:06:34.280> a<00:06:34.370> green<00:06:34.610> class<00:06:34.940> or

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
there put him in a green class or

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.659 
there put him in a green class or
whatever<00:06:35.660> his<00:06:36.350> speed<00:06:36.740> is<00:06:36.770> just<00:06:37.310> the<00:06:37.460> boat

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:37.669 
whatever his speed is just the boat

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:39.969 
whatever his speed is just the boat
there<00:06:38.090> and<00:06:38.300> that<00:06:38.930> will<00:06:39.139> finish<00:06:39.380> out<00:06:39.710> the<00:06:39.949> rest

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:39.979 
there and that will finish out the rest

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:43.029 
there and that will finish out the rest
of<00:06:40.310> the<00:06:40.430> way<00:06:40.610> as<00:06:40.910> he<00:06:41.810> figures<00:06:42.530> out<00:06:42.650> the<00:06:42.860> top

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 
of the way as he figures out the top

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:46.810 
of the way as he figures out the top
line<00:06:43.370> at<00:06:43.639> the<00:06:44.210> lope<00:06:44.419> so<00:06:45.430> you<00:06:46.430> can<00:06:46.580> see<00:06:46.789> how

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:46.820 
line at the lope so you can see how

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.090 
line at the lope so you can see how
pretty<00:06:47.210> that<00:06:47.389> top<00:06:47.810> line<00:06:48.050> is<00:06:48.260> going<00:06:48.590> to<00:06:48.680> be<00:06:48.830> when

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.100 
pretty that top line is going to be when

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.850 
pretty that top line is going to be when
he<00:06:49.250> relaxes<00:06:49.820> it<00:06:49.970> out<00:06:50.120> and<00:06:50.449> finishes<00:06:51.350> out<00:06:51.530> his

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860 
he relaxes it out and finishes out his

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.040 
he relaxes it out and finishes out his
balance<00:06:52.370> him<00:06:52.699> the<00:06:52.880> strength<00:06:53.240> like<00:06:53.900> I<00:06:53.990> said

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.050 
balance him the strength like I said

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.950 
balance him the strength like I said
right<00:06:54.320> now<00:06:54.530> it's<00:06:54.919> the<00:06:55.039> strength<00:06:55.550> factor<00:06:55.960> after

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 
right now it's the strength factor after

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.260 
right now it's the strength factor after
sitting<00:06:57.380> for<00:06:57.410> he's<00:06:58.220> been<00:06:58.250> sitting<00:06:58.850> for<00:06:59.030> like

00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.270 
sitting for he's been sitting for like

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.800 
sitting for he's been sitting for like
six<00:06:59.600> months<00:06:59.840> and<00:07:00.430> he's<00:07:01.430> got<00:07:01.760> about<00:07:02.300> two<00:07:02.600> weeks

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:02.810 
six months and he's got about two weeks

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.980 
six months and he's got about two weeks
under<00:07:03.139> saddle<00:07:03.440> now<00:07:03.860> like<00:07:04.340> this<00:07:04.669> and<00:07:04.970> he<00:07:05.840> has

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:05.990 
under saddle now like this and he has

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.050 
under saddle now like this and he has
learned<00:07:06.260> a<00:07:06.470> whole<00:07:06.680> lot<00:07:06.740> in<00:07:07.250> the<00:07:07.580> last<00:07:07.610> little

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:08.060 
learned a whole lot in the last little

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.990 
learned a whole lot in the last little
bit<00:07:08.210> so<00:07:08.750> if<00:07:09.110> you<00:07:09.710> do<00:07:09.860> end<00:07:10.039> up<00:07:10.160> interested<00:07:10.789> in

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.000 
bit so if you do end up interested in

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.580 
bit so if you do end up interested in
