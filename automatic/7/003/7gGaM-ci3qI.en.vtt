00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
now or try a little bit better the setup

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.740 
now or try a little bit better the setup
because<00:01:01.010> I<00:01:01.070> look<00:01:01.309> at<00:01:01.430> um<00:01:01.579> experience<00:01:02.210> check<00:01:02.540> we

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
because I look at um experience check we

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.830 
because I look at um experience check we
see<00:01:03.190> this<00:01:04.190> is<00:01:04.369> the<00:01:04.519> clutch<00:01:04.879> setup<00:01:05.330> so<00:01:05.630> don't

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
see this is the clutch setup so don't

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.800 
see this is the clutch setup so don't
know<00:01:05.930> if<00:01:06.020> you<00:01:06.110> can<00:01:06.200> see<00:01:06.409> some<00:01:06.619> just<00:01:06.800> guessing

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
know if you can see some just guessing

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.980 
know if you can see some just guessing
this<00:01:08.810> is<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.080> clutch<00:01:09.380> spins<00:01:10.509> how<00:01:11.509> much<00:01:11.780> been

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
this is the clutch spins how much been

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.139 
this is the clutch spins how much been
as<00:01:12.080> fast<00:01:12.259> enough<00:01:12.530> to<00:01:12.619> move<00:01:12.770> this<00:01:13.130> over<00:01:13.520> that's

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
as fast enough to move this over that's

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.350 
as fast enough to move this over that's
our<00:01:14.750> X<00:01:14.930> is<00:01:15.140> what's<00:01:15.350> forcing<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.880> wheel<00:01:17.060> into

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
our X is what's forcing the wheel into

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:27.530 
our X is what's forcing the wheel into
there<00:01:18.280> so<00:01:19.280> if<00:01:19.399> this<00:01:19.520> thing<00:01:19.970> moves

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.790 

of<00:01:28.540> these<00:01:28.720> little<00:01:28.960> tension<00:01:29.170> of<00:01:29.440> things<00:01:29.620> which

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
of these little tension of things which

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.580 
of these little tension of things which
hold<00:01:30.070> this<00:01:30.250> down<00:01:30.640> as<00:01:31.120> well<00:01:31.540> as<00:01:31.690> away<00:01:32.140> from<00:01:32.170> the

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
hold this down as well as away from the

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.880 
hold this down as well as away from the
tire<00:01:32.880> because<00:01:33.880> once<00:01:34.870> you<00:01:34.990> start<00:01:35.260> to<00:01:35.350> twerk<00:01:35.710> on

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
tire because once you start to twerk on

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.740 
tire because once you start to twerk on
this<00:01:36.040> engine<00:01:36.310> things<00:01:37.000> gonna<00:01:37.150> want<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:37.510> come

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
this engine things gonna want to come

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.550 
this engine things gonna want to come
this<00:01:37.990> way

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
this way

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.170 
this way
and<00:01:39.040> your<00:01:39.130> tire<00:01:39.400> is<00:01:39.430> going<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:39.729> start<00:01:39.970> hitting

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
and your tire is going to start hitting

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.840 
and your tire is going to start hitting
down<00:01:40.270> that's<00:01:40.510> bad<00:01:40.840> that's<00:01:41.380> very<00:01:42.310> bad<00:01:42.490> you<00:01:42.670> blow

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
down that's bad that's very bad you blow

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:43.530 
down that's bad that's very bad you blow
a<00:01:42.880> tire

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
a tire

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.840 
a tire
there's<00:01:44.320> my<00:01:44.500> thumb<00:01:44.950> right<00:01:45.130> here<00:01:45.190> is<00:01:45.520> where<00:01:45.700> the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
there's my thumb right here is where the

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.060 
there's my thumb right here is where the
oil<00:01:46.000> tank<00:01:46.630> used<00:01:46.900> to<00:01:47.050> be<00:01:47.170> for<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:47.530> chainsaw

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
oil tank used to be for the chainsaw

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.440 
oil tank used to be for the chainsaw
where<00:01:48.400> they<00:01:48.580> would<00:01:48.729> squirt<00:01:49.030> at<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.150> bar<00:01:49.330> with

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
where they would squirt at the bar with

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.760 
where they would squirt at the bar with
oil<00:01:49.630> but<00:01:49.780> we<00:01:49.840> don't<00:01:49.990> need<00:01:50.080> an<00:01:50.229> axe<00:01:50.500> I<00:01:50.650> don't

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
oil but we don't need an axe I don't

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.460 
oil but we don't need an axe I don't
need<00:01:50.860> oil<00:01:50.950> squirt<00:01:51.369> in<00:01:51.460> anywhere<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:53.350> you

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
need oil squirt in anywhere so you

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.140 
need oil squirt in anywhere so you
actually<00:01:53.680> have<00:01:53.920> this<00:01:54.070> in<00:01:54.729> here<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.119> same

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
actually have this in here the same

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.530 
actually have this in here the same
thing<00:01:55.630> this<00:01:56.320> actually<00:01:56.590> is<00:01:56.830> what's<00:01:57.040> forcing

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
thing this actually is what's forcing

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.410 
thing this actually is what's forcing
the<00:01:58.540> wheel<00:01:58.750> into<00:01:59.020> there<00:01:59.970> so<00:02:00.970> this<00:02:01.210> thing<00:02:02.020> moves

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
the wheel into there so this thing moves

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.540 
the wheel into there so this thing moves
now<00:02:04.420> see<00:02:04.720> we<00:02:04.869> get<00:02:04.990> a<00:02:05.050> little<00:02:05.259> bit<00:02:05.350> higher<00:02:05.550> this

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
now see we get a little bit higher this

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.900 
now see we get a little bit higher this
is<00:02:06.610> my<00:02:06.820> exhaust<00:02:07.830> not<00:02:08.830> not<00:02:09.039> nothing<00:02:09.399> too<00:02:09.700> crazy

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
is my exhaust not not nothing too crazy

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.130 
is my exhaust not not nothing too crazy
looking<00:02:10.360> but<00:02:10.450> it<00:02:10.539> actually<00:02:10.780> does<00:02:10.929> have<00:02:11.110> a

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
looking but it actually does have a

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.470 
looking but it actually does have a
small<00:02:11.650> expansion<00:02:12.010> chamber<00:02:12.640> down<00:02:12.760> here<00:02:13.060> for<00:02:13.360> it

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
small expansion chamber down here for it

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.380 
small expansion chamber down here for it
and<00:02:13.750> this<00:02:13.930> is<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:15.150> 60<00:02:16.150> cc<00:02:16.420> two-stroke<00:02:18.180> 3.7<00:02:19.180> inch
