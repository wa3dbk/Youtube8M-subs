00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
have to do is you just copy the contents

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.020 
have to do is you just copy the contents
from<00:01:47.790> here<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.240> some<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.140> your<00:01:49.290> partitions

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
from here to some of your partitions

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.109 
from here to some of your partitions
then<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:51.570> format<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.490> then<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.700> can<00:01:53.909> use

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
then you just format it then you can use

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.260 
then you just format it then you can use
it<00:01:54.149> for<00:01:54.720> normal<00:01:54.899> purpose<00:01:55.729> this<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.090> only

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270
