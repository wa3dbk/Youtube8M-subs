actually comes out oh yeah yeah that
helped<00:01:22.930> a<00:01:23.049> little<00:01:23.229> bit<00:01:23.380> grease<00:01:23.620> how<00:01:23.830> that

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
helped a little bit grease how that

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.610 
helped a little bit grease how that
might<00:01:25.570> be<00:01:25.720> doing<00:01:25.930> it<00:01:26.049> a<00:01:26.080> few<00:01:26.140> times<00:01:28.260> yeah

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620
