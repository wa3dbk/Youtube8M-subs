00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
batteries three bucks a pound

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.590 
batteries three bucks a pound
I've<00:01:25.860> got<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.250> bunch<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.790> laptops<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.360> got<00:01:27.509> to

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
I've got a bunch of laptops I got to

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.539 
I've got a bunch of laptops I got to
pull<00:01:27.720> apart<00:01:27.810> but<00:01:28.590> these<00:01:28.799> add<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.070> fast<00:01:29.280> because

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
pull apart but these add it fast because

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.190 
pull apart but these add it fast because
the<00:01:29.790> batteries<00:01:30.090> are<00:01:30.119> over<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> pound<00:01:30.659> apiece<00:01:30.780> so

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the batteries are over a pound apiece so

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.560 
the batteries are over a pound apiece so
that'll<00:01:31.890> add<00:01:31.950> up<00:01:32.100> fast<00:01:32.299> there's<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.360> bunch<00:01:33.509> of

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
that'll add up fast there's a bunch of

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.080 
that'll add up fast there's a bunch of
laptops<00:01:33.930> up<00:01:34.110> there<00:01:34.320> my<00:01:35.310> aluminum<00:01:35.490> bins<00:01:35.820> are<00:01:35.970> so

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
laptops up there my aluminum bins are so

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.429 
laptops up there my aluminum bins are so
full<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.420> can't<00:01:36.689> probably<00:01:36.840> even<00:01:37.049> pull<00:01:37.229> them<00:01:37.350> out

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
full I can't probably even pull them out

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.569

now<00:01:37.590> because<00:01:37.740> they'll<00:01:37.920> get<00:01:38.040> stuck<00:01:38.280> up<00:01:38.430> in

the wire cut off I took in three bins of
those<00:02:19.950> my<00:02:20.950> floppy<00:02:21.760> drives<00:02:22.120> down<00:02:22.870> on<00:02:23.020> there<00:02:23.140> I

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
those my floppy drives down on there I

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.800 
those my floppy drives down on there I
had<00:02:24.520> like<00:02:24.670> four<00:02:24.850> bins<00:02:25.090> of<00:02:25.270> those<00:02:25.360> I'm<00:02:25.570> down<00:02:25.690> the

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
had like four bins of those I'm down the

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.510 
had like four bins of those I'm down the
one<00:02:25.990> bin<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.560> takes<00:02:26.740> forever<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:27.160> break<00:02:27.310> those

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
one bin it takes forever to break those

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.330 
one bin it takes forever to break those
down<00:02:27.550> but<00:02:28.540> out<00:02:28.660> of<00:02:28.810> those<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.530> get<00:02:29.680> this<00:02:30.100> kind

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
down but out of those you get this kind

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.830 
down but out of those you get this kind
of<00:02:30.400> stuff<00:02:30.610> that<00:02:30.790> I<00:02:30.820> got<00:02:30.970> in<00:02:31.030> my<00:02:31.060> truck<00:02:32.550> get<00:02:33.840> this

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
of stuff that I got in my truck get this

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.600 
of stuff that I got in my truck get this
copper<00:02:35.140> winding<00:02:35.470> in<00:02:35.590> these<00:02:35.770> type<00:02:35.950> of<00:02:35.980> motors<00:02:36.370> I

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
copper winding in these type of motors I

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.949 
copper winding in these type of motors I
guess<00:02:38.310> like<00:02:39.310> that<00:02:39.520> you<00:02:40.030> know<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.540> throw<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:40.840> in

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
guess like that you know you throw it in

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.840 
guess like that you know you throw it in
there<00:02:41.230> I'll<00:02:41.320> get<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.560> extra<00:02:41.800> weight<00:02:41.920> for<00:02:42.730> my

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
there I'll get the extra weight for my

with my plastic transformers

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.880 
with my plastic transformers

there's<00:04:11.620> also<00:04:11.740> a<00:04:11.860> fuses<00:04:12.220> so<00:04:12.250> I<00:04:12.370> don't<00:04:12.520> know<00:04:12.580> if

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
there's also a fuses so I don't know if

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.730 
there's also a fuses so I don't know if
they'll<00:04:12.940> taken<00:04:13.210> that<00:04:13.300> way<00:04:13.450> or<00:04:13.540> not<00:04:13.600> but<00:04:13.930> I'll

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
they'll taken that way or not but I'll

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.320

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.700 
have to experiment stuff like this you
may<00:04:59.770> see<00:04:59.830> I<00:04:59.920> don't<00:05:00.010> want<00:05:00.220> to<00:05:00.340> bother<00:05:00.460> with<00:05:00.670> it

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
may see I don't want to bother with it

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.810 
may see I don't want to bother with it
but<00:05:02.710> it's<00:05:02.920> worth<00:05:03.040> open<00:05:03.370> them<00:05:03.460> up<00:05:03.520> at<00:05:03.670> least

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
but it's worth open them up at least

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.310 
but it's worth open them up at least
once<00:05:04.090> or<00:05:04.180> twice<00:05:04.240> to<00:05:04.540> see<00:05:04.690> what's<00:05:04.840> in<00:05:04.960> them<00:05:05.080> if

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
once or twice to see what's in them if

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.630 
once or twice to see what's in them if
you<00:05:05.500> decide<00:05:05.800> for<00:05:05.950> that<00:05:06.070> point<00:05:06.280> you<00:05:06.400> don't<00:05:06.430> want

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
you decide for that point you don't want

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.030 
you decide for that point you don't want
to<00:05:06.700> mess<00:05:06.790> with<00:05:06.880> it<00:05:07.090> that's<00:05:07.210> up<00:05:07.390> to<00:05:07.480> you<00:05:07.920> again<00:05:08.920> I

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
to mess with it that's up to you again I

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.920 
to mess with it that's up to you again I
like<00:05:09.160> to<00:05:09.310> mess<00:05:09.580> with<00:05:09.670> about<00:05:09.880> everything<00:05:10.270> so

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930
