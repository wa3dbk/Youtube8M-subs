00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.240
 I came back, my beauty, I came back with more 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.220
 an analysis for you of the sims 4 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.920
 only this time I bring the analysis of 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.290
 detectives and police trailer 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.450
 As I said, it will launch a trailer for 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.400
 all right new careers then 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.740
 we'll probably see one more 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.949
 trailer released so let's go guys 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.789
 If the dollynho is coming, I'll come. 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.279
 eat well 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.279
 already max wilson does not want a turkish 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.330
 and on February 24 , 2015 was 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.820
 released 13 more showing some of the 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.280
 the sims 4 gameplay to work 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.960
 a new sims 4 expansion pack 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.270
 this time they show a little about the 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.110
 Detectives and police officers who are the 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.730
 same branch 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.770
 as in the previous training showing 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.630
 a bit of soul tores in that you can 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.520
 see also that it shows another 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.380
 card probably this card 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.810
 will be present in all works 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.120
 Hey, to tell you that you're here, it's for 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.070
 mark the time you arrived, huh? 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.170
 It is a very cool thing even then will 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.180
 I have to think that in all the works that 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.920
 come in the clear expansion we got 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.170
 see also some of the department of 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.150
 cops right there in the background we can see 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.430
 a little from prison, we already know that 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.369
 You can see it, we just do not know if we're going to be 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.410
 prisoner is not and how we will be trapped in that 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.670
 idea why to be arrested has to do 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.110
 something is wrong, right? 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.090
 will you be able to kill one of the 64 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.700
 flights and drowned her in the pool 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.890
 can afford to go taka as he had said 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.770
 in my first analysis of the work 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.140
 likely to be arrested and will have a 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.180
 Time right on it so you can leave. 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.400
 because the prison already exists already knows that 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.010
 exists and we can see her right 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.440
 just do not know the same if we players 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.020
 We can get stuck or we can just go 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.370
 can arrest people right there is 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.200
 doubt that we could not 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.540
 respond to the work of 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.670
 Detective does not have much secret, you go. 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.280
 receive a case and you go to the place 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.960
 of the case and will investigate everything there 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.690
 Right one thing I liked 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.430
 enough research that you will not 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.290
 simply send your sim to the 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.510
 place and you will not see it you will 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.610
 follow any expensive place, that is, if you 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.010
 You have to do an investigation in a house. 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.690
 You go to the house with him and on the 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.280
 part of choosing the case I think it will 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.410
 work the same sims 3 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.269
 the expansion around the world had this 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.430
 When you traveled, you will have a 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.080
 You will click on the picture and you will have 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.910
 all case options 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.980
 You will choose the case and go there. 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.720
 investigate, I think it's going to be like this, right? 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.980
 they put a transition of the bat 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.050
 bigger 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.250
 when you arrive at the crime scene you 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.360
 Are you going to have several things? 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.010
 flashing right 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.750
 but never talk a little about my game 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.120
 these are the clues 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.890
 so the more clues you pick up the more 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.209
 It will be easy for you to find the 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.379
 criminal right 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.780
 You may also be talking to 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:52.209
 the residents of the house and ask you there 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.920
 saw something suspicious things like 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.590
 after all this you will return to 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.079
 police station and take all your evidence and 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.269
 put on the table and investigate further 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.400
 right will make an examination of DNA will you 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.470
 stay the photos this part I do not know how 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.000
 It will work fine so it's better not to 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.829
 too deep, otherwise I can finish 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.060
 saying the wrong thing as seen 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.400
 in the trailer when the pincers 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.049
 accumulate in the database neither there you 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.239
 will be able to connect the points that you will 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.769
 see the one here was seen in it then 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.200
 that is to say that it was seen 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.690
 also there you will reach the 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.760
 criminal this is not really there people 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.920
 is thinking that it is only in the sims no 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.690
 this really exists he used it 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.400
 also assault the bank after 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.209
 Do you know who you are? 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.129
 prison 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.569
 There you will do what you will learn to see. 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:40.840
 nor will she pick up the microphone a range 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.329
 It's only gigantic that I do not take a picture 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.650
 You hold him or her something else that 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.169
 I'm curious, will we go? 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.389
 receive for each case we are going to do 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:51.639
 because the person would be cool because they kind 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.019
 you get a salary if you hold 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.970
 Someone or something 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.220
 jack the ripper should receive a 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.290
 little else, right after being arrested 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.079
 comes the part of the question table 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.290
 that part you're going to put in the can 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.760
 Then tell us your new ep and it 's good to see a good 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.690
 what does that mean 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:13.239
 This is not normal, can we do this? 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.049
 easy way and either the defense counted 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.239
 was you 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.970
 this is my case then you will have kind of 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.829
 a choice of your good cop or 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.840
 take one or both at the same time. 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.430
 time this part struck a doubt not 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.800
 I know why she's giving this inflation. 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.660
 for it is not fine because we know that 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.789
 Do not have a car, I do not know they put it. 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.680
 In this expansion, right but I do not 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:34.270
 I can explain exactly what happened. 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.330
 If you're going to get the cop, he's going to 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.280
 give but it was an inflation is that you are 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.110
 cursing the law these things know how 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.150
 It was well explained because she is giving 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.900
 this inflation seems so but we know 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.150
 You'll start out as a regular cop. 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.850
 Calm down then move on to one more 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.340
 career after that I even had the boss 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.130
 the platoon is not us platoon but okay 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.020
 even the chief of police officers this week 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.810
 Come and see another trailer showing 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.130
 a little for you now from the career of 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.600
 entrepreneur 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.000
 then we will be there doing the last 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.400
 analysis of the careers trailers right 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.440
 probably will have three more still only 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.530
 that of the game even without being separated by 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.380
 career then we are waiting for this 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.030
 It was another analysis for you there. 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.949
 below the description will have a link 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.960
 where it will take you to a website where 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:24.389
 You will be able to see a story made 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.220
 by the sims of the new expansion is well 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.260
 short but at the same time very cool 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.389
 if you liked the project, leave the 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.320
 joinha to help spread the word 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:34.289
 share with your friends on networks 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.030

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.010
 to have more news still the two 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.260
 I've been here four times. 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.820
 a big hug to all of you too

 and until the next video bye
