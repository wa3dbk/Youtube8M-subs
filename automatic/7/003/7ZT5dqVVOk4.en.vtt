00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.130 

now<00:00:03.949> let's<00:00:04.279> adjust<00:00:04.850> this<00:00:05.060> animation<00:00:05.540> just<00:00:06.020> a

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:06.140 
now let's adjust this animation just a

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.220 
now let's adjust this animation just a
little<00:00:06.410> bit<00:00:06.590> here<00:00:06.950> and<00:00:07.120> I<00:00:08.120> want<00:00:08.660> to<00:00:08.750> point<00:00:09.080> out

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:09.230 
little bit here and I want to point out

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.660 
little bit here and I want to point out
something<00:00:09.500> about<00:00:09.800> the<00:00:09.920> keyframes<00:00:10.370> that<00:00:10.550> we've

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
something about the keyframes that we've

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.730 
something about the keyframes that we've
generated<00:00:11.090> here<00:00:11.420> let's<00:00:11.960> look<00:00:12.110> for<00:00:12.350> I<00:00:12.380> think

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
generated here let's look for I think

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.140 
generated here let's look for I think
there<00:00:12.860> was<00:00:12.980> a<00:00:13.010> place<00:00:13.280> where<00:00:13.310> the<00:00:13.670> hip<00:00:13.850> thrust

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
there was a place where the hip thrust

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.570 
there was a place where the hip thrust
was<00:00:14.360> kind<00:00:14.600> of<00:00:14.720> exaggerated<00:00:15.559> where<00:00:16.279> we're

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
was kind of exaggerated where we're

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.000 
was kind of exaggerated where we're
really<00:00:16.789> kind<00:00:17.119> of<00:00:17.410> right<00:00:18.410> there<00:00:18.529> i<00:00:18.590> think<00:00:18.890> it

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
really kind of right there i think it

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.970 
really kind of right there i think it
was<00:00:19.419> these<00:00:20.419> keyframes<00:00:20.779> that<00:00:21.289> we<00:00:21.380> generated

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
was these keyframes that we generated

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.189 
was these keyframes that we generated
here<00:00:22.310> are<00:00:22.489> exactly<00:00:23.390> the<00:00:23.570> same<00:00:23.599> types<00:00:24.050> of

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
here are exactly the same types of

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.200 
here are exactly the same types of
keyframes<00:00:24.589> as<00:00:24.919> any<00:00:25.099> other<00:00:25.189> key<00:00:25.579> frame<00:00:25.880> that<00:00:26.089> we

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
keyframes as any other key frame that we

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.050 
keyframes as any other key frame that we
generate<00:00:26.449> in<00:00:26.869> After<00:00:27.560> Effects<00:00:27.890> and<00:00:28.039> we<00:00:28.759> can

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
generate in After Effects and we can

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.659 
generate in After Effects and we can
subsequently<00:00:29.890> modify<00:00:30.890> them<00:00:31.159> in<00:00:31.310> just<00:00:31.489> the

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
subsequently modify them in just the

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.090 
subsequently modify them in just the
same<00:00:31.699> ways<00:00:32.119> so<00:00:32.750> if<00:00:32.930> we<00:00:33.020> zoom<00:00:33.170> in<00:00:33.649> on<00:00:33.860> this

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
same ways so if we zoom in on this

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.450 
same ways so if we zoom in on this
there's<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:35.210> actual<00:00:35.480> keyframe<00:00:35.930> there<00:00:36.170> and

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
there's the actual keyframe there and

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.910 
there's the actual keyframe there and
let's<00:00:37.460> go<00:00:37.579> back<00:00:37.789> to<00:00:37.910> this<00:00:38.030> tool<00:00:38.269> and<00:00:38.570> we<00:00:39.530> select

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
let's go back to this tool and we select

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.009 
let's go back to this tool and we select
those<00:00:40.160> two<00:00:40.430> keyframes<00:00:40.670> you<00:00:41.420> see<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:41.690> motion

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019 
those two keyframes you see the motion

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:44.020 
those two keyframes you see the motion
path<00:00:42.260> for<00:00:42.530> one<00:00:42.710> of<00:00:42.769> them<00:00:42.890> there<00:00:43.100> at<00:00:43.190> least<00:00:43.399> we

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
path for one of them there at least we

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.660 
path for one of them there at least we
can<00:00:44.300> just<00:00:44.870> adjust<00:00:45.079> that<00:00:45.590> position<00:00:46.190> by<00:00:46.399> just

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
can just adjust that position by just

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.790 
can just adjust that position by just
dragging<00:00:46.879> the<00:00:47.179> keyframes<00:00:47.660> around<00:00:48.079> in<00:00:48.620> this

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
dragging the keyframes around in this

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.770 
dragging the keyframes around in this
case<00:00:48.980> we're<00:00:49.160> tracking<00:00:49.339> both<00:00:49.699> together<00:00:49.969> to

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
case we're tracking both together to

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.119 
case we're tracking both together to
just<00:00:50.989> fix<00:00:51.230> that<00:00:51.469> little<00:00:51.769> bit<00:00:51.949> of<00:00:51.980> the

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
just fix that little bit of the

00:00:52.129 --> 00:01:04.570 
just fix that little bit of the
animation

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.130 

so<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.730> a<00:01:05.790> little<00:01:05.820> exaggerated<00:01:06.570> there<00:01:06.960> as

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
so it's a little exaggerated there as

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.830 
so it's a little exaggerated there as
well<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:08.130> we'll<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.520> swing<00:01:09.390> these<00:01:09.570> back<00:01:09.810> a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
well so we'll just swing these back a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:26.270 
well so we'll just swing these back a
little<00:01:10.230> bit<00:01:10.470> like<00:01:10.800> so<00:01:21.050> alright<00:01:22.050> there<00:01:22.229> we<00:01:22.260> go

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.730 

so<00:01:27.280> these<00:01:27.520> keyframes<00:01:27.790> can<00:01:28.360> be<00:01:28.660> adjusted<00:01:29.170> in

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
so these keyframes can be adjusted in

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.770 
so these keyframes can be adjusted in
exactly<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:30.400> same<00:01:30.430> way<00:01:30.640> as<00:01:31.060> any<00:01:31.090> other<00:01:31.420> type

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
exactly the same way as any other type

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.410 
exactly the same way as any other type
of<00:01:31.810> key<00:01:32.080> frame<00:01:32.380> in<00:01:32.560> here<00:01:32.830> we<00:01:33.310> can<00:01:33.580> modify<00:01:33.970> them

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
of key frame in here we can modify them

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.960 
of key frame in here we can modify them
by<00:01:34.900> changing<00:01:35.530> their<00:01:35.650> properties<00:01:36.190> we<00:01:36.760> can

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
by changing their properties we can

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.430 
by changing their properties we can
apply<00:01:37.150> Eazy<00:01:37.480> E's<00:01:37.750> to<00:01:37.930> them<00:01:38.050> we<00:01:38.170> could<00:01:38.320> even

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
apply Eazy E's to them we could even

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.380 
apply Eazy E's to them we could even
make<00:01:38.680> these<00:01:38.830> hold<00:01:39.130> key<00:01:39.460> frames<00:01:39.790> if<00:01:40.000> we<00:01:40.120> wanted

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
make these hold key frames if we wanted

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.460 
make these hold key frames if we wanted
to<00:01:40.450> actually<00:01:40.810> as<00:01:41.350> we<00:01:41.530> saw<00:01:41.710> before<00:01:42.300> because

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
to actually as we saw before because

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.860 
to actually as we saw before because
these<00:01:44.470> are<00:01:44.950> standard<00:01:45.670> key<00:01:45.850> frames<00:01:46.120> so<00:01:46.600> if<00:01:46.750> we

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
these are standard key frames so if we

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.750 
these are standard key frames so if we
wanted<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:47.320> jump<00:01:47.830> from<00:01:48.130> position<00:01:48.640> to<00:01:48.670> position

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
wanted to jump from position to position

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.610 
wanted to jump from position to position
here<00:01:49.360> instead<00:01:49.780> of<00:01:49.840> moving<00:01:50.020> in<00:01:50.290> a<00:01:50.350> smooth

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
here instead of moving in a smooth

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.680 
here instead of moving in a smooth
linear<00:01:51.010> way<00:01:51.250> we<00:01:51.760> could<00:01:51.940> do<00:01:52.060> that<00:01:52.090> by<00:01:52.450> changing

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
linear way we could do that by changing

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.240 
linear way we could do that by changing
these<00:01:52.930> two<00:01:53.080> hold<00:01:53.260> key<00:01:53.470> frames<00:01:53.740> if<00:01:53.890> we<00:01:54.010> chose<00:01:54.220> to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
these two hold key frames if we chose to

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.620 
these two hold key frames if we chose to
do<00:01:54.550> that<00:01:54.730> so<00:01:55.390> now<00:01:56.110> let's<00:01:56.380> go<00:01:56.740> back<00:01:57.010> to<00:01:57.310> our<00:01:57.850> arm

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
do that so now let's go back to our arm

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.000 
do that so now let's go back to our arm
up<00:01:59.050> here<00:01:59.410> let's<00:02:00.310> go<00:02:00.430> back<00:02:00.580> to<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.790> beginning

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
up here let's go back to the beginning

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.550 
up here let's go back to the beginning
God<00:02:03.010> is<00:02:03.130> going<00:02:03.310> in<00:02:03.520> back<00:02:03.700> here<00:02:03.970> and<00:02:04.470> what<00:02:05.470> we're

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
God is going in back here and what we're

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.650 
God is going in back here and what we're
going<00:02:05.650> to<00:02:05.770> do<00:02:05.890> now<00:02:06.100> is<00:02:06.490> just<00:02:06.850> set<00:02:07.420> some

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
going to do now is just set some

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.440 
going to do now is just set some
keyframes<00:02:08.080> for<00:02:08.320> that<00:02:08.649> arm<00:02:08.920> animation<00:02:09.790> to

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
keyframes for that arm animation to

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.410 
keyframes for that arm animation to
finish<00:02:11.440> up<00:02:11.650> actually<00:02:12.130> for<00:02:12.280> both<00:02:12.400> arms<00:02:12.730> to

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
finish up actually for both arms to

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.350 
finish up actually for both arms to
finish<00:02:13.840> up<00:02:14.080> this<00:02:14.740> part<00:02:15.430> of<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.670> animation<00:02:16.180> and

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
finish up this part of the animation and

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.790 
finish up this part of the animation and
then<00:02:16.450> we<00:02:16.540> can<00:02:16.720> bring<00:02:16.900> his<00:02:17.050> girlfriend<00:02:17.200> in<00:02:17.650> and

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
then we can bring his girlfriend in and

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.500

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
let's just give that a quick preview and

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.130 
let's just give that a quick preview and
see<00:03:18.890> how<00:03:18.980> that<00:03:19.190> looks<00:03:22.660> see<00:03:23.660> his<00:03:23.780> arm<00:03:23.959> is<00:03:24.110> a

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
see how that looks see his arm is a

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.660 
see how that looks see his arm is a
little<00:03:24.200> bit<00:03:24.590> rubbery<00:03:24.920> there<00:03:25.400> we<00:03:25.520> could

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
little bit rubbery there we could

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.280 
little bit rubbery there we could
stiffen<00:03:26.120> that<00:03:26.150> up<00:03:26.360> with<00:03:26.540> some<00:03:26.690> starch<00:03:27.020> but<00:03:27.260> I

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
stiffen that up with some starch but I

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
think it's actually going to be okay for

00:03:28.640 --> 00:04:24.170 
think it's actually going to be okay for
our<00:03:28.910> purposes
