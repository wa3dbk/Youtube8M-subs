when<00:02:14.680> I<00:02:14.710> actually<00:02:14.920> first<00:02:15.280> saw<00:02:15.550> this<00:02:15.760> set<00:02:15.970> of

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
when I actually first saw this set of

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.360 
when I actually first saw this set of
memory<00:02:16.450> come<00:02:17.050> into<00:02:17.260> our<00:02:17.290> offices<00:02:17.830> I<00:02:18.010> did

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
memory come into our offices I did

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.010 
memory come into our offices I did
notice<00:02:18.520> that<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.880> heat<00:02:19.060> spreader<00:02:19.390> design<00:02:19.810> is

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
notice that the heat spreader design is

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.810 
notice that the heat spreader design is
a<00:02:20.050> lot<00:02:20.290> like<00:02:20.620> memory<00:02:21.250> that<00:02:21.400> I've<00:02:21.490> seen<00:02:21.640> in<00:02:21.790> the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
a lot like memory that I've seen in the

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.820 
a lot like memory that I've seen in the
past<00:02:21.880> for<00:02:22.300> a<00:02:22.330> manufacturer<00:02:22.990> such<00:02:23.200> as<00:02:23.380> Kingston

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
past for a manufacturer such as Kingston

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.190 
past for a manufacturer such as Kingston
they<00:02:24.250> do<00:02:24.310> generally<00:02:25.000> use<00:02:25.240> a<00:02:25.540> blue<00:02:26.020> heat

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
they do generally use a blue heat

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.560 
they do generally use a blue heat
spreader<00:02:26.500> with<00:02:26.710> these<00:02:27.130> tall<00:02:27.670> thin<00:02:28.210> designs

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
spreader with these tall thin designs

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.390 
spreader with these tall thin designs
and<00:02:28.780> from<00:02:29.530> some<00:02:29.770> of<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.890> tests<00:02:30.190> that<00:02:30.220> we've

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
and from some of the tests that we've

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.040 
and from some of the tests that we've
actually<00:02:30.550> done<00:02:30.850> in<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.030> past<00:02:31.240> with<00:02:31.510> various

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
actually done in the past with various

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.960 
actually done in the past with various
different<00:02:32.380> sets<00:02:32.590> of<00:02:32.710> memory<00:02:33.130> we<00:02:33.430> have<00:02:33.580> noticed

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
different sets of memory we have noticed

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.910 
different sets of memory we have noticed
that<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.540> heat<00:02:34.930> spreaders<00:02:35.350> with<00:02:35.500> these<00:02:35.680> two

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
that the heat spreaders with these two

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.520 
that the heat spreaders with these two
fins<00:02:36.250> are<00:02:36.690> fantastic<00:02:37.690> for<00:02:37.720> heat<00:02:38.050> dissipation

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
fins are fantastic for heat dissipation

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.530 
fins are fantastic for heat dissipation
so<00:02:39.100> we<00:02:39.220> can<00:02:39.340> understand<00:02:39.760> why<00:02:39.910> Patriot<00:02:40.420> have

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
so we can understand why Patriot have

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.660 
so we can understand why Patriot have
gone<00:02:40.720> with<00:02:40.930> this<00:02:41.350> design<00:02:41.650> instead<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.160> a<00:02:42.220> low

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
gone with this design instead of a low

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:51.900 
gone with this design instead of a low
profile<00:02:43.210> heat<00:02:43.420> spreader<00:02:43.720> instead

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:03:07.630 

you

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.090 

I'd<00:03:08.630> really<00:03:09.110> like<00:03:09.290> this<00:03:09.470> set<00:03:09.710> of<00:03:09.800> memory

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
I'd really like this set of memory

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.040 
I'd really like this set of memory
modules<00:03:10.460> the<00:03:10.670> whole<00:03:10.880> overall<00:03:11.360> design<00:03:11.780> of<00:03:11.810> the

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
modules the whole overall design of the

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.449 
modules the whole overall design of the
heatsink<00:03:12.470> is<00:03:12.590> really<00:03:12.830> nice<00:03:12.950> with<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.340> blue

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
heatsink is really nice with the blue

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.400 
heatsink is really nice with the blue
and<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.910> Patriot<00:03:14.300> logo<00:03:14.569> on<00:03:14.720> there<00:03:14.870> some

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
and the Patriot logo on there some

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.410 
and the Patriot logo on there some
people<00:03:15.709> may<00:03:15.830> have<00:03:15.860> some<00:03:16.160> issues<00:03:16.280> with<00:03:16.490> Clement

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
people may have some issues with Clement

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.030 
people may have some issues with Clement
so<00:03:17.569> because<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.140> heat<00:03:18.319> spreaders<00:03:18.740> have<00:03:18.890> got

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
so because the heat spreaders have got

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.130 
so because the heat spreaders have got
the<00:03:19.160> fins<00:03:19.430> on<00:03:19.610> top<00:03:19.819> there<00:03:20.360> may<00:03:20.510> be<00:03:20.540> some<00:03:20.840> issues

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
the fins on top there may be some issues

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.530 
the fins on top there may be some issues
with<00:03:21.170> regards<00:03:21.709> to<00:03:21.770> heat<00:03:22.670> sink<00:03:22.940> or<00:03:23.150> putting

with<00:03:56.959> regards<00:03:57.290> to<00:03:57.320> the<00:03:57.440> benchmarks<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:58.010> can

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
with regards to the benchmarks you can

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.949 
with regards to the benchmarks you can
see<00:03:58.340> that<00:03:58.489> it<00:03:58.580> did<00:03:58.730> give<00:03:58.940> fantastic<00:03:59.600> results

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
see that it did give fantastic results

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.490 
see that it did give fantastic results
and<00:04:00.140> it<00:04:00.230> has<00:04:00.380> really<00:04:00.590> solid<00:04:01.489> type<00:04:01.940> low<00:04:02.630> timings

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
and it has really solid type low timings

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.949 
and it has really solid type low timings
as<00:04:03.680> well<00:04:03.860> this<00:04:04.250> memory<00:04:04.820> module<00:04:05.120> set<00:04:05.330> is<00:04:05.540> a<00:04:05.720> low

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
as well this memory module set is a low

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.960 
as well this memory module set is a low
latency<00:04:06.500> set<00:04:06.769> so<00:04:07.130> you<00:04:07.220> can<00:04:07.370> see<00:04:07.580> straight<00:04:07.850> away

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
latency set so you can see straight away

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.699 
latency set so you can see straight away
that<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.330> time<00:04:08.540> is<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:08.900> even<00:04:09.200> the<00:04:09.290> voltages

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
that the time is and even the voltages

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.370 
that the time is and even the voltages
are<00:04:09.890> very<00:04:10.430> very<00:04:10.940> low<00:04:11.209> there's<00:04:11.780> no<00:04:11.930> school<00:04:12.200> that

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
are very very low there's no school that

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.229 
are very very low there's no school that
I<00:04:12.440> can<00:04:12.680> give<00:04:12.799> this<00:04:12.950> other<00:04:13.250> than<00:04:13.340> five<00:04:14.030> out<00:04:14.209> of

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
I can give this other than five out of

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:22.400 
I can give this other than five out of
five<00:04:14.420> stars
