00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
here this is actually the actual kit for

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.220 
here this is actually the actual kit for
the<00:00:38.710> iPad<00:00:39.010> Mini<00:00:39.310> and<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.780> way<00:00:40.900> that<00:00:41.110> these

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
the iPad Mini and the way that these

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.160 
the iPad Mini and the way that these
work<00:00:41.290> is<00:00:41.740> they<00:00:41.860> have<00:00:42.070> a<00:00:42.390> flange<00:00:43.390> on<00:00:43.630> the<00:00:43.750> inside

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
work is they have a flange on the inside

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.150 
work is they have a flange on the inside
edge<00:00:44.970> ok<00:00:45.970> which<00:00:46.690> does<00:00:46.870> allow<00:00:47.020> the<00:00:47.200> tablet<00:00:48.070> to

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
edge ok which does allow the tablet to

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.310 
edge ok which does allow the tablet to
come<00:00:48.340> through<00:00:48.670> you<00:00:49.270> typically<00:00:49.660> would<00:00:49.960> cut

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
come through you typically would cut

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.100 
come through you typically would cut
either<00:00:50.500> a<00:00:50.620> top<00:00:50.950> edge<00:00:51.280> or<00:00:51.610> a<00:00:51.670> side<00:00:52.210> edge<00:00:52.480> off<00:00:52.810> and

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
either a top edge or a side edge off and

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.830 
either a top edge or a side edge off and
then<00:00:53.200> it<00:00:53.320> will<00:00:53.410> create<00:00:53.680> a<00:00:54.040> perfect<00:00:54.610> dock<00:00:55.090> for

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
then it will create a perfect dock for

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.100 
then it will create a perfect dock for
your<00:00:56.740> iPad<00:00:57.400> then<00:00:58.030> we<00:00:58.180> took<00:00:58.390> one<00:00:58.660> that<00:00:58.780> we<00:00:58.870> made

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
your iPad then we took one that we made

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.600 
your iPad then we took one that we made
for<00:00:59.470> the<00:01:00.360> iPad<00:01:01.360> air<00:01:01.990> and<00:01:02.740> you<00:01:02.830> can<00:01:03.040> see<00:01:03.280> here<00:01:03.490> it

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
for the iPad air and you can see here it

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.300 
for the iPad air and you can see here it
creates<00:01:03.790> a<00:01:04.299> creates<00:01:05.229> a<00:01:05.350> groove<00:01:05.710> that<00:01:06.159> the

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
creates a creates a groove that the

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.709 
creates a creates a groove that the
actual<00:01:06.609> iPad<00:01:07.090> can<00:01:07.390> sit<00:01:07.719> in<00:01:07.960> ok<00:01:08.679> and<00:01:09.719> we

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:10.719 
actual iPad can sit in ok and we

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:13.109 
actual iPad can sit in ok and we
basically<00:01:11.170> will<00:01:11.740> be<00:01:11.799> done<00:01:12.189> is<00:01:12.579> to<00:01:12.640> show<00:01:13.000> how

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
basically will be done is to show how

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.200 
basically will be done is to show how
that<00:01:13.179> works<00:01:13.509> a<00:01:13.719> little<00:01:13.929> bit<00:01:14.079> is<00:01:14.609> we<00:01:15.609> have<00:01:15.640> a

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
that works a little bit is we have a

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.520 
that works a little bit is we have a
dash<00:01:16.509> here<00:01:16.899> for<00:01:17.229> a<00:01:17.259> 2012<00:01:18.189> Toyota<00:01:18.520> Camry<00:01:18.789> and<00:01:19.530> we

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
dash here for a 2012 Toyota Camry and we

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.700 
dash here for a 2012 Toyota Camry and we
actually<00:01:20.920> took<00:01:21.159> the<00:01:21.939> mini<00:01:22.210> kit<00:01:22.539> and<00:01:22.780> we<00:01:23.380> cut

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
actually took the mini kit and we cut

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.520 
actually took the mini kit and we cut
the<00:01:24.009> top<00:01:24.219> edge<00:01:24.490> off<00:01:24.789> and<00:01:25.179> we<00:01:25.780> cut<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.109> backing

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
the top edge off and we cut the backing

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.230 
the top edge off and we cut the backing
plate<00:01:26.770> out<00:01:26.950> for<00:01:27.189> the<00:01:27.280> double<00:01:27.549> din<00:01:27.700> to<00:01:27.880> still<00:01:28.179> be

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
plate out for the double din to still be

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.620 
plate out for the double din to still be
mounted<00:01:28.539> behind<00:01:28.659> it<00:01:29.049> and<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:30.340> mini<00:01:30.579> will<00:01:31.450> just

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
mounted behind it and the mini will just

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.590 
mounted behind it and the mini will just
drop<00:01:31.840> right<00:01:31.899> down<00:01:32.319> right<00:01:32.679> in<00:01:33.189> front<00:01:33.429> of<00:01:33.520> it<00:01:33.640> ok

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.779 
drop right down right in front of it ok
and<00:01:34.630> then<00:01:34.810> it<00:01:34.899> comes<00:01:35.229> back<00:01:35.380> out<00:01:35.770> now<00:01:36.460> for<00:01:36.549> the
