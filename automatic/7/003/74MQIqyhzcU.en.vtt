machine sound power is a piece of
software<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.730> enables<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.360> route<00:00:33.870> audio

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
software that enables you to route audio

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.430 
software that enables you to route audio
within<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.489> Mac<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:36.239> different<00:00:36.660> locations

within the Mac to different locations
this<00:00:37.890> makes<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.280> great<00:00:38.550> for<00:00:38.790> recording<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
this makes it great for recording the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.750 
this makes it great for recording the
output<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.440> various<00:00:40.860> audio<00:00:41.190> programs

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
sound flower now active and the output

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.990 
sound flower now active and the output
set<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.989> my<00:00:49.140> built-in<00:00:49.320> output<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:50.160> can<00:00:50.640> go<00:00:50.940> to

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
route the output to sound flower so you

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.170 
route the output to sound flower so you
can<00:00:57.870> see<00:00:58.020> here<00:00:58.199> sampler<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.920> channel<00:00:59.370> well

my computer system will be routed via
sound<00:01:07.830> flower<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.820> now<00:01:09.090> means<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.840> can

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
sound flower this now means that I can

choose sound flower as an input on

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.100 
choose sound flower as an input on
machine<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.140> record<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.479> do<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.840> I

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.890 
machine and record it so to do this I
need<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.560> bring<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.920> machine<00:01:17.189> software

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
need to bring up the machine software

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.620 
need to bring up the machine software
and<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:19.020> need<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.350> go<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.590> file<00:01:20.430> audio<00:01:21.210> MIDI

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
and I need to go to file audio MIDI

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.109 
and I need to go to file audio MIDI
settings<00:01:21.930> have<00:01:22.650> changed<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:23.040> routing<00:01:23.460> device

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
to sound flower to channel and make sure

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.940 
to sound flower to channel and make sure
that<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.070> audio<00:01:29.729> inputs<00:01:30.240> are<00:01:30.479> set<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.229> sound

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
that the audio inputs are set to sound

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.920 
that the audio inputs are set to sound
flower<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.850> channel<00:01:33.210> there<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.450> go<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.659> can

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
flower to channel there you go you can

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.679 
flower to channel there you go you can
see<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.500> input<00:01:34.710> there<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.369> now<00:01:35.729> setup<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.630> I'm

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
see the input there is now setup so I'm

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.920 
see the input there is now setup so I'm
now<00:01:36.810> going<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.990> set<00:01:37.200> up<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.380> new<00:01:37.560> group<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:38.040> e<00:01:38.430> and

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
now going to set up a new group on e and

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.630 
now going to set up a new group on e and
go<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:39.990> my<00:01:40.170> sampling<00:01:40.619> page<00:01:40.860> now<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.430> see

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
go to my sampling page now you can see

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.670 
go to my sampling page now you can see
here<00:01:41.850> on<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> left<00:01:42.210> screen<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:43.170> currently<00:01:43.560> we

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
here on the left screen but currently we

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.649 
here on the left screen but currently we
have<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.890> source<00:01:44.100> set<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.520> internal<00:01:44.670> by

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
have the source set to internal by

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.649 
have the source set to internal by
switching<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.290> across<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:47.240> can<00:01:48.240> set<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.509> to

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
switching this across I can set this to

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.200 
switching this across I can set this to
an<00:01:48.750> external<00:01:49.079> stereo<00:01:49.680> input<00:01:50.100> now<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.820> can<00:01:51.030> see

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
an external stereo input now you can see

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.120 
an external stereo input now you can see
here<00:01:51.420> as<00:01:51.540> well<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.409> can<00:01:52.560> either<00:01:52.710> have<00:01:53.009> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
here as well that I can either have the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.730 
here as well that I can either have the
sample<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.549> working<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.030> sync<00:01:54.479> with<00:01:55.229> machine

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
sample of working in sync with machine

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.800 
sample of working in sync with machine
so<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.100> when<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.219> hit<00:01:56.430> play<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:57.270> will<00:01:57.420> start<00:01:57.689> to

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
so that when I hit play it will start to

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.789 
so that when I hit play it will start to
sample<00:01:58.310> or<00:01:59.310> we<00:01:59.610> can<00:01:59.759> have<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.000> set<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.570> detect

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
sample or we can have this set to detect

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.679 
sample or we can have this set to detect
which<00:02:01.799> works<00:02:02.159> by<00:02:02.490> detecting<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.090> audio<00:02:03.479> input

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
which works by detecting the audio input

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.109 
which works by detecting the audio input
level<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.350> triggering<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.430> recording<00:02:05.969> as

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
level and triggering the recording as

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.719 
level and triggering the recording as
soon<00:02:06.600> as<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.810> level<00:02:07.079> threshold<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.649> met<00:02:07.729> now

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
soon as the level threshold is met now

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.210 
soon as the level threshold is met now
on<00:02:08.940> top<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.420> as<00:02:09.599> well<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:10.200> can<00:02:10.679> also<00:02:10.830> under

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
on top of that as well I can also under

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.070 
on top of that as well I can also under
sink<00:02:11.459> mode<00:02:11.700> set<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.540> length<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.959> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
sink mode set the length of the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.360 
sink mode set the length of the
sample<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:13.650> for<00:02:13.800> example<00:02:14.160> if<00:02:14.250> you're

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
sample so for example if you're

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.390 
sample so for example if you're
recording<00:02:15.050> loops<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.650> can<00:02:16.680> set<00:02:16.890> it's<00:02:17.010> one<00:02:17.220> to

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
recording loops you can set it's one to

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.850
