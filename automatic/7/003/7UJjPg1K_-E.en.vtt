devices which is fantastic so I'm just

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.700 
devices which is fantastic so I'm just
disconnected<00:00:26.490> here<00:00:29.900> Carly<00:00:30.900> made<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.590> at<00:00:31.650> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
disconnected here Carly made so at the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.560 
disconnected here Carly made so at the
moment<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.130> connected<00:00:32.610> by<00:00:32.640> one<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.420> these

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
moment it's connected by one of these

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.860 
moment it's connected by one of these
connectors<00:00:34.170> which<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.309> hooked<00:00:35.700> into<00:00:35.969> my<00:00:36.180> PC

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
connectors which is hooked into my PC

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.170 
connectors which is hooked into my PC
via<00:00:37.710> USB<00:00:39.710> so<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.770> used<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.129> apply<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.489> connector

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
via USB so I used to apply to connector

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.869 
via USB so I used to apply to connector
back<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.140> there<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.739> then<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.129> will<00:00:44.370> take<00:00:44.670> it

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
back in there and then that will take it

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.360 
back in there and then that will take it
to<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.329> USB<00:00:45.690> connection<00:00:46.110> but<00:00:46.770> if<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.129> don't

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
have a laptop or a PC on to hand you can

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.930 
have a laptop or a PC on to hand you can
connect<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.850> an<00:00:51.300> old-fashioned<00:00:52.879> what<00:00:53.879> are

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
connect it to an old-fashioned what are

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.819 
connect it to an old-fashioned what are
these<00:00:54.030> called<00:00:54.210> second<00:00:54.690> connectors<00:00:55.140> yes<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.739> if

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
these called second connectors yes so if

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
don't worry because it also comes the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.460 
don't worry because it also comes the
Lightning<00:01:08.939> connector<00:01:09.090> which<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.020> awesome

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
Lightning connector which is awesome

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.620 
Lightning connector which is awesome
because<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.520> can<00:01:11.700> connect<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.360> your

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
because you can connect it to your

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.230 
because you can connect it to your
iPhone<00:01:13.200> obviously<00:01:13.799> or<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.310> new<00:01:14.640> version<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.060> an

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
iPhone obviously or a new version of an

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.929 
iPhone obviously or a new version of an
iPad<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.830> get<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.040> really<00:01:17.430> good<00:01:17.729> solid

iPad and you get a really good solid
digital<00:01:18.509> connection<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.259> don't<00:01:19.530> get<00:01:19.650> a

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
digital connection so you don't get a

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.149 
digital connection so you don't get a
lot<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:19.979> noise<00:01:20.250> when<00:01:20.869> you<00:01:21.869> hook<00:01:22.020> things<00:01:22.590> up<00:01:22.770> you

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
lot of noise when you hook things up you

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.280 
lot of noise when you hook things up you
have<00:01:23.340> really<00:01:23.670> nice<00:01:23.820> super<00:01:24.270> clean<00:01:24.479> times<00:01:24.720> it's

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
have really nice super clean times it's

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.840 
have really nice super clean times it's
literally<00:01:25.799> very<00:01:25.950> plug-and-play<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.549> lets

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
works and then around the side there's

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.899 
works and then around the side there's
also<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.939> minion<00:01:34.759> there<00:01:36.200> which<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.650> like<00:01:38.220> cable

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
also a minion there which is like cable

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.969 
also a minion there which is like cable
all<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.119> cables<00:01:39.450> are<00:01:39.509> supplied<00:01:39.840> which<00:01:40.170> M<00:01:40.920> is

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
all the cables are supplied which M is

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.560 
all the cables are supplied which M is
handy<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.509> pop<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.259> there<00:01:43.500> and

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
handy so you just pop it in there and

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.090 
handy so you just pop it in there and
connect<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:46.020> an<00:01:46.350> older<00:01:46.649> school<00:01:46.770> MIDI

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
connect it to an older school MIDI

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.359 
connect it to an older school MIDI
device<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.759> really<00:01:48.090> all<00:01:48.270> generations<00:01:48.750> of

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
device so really all generations of

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.660 
device so really all generations of
input<00:01:50.369> are<00:01:50.689> accepted<00:01:52.040> which<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.250> very<00:01:53.460> good

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
input are accepted which is very good

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.060 
input are accepted which is very good
and<00:01:53.970> it's<00:01:54.780> powered<00:01:55.290> by<00:01:56.810> a<00:01:57.810> battery<00:01:58.079> on<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
and it's powered by a battery on the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.850 
and it's powered by a battery on the
back<00:01:59.219> there<00:02:00.170> so<00:02:01.170> it's<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.380> very<00:02:01.409> portable

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
back there so it's a very portable

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.580 
back there so it's a very portable
device<00:02:02.430> although<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.450> battery<00:02:03.840> does<00:02:04.020> pop<00:02:04.320> out

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
device although the battery does pop out

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.180 
device although the battery does pop out
a<00:02:04.799> little<00:02:04.829> bit<00:02:05.189> look<00:02:05.460> nice<00:02:06.680> secure<00:02:07.680> connection

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
a little bit look nice secure connection

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.219 
a little bit look nice secure connection
but<00:02:08.729> that's<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.030> minor<00:02:09.270> quibble<00:02:09.479> because<00:02:10.020> once

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
but that's a minor quibble because once

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.190 
but that's a minor quibble because once
you<00:02:10.410> put<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.800> air<00:02:10.979> casement<00:02:11.489> you

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
you put the air casement you

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.680 
you put the air casement you
really<00:02:12.500> have<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.520> worry<00:02:13.670> about<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.569> if

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
really have to worry about it and if

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.690 
really have to worry about it and if
you're<00:02:14.870> using<00:02:15.170> might<00:02:15.920> that<00:02:16.099> needs<00:02:16.280> a<00:02:16.340> preamp

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700
