00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello last week of this 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.799
 of the month everyone knows studio warner bros 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.910
 which for me personally lately 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.190
 associated with angry curses 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.330
 or even unknowingly found in 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.160
 courage and in order to 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.130
 place in the appstore and mortal game 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.830
 kombat x although the letter h will be more appropriate 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.109
 after this release I was naturally 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.330
 thought no spontaneous surcharge 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.830
 to paycheck or even buying a winning one 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.689
 a million dollar lottery ticket 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.330
 will not be able to save this week but 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.210
 know truly there is a god and merciful 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.010
 All births by the way Spassky with friends so 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.200
 like behind this apple product 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.540
 the store flew long-awaited play on 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.420
 dinner under the inspiring and extremely 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.579
 symbolic slogan neville braces after 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.800
 of this i believed the life is good and in huge 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.809
 pink background and so I suggest to look 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.860
 what kind of animal and what it eats it 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.860
 is he worth his money 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.000
 perhaps 1 the good news was the price 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.230
 products 599 rubles 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.240
 no no no no no no this is not sarcasm 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.220
 recently all free projects 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.650
 in the appstore is perceived with the greatest 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.930
 skepticism and the availability of the price tag on the game as 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.210
 such invigorates inspires and gives 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.610
 hope also running a little ahead 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.650
 forced to note that the studio of the river Che 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.810
 golden hands in their bins created and 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.580
 they created it was laid a lot 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.680
 temptations to wind down with 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.960
 true path by conquering armonia itself or 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.630
 I do not know to sell the soul to the devil and make 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.330
 your game is free well, you know about 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.030
 What is the first free speech 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.520
 information about the game appeared in 2013 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.470
 year at the game show in Tokyo show games 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.540
 the developers on courage promised 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.250
 innovative console graphics in 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.600
 great gameplay and astra 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.509
 plot twists and turns 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.610
 the next morning pretty sober they remembered 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.280
 all that they have promised they grabbed 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.920
 heads fired the speaker and assiduously 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.990
 set to work, otherwise how else can 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.540
 explain the partisan silence which 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.730
 lasted more than a year at last the game 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.400
 appeared in the appstore but throws it out 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.710
 black horse 599 rubles at least 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.050
 stupid since it's about twenty five 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.940
 packs of delicious noodles on this 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.680
 food can live about two 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.319
 weeks so i started carefully 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.130
 read the comments you know generally nifiga 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.650
 not understood 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.500
 some are shouting a bomb tin fire swing up 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.690
 end others spat cried spewed 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.720
 other liquid masses from the body are therefore 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.760
 I begged 600 rubles from the editorial board and started 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.410
 watch 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.910
 according to the storyline of the game 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.250
 flows in the distant future 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.050
 alien mind still got to 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.959
 our blooming planets began to kill 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.030
 bring down know in every way excesses and 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.990
 not even the mighty all-powerful Americans 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.660
 were able to fight back 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.670
 absolutely everyone died only a small 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.380
 a group of survivors managed to escape into space 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.990
 to somehow keep the memory of 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.090
 a good name of a man passed some 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.130
 there years and the survivors managed to make 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.740
 innovative combat suit in armies 3 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.520
 believed in themselves and decided to fight for 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.220
 their homeland 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.210
 we in turn play for the young 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.220
 a guy named jake who 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.930
 and was afraid to get into fashionable suits in 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.180
 kick ass all alone 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.890
 apparently Ombre 1 great-grandson of chuck norris 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.840
 Having passed the first two missions I am a little 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.760
 disappointed because it was thought that 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.420
 before us the next banal happens 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.640
 just rubbish 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.800
 running yourself on locations waving 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.320
 metal limbs and fiercely topoy 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.070
 on the lower right corner of your device 3 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.440
 boredom 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.330
 nevertheless, a little later, I realized that 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.550
 for greater productivity, press on 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.680
 attack button you need to meaningfully with 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.690
 harmony and endurance as in this 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.540
 case of more painful 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.730
 combo attacks and it already somehow deprives 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.620
 the game of dull mechanics that ptu screw still 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.720
 a little later, the management explained that 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.720
 fur is equipped with high-tech 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.430
 ranged weapon and added that this 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.020
 most weapons can be used by 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.240
 self discretion 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.310
 like little things but even after that 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.650
 gameplay no longer seemed so 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.000
 dull beyond that the levels themselves are not 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.200
 confined meaninglessly and 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.960
 stabbing and with a huge amount 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.640
 meat and cadavers from time to time we need 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.260
 will hold the control point not 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.960
 let rivals cross the line 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.610
 front to collect the necessary artifacts a 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.320
 the end of each level will be waiting for us 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.340
 great varnish and sweet mouthwatering 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.710
 grannies 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.290
 pronounced large toothy creatures 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.180
 incomprehensible form 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.590
 Yes, where are you going ? I have no vodka 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.280
 against two puja dragging 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.390
 so hide your hand will hit you 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.340
 It should be noted that some bosses 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.260
 truly strong and indeed 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.540
 developers do not particularly cherish patience 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.180
 users example of this kid here I 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.910
 probably gone from 10 to 10 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:55.010
 same dota 5k mmr so who thinks that 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.010
 iraq let the gadget throw me first 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.020
 Of course in the game there was a place for 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.640
 detailed rpg component which 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.100
 expressed in the acquisition of new skills 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.290
 buying new more modernized 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.970
 fur of and and so forth let it not be you 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.740
 How much does not bother game currency 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.780
 easy to farm and after purchase 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.570
 developers will not require you a single 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.650
 From weight they not such as these bad 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.990
 uncle geymloft 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.150
 in my opinion we play on dinner nebulus 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.040
 Hope is justified and good 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.450
 folded in the first days after release 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.980
 many had some problems with 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.260
 optimization complained about low 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.480
 resolution pictures and other bag of bugs 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.510
 I personally play on the first generation ipad 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.280
 and the flight is completely normal even though I am not 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.320
 I find all this romance in anime style 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.690
 sure that a similar fitting 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.980
 very much will like 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.260
 the aesthetic component of the game is 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.300
 at the perfect level for sound 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.830
 moments answered john hen lander who 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.670
 time gave us where the sound 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.310
 lord of the rings 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:11.770
 I somehow trust this man not 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.020
 I know personally for me the game did not go 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.670
 not one wasted ruble wasted 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.470
 write your opinion on this 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.030

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:23.250

 worthy games to everyone bye
