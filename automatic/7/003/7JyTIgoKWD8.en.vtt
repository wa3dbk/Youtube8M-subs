of samples back from the factory and

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.270 
of samples back from the factory and
here's<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.259> first<00:00:07.440> one<00:00:07.589> we<00:00:07.710> got<00:00:07.740> this<00:00:08.069> one's

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
here's the first one we got this one's

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.370 
here's the first one we got this one's
to<00:00:08.340> show<00:00:08.460> you<00:00:08.519> this<00:00:08.730> you<00:00:09.660> can<00:00:09.690> see<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.050> colors

to show you this you can see the colors

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.039 
to show you this you can see the colors
they<00:00:11.099> look<00:00:11.250> pretty<00:00:11.400> good<00:00:11.519> unless<00:00:12.240> looks<00:00:12.780> about

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
they look pretty good unless looks about

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.480 
they look pretty good unless looks about
what<00:00:13.200> we'd<00:00:13.320> expect<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.889> be<00:00:14.009> like<00:00:14.040> you<00:00:14.370> can

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
what we'd expect it to be like you can

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.740 
what we'd expect it to be like you can
also<00:00:14.610> get<00:00:14.700> an<00:00:14.820> idea<00:00:14.880> for<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.269> size<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.660> this

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
also get an idea for the size of this

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.359 
also get an idea for the size of this
based<00:00:15.990> on<00:00:16.080> this<00:00:16.199> table<00:00:16.350> here<00:00:16.650> one<00:00:17.190> thing<00:00:17.310> I

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
based on this table here one thing I

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.939 
based on this table here one thing I
didn't<00:00:17.580> like<00:00:17.609> about<00:00:17.699> this<00:00:18.029> one<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:18.449> the

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
didn't like about this one is that the

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.790 
didn't like about this one is that the
neoprene<00:00:19.949> on<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.340> it's<00:00:20.550> good<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.210> it's<00:00:22.109> the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
neoprene on it it's good and it's the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.050 
neoprene on it it's good and it's the
right<00:00:22.980> thickness<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.550> everything<00:00:23.850> but<00:00:23.939> it's

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
right thickness and everything but it's

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.490 
right thickness and everything but it's
a<00:00:24.119> little<00:00:24.269> bit<00:00:24.359> lightweight<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.109> then<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
a little bit lightweight and then the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.900 
a little bit lightweight and then the
main<00:00:25.680> thing<00:00:25.980> for<00:00:26.010> me<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.519> didn't<00:00:26.789> like

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
main thing for me that I didn't like

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.670 
main thing for me that I didn't like
about<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.330> was<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.630> slide<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.380> can<00:00:28.529> see

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
about it was this slide so you can see

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.960 
about it was this slide so you can see
this<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.890> just<00:00:28.949> put<00:00:29.160> my<00:00:29.279> finger<00:00:29.340> one<00:00:29.820> finger

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
this I just put my finger one finger

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.450 
this I just put my finger one finger
here<00:00:30.470> and<00:00:31.470> see<00:00:31.590> how<00:00:31.650> easily<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:32.070> slides<00:00:32.369> back

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
here and see how easily that slides back

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.910 
here and see how easily that slides back
and<00:00:32.610> forth<00:00:32.820> apologize<00:00:33.780> for<00:00:33.989> shaky<00:00:34.260> cam<00:00:34.469> here<00:00:34.710> I

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
and forth apologize for shaky cam here I

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.100 
and forth apologize for shaky cam here I
feel<00:00:35.760> like<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:35.940> got<00:00:36.059> hypoglycemia<00:00:36.780> today<00:00:36.989> or

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
feel like I got hypoglycemia today or

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.110 
feel like I got hypoglycemia today or
something<00:00:37.410> anyway<00:00:37.770> here's<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.820> other<00:00:38.940> one

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
something anyway here's the other one

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.670 
something anyway here's the other one
from<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.329> different<00:00:39.510> factory<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.050> had<00:00:40.320> them<00:00:40.469> put

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
from a different factory I had them put

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.770 
from a different factory I had them put
the<00:00:40.800> non-slip<00:00:41.370> rubber<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.360> one's<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.629> little

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
the non-slip rubber this one's a little

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.990 
the non-slip rubber this one's a little
bit<00:00:43.020> thicker<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> 2<00:00:44.820> millimeter

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
bit thicker this is a 2 millimeter

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.750 
bit thicker this is a 2 millimeter
instead<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.570> 1.5<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:47.219> can<00:00:47.370> see<00:00:47.550> it

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
instead of 1.5 and you can see it

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.029 
instead of 1.5 and you can see it
doesn't<00:00:48.059> slide<00:00:48.329> it's<00:00:49.320> also<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.590> think<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
doesn't slide it's also I think that the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.709 
doesn't slide it's also I think that the
color<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.460> little<00:00:50.579> less<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:51.149> little<00:00:51.480> bit<00:00:51.570> more

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
color is a little less a little bit more

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.869 
color is a little less a little bit more
vibrant<00:00:51.930> on<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.440> right<00:00:52.590> side<00:00:52.829> one<00:00:53.039> I'm<00:00:53.789> not

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
vibrant on the right side one I'm not

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.069 
vibrant on the right side one I'm not
sure<00:00:53.969> if<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.210> can<00:00:54.329> see<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.629> on<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.840> camera

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
sure if you can see that on that camera

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.290 
sure if you can see that on that camera
or<00:00:55.230> not<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.590> give<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.430> bit<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:56.940> an<00:00:57.030> idea

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
or not but give you a bit of an idea

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.779 
or not but give you a bit of an idea
this<00:00:57.809> one<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.109> not<00:00:58.199> going<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.469> slide<00:00:58.620> around

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
this one is not going to slide around

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.670 
this one is not going to slide around
you<00:00:59.789> can<00:00:59.910> actually<00:01:00.030> drag<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.350> see<00:01:01.530> how

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
you can actually drag it you can see how

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.080 
you can actually drag it you can see how
heavy<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.219> it's<00:01:02.399> much<00:01:02.579> heavier<00:01:02.760> than<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
heavy it is it's much heavier than the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.800 
heavy it is it's much heavier than the
other<00:01:03.120> one<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:04.760> a<00:01:05.760> better<00:01:05.909> butter<00:01:06.479> metal

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
other one and just a better butter metal

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.730 
other one and just a better butter metal
around<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.229> will<00:01:07.380> be<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.500> one<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.680> we

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
around so this will be the one that we

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.740 
around so this will be the one that we
use<00:01:07.950> for<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> game<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.299> see<00:01:09.450> kind<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.689> how

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
use for the game you can see kind of how

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.830 
use for the game you can see kind of how
it<00:01:09.960> rolls<00:01:10.920> or<00:01:11.280> folds<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.450> do<00:01:12.540> whatever<00:01:12.689> you

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
it rolls or folds and do whatever you

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.600 
it rolls or folds and do whatever you
want<00:01:13.020> with<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.140> it's<00:01:13.409> not<00:01:13.530> gonna<00:01:13.680> wrinkle<00:01:13.920> you

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
want with it it's not gonna wrinkle you

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.270 
want with it it's not gonna wrinkle you
can<00:01:14.640> wad<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.330> up<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.570> ball<00:01:15.689> for<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.960> laker<00:01:16.280> it

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
can wad it up in a ball for a laker it

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.100 
can wad it up in a ball for a laker it
may<00:01:17.520> actually<00:01:17.759> come<00:01:18.060> as<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.540> packing

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
may actually come as the packing

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.810 
may actually come as the packing
material<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.470> your<00:01:19.590> package<00:01:19.920> if<00:01:20.040> we<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.280> work

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
material in your package if we can work

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:21.980 
material in your package if we can work
that<00:01:20.939> out<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.210> just<00:01:21.360> wrap<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.509> around<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.900> for

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
that out we just wrap it around it for

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.149 
that out we just wrap it around it for
those<00:01:22.140> who<00:01:22.259> are<00:01:22.350> getting<00:01:22.409> play<00:01:22.680> mats<00:01:22.860> so

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
those who are getting play mats so

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.710 
those who are getting play mats so
that's<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.030> that's<00:01:24.119> what<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.330> final<00:01:24.509> mat

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
that's it that's what the final mat

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.570 
that's it that's what the final mat
looks<00:01:24.960> like<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.500> we<00:01:25.920> will<00:01:26.070> have<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> little<00:01:26.460> bit

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
looks like and we will have a little bit

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.100 
looks like and we will have a little bit
better<00:01:26.790> resolution<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.600> we<00:01:27.720> are<00:01:27.869> getting

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
better resolution on it we are getting

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.770 
better resolution on it we are getting
the<00:01:28.229> original<00:01:28.650> PSD<00:01:29.640> file<00:01:29.909> for<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> factory

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
the original PSD file for the factory

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.450 
the original PSD file for the factory
even<00:01:31.530> though<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.680> can<00:01:31.860> read<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.250> pretty

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
even though you can read this pretty

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.420 
even though you can read this pretty
well<00:01:32.990> maybe<00:01:33.990> not<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.290> camera<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:34.920> you

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
well maybe not in this camera but you

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.190 
well maybe not in this camera but you
can<00:01:35.549> read<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.790> pretty<00:01:35.909> well<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:37.909> the<00:01:38.909> on<00:01:39.689> here

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
can read it pretty well and the on here

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.080 
can read it pretty well and the on here
but<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.710> will<00:01:40.829> look<00:01:40.979> better<00:01:41.220> when<00:01:41.520> we<00:01:41.640> actually

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
but it will look better when we actually

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.850 
but it will look better when we actually
have<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.780> printed<00:01:43.020> right<00:01:43.229> after<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.619> instead

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
have it printed right after that instead

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.310 
have it printed right after that instead
of<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.280> JPEG<00:01:44.700> file<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.149> was<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.320> larger

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
of just a JPEG file that was a larger

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.810 
of just a JPEG file that was a larger
JPEG<00:01:46.619> file<00:01:46.799> but<00:01:46.979> still<00:01:47.159> not<00:01:47.310> as<00:01:47.460> good<00:01:47.610> as<00:01:47.700> it

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
JPEG file but still not as good as it

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.940 
JPEG file but still not as good as it
could<00:01:47.939> be<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.320> we're<00:01:49.320> really<00:01:49.470> excited<00:01:49.590> about

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950
