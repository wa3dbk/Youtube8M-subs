makeup remover circle things and I was
like<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.329> bet<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.780> would<00:01:03.899> fit<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:04.229> inside

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
like I bet that would fit like inside

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.149 
like I bet that would fit like inside
the<00:01:04.949> cap<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:06.600> sure<00:01:06.810> enough<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:07.140> set<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.010> on

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
the cap and so sure enough I set it on

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.340 
the cap and so sure enough I set it on
top<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.729> jar<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.390> twisted<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:09.990> jar<00:01:10.170> back

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
top of the jar and twisted the jar back

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.859 
top of the jar and twisted the jar back
on<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.890> fit<00:01:11.070> perfectly<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.510> left<00:01:12.720> it

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
on and it fit perfectly and I left it

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.510 
on and it fit perfectly and I left it
like<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.170> for<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.439> few<00:01:13.470> days<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.159> then<00:01:14.280> when<00:01:14.490> I

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
like that for a few days and then when I

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.359 
like that for a few days and then when I
took<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.880> off<00:01:15.409> this<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.680> completely<00:01:17.159> fine

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
took it off this is completely fine

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.760 
took it off this is completely fine
again<00:01:17.670> like<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.180> not<00:01:18.479> completely<00:01:19.320> back<00:01:19.590> to

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
again like it's not completely back to

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
to use it again so yeah all I did was

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.179 
to use it again so yeah all I did was
put<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.340> right<00:01:27.210> straight<00:01:27.540> on<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.049> then
