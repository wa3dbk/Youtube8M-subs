how it works and here's an example that

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:01.100 
how it works and here's an example that
I<00:01:54.869> built<00:01:56.719> with<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:57.960> huge<00:01:58.530> set<00:01:59.899> again<00:02:00.899> these

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
I built with this huge set again these

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.999 
I built with this huge set again these
four<00:02:02.090> plastic<00:02:03.860> peg<00:02:05.270> bases<00:02:06.350> are<00:02:07.350> connected<00:02:07.890> to

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
four plastic peg bases are connected to

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.350 
four plastic peg bases are connected to
each<00:02:08.039> other<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.830> oh<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.940> don't<00:02:12.150> know

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
each other and this is oh I don't know

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.800 
each other and this is oh I don't know
twenty-something<00:02:13.020> stories

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
twenty-something stories

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.430 
twenty-something stories
and<00:02:15.810> has<00:02:16.050> some<00:02:17.480> subsequent<00:02:18.480> open<00:02:19.170> airy

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
and has some subsequent open airy

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.650 
and has some subsequent open airy
atriums<00:02:20.660> units<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:23.370> again<00:02:23.760> these<00:02:23.970> plastic

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
atriums units and again these plastic

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.720 
atriums units and again these plastic
panels<00:02:25.470> or<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.709> real<00:02:25.980> paper<00:02:26.459> thin<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.650> very

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
panels or a real paper thin and very

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.780 
panels or a real paper thin and very
fragile<00:02:29.989> that's<00:02:30.989> why<00:02:31.260> when<00:02:31.560> taking<00:02:32.550> these

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
fragile that's why when taking these

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.790 
fragile that's why when taking these
apart<00:02:34.430> these<00:02:35.430> can<00:02:36.020> constructed<00:02:37.020> sets<00:02:37.290> apart

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
apart these can constructed sets apart

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.030 
apart these can constructed sets apart
you<00:02:38.040> almost<00:02:38.310> have<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:39.440> use<00:02:40.440> some<00:02:40.680> kind<00:02:40.709> of<00:02:40.980> a

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
you almost have to use some kind of a

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.350 
you almost have to use some kind of a
Slugger<00:02:41.370> tool<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:42.180> pry<00:02:42.450> these<00:02:42.720> up<00:02:44.150> so<00:02:45.150> that

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
Slugger tool to pry these up so that

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.949 
Slugger tool to pry these up so that
they<00:02:45.480> don't<00:02:45.690> break<00:02:46.880> but<00:02:47.880> it's<00:02:48.090> wonderful<00:02:48.450> set

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
they don't break but it's wonderful set

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.860 
they don't break but it's wonderful set
if<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.320> can<00:02:49.500> be<00:02:49.620> careful<00:02:49.890> with<00:02:50.220> them<00:02:50.870> and

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
if you can be careful with them and

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.070 
if you can be careful with them and
again<00:02:52.230> this<00:02:52.410> is<00:02:52.680> my<00:02:53.310> own<00:02:53.340> design<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:53.910> didn't<00:02:54.420> use

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
again this is my own design I didn't use

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.050 
again this is my own design I didn't use
any<00:02:55.320> plan<00:02:55.739> from<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.160> book<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:59.220> it's<00:02:59.370> all<00:02:59.610> in

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
blue here shows you how they're

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.420
