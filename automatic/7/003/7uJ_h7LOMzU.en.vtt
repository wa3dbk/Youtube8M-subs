00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
handles to use two hands on I could put

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.350

my<00:01:28.350> two<00:01:28.500> hands<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:29.100> there<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:29.970> definitely

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
my two hands in there so I definitely

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.120 
my two hands in there so I definitely
wanted<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.659> try<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.079> out<00:01:31.110> chopping<00:01:31.530> mrs.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
wanted to try that out chopping mrs.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.670 
wanted to try that out chopping mrs.
some<00:01:32.250> really<00:01:32.670> really<00:01:32.790> really<00:01:33.150> hard<00:01:34.020> deadwood

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
some really really really hard deadwood

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.490 
some really really really hard deadwood
so<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:34.979> might<00:01:35.100> take<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.340> while<00:01:37.280> agate<00:01:39.500> sourwood

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
so it might take a while agate sourwood

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.940 
so it might take a while agate sourwood
was<00:01:40.890> either<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.640> or<00:01:41.790> dog<00:01:43.729> probably<00:01:44.729> dogwood

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
was either that or dog probably dogwood

00:01:46.950 --> 00:02:41.569 
was either that or dog probably dogwood
anyway<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:39.870> at<00:02:40.049> least<00:02:40.170> with<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.590> underhand

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
anyway so at least with the underhand

00:02:41.579 --> 00:03:31.220 
anyway so at least with the underhand
cuts<00:02:42.049> got<00:02:43.049> more<00:02:43.260> accuracy<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:43.860> think

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.660 

not<00:03:32.230> too<00:03:32.470> bad<00:03:32.680> for<00:03:32.710> how<00:03:32.980> hard<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:33.370> would<00:03:33.490> cease

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
not too bad for how hard it would cease

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.490 
not too bad for how hard it would cease
