the<00:00:09.120> two<00:00:09.150> galaxy<00:00:09.719> Megas<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.380> white<00:00:10.590> one<00:00:10.800> is

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
the two galaxy Megas the white one is

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.350 
the two galaxy Megas the white one is
5.8<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.599> black<00:00:12.900> one<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.230> galaxy<00:00:13.620> mega<00:00:13.740> 6.3

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360

5.8 and the black one is galaxy mega 6.3
now<00:00:15.360> as<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.690> can<00:00:15.839> see<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.109> dimensionally

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
now as you can see the dimensionally

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.019 
now as you can see the dimensionally
they're<00:00:16.859> not<00:00:16.980> very<00:00:17.430> different<00:00:17.699> from<00:00:17.940> each

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
they're not very different from each

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.529 
they're not very different from each
other

other

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.439 
other
although<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:19.619> galaxy<00:00:20.189> mega<00:00:20.310> 6.3<00:00:20.670> offers<00:00:21.420> a

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
although this galaxy mega 6.3 offers a

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.410 
although this galaxy mega 6.3 offers a
significantly<00:00:22.140> larger<00:00:22.680> display<00:00:23.070> area<00:00:23.550> in

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
significantly larger display area in

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.450 
significantly larger display area in
general<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.170> two<00:00:25.289> devices<00:00:25.560> are<00:00:25.980> quite

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
general the two devices are quite

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.859 
general the two devices are quite
similar<00:00:27.000> in<00:00:27.029> size<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:29.150> big<00:00:30.150> reason<00:00:30.330> why<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.660> is

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
similar in size a big reason why this is

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.410 
similar in size a big reason why this is
possible<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.470> because<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.070> bezel<00:00:32.550> size<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.210> a

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
possible is because the bezel size is a

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.870 
possible is because the bezel size is a
lot<00:00:33.630> thinner<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.290> case<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.680> 6.3<00:00:35.280> whereas<00:00:35.700> it's

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
lot thinner in case of 6.3 whereas it's

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.380 
lot thinner in case of 6.3 whereas it's
quite<00:00:36.120> wide<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.660> 5.8<00:00:37.290> at<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:38.489> back<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.910> the

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.930 
5.8 is 540 by 960 pixels now the problem
is<00:03:54.780> that<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.380> resolutions<00:03:55.920> are<00:03:56.040> so<00:03:56.400> small<00:03:56.730> as

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
is that the resolutions are so small as

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.600 
is that the resolutions are so small as
compared<00:03:57.420> to<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.600> display<00:03:57.990> area<00:03:58.250> that<00:03:59.250> all<00:03:59.459> of

also results into a lot better viewing

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.920 
also results into a lot better viewing
angles<00:04:20.100> you<00:04:20.970> know<00:04:21.000> even<00:04:21.359> when<00:04:21.479> you<00:04:21.570> tilt<00:04:21.810> your

with<00:04:26.949> the<00:04:27.039> help<00:04:27.190> of<00:04:27.280> some<00:04:27.490> examples<00:04:27.539> you<00:04:28.539> can

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
with the help of some examples you can

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.900 
with the help of some examples you can
see<00:04:28.900> on<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.500> 6.3<00:04:30.220> on<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.460> right<00:04:30.639> that<00:04:30.880> the

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
see on the 6.3 on the right that the

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.080 
see on the 6.3 on the right that the
colors<00:04:31.270> pop<00:04:31.960> out<00:04:32.169> much<00:04:32.500> better<00:04:32.740> and<00:04:33.070> even<00:04:34.030> the

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
colors pop out much better and even the

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.680 
colors pop out much better and even the
color<00:04:34.300> accuracy<00:04:34.750> seems<00:04:35.320> to<00:04:35.530> be<00:04:35.650> a<00:04:35.889> lot<00:04:36.100> better

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
color accuracy seems to be a lot better

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.600 
color accuracy seems to be a lot better
so<00:04:37.690> you<00:04:38.110> know<00:04:38.199> on<00:04:38.350> the<00:04:38.440> 5.8<00:04:39.070> the<00:04:39.310> display

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
so you know on the 5.8 the display

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.580 
so you know on the 5.8 the display
quality<00:04:39.880> is<00:04:40.210> not<00:04:40.419> as<00:04:40.479> good<00:04:40.780> as<00:04:41.139> that<00:04:41.320> in<00:04:41.500> the

for<00:05:29.410> that<00:05:29.590> in<00:05:30.550> the<00:05:30.760> end<00:05:30.909> I'd<00:05:31.030> like<00:05:31.060> to<00:05:31.270> talk

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
for that in the end I'd like to talk

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:34.589 
for that in the end I'd like to talk
about<00:05:31.570> their<00:05:31.960> camera<00:05:32.380> applications<00:05:32.919> so<00:05:33.610> you

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
about their camera applications so you

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:36.689 
about their camera applications so you
know<00:05:34.690> inspired<00:05:35.110> from<00:05:35.260> the<00:05:35.409> galaxy<00:05:35.770> s4<00:05:36.190> which
