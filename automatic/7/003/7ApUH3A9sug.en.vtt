realize<00:02:20.050> that's<00:02:20.170> nothing<00:02:20.500> revolutionary<00:02:21.280> but

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
realize that's nothing revolutionary but

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.700 
realize that's nothing revolutionary but
still<00:02:22.120> for<00:02:22.390> me<00:02:22.510> it<00:02:22.690> just<00:02:22.840> comes<00:02:23.050> down<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.290> the

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
still for me it just comes down to the

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.100 
still for me it just comes down to the
convenience<00:02:24.250> okay<00:02:25.180> so<00:02:25.240> this<00:02:25.480> splash<00:02:25.750> students

battery<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.970> unfortunately<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.030> don't<00:02:31.330> have

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
battery and unfortunately I don't have

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.260 
battery and unfortunately I don't have
an<00:02:31.810> exact<00:02:32.260> time<00:02:32.740> on<00:02:32.950> battery<00:02:33.310> life<00:02:33.370> but<00:02:34.120> that's

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
an exact time on battery life but that's

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.660 
an exact time on battery life but that's
actually<00:02:34.450> a<00:02:34.750> good<00:02:35.080> thing<00:02:35.140> because<00:02:35.590> it's<00:02:36.430> been

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
actually a good thing because it's been

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.020 
actually a good thing because it's been
about<00:02:36.940> two<00:02:37.510> weeks<00:02:37.540> or<00:02:37.990> so<00:02:38.200> since<00:02:39.040> I've<00:02:39.250> unboxed

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
about two weeks or so since I've unboxed

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.600 
about two weeks or so since I've unboxed
these<00:02:40.330> splash<00:02:40.630> tunes<00:02:40.900> Pro<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:42.130> have<00:02:42.340> yet<00:02:42.580> to

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
these splash tunes Pro and I have yet to

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.360 
these splash tunes Pro and I have yet to
charge<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.240> because<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.990> speaker<00:02:44.470> has<00:02:44.950> not

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
charge it because the speaker has not

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.630 
charge it because the speaker has not
died<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.540> that<00:02:47.230> is<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.560> good<00:02:47.950> thing<00:02:48.250> now

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
died and that is a good thing now

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.610 
died and that is a good thing now
obviously<00:02:49.030> my<00:02:49.120> showers<00:02:49.690> daily<00:02:50.170> rained<00:02:50.410> for

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
obviously my showers daily rained for

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.650 
obviously my showers daily rained for
maybe<00:02:50.770> like<00:02:50.860> five<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.520> ten<00:02:51.730> minutes<00:02:52.060> each

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
maybe like five to ten minutes each

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.290 
maybe like five to ten minutes each
so<00:02:53.230> if<00:02:53.470> you<00:02:53.560> factor<00:02:53.800> in<00:02:54.190> that<00:02:54.220> times<00:02:54.820> two<00:02:55.090> weeks

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
so if you factor in that times two weeks

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.150 
so if you factor in that times two weeks
that'll<00:02:56.140> give<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:56.350> a<00:02:56.410> rough<00:02:56.710> idea<00:02:56.830> of<00:02:57.040> its

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
that'll give you a rough idea of its

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.370 
that'll give you a rough idea of its
battery<00:02:57.340> life<00:02:57.520> but<00:02:58.090> keep<00:02:58.270> in<00:02:58.390> mind<00:02:58.420> it's<00:02:58.930> not

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
battery life but keep in mind it's not

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.240 
battery life but keep in mind it's not
even<00:02:59.740> dead<00:02:59.950> yet<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:00.930> awesome<00:03:01.960> and<00:03:02.110> finally<00:03:02.860> the

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
even dead yet so awesome and finally the

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.410 
even dead yet so awesome and finally the
suction<00:03:04.060> cup<00:03:04.620> definitely<00:03:05.940> impressive<00:03:06.940> it<00:03:07.150> did

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
suction cup definitely impressive it did

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.420 
suction cup definitely impressive it did
fall<00:03:07.750> once<00:03:08.110> but<00:03:08.440> that<00:03:08.530> was<00:03:08.590> my<00:03:09.040> fault<00:03:09.310> because

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
fall once but that was my fault because

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.940 
fall once but that was my fault because
I<00:03:09.580> didn't<00:03:09.880> mount<00:03:10.090> it<00:03:10.350> hard<00:03:11.350> enough

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
I didn't mount it hard enough

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.680 
I didn't mount it hard enough
sounds<00:03:12.850> kind<00:03:13.030> of<00:03:13.060> weird<00:03:13.120> saying<00:03:13.450> that<00:03:13.600> out

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
sounds kind of weird saying that out

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.540 
sounds kind of weird saying that out
loud<00:03:13.840> but<00:03:14.410> you<00:03:14.530> know<00:03:14.620> what<00:03:14.740> I<00:03:14.770> mean<00:03:15.010> it's<00:03:15.430> a

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
loud but you know what I mean it's a

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.060 
loud but you know what I mean it's a
suction<00:03:15.820> cup<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.300> it<00:03:16.690> works<00:03:16.900> exactly<00:03:17.200> as<00:03:17.709> it

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
suction cup and it works exactly as it

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.620 
suction cup and it works exactly as it
should<00:03:18.340> and<00:03:18.580> actually<00:03:19.000> it's<00:03:19.150> been<00:03:19.360> up<00:03:19.450> my

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
should and actually it's been up my

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.300 
should and actually it's been up my
shower<00:03:19.930> for<00:03:20.380> about<00:03:20.560> two<00:03:20.860> weeks<00:03:21.100> now

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
shower for about two weeks now

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.310 
shower for about two weeks now
and<00:03:21.580> it<00:03:21.940> hasn't<00:03:22.120> fallen<00:03:22.510> after<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.110> first

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
and it hasn't fallen after the first

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.170 
and it hasn't fallen after the first
time<00:03:23.560> well<00:03:23.920> except<00:03:24.220> for<00:03:24.250> right<00:03:24.489> now<00:03:24.670> because<00:03:24.880> I

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
time well except for right now because I

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.960 
time well except for right now because I
manually<00:03:25.570> took<00:03:25.870> it<00:03:25.989> off<00:03:26.140> for<00:03:26.560> this<00:03:26.650> video<00:03:26.980> just
