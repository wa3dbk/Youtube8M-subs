 endemic with a small area of 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.750
 distribution that is limited to the part 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.250
 central of the transverse neo-volcanic axis 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.350
 belongs to a specific world genre 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.810
 which is the smallest rabbit in Mexico 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.810
 It has an average length of 12 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:15.159

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.229

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.189
 perfectly in own burrows or 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.100

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:33.189

 zacatones the takatu are selected the 

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:46.090
 young leaves that are soft and green and 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.299
 they lack too much silica to cough 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.060
 it reproduces throughout the year but 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.469
 with an increase in activity 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.840
 reproductive period from May to October 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:58.810
 coincides with the rainy season and with a 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.140
 slight annual rise in temperature 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.479
 gestation period is 39 days and the 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.520
 litter size is 2 pups in 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.979
 average although there are no estimates 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.620
 reliable of the density of their 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.060
 populations usually the males are 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.540
 larger than the females although the 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.180
 but the females are not very significant 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.940
 they have a double uterus embryos 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.040
 they are spherical reds when 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.040
 develop in the middle part of the 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.349
 length of the uterus terrorism is becoming 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.530
 rare time so it is considered 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:36.230
 in danger of extinction in the monfero 59 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.480
 école 2001 as a result of the 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.480
 incessant increase in practices 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.180
 agricultural livestock extraction 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.459
 wood and the pressure of hunting 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.910
 habitat of this species is being 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.220
 gradually destroyed additionally the 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.650
 expansion of large urban areas 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.019
 has provoked in a direct way and 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.420
 Indirect habitat fragmentation 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.299

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.900
 chichinautzin you have records of 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.269
 this lagomorph however 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.480
 a formal study has been carried out to 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.540
 determine the state of their populations 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.280
 in this sense it is extremely important 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.319
 monitor rosemary populations 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.140
 lakes in this part of their distribution 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:39.640
 to evaluate their relative abundance and 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.640
 conditions of its habitat
