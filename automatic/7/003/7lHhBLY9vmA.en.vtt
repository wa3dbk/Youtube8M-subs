 that do not usually live together 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.480
 because these rules 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.480
 here we see an example of an acorn 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.460
 clavell tobacco not that they are not rich are not comfortable of other trees 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.900

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.120
 if you take a leaf 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.440

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.300
 surely he does not know that he could chew an egyptian leaf 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.350
 but at the plant level it always says 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.350
 and that is very good for cool slow and all that 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.030

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:36.099
 on the fourth floor 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.819
 It is also used in some places as a condiment that is eaten 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.939
 You can even buy it to grow it because I've had it 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:49.139

 within it 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.549
 then this plant was formerly used to make ropes and you take a 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.309
 range and just with that makes a china that are hard and that does not break 

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:24.309
 and that formerly they used it as a rope 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:29.559
 but I think it looks very bad because it is very cloudy and it did not occur in the plant 

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:43.539
 but normally I want to cherry white andrés of five petals that if nothing 

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:46.539
 more than it touches the dry branch the petals running 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.409

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:09.219
 although it was not too soon 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.639

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.919

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.919
 does not have flowers 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:35.360

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:58.740
 that at this time of year there are not many plants 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.290
 because in the autumn it is still fine the winter and find out everything at the time 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:04.860
 shows the year there are very few plants 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.509
 until in the spring debate marrama planted in the old field 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.349

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.830
