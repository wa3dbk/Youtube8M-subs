00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.150 
good so you think your your game would
be<00:03:53.280> better<00:03:53.489> than<00:03:53.640> up-tempo<00:03:54.120> offense

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
be better than up-tempo offense

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.160 
be better than up-tempo offense
kind<00:03:55.460> of<00:03:55.490> a<00:03:55.580> half<00:03:55.760> pork<00:03:56.060> I<00:03:56.480> probably<00:03:56.930> have

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
kind of a half pork I probably have

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.810 
kind of a half pork I probably have
tempo<00:03:57.560> cuz<00:03:57.830> you<00:03:57.920> know<00:03:58.040> I<00:03:58.070> like<00:03:58.310> to<00:03:58.340> run<00:03:58.550> a<00:03:58.610> lot

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
tempo cuz you know I like to run a lot

and<00:03:59.060> I<00:03:59.150> think<00:03:59.180> I<00:03:59.540> can<00:03:59.720> push<00:03:59.900> it<00:03:59.930> too<00:04:00.230> when<00:04:00.740> i<00:04:00.770> get

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
and I think I can push it too when i get

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.940 
and I think I can push it too when i get
rebound<00:04:01.310> so<00:04:01.520> I<00:04:01.550> think<00:04:01.760> I<00:04:01.820> took<00:04:02.860> Ashley<00:04:03.860> because

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950
