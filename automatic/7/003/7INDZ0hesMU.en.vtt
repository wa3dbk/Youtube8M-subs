 of christian allam I love Italy 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.240
 related but only a little with the 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.160
 center is actually a movement and yes 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.529
 presents at 8 did not have a night 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.080
 again because we want to start with 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.199
 content and not from containers where 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.320
 inside there is everything and the opposite of everything 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.460
 we are the only political subject that the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.489
 24 February 25 promotes the release 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.969
 of Italy both from the euro and from this one 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.940
 European Union to redeem ours 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.219
 monetary sovereignty and to promote the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.309
 against non-negotiable values ​​in 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.160
 italy now but of christian allam 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.020
 the first proposal you will make upon entering 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.840
 parliament our goal is to pose 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.570
 end to an epochal crime that is taking place 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.690
 perpetrating and it is transformation 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.550
 of Italy from rich state in 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.850
 poor population we want the flood 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.340
 employment through return 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.130
 to the state of the prerogative to issue 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.830
 direct currency credit without 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.500
 be forced to borrow for 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.600
 have the resources we want a 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.090
 drastic reduction of the costs of the 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.119
 been eliminating all institutions 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.759
 the provinces are superfluous but 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.280
 even the municipal companies the same 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.750
 the senate of the republic is one of the 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.270
 very few countries in the world than at 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.000
 perfect bicameralism to be able to 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.070
 get a drastic lowering of the 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.380
 taxes we have the highest level of 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.390
 taxation in the world and put the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.670
 entrepreneurs who care about 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.979
 own money in the condition to be able to 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.170
 to be the protagonists of the 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.759
 but the development of Christian 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.970
 naturally they think differently 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.729
 without prejudice to respect for gods 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.310
 non-negotiable values to life at 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.110
 dignity and freedom of all therefore 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.329
 including homosexuals 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.759
 I acknowledge that today 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.160
 Europe and the area of ​​the world than at most 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.619
 low birth rate and unfortunately 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.800
 Italy is among the countries of the world that has 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.400
 lower birth rate 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.340
 I love Italy and supportive 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.260
 of the centrality of the natural family 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.600
 in social construction, support 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.300
 to motherhood to encourage the 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.330
 birth of Italians because 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.570
 historically the end of empires and the 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:36.200
 collapse of civilizations has always happened 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:39.170
 from the falling birth rate we believe 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.200
 that promote the birth rate and therefore 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.790
 supporting the natural family 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:50.720
 represents a national emergency today 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:52.420
 for time only about a joke about it 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.490
 let's take the most topical case 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.580
 abolition of the imu pray the farmyard e 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:01.370
 against any tax on assets 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.980
 purchased with money already taxed a 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.480
 more reason about taxes 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.480
 applied to the house
