one<00:02:59.320> else<00:02:59.560> was<00:03:00.040> doing<00:03:00.100> at<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.489> time<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:00.910> it

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
one else was doing at the time and it

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.960 
one else was doing at the time and it
really<00:03:01.030> seemed<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.540> be<00:03:03.420> genuinely<00:03:05.489> a<00:03:06.489> step

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
really seemed to be genuinely a step

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.470 
really seemed to be genuinely a step
forward<00:03:07.299> and<00:03:07.540> that<00:03:08.170> really<00:03:09.000> really<00:03:10.000> was

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
forward and that really really was

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.210 
forward and that really really was
something<00:03:11.049> that<00:03:11.260> I've<00:03:11.410> been<00:03:11.560> looking<00:03:11.890> for<00:03:12.190> for
