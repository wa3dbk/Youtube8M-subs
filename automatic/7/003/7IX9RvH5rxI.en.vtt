00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
lot is do I have to use a pressure pot

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.629 
lot is do I have to use a pressure pot
do<00:00:09.090> I<00:00:09.150> have<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.570> use<00:00:09.719> vacuum<00:00:10.080> can<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.040> use<00:00:11.370> vacuum

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
do I have to use vacuum can I use vacuum

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.850 
do I have to use vacuum can I use vacuum
instead<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.450> pressure<00:00:12.719> pot<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.290> if<00:00:13.710> I

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
instead of the pressure pot and if I

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.709 
instead of the pressure pot and if I
don't<00:00:14.040> have<00:00:14.190> either<00:00:14.429> one<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.759> those<00:00:14.969> can<00:00:15.630> I

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
don't have either one of those can I

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.330 
don't have either one of those can I
just<00:00:15.929> leave<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.230> out<00:00:16.350> in<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.500> open

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.920 

so<00:00:22.610> for<00:00:22.760> this<00:00:22.850> video<00:00:23.180> I'm<00:00:23.480> going<00:00:23.660> to<00:00:23.750> use<00:00:23.900> a

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
so for this video I'm going to use a

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.330 
so for this video I'm going to use a
lumen<00:00:24.380> like<00:00:24.500> clear<00:00:24.890> which<00:00:25.130> has<00:00:25.310> a

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
lumen like clear which has a

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.490 
lumen like clear which has a
seven-minute<00:00:26.060> working<00:00:26.480> window<00:00:26.810> and<00:00:27.050> a<00:00:27.140> 2-hour

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
seven-minute working window and a 2-hour

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.040 
seven-minute working window and a 2-hour
de-mold<00:00:27.980> time<00:00:28.310> because<00:00:29.240> that's<00:00:29.480> what<00:00:29.720> I<00:00:29.750> used

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
de-mold time because that's what I used

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.000 
de-mold time because that's what I used
and<00:00:30.380> all<00:00:30.560> of<00:00:30.680> my<00:00:30.830> worthless<00:00:31.700> wood<00:00:32.090> casting<00:00:32.660> and

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
and all of my worthless wood casting and

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.460 
and all of my worthless wood casting and
this<00:00:34.010> may<00:00:34.520> not<00:00:34.760> work<00:00:34.820> for<00:00:35.090> polyester<00:00:35.750> resin<00:00:36.320> or

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
this may not work for polyester resin or

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.100 
this may not work for polyester resin or
any<00:00:36.620> other<00:00:36.830> resin<00:00:37.220> that<00:00:37.280> you<00:00:37.460> may<00:00:37.610> have<00:00:37.930> but<00:00:38.930> if

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
any other resin that you may have but if

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.600 
any other resin that you may have but if
you<00:00:39.290> really<00:00:39.680> want<00:00:39.860> to<00:00:39.920> know<00:00:39.950> if<00:00:40.250> it<00:00:40.400> will<00:00:40.550> work

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
you really want to know if it will work

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.850 
you really want to know if it will work
you<00:00:41.090> can<00:00:41.270> always<00:00:41.420> try<00:00:41.840> it<00:00:41.900> and<00:00:42.140> see<00:00:42.559> how<00:00:42.710> it

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
you can always try it and see how it

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.600 
you can always try it and see how it
does<00:00:42.890> so<00:00:43.400> I<00:00:43.610> have<00:00:44.150> three<00:00:44.510> samples<00:00:45.050> here

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
does so I have three samples here

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.920 
does so I have three samples here
they're<00:00:46.610> all<00:00:46.730> hot<00:00:47.000> glued<00:00:47.300> to<00:00:47.450> the<00:00:47.540> bottom

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
they're all hot glued to the bottom

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.200 
they're all hot glued to the bottom
they're<00:00:48.470> all<00:00:48.559> going<00:00:48.770> to<00:00:48.830> be<00:00:48.890> scrap<00:00:49.550> wood<00:00:49.910> that

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
they're all going to be scrap wood that

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.570 
they're all going to be scrap wood that
I<00:00:50.750> get<00:00:51.080> out<00:00:51.200> of<00:00:51.350> my<00:00:51.470> scrap<00:00:51.800> bin<00:00:52.070> so<00:00:52.340> what<00:00:52.489> I'm

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
I get out of my scrap bin so what I'm

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.910 
I get out of my scrap bin so what I'm
going<00:00:52.730> to<00:00:52.790> do<00:00:52.970> is<00:00:53.150> I'm<00:00:53.300> going<00:00:53.450> to<00:00:53.510> mix<00:00:53.920> about

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
going to do is I'm going to mix about

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.060 
going to do is I'm going to mix about
six<00:00:55.370> ounces<00:00:55.580> maybe<00:00:56.269> three<00:00:57.260> four<00:00:57.440> six<00:00:57.680> ounces

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
six ounces maybe three four six ounces

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.850 
six ounces maybe three four six ounces
of<00:00:58.280> resin<00:00:59.239> and<00:00:59.420> I'm<00:01:00.080> going<00:01:00.230> to<00:01:00.260> put<00:01:00.500> them<00:01:00.650> in

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
of resin and I'm going to put them in

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.130 
of resin and I'm going to put them in
I'm<00:01:01.339> going<00:01:01.489> to<00:01:01.550> put<00:01:01.790> one<00:01:02.089> sample<00:01:02.480> into<00:01:03.019> the

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
I'm going to put one sample into the

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.950 
I'm going to put one sample into the
pressure<00:01:03.409> pot<00:01:03.769> under<00:01:04.040> 60<00:01:04.550> psi<00:01:05.059> I'm<00:01:05.690> going<00:01:05.900> to

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
pressure pot under 60 psi I'm going to

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.860 
pressure pot under 60 psi I'm going to
put<00:01:06.200> one<00:01:06.470> into<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:07.490> vacuum<00:01:07.820> chamber<00:01:08.150> and

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 
put one into the vacuum chamber and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.830 
put one into the vacuum chamber and
slowly<00:01:09.590> vacuum<00:01:10.159> out<00:01:10.340> of<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:10.850> air<00:01:11.060> and<00:01:11.390> I'm

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
slowly vacuum out of the air and I'm

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.810 
slowly vacuum out of the air and I'm
going<00:01:12.020> to<00:01:12.050> leave<00:01:12.230> one<00:01:12.530> out<00:01:12.770> in<00:01:13.040> the<00:01:13.100> open<00:01:13.550> and

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
going to leave one out in the open and

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.000 
going to leave one out in the open and
we'll<00:01:14.570> compare<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.170> three<00:01:15.440> and<00:01:15.650> see<00:01:15.860> what

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
we'll compare the three and see what

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:30.870 
we'll compare the three and see what
happens

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.640 

yes

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
yes

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.970 
yes
ahead<00:01:32.860> and

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
ahead and

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.390 
ahead and
cover<00:01:35.280> each<00:01:35.550> one<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.150> these<00:01:36.300> samples<00:01:36.630> and

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
cover each one of these samples and

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:56.740 
cover each one of these samples and
resin

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.350 

there<00:01:57.750> we<00:01:57.870> go<00:01:58.020> we've<00:01:58.350> got<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:59.040> sample<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
there we go we've got the sample and the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.000 
there we go we've got the sample and the
pressure<00:02:00.660> Prada<00:02:01.020> now<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.410> is<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.680> method

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
pressure Prada now this is the method

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.730 
pressure Prada now this is the method
that<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.190> use<00:02:02.720> because<00:02:03.720> I<00:02:03.870> know<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.260> works<00:02:04.530> and

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
that I use because I know it works and

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.130 
that I use because I know it works and
this<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.010> actually<00:02:05.340> what<00:02:05.460> they<00:02:05.580> recommend<00:02:06.150> for

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
this is actually what they recommend for

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.219 
this is actually what they recommend for
the<00:02:07.530> alumalite<00:02:07.830> resin<00:02:08.660> now<00:02:09.660> let's<00:02:09.840> go<00:02:10.020> ahead

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
the alumalite resin now let's go ahead

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:17.270 
the alumalite resin now let's go ahead
and<00:02:10.470> put<00:02:10.680> one<00:02:10.710> into<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:12.600> vacuum<00:02:12.900> chamber

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:42.020 

you

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.090 

now<00:02:42.540> as<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.780> can<00:02:42.900> see<00:02:42.960> if<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.410> completely

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
now as you can see if I completely

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.270 
now as you can see if I completely
closed<00:02:44.340> off<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.790> ball<00:02:45.030> valve<00:02:45.710> the<00:02:46.710> air<00:02:46.860> starts

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
closed off the ball valve the air starts

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.850 
closed off the ball valve the air starts
to<00:02:47.460> kind<00:02:47.910> of<00:02:48.030> bubble<00:02:48.450> up<00:02:48.600> or<00:02:48.840> starting<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.620> foam

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
to kind of bubble up or starting to foam

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.760 
to kind of bubble up or starting to foam
up<00:02:50.070> I<00:02:50.540> don't<00:02:51.540> want<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.930> foam<00:02:52.170> up<00:02:52.200> too<00:02:52.590> much

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
up I don't want it to foam up too much

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.410 
up I don't want it to foam up too much
so<00:02:53.160> I'm<00:02:53.340> going<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.610> kind<00:02:53.910> of<00:02:53.940> bleed<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.390> air

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
so I'm going to kind of bleed the air

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:11.140 
so I'm going to kind of bleed the air
into<00:02:55.050> it

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.660 

so<00:03:11.810> after<00:03:12.110> a<00:03:12.140> few<00:03:12.200> hours<00:03:12.409> the<00:03:13.129> resin<00:03:13.519> has

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
so after a few hours the resin has

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.520 
so after a few hours the resin has
hardened<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.299> I<00:03:14.599> went<00:03:14.810> ahead<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.230> removed

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
hardened and I went ahead and removed

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.220 
hardened and I went ahead and removed
them<00:03:15.739> from<00:03:15.769> the<00:03:16.370> pressure<00:03:16.610> pot<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.840> vacuum

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
them from the pressure pot the vacuum

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.990 
them from the pressure pot the vacuum
chamber<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:18.680> I<00:03:19.010> took<00:03:19.250> them<00:03:19.400> out<00:03:19.489> of<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:19.730> cups

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
chamber and I took them out of the cups

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.460 
chamber and I took them out of the cups
so<00:03:20.299> that<00:03:20.330> way<00:03:20.629> you<00:03:20.690> can<00:03:20.870> kind<00:03:21.110> of<00:03:21.170> see<00:03:21.349> the

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
so that way you can kind of see the

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.550 
so that way you can kind of see the
difference<00:03:21.500> between<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:23.150> three<00:03:23.560> samples

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
difference between the three samples

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.619 
difference between the three samples
that<00:03:24.709> I<00:03:24.739> have<00:03:25.010> here<00:03:25.370> looks<00:03:25.909> like<00:03:26.000> my<00:03:26.239> scrap

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:26.629 
that I have here looks like my scrap

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.050 
that I have here looks like my scrap
pieces<00:03:26.900> did<00:03:27.319> have<00:03:27.590> slight<00:03:28.220> moisture<00:03:28.879> in<00:03:28.940> them

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
pieces did have slight moisture in them

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.420 
pieces did have slight moisture in them
so<00:03:29.450> this<00:03:30.049> didn't<00:03:30.290> really<00:03:30.349> turn<00:03:30.680> out<00:03:30.739> as<00:03:31.099> well

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
so this didn't really turn out as well

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.550 
so this didn't really turn out as well
as<00:03:31.610> I'd<00:03:31.760> hoped<00:03:31.790> but<00:03:32.329> I<00:03:32.480> still<00:03:32.870> think<00:03:33.260> that<00:03:33.319> this

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
as I'd hoped but I still think that this

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.740 
as I'd hoped but I still think that this
example<00:03:34.250> kind<00:03:34.489> of<00:03:34.640> shows<00:03:34.970> you<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.239> difference

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
example kind of shows you the difference

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.520 
example kind of shows you the difference
between<00:03:35.829> pressure<00:03:36.829> casting<00:03:37.989> vacuum<00:03:38.989> casting

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
between pressure casting vacuum casting

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.369 
between pressure casting vacuum casting
and<00:03:40.209> nothing<00:03:41.209> at<00:03:41.360> all<00:03:41.540> just<00:03:41.569> leaving<00:03:42.110> it<00:03:42.260> out

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 
and nothing at all just leaving it out

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.380 
and nothing at all just leaving it out
there<00:03:42.620> opens<00:03:43.010> so<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:43.370> first<00:03:43.640> sample<00:03:44.299> I<00:03:44.359> have

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
there opens so the first sample I have

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.410 
there opens so the first sample I have
here<00:03:45.079> is<00:03:45.290> from<00:03:45.769> the<00:03:45.920> pressure<00:03:46.190> casting<00:03:46.819> now

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
here is from the pressure casting now

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.449 
here is from the pressure casting now
from<00:03:48.019> the<00:03:48.140> sample<00:03:48.560> you<00:03:48.680> could<00:03:48.829> see<00:03:49.069> that<00:03:49.250> it's

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
from the sample you could see that it's

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.970 
from the sample you could see that it's
much<00:03:49.790> clearer<00:03:50.510> and<00:03:50.720> there's<00:03:51.500> a<00:03:51.590> lot<00:03:51.769> less

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
much clearer and there's a lot less

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.869 
much clearer and there's a lot less
bubbles<00:03:52.459> in<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.900> resin<00:03:54.829> there<00:03:55.579> are<00:03:55.700> some

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
bubbles in the resin there are some

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:57.670 
bubbles in the resin there are some
bubbles<00:03:56.239> next<00:03:56.599> to<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.780> wood<00:03:56.989> but<00:03:57.379> that's

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
bubbles next to the wood but that's

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.580 
bubbles next to the wood but that's
because<00:03:57.950> my<00:03:58.819> wood<00:03:59.299> had<00:03:59.569> some<00:03:59.900> moisture<00:04:00.409> in<00:04:00.500> it

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
because my wood had some moisture in it

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.380 
because my wood had some moisture in it
and<00:04:00.799> when<00:04:01.220> you<00:04:01.310> have<00:04:01.430> moisture<00:04:01.700> in<00:04:01.970> with

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
and when you have moisture in with

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.050 
and when you have moisture in with
alumalite<00:04:02.750> this<00:04:03.680> is<00:04:03.829> kind<00:04:04.099> of<00:04:04.220> what<00:04:04.579> you<00:04:04.849> get

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
alumalite this is kind of what you get

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.050 
alumalite this is kind of what you get
you<00:04:05.180> get<00:04:05.329> the<00:04:05.540> white<00:04:05.810> bubbles<00:04:06.790> the<00:04:07.790> next

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
you get the white bubbles the next

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.899 
you get the white bubbles the next
sample<00:04:08.450> I<00:04:08.510> have<00:04:08.540> here<00:04:09.200> is<00:04:09.730> without<00:04:10.730> the

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:10.909 
sample I have here is without the

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:12.970 
sample I have here is without the
pressure<00:04:11.209> pot<00:04:11.569> or<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:11.870> vacuum<00:04:12.260> chamber<00:04:12.470> this

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
pressure pot or the vacuum chamber this

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.380 
pressure pot or the vacuum chamber this
is<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.220> one<00:04:13.370> where<00:04:13.549> I<00:04:13.579> just<00:04:13.640> left<00:04:14.000> out<00:04:14.209> in<00:04:14.329> the

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
is the one where I just left out in the

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.810 
is the one where I just left out in the
open<00:04:14.420> and<00:04:14.900> as<00:04:15.380> you<00:04:15.530> can<00:04:15.709> see<00:04:15.980> it's<00:04:16.220> got<00:04:16.430> a<00:04:16.459> lot

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
open and as you can see it's got a lot

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.440 
open and as you can see it's got a lot
of<00:04:17.269> tiny<00:04:17.630> little<00:04:17.959> air<00:04:18.320> bubbles<00:04:18.739> and<00:04:19.269> those<00:04:20.269> are

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
of tiny little air bubbles and those are

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.330 
of tiny little air bubbles and those are
air<00:04:20.630> bubbles<00:04:21.049> that<00:04:21.139> will<00:04:21.410> be<00:04:21.560> visible<00:04:21.769> once

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
air bubbles that will be visible once

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.159 
air bubbles that will be visible once
you<00:04:22.520> turn<00:04:22.820> it<00:04:23.000> on<00:04:23.090> your<00:04:23.300> lathe<00:04:23.539> and<00:04:23.900> try<00:04:24.110> to

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
you turn it on your lathe and try to

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.010 
you turn it on your lathe and try to
polish<00:04:24.560> it<00:04:24.740> up<00:04:24.940> it's<00:04:25.940> kind<00:04:26.210> of<00:04:26.270> going<00:04:26.780> to<00:04:26.840> give

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
polish it up it's kind of going to give

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.690 
polish it up it's kind of going to give
you<00:04:27.110> a<00:04:27.139> really<00:04:27.500> rough<00:04:27.770> surface<00:04:28.310> and<00:04:28.580> it's

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
you a really rough surface and it's

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.070 
you a really rough surface and it's
really<00:04:28.970> not<00:04:29.090> going<00:04:29.300> to<00:04:29.360> turn<00:04:29.539> out<00:04:29.599> very<00:04:29.930> well

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
really not going to turn out very well

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.159 
really not going to turn out very well
and<00:04:30.500> a<00:04:31.310> third<00:04:31.610> sample<00:04:31.970> is<00:04:32.330> probably<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:32.930> worst

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
and a third sample is probably the worst

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.900 
and a third sample is probably the worst
out<00:04:33.560> of<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:33.800> three<00:04:34.130> and<00:04:34.160> really<00:04:34.669> what<00:04:34.820> I've

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
out of the three and really what I've

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.430 
out of the three and really what I've
been<00:04:35.000> telling<00:04:35.360> people<00:04:35.690> for<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:35.990> longest<00:04:36.169> time

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
been telling people for the longest time

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.129 
been telling people for the longest time
is<00:04:36.770> you<00:04:36.889> can't<00:04:37.190> use<00:04:37.490> vacuum<00:04:38.240> with<00:04:38.690> a<00:04:38.720> luma

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
is you can't use vacuum with a luma

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.510 
is you can't use vacuum with a luma
light<00:04:39.289> clear<00:04:39.650> because<00:04:39.889> you<00:04:40.070> really<00:04:40.460> don't

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
light clear because you really don't

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.540 
light clear because you really don't
have<00:04:40.760> that<00:04:40.820> much<00:04:41.270> time<00:04:41.949> before<00:04:42.949> it<00:04:43.250> starts

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
have that much time before it starts

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.570 
have that much time before it starts
setting<00:04:43.940> to<00:04:44.090> get<00:04:44.240> all<00:04:44.510> that<00:04:44.720> air<00:04:44.990> out<00:04:45.490> so<00:04:46.490> as

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
setting to get all that air out so as

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.790 
setting to get all that air out so as
you<00:04:46.699> can<00:04:46.849> see<00:04:47.060> here<00:04:47.389> this<00:04:48.020> is<00:04:48.080> what<00:04:48.410> it<00:04:48.500> turned

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
you can see here this is what it turned
