00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
okay after after another two hours

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.390 
okay after after another two hours
because<00:00:05.279> I'm<00:00:05.400> going<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.609> get<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:05.730> bed<00:00:05.940> now<00:00:06.150> they

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:07.400 
because I'm going to get a bed now they

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.879 
because I'm going to get a bed now they
will<00:00:08.400> get<00:00:08.610> in<00:00:08.730> oh<00:00:09.980> good<00:00:10.980> oh<00:00:12.469> he's<00:00:13.469> gone<00:00:13.650> off<00:00:13.740> in

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
will get in oh good oh he's gone off in

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:23.140 
will get in oh good oh he's gone off in

it 12 volts charging across battery I

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.019 
it 12 volts charging across battery I
and<00:00:24.150> we've<00:00:24.330> got<00:00:25.400> seven<00:00:26.400> point<00:00:26.730> two<00:00:26.849> eight

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
and we've got seven point two eight

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.659 
and we've got seven point two eight
volts<00:00:28.460> charging<00:00:29.460> across<00:00:29.609> battery<00:00:30.150> sing

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.759 

yeah<00:00:33.269> well<00:00:33.660> I'm<00:00:33.989> going<00:00:34.109> to<00:00:34.199> do<00:00:34.289> now<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.500> look

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:34.769 
yeah well I'm going to do now is look

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:36.919 
yeah well I'm going to do now is look
for<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.039> true<00:00:35.219> voltages<00:00:35.789> again<00:00:36.059> okay

00:00:36.919 --> 00:00:36.929 
for the true voltages again okay

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:39.079 
for the true voltages again okay
actually<00:00:37.829> what<00:00:37.949> it<00:00:38.039> is<00:00:38.129> as<00:00:38.280> opposed<00:00:38.519> to<00:00:38.789> the

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:39.089 
actually what it is as opposed to the

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:42.549 
actually what it is as opposed to the
charging<00:00:39.510> voltages<00:00:40.019> are<00:00:40.879> you<00:00:41.879> still<00:00:42.120> spare

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
charging voltages are you still spare

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.840 
charging voltages are you still spare
sata<00:00:43.559> speed<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.949> seems<00:00:44.339> to<00:00:44.519> have<00:00:44.609> been<00:00:44.699> it's

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
sata speed it seems to have been it's

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.540 
sata speed it seems to have been it's
been<00:00:44.879> there<00:00:45.149> all<00:00:45.300> night<00:00:46.190> it's<00:00:47.190> been<00:00:47.370> running

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
been there all night it's been running

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.740 
been there all night it's been running
for<00:00:47.670> about<00:00:49.789> 18<00:00:50.789> hours<00:00:51.210> now<00:00:52.760> so<00:00:53.760> they're<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:54.600> to

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
for about 18 hours now so they're in to

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.990 
for about 18 hours now so they're in to
find<00:00:55.049> everything<00:00:55.350> else<00:00:55.589> you'd<00:00:56.460> expect<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.909> to

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
find everything else you'd expect it to

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.459 
find everything else you'd expect it to
be<00:00:57.119> because<00:00:57.299> it's<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.659> inside<00:00:57.869> of<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.140> hard

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
be because it's the inside of the hard

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.279 
be because it's the inside of the hard
drive<00:00:59.000> listen<00:01:00.000> up<00:01:00.089> too<00:01:00.329> much<00:01:00.689> faster<00:01:01.079> speeds

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
drive listen up too much faster speeds

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.590 
drive listen up too much faster speeds
in<00:01:01.439> this<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.920> stay<00:01:02.789> up<00:01:02.820> there<00:01:03.059> for<00:01:03.359> quite<00:01:03.479> a

right<00:02:33.400> now<00:02:35.170> we've<00:02:36.170> got<00:02:36.200> when<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.740> road<00:02:37.310> to

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
right now we've got when the road to

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.040 
right now we've got when the road to
stop<00:02:37.730> spinning<00:02:38.180> is<00:02:38.360> a<00:02:39.160> 5.9<00:02:40.160> one<00:02:40.490> across<00:02:41.300> what

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
stop spinning is a 5.9 one across what

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.030 
stop spinning is a 5.9 one across what
work<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.470> plug<00:02:42.740> the<00:02:43.070> on<00:02:44.470> one<00:02:45.470> chargeable

work and plug the on one chargeable
battery<00:02:46.100> is<00:02:46.460> a<00:02:46.550> second<00:02:46.850> again<00:02:47.090> I<00:02:51.040> felt<00:02:52.040> looking

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
battery is a second again I felt looking

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.490 
battery is a second again I felt looking
too<00:02:52.460> good<00:02:52.700> light<00:02:52.910> but<00:02:53.080> it's<00:02:54.080> still<00:02:54.260> definitely

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
too good light but it's still definitely

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.190 
too good light but it's still definitely
higher<00:02:54.920> than<00:02:55.160> it<00:02:55.250> was<00:02:57.280> and<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:59.840> batteries

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
higher than it was and the batteries

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.760 
higher than it was and the batteries
that<00:03:00.380> were<00:03:00.500> running<00:03:00.740> all<00:03:00.950> this<00:03:01.280> are<00:03:01.580> an<00:03:01.610> 11

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
that were running all this are an 11

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:12.890 
that were running all this are an 11
point<00:03:03.770> nine<00:03:04.100> seven

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.890 

six<00:03:13.620> is<00:03:13.769> going<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.010> go<00:03:14.069> down<00:03:14.099> any<00:03:14.310> further

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.790 

probably<00:03:18.900> get<00:03:18.959> out<00:03:19.110> a<00:03:19.140> bit

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.420 

definitely<00:03:25.730> living<00:03:26.000> point<00:03:26.210> 97<00:03:26.780> there<00:03:27.430> seem

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
definitely living point 97 there seem

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:36.910 
definitely living point 97 there seem
quite<00:03:28.610> stable<00:03:28.820> ever<00:03:29.090> since<00:03:29.300> we<00:03:29.480> stopped<00:03:30.140> it

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.750 

and<00:03:37.920> that's<00:03:41.180> 4.7<00:03:42.180> knowing<00:03:42.420> across<00:03:42.810> the

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
and that's 4.7 knowing across the

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:51.780 
and that's 4.7 knowing across the
actress<00:03:44.760> a

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.950 

open<00:03:52.659> seven<00:03:52.959> eight

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.930 

we've<00:03:57.560> definitely<00:03:57.800> got<00:03:58.130> more<00:03:58.340> into<00:03:58.850> the

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
we've definitely got more into the

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.230 
we've definitely got more into the
system<00:03:59.330> I<00:03:59.420> think<00:03:59.450> because<00:04:01.060> voltage<00:04:02.060> is

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
system I think because voltage is

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.840 
system I think because voltage is
directly<00:04:02.600> correlated<00:04:03.170> amps<00:04:06.460> which<00:04:07.460> means<00:04:07.700> if

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
directly correlated amps which means if

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.080 
directly correlated amps which means if
we're<00:04:07.970> getting<00:04:08.210> more<00:04:08.330> voltage<00:04:09.850> we<00:04:10.850> definitely

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
we're getting more voltage we definitely

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:18.770 
we're getting more voltage we definitely
have<00:04:11.810> more<00:04:12.020> amps

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.420 

so<00:04:19.820> this<00:04:20.820> is<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.120> final<00:04:21.540> four<00:04:21.660> now<00:04:22.010> just<00:04:23.010> four

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
so this is the final four now just four
