I<00:00:26.320> don't<00:00:27.280> know<00:00:27.400> it's<00:00:27.610> just<00:00:27.700> a<00:00:27.850> bit<00:00:28.030> it<00:00:28.390> says<00:00:28.570> the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
I don't know it's just a bit it says the

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.339 
I don't know it's just a bit it says the
videos<00:00:29.440> for<00:00:29.710> Paradise<00:00:30.160> Island<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:31.510> I<00:00:31.930> don't

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
videos for Paradise Island so I don't

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.700 
videos for Paradise Island so I don't
know<00:00:32.470> where<00:00:32.680> LLC's

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.740 

early<00:00:36.710> this<00:00:37.280> will<00:00:37.520> be<00:00:37.670> a<00:00:37.700> 270<00:00:40.630> so<00:00:41.630> the

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
early this will be a 270 so the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.500 
early this will be a 270 so the
difference<00:00:41.960> between<00:00:42.290> ours<00:00:42.710> and<00:00:43.070> the<00:00:43.820> other<00:00:44.000> HD

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
difference between ours and the other HD

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.600 
difference between ours and the other HD
screens<00:00:44.930> out<00:00:45.140> there<00:00:45.410> so<00:00:45.590> the<00:00:45.680> one<00:00:45.830> that<00:00:46.040> the

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
screens out there so the one that the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.690 
screens out there so the one that the
ammo<00:00:46.820> electron<00:00:47.270> is<00:00:47.710> in<00:00:48.710> each<00:00:48.860> sub-pixel<00:00:49.310> you

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
ammo electron is in each sub-pixel you

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.430 
ammo electron is in each sub-pixel you
get<00:00:49.880> red<00:00:50.060> green<00:00:50.330> and<00:00:50.360> blue<00:00:50.540> sea<00:00:50.840> get<00:00:51.050> all<00:00:51.230> the

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
get red green and blue sea get all the

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.230 
get red green and blue sea get all the
color<00:00:51.680> representations<00:00:52.580> that<00:00:52.670> you<00:00:52.910> get<00:00:53.090> with

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:53.240 
color representations that you get with

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.380 
color representations that you get with
your<00:00:53.360> TV's<00:00:53.800> with<00:00:54.800> this<00:00:55.010> samsung<00:00:55.520> HD<00:00:56.000> if<00:00:56.270> the

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
your TV's with this samsung HD if the

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.440 
your TV's with this samsung HD if the
AMOLED<00:00:56.870> screen<00:00:57.230> it<00:00:58.190> only<00:00:58.430> has<00:00:58.700> red<00:00:59.000> green<00:00:59.300> or

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
AMOLED screen it only has red green or

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.870 
AMOLED screen it only has red green or
green<00:00:59.690> blue<00:00:59.960> so<00:01:00.770> what<00:01:01.040> happens<00:01:01.430> is<00:01:01.610> if<00:01:01.730> that

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
green blue so what happens is if that

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.730 
green blue so what happens is if that
needs<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.240> other<00:01:02.450> color<00:01:02.780> has<00:01:03.170> to<00:01:03.380> borrow<00:01:03.560> it

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:03.740 
needs the other color has to borrow it

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.280 
needs the other color has to borrow it
from<00:01:04.040> another<00:01:04.370> subject<00:01:05.020> that's<00:01:06.020> what<00:01:06.200> they

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
from another subject that's what they

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.710 
from another subject that's what they
call<00:01:06.530> a<00:01:06.560> pentile<00:01:07.130> where<00:01:07.940> ours<00:01:08.210> is<00:01:08.390> what<00:01:08.570> we

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
call a pentile where ours is what we

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.010 
call a pentile where ours is what we
call<00:01:08.900> a<00:01:08.930> strike<00:01:09.350> I<00:01:09.650> so<00:01:10.520> it<00:01:10.670> has<00:01:10.700> more<00:01:11.390> millions

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
call a strike I so it has more millions

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.850 
call a strike I so it has more millions
is<00:01:12.920> 2.76<00:01:13.850> million<00:01:14.390> pixels<00:01:14.900> on<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:15.200> screen

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
is 2.76 million pixels on the screen

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.330 
is 2.76 million pixels on the screen
where<00:01:16.760> there's<00:01:16.970> only<00:01:17.300> one<00:01:17.540> point<00:01:17.810> 84<00:01:18.290> so<00:01:19.280> you

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
where there's only one point 84 so you

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.530 
where there's only one point 84 so you
lose<00:01:20.740> three<00:01:21.740> quarters<00:01:22.190> of<00:01:22.220> you<00:01:22.460> picture<00:01:23.420> with

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
lose three quarters of you picture with

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.060 
lose three quarters of you picture with
amount<00:01:23.840> of<00:01:23.900> pixels<00:01:24.260> in<00:01:24.410> there<00:01:24.560> how<00:01:24.830> does<00:01:24.979> the

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
amount of pixels in there how does the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.800 
amount of pixels in there how does the
fact<00:01:25.280> that<00:01:25.369> when<00:01:25.640> you're<00:01:25.760> playing<00:01:25.970> it's<00:01:26.570> the

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
fact that when you're playing it's the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.300 
fact that when you're playing it's the
videos<00:01:28.240> so<00:01:29.240> again<00:01:29.960> it's<00:01:30.380> down<00:01:30.680> to<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.070> matter

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
videos so again it's down to the matter

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.330 
videos so again it's down to the matter
cause<00:01:31.729> that<00:01:32.150> they're<00:01:33.140> playing<00:01:33.500> so<00:01:33.890> what<00:01:34.130> the

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
cause that they're playing so what the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.740 
cause that they're playing so what the
core<00:01:34.610> needs<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:35.180> use

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
core needs to use

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.800 
core needs to use
so<00:01:36.350> if<00:01:37.160> we<00:01:37.220> playing<00:01:37.580> a<00:01:37.670> HD<00:01:38.060> video<00:01:38.390> and<00:01:38.480> it<00:01:38.600> needs

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
so if we playing a HD video and it needs

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.900 
so if we playing a HD video and it needs
more<00:01:38.990> power<00:01:39.260> then<00:01:39.560> all<00:01:39.830> it<00:01:39.980> will<00:01:40.130> do<00:01:40.370> the<00:01:40.400> chip

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
more power then all it will do the chip

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.860 
more power then all it will do the chip
will<00:01:41.180> tell<00:01:42.010> needs<00:01:43.010> to<00:01:43.220> turn<00:01:43.400> on<00:01:43.610> more<00:01:43.790> cause<00:01:44.120> so

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
will tell needs to turn on more cause so

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.600 
will tell needs to turn on more cause so
that's<00:01:45.050> what<00:01:45.260> this<00:01:45.410> is<00:01:45.470> doing<00:01:45.800> so<00:01:46.160> you'll<00:01:46.340> see

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
that's what this is doing so you'll see

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.490 
that's what this is doing so you'll see
that<00:01:46.790> will<00:01:47.030> fluctuate<00:01:47.270> and<00:01:47.720> change<00:01:47.810> all<00:01:48.320> the

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
that will fluctuate and change all the

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.240 
that will fluctuate and change all the
time<00:01:48.729> so<00:01:49.729> it's<00:01:49.760> just<00:01:50.000> what<00:01:50.240> it<00:01:50.270> needs<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:50.690> use

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
time so it's just what it needs to use

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.920 
time so it's just what it needs to use
I've<00:01:52.250> got<00:01:52.490> a<00:01:52.520> game<00:01:52.790> on<00:01:52.970> here<00:01:53.180> called<00:01:53.390> global

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
I've got a game on here called global

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.560 
I've got a game on here called global
that<00:01:54.740> will<00:01:54.950> use<00:01:55.160> it<00:01:55.369> to<00:01:55.610> its<00:01:55.640> maximum<00:01:56.210> of<00:01:56.479> the

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
that will use it to its maximum of the

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.810 
that will use it to its maximum of the
full<00:01:56.810> course<00:01:57.110> when<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:58.010> play<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.400> game<00:01:58.580> it's

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
full course when you play the game it's

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.560 
full course when you play the game it's
extremely<00:01:59.660> vast<00:02:00.640> Mike<00:02:01.640> can<00:02:01.850> I<00:02:01.880> just<00:02:02.150> take<00:02:02.300> you

play cod global for you to catch up on
it<00:02:21.780> because<00:02:22.410> it's<00:02:22.620> very<00:02:22.800> fast

is it available in the US market do
either<00:02:33.180> this<00:02:33.990> is<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.620> we're<00:02:35.070> not<00:02:35.100> sure<00:02:35.400> we

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
either this is and we're not sure we

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
haven't been told what regions it's

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.320 
haven't been told what regions it's
going<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.260> go<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.550> all<00:02:38.550> we<00:02:38.730> know<00:02:38.880> exactly<00:02:39.300> the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
going to go to all we know exactly the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.730 
going to go to all we know exactly the
device<00:02:39.720> you're<00:02:39.930> launching<00:02:40.170> q2<00:02:41.210> yeah<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:43.590> this

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
device you're launching q2 yeah so this

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.680 
device you're launching q2 yeah so this
one<00:02:43.890> because<00:02:44.070> there's<00:02:44.460> so<00:02:44.670> much<00:02:44.850> data<00:02:45.180> on<00:02:45.540> it

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
one because there's so much data on it

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.770 
one because there's so much data on it
obviously<00:02:46.880> we<00:02:47.880> put<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.150> for<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.360> sleeve<00:02:48.600> of

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
obviously we put it for the sleeve of

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.500 
obviously we put it for the sleeve of
sea<00:02:48.990> floor<00:02:49.340> it<00:02:50.340> takes<00:02:50.820> a<00:02:50.940> little<00:02:51.090> while<00:02:51.240> to

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
sea floor it takes a little while to

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.630 
sea floor it takes a little while to
load<00:02:51.660> because<00:02:52.020> it's<00:02:52.230> so<00:02:52.470> we'll<00:02:52.830> use<00:02:53.100> a<00:02:53.130> maximum

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
load because it's so we'll use a maximum

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.820 
load because it's so we'll use a maximum
of<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.820> four<00:02:54.030> paws<00:02:54.330> so<00:02:55.140> it's<00:02:55.290> opening<00:02:55.650> and

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
of the four paws so it's opening and

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.610 
of the four paws so it's opening and
it's<00:02:55.950> using<00:02:56.280> three<00:02:56.550> at<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.730> moment<00:02:57.500> when<00:02:58.500> you

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
it's using three at the moment when you

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.130 
it's using three at the moment when you
start<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.070> play<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.520> game<00:02:59.790> you'll<00:03:00.600> see<00:03:00.840> goal

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
start to play the game you'll see goal

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:11.020 
start to play the game you'll see goal
for<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.890> spikes<00:03:02.310> in<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.700> maximum

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.150 

one<00:03:11.600> of<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:11.810> other<00:03:11.930> patents<00:03:12.590> or<00:03:12.740> one<00:03:12.980> of<00:03:13.010> the

one of the other patents or one of the

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.980 
one of the other patents or one of the
other<00:03:13.310> features<00:03:13.730> that<00:03:13.850> were<00:03:14.120> shown<00:03:14.690> on<00:03:14.870> the

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
other features that were shown on the

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.930 
other features that were shown on the
main<00:03:15.170> booth<00:03:15.470> that<00:03:15.830> government<00:03:16.580> to<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:16.700> main

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
main booth that government to the main

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.150 
main booth that government to the main
booth<00:03:17.180> they've<00:03:18.020> got<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:18.260> demonstration<00:03:18.800> where

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
booth they've got a demonstration where

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.930 
booth they've got a demonstration where
they<00:03:19.580> show<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:20.030> device<00:03:20.650> with<00:03:21.650> two<00:03:22.430> or<00:03:22.610> four

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
they show the device with two or four

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.880 
they show the device with two or four
cores<00:03:23.270> working<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:23.990> you<00:03:24.200> can<00:03:24.380> see<00:03:24.650> the

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
cores working and you can see the

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.340 
cores working and you can see the
difference<00:03:25.310> in<00:03:25.490> the<00:03:25.580> performance<00:03:26.170> from<00:03:27.170> it's

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
difference in the performance from it's

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.710 
difference in the performance from it's
actually<00:03:27.470> it's<00:03:27.860> freezing<00:03:28.430> are<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.270> video<00:03:29.540> is

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
actually it's freezing are the video is

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.860 
actually it's freezing are the video is
now<00:03:30.680> that's<00:03:30.860> a<00:03:30.950> game<00:03:33.040> must<00:03:34.040> refer<00:03:34.430> I<00:03:34.850> can't<00:03:35.690> see

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
now that's a game must refer I can't see

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:56.640 
now that's a game must refer I can't see
one<00:03:36.020> doing<00:03:36.230> upside<00:03:36.530> down<00:03:37.270> well

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.640
