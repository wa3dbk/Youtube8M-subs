00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.980
Miles: Junior year of college

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.520
I had, uh, recently broken up

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.220
with a pretty long term girlfriend.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.160
She invited me to her 21st birthday

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.480
And I was, like, trying to be nice

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.400
I was like 'sure, yeah, I'll go'

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.140
I didn't want to go

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.280
It was at her new boyfriend's house

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.360
So, I go to the party with a few friends

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.440
I'm having a miserable time

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.680
Her best friend made a homemade cake for her

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.000
a really beautiful cake

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.500
She's really happy

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.440
and I'm in the back, drinking

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.240
lots and being a

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.440
curmudgeon about the whole thing

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.220
I finally found a time where I felt like

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.360
"Okay, I've been here for an appropriate

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.720
amount of time. I can leave."

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.220
Okay, let's go

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.420
My friend Adam and I had to drive a bunch of our drunk friends home

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.380
The last guy that we had to get home

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.640
Was my old roommate Shea

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.340
I tell him 'hey, dude, we're gonna go ahead and drive you home now'

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.800
'come on, in the car'

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.300
He goes 'ok, hold on

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.060
I have to run to the bathroom and I've gotta grab something.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.560
I'll be right back.'

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.180
I'm like 'okay'

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.820
I get in the car

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.160
I'm really bitter. I'm really angry.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.220
Shea comes sprinting out of the house

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.180
He dives into the car

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.220
He goes 'Go! We gotta go! We gotta go!'

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.880
We take off

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.580
'Dude, what's going on?'

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.700
He stole the cake

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.760
I'm like 'why did you do that?!'

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.640
*drunkenly* 'It's a good cake'

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.220
*Gus laughter*

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.260
My miserable night has done a complete 180.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
So we're laughing, we're having a great time, we're driving home

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.420
Near the UT campus is a

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.600
place called Ken's Donuts

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.240
Gus: Yes

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.800
Miles: It is a 24 hour donut shop

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.300
Barb: So good!

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.740
Miles: We mention Ken's Donuts

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.480
And all of a sudden like passed-out Shea goes

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.600
'Oooooh!

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.620
We need to go to Ken's Donuts!'

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.600
'Well why is that?'

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.380
'Well, I can buy donuts with this cake.'

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.220
'Shea, that is a half eaten cake!'

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.920
'Yeah it is.'

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.440
'How many Donuts do you think we could get with that cake?'

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.820
He stops and seriously stares for like a good thirty seconds

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.200
'If I were to guess, I would say

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.200
approximately six dozen.'

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.700
Adam's like 'alright, so we're going to Ken's Donuts.'

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.860
We pull in

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.960
The guy there's like 'hey, welcome to Ken's Donuts! How you doing?'

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.520
He slams it down on the table

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.360
'So, let's make this happen.'

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.580
The guy's like 'I'm... Let's make what happen?'

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.940
'You know what.'

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:40.520
*Gus and Barb laughter*

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.600
He goes 'Listen.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.320
I have sweets

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.080
You sell sweets

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.940
I think we know what's going on here.'

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.140
The guy's like 'seriously, I seriously don't know.'

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.260
He slams the table

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.700
'Are you gonna buy my cake or aren't you?!

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.960
Give me donuts!'

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.760
At that point the guy started to get annoyed and go for the phone

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.060
So we had to drag him out of there

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.420
and for the rest of the night

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.700
he was just sulking

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.060
'It could have been, man.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.040
Six dozen.'

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.160
But he completely made my night.
