this<00:04:07.780> and<00:04:08.250> godmother<00:04:09.250> and<00:04:09.340> I<00:04:09.550> thought<00:04:10.060> I<00:04:10.270> was

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
this and godmother and I thought I was

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.020 
this and godmother and I thought I was
like<00:04:10.510> a<00:04:10.600> really<00:04:11.140> long<00:04:11.530> godmother<00:04:12.190> like<00:04:12.520> really

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.250 
like a really long godmother like really
badly<00:04:13.240> but<00:04:14.200> then<00:04:14.380> I<00:04:14.820> realized<00:04:15.820> that<00:04:16.000> like<00:04:16.299> it's

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
badly but then I realized that like it's

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.110 
badly but then I realized that like it's
the<00:04:17.410> same<00:04:17.590> scent<00:04:17.830> as<00:04:17.920> Snow<00:04:18.160> Fairy<00:04:18.430> so<00:04:18.820> I<00:04:18.850> was

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
the same scent as Snow Fairy so I was

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.180 
the same scent as Snow Fairy so I was
like<00:04:19.270> kind<00:04:20.230> of<00:04:20.320> mix<00:04:20.500> it<00:04:20.680> up<00:04:20.739> a<00:04:20.890> little<00:04:20.920> bit

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
like kind of mix it up a little bit

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.610 
like kind of mix it up a little bit
because<00:04:21.820> since<00:04:22.570> this<00:04:22.690> is<00:04:22.870> limited<00:04:22.990> edition

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
have a huge thing at this and might as

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.220 
have a huge thing at this and might as
well<00:04:25.210> use<00:04:25.330> this<00:04:25.480> because<00:04:25.630> I<00:04:25.900> don't<00:04:26.080> think

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
well use this because I don't think

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.560
