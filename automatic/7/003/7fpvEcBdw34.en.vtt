00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
piece of technology but a few minor

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.089 
piece of technology but a few minor
changes<00:00:29.010> first<00:00:29.580> off<00:00:30.349> every<00:00:31.349> time<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.740> start

climate<00:00:36.230> top-right<00:00:37.230> navigation<00:00:37.640> top<00:00:38.640> left<00:00:38.910> is

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
climate top-right navigation top left is

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.540 
climate top-right navigation top left is
your<00:00:39.210> phone<00:00:39.390> bottom<00:00:39.870> left<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.200> music<00:00:40.559> now<00:00:41.219> I'm

your phone bottom left is music now I'm
like<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> lot<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.090> people<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.510> use<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:42.960> mainly

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
like a lot of people I use this mainly

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.160 
like a lot of people I use this mainly
for<00:00:43.680> music<00:00:44.010> 99%<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.000> time<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.840> every<00:00:46.050> time

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
for music 99% of the time so every time

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.840 
for music 99% of the time so every time
I<00:00:46.289> get<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.559> car<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.739> have<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.010> select<00:00:47.309> music

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
I get in the car I have to select music

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.389 
I get in the car I have to select music
I<00:00:48.260> really<00:00:49.260> think<00:00:49.469> they<00:00:49.590> should<00:00:49.620> have<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.250> we

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
I really think they should have it so we

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.869 
I really think they should have it so we
can<00:00:50.579> have<00:00:51.469> music<00:00:52.469> be<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> default<00:00:53.070> screen<00:00:53.250> or

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
can have music be the default screen or

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.279 
can have music be the default screen or
the<00:00:54.090> phone<00:00:54.270> maybe<00:00:54.570> use<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.930> phone<00:00:55.079> all<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
the phone maybe use the phone all the

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.330 
the phone maybe use the phone all the
time<00:00:55.379> but<00:00:55.590> maybe<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.920> only<00:00:56.039> use<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.309> for

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
time but maybe you only use it for

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.490 
time but maybe you only use it for
navigation<00:00:56.870> they<00:00:57.870> should<00:00:58.020> have<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.170> way<00:00:58.440> to

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
navigation they should have a way to

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.529 
navigation they should have a way to
make<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.010> default<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.850> mean<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.420> would<00:01:00.510> be

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
make it default I mean it would be

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.229 
make it default I mean it would be
simple<00:01:00.960> for<00:01:01.109> them<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.320> do<00:01:02.000> second<00:01:03.000> small

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
simple for them to do second small

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.020 
simple for them to do second small
problem<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.409> left<00:01:04.619> side<00:01:04.860> we've<00:01:05.159> got<00:01:05.189> the

up automatically as it is now it takes
three<00:02:22.079> clicks<00:02:22.379> so<00:02:23.220> we<00:02:23.370> go<00:02:23.459> one<00:02:24.470> then<00:02:25.470> we<00:02:25.620> hit

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
three clicks so we go one then we hit

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.339 
three clicks so we go one then we hit
destination<00:02:26.610> then<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.629> hit<00:02:27.750> my<00:02:27.930> home<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.170> would

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
destination then you hit my home I would

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.869 
destination then you hit my home I would
hit<00:02:28.409> it<00:02:28.560> but<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:28.769> shows<00:02:28.920> my<00:02:29.189> home<00:02:29.430> address<00:02:29.549> I

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
hit it but it shows my home address I

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.839 
hit it but it shows my home address I
don't<00:02:30.000> want<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.180> do<00:02:30.269> that<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:31.430> one<00:02:32.430> click<00:02:32.670> there

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
don't want to do that I one click there

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.069 
don't want to do that I one click there
and<00:02:33.060> then<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.239> have<00:02:33.329> to<00:02:33.420> do<00:02:33.510> one<00:02:33.659> more<00:02:33.690> click

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
and then you have to do one more click

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.949 
and then you have to do one more click
so<00:02:34.230> it's<00:02:34.349> three<00:02:34.620> clicks<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:35.159> get<00:02:35.790> home<00:02:36.060> whereas

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
so it's three clicks to get home whereas

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.089 
so it's three clicks to get home whereas
it<00:02:37.110> could<00:02:37.200> be<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.319> lot<00:02:37.500> easier<00:02:37.799> if<00:02:37.829> they<00:02:37.950> just

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
it could be a lot easier if they just

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.250 
it could be a lot easier if they just
had<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.280> little<00:02:38.549> home<00:02:38.790> icon<00:02:39.090> somewhere<00:02:42.260> fourth

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
had a little home icon somewhere fourth

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.530 
had a little home icon somewhere fourth
thing<00:02:43.470> this<00:02:43.769> thing<00:02:44.129> shuts<00:02:44.549> off<00:02:44.790> after<00:02:45.150> 15

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
thing this thing shuts off after 15

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.199 
thing this thing shuts off after 15
minutes<00:02:45.959> automatically<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.579> I<00:02:47.609> often<00:02:47.849> get<00:02:48.060> my

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
minutes automatically so I often get my

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
a song or listening to an interview the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.180 
a song or listening to an interview the
thing<00:02:54.900> shuts<00:02:55.139> off<00:02:55.319> with<00:02:55.530> no<00:02:55.650> warning<00:02:55.920> and

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
thing shuts off with no warning and

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.270 
thing shuts off with no warning and
there's<00:02:56.639> no<00:02:56.879> way<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.680> set<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.709> so<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.010> it

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
there's no way to set it so that it

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.369 
there's no way to set it so that it

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
takes longer to shut off I think you

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:02.599 
takes longer to shut off I think you
should<00:03:01.530> have<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:01.859> option<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.220> having<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.459> shut

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
should have the option of having to shut

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.960 
should have the option of having to shut
off<00:03:02.730> after<00:03:02.940> 30<00:03:03.329> minutes<00:03:04.400> or<00:03:05.400> maybe<00:03:05.760> just<00:03:05.849> a
