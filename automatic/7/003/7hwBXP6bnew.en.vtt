00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.469 
think i had to unlock at this time
that's<00:01:46.649> why<00:01:46.799> i'm<00:01:46.890> not<00:01:46.950> using<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.369> right<00:01:47.520> now<00:01:47.549> my

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
that's why i'm not using it right now my

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.319

that's<00:04:09.810> just<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.079> hypocrisy<00:04:10.410> I've<00:04:10.919> learned

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
that's just the hypocrisy I've learned

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.879 
that's just the hypocrisy I've learned
and<00:04:12.139> discovered<00:04:13.139> from<00:04:13.379> the<00:04:13.560> sniping

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
and discovered from the sniping

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:14.930 
and discovered from the sniping
community<00:04:14.250> it's<00:04:14.340> absolutely<00:04:14.910> ridiculous

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
community it's absolutely ridiculous

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.199 
community it's absolutely ridiculous
dies<00:04:15.690> so<00:04:16.229> to<00:04:16.650> me<00:04:16.859> hardscoping<00:04:17.729> is<00:04:17.880> irrelevant

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
dies so to me hardscoping is irrelevant

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.640 
dies so to me hardscoping is irrelevant
because<00:04:18.570> that's<00:04:18.780> what<00:04:18.959> they<00:04:19.079> do<00:04:19.139> in<00:04:19.440> real<00:04:19.590> life

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
because that's what they do in real life

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.459 
because that's what they do in real life
when<00:04:20.010> they're<00:04:20.190> sniping<00:04:20.849> they<00:04:21.090> earn<00:04:21.299> my<00:04:21.810> half<00:04:22.349> a
