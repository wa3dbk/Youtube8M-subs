00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.400 
correct on this guitar I opened it up to
try<00:02:13.579> to<00:02:13.640> help<00:02:13.880> me<00:02:14.030> determine<00:02:14.750> what<00:02:14.930> year<00:02:15.230> this

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
try to help me determine what year this

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.580 
try to help me determine what year this
guitar<00:02:15.739> was<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.370> pots<00:02:16.579> are<00:02:16.760> 1974<00:02:17.750> so<00:02:18.410> my

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
guitar was and the pots are 1974 so my

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.800 
guitar was and the pots are 1974 so my
guess<00:02:18.799> is<00:02:18.829> the<00:02:19.549> guy<00:02:19.670> played<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.269> to<00:02:20.390> death<00:02:20.600> and

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
guess is the guy played it to death and

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.530 
guess is the guy played it to death and
then<00:02:21.079> finally<00:02:21.739> the<00:02:22.609> pots<00:02:22.820> gave<00:02:23.090> out<00:02:23.299> or<00:02:23.480> you

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
then finally the pots gave out or you

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.020 
then finally the pots gave out or you

decide to upgrade them whatever the pots

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.150 
decide to upgrade them whatever the pots
are<00:02:26.180> 1974<00:02:27.079> which<00:02:27.350> is<00:02:27.500> not<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.859> year<00:02:28.010> of<00:02:28.100> the

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160
