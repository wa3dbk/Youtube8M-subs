00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
string a thing on the side and a little

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.420 
string a thing on the side and a little

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
hard inside the paper piece and as you

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.700

and this one is kind of similar to the

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.780 
and this one is kind of similar to the
previous<00:03:38.989> one<00:03:39.410> and<00:03:39.620> you'll<00:03:40.070> need<00:03:40.310> pretty<00:03:40.640> much

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
previous one and you'll need pretty much

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.789 
previous one and you'll need pretty much
the<00:03:40.970> same<00:03:41.150> things<00:03:41.540> except<00:03:42.019> instead<00:03:42.260> of<00:03:42.530> the

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
so this last one doesn't require any

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.320 
so this last one doesn't require any
material<00:04:38.950> really<00:04:39.340> except<00:04:39.760> for<00:04:39.790> your<00:04:40.060> phone

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
but it is also may be the most expensive

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.390 
but it is also may be the most expensive
out<00:04:43.180> of<00:04:43.480> these<00:04:43.840> ideas<00:04:44.320> it's<00:04:44.830> not<00:04:44.980> too<00:04:45.220> bad

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
out of these ideas it's not too bad

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.670 
out of these ideas it's not too bad
