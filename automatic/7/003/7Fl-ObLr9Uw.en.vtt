00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 no one can do it in the shepherd and 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.799
 tricks to catch out dornbirn 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.690
 you are presenting a motorcycle here 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.480
 which you can fly that is 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.610
 The idea behind it was actually the idea 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.030
 behind it as not only that one there 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.779
 But it can be a concept with flying 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.670
 for which you transport the future 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.300
 basically the core of the system 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.890
 So the motorcycle so just for 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.949
 short distances so city ​​traffic but 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.170
 one can for long distance while cooking 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.809
 on a plane or a plane 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.750
 contract helicopter a helicopter well 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.760
 railroad car and so on you can 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.610
 thus on rank stretch cope 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.309
 when coupling with a helicopter and 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.980
 a plane with during the flight here 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.350
 also the batteries of the motorcycle 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.700
 charged by the pressure motor and then 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.460
 you have a full expectation of 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.510
 Batteries if you come and can 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.770
 you can continue with it at the city 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.020
 is more suitable for everyday use than you 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.170
 motorcycle concept the motorcycle 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.220
 you there are a three variants 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.530
 basically the planned 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.869
 there is one variant diana open 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.400
 variant how it looks now as a 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.070
 version with a closed cabin 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.650
 as planned so that means everyday 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.479
 all-weather capable it is heated it 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.080
 is air conditioned if you like it 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.170
 wishes all weather yes how should it with 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.970
 continue the project this is the future 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:31.009
 the future of the project here is what 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.409
 We then manufacture here from the 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.090
 motorcycle for the automotive industry 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.840
 want to share 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.060
 so you can do better 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.450
 Acquisition costs for the consumer 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.689
 be guaranteed 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.329
 You can also expand the selection that 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.470
 You can call it the one of a brand or 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.340
 choose the other 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.590
 you can go the color of the equipment 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.729
 here still wishes and also here after 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.680
 the human being is so the sp2 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.619
 live with the motorcycle 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:09.149
 We will not just do the same 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.370
 Free for the aviation industry 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.190
 So this is about this one 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.970
 unit from uniform to this system 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.790
 use 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.300
 mainly is the cooking on or 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.400
 dock to a railroad car and that 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.349
 It also accounts for a major part of 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.750
 concept what we have developed 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.209
 the flying community is one 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.420
 small community so on trouble so 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.879
 mainly looks at who is that 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.709
 system actually for all people 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.629
 thought and not only for 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:44.360
 flying pilots show or for people 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.360
 who want to fly again
