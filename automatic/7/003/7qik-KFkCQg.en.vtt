well<00:01:41.870> I<00:01:42.200> don't<00:01:43.100> know<00:01:43.250> okay<00:01:43.520> this<00:01:43.670> last<00:01:43.880> layer

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
well I don't know okay this last layer

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.910 
well I don't know okay this last layer
what's<00:01:44.900> on<00:01:45.050> here<00:01:45.290> don't<00:01:45.409> even<00:01:45.470> know<00:01:45.650> what's<00:01:45.800> on

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
what's on here don't even know what's on

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.010 
what's on here don't even know what's on
here<00:01:46.070> I<00:01:46.220> think<00:01:46.430> it's<00:01:46.550> a<00:01:46.580> blank<00:01:46.850> layer<00:01:47.120> and<00:01:47.540> then

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
here I think it's a blank layer and then

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.080 
here I think it's a blank layer and then
this<00:01:48.320> one<00:01:48.500> I<00:01:48.530> we<00:01:48.980> went<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.640> little<00:01:49.670> bit<00:01:49.940> more

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
this one I we went a little bit more

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.820 
this one I we went a little bit more
elaborate<00:01:50.450> we<00:01:50.570> have<00:01:50.690> a<00:01:50.720> few<00:01:51.110> more<00:01:51.260> levels<00:01:51.590> of

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
elaborate we have a few more levels of

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.040 
elaborate we have a few more levels of
details<00:01:52.159> so<00:01:52.280> let<00:01:52.400> me<00:01:52.460> just<00:01:52.640> go<00:01:52.760> through<00:01:52.970> that

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
details so let me just go through that

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.020 
details so let me just go through that
okay<00:01:54.050> so<00:01:54.800> the<00:01:54.920> value<00:01:55.190> at<00:01:55.280> this<00:01:55.400> point<00:01:55.640> is<00:01:55.790> good

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
okay so the value at this point is good

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.240 
okay so the value at this point is good
you<00:01:56.659> know<00:01:56.690> I<00:01:56.900> like<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.320> overall<00:01:57.620> value<00:01:57.980> I<00:01:58.010> like

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
you know I like the overall value I like

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.000 
you know I like the overall value I like
the<00:01:58.370> overall<00:01:58.640> contrast<00:01:59.330> so<00:01:59.900> with<00:02:00.350> that<00:02:00.470> set<00:02:00.770> we

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
the overall contrast so with that set we

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.890 
the overall contrast so with that set we
could<00:02:01.159> then<00:02:01.280> go<00:02:01.460> in<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:01.700> add<00:02:01.850> a<00:02:02.300> little<00:02:02.420> bit

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
could then go in and add a little bit

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.830 
could then go in and add a little bit
more<00:02:02.930> detail<00:02:03.409> to<00:02:03.440> make<00:02:03.650> it<00:02:03.800> presentable<00:02:03.950> so

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
more detail to make it presentable so

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.469 
more detail to make it presentable so
here's<00:02:05.840> some<00:02:06.020> snow<00:02:06.320> here<00:02:06.350> are<00:02:06.770> some<00:02:06.920> scratched

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
here's some snow here are some scratched

painting<00:02:40.080> up<00:02:40.319> here<00:02:40.940> okay<00:02:41.940> one<00:02:42.090> layer<00:02:42.239> we<00:02:42.420> are

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
painting up here okay one layer we are

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.089 
painting up here okay one layer we are
here's<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.870> fog<00:02:43.079> layer<00:02:43.319> to<00:02:43.560> again<00:02:43.829> create

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
here's the fog layer to again create

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.650 
here's the fog layer to again create
that<00:02:44.370> sense<00:02:44.579> of<00:02:44.700> creepiness<00:02:45.090> this<00:02:45.480> whole

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
that sense of creepiness this whole

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.319 
that sense of creepiness this whole
Silent<00:02:46.110> Hill<00:02:46.230> type<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:46.650> feel<00:02:46.880> just<00:02:47.880> constantly

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
Silent Hill type of feel just constantly

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.630 
Silent Hill type of feel just constantly
adjusting<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.930> values<00:02:49.380> here<00:02:49.680> this<00:02:50.160> layer<00:02:50.430> in

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
adjusting the values here this layer in

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.309 
adjusting the values here this layer in
particular<00:02:50.910> was<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.599> brighten<00:02:51.840> up<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.079> snow

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
particular was to brighten up the snow

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.589 
particular was to brighten up the snow
to<00:02:52.620> create<00:02:53.010> this<00:02:53.190> high<00:02:53.459> contrast<00:02:54.269> point<00:02:54.510> you

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
to create this high contrast point you

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.650 
to create this high contrast point you
can<00:02:54.720> see<00:02:54.840> here<00:02:55.049> if<00:02:55.140> I<00:02:55.230> turn<00:02:55.440> this<00:02:55.530> on<00:02:55.769> and<00:02:55.799> off

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
can see here if I turn this on and off

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.030 
can see here if I turn this on and off
to<00:02:57.660> really<00:02:57.930> just<00:02:58.110> brighten<00:02:58.530> up<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.769> snow

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
to really just brighten up the snow

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.670 
to really just brighten up the snow
almost<00:02:59.220> give<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.549> that<00:02:59.610> glowy<00:03:00.030> type<00:03:00.599> of<00:03:00.840> look

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
almost give it that glowy type of look

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.949 
almost give it that glowy type of look
and<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:02.640> course<00:03:02.940> that<00:03:03.120> wouldn't<00:03:03.269> bounce<00:03:03.690> into

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
and of course that wouldn't bounce into

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.259 
and of course that wouldn't bounce into
these<00:03:04.200> walls<00:03:04.500> here<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.250> snow<00:03:05.489> is<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:05.670> quite<00:03:06.090> a

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
these walls here the snow is a quite a

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.589 
these walls here the snow is a quite a
reflective<00:03:07.079> material<00:03:07.680> here<00:03:08.430> so<00:03:08.579> it<00:03:09.360> will<00:03:09.450> just

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
reflective material here so it will just

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.740 
reflective material here so it will just
balance<00:03:09.959> boom<00:03:10.140> boom<00:03:10.349> into<00:03:10.739> here<00:03:11.750> further

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
balance boom boom into here further

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.729 
balance boom boom into here further
bring<00:03:12.989> up<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.379> fog<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:14.959> then<00:03:15.959> another<00:03:16.530> layer

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
bring up the fog and then another layer

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.199 
bring up the fog and then another layer
of<00:03:16.859> detail<00:03:17.160> just<00:03:17.220> keep<00:03:17.519> adding<00:03:17.670> this<00:03:17.880> stuff<00:03:18.030> in

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
of detail just keep adding this stuff in

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.819 
of detail just keep adding this stuff in
especially<00:03:18.540> on<00:03:18.600> these<00:03:18.750> rocks<00:03:19.019> because<00:03:19.500> I<00:03:19.590> felt

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
especially on these rocks because I felt

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.680 
especially on these rocks because I felt
at<00:03:19.950> this<00:03:20.130> stage<00:03:20.370> it's<00:03:20.880> still<00:03:21.060> too<00:03:21.239> rough<00:03:21.510> it's

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
at this stage it's still too rough it's

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.199 
at this stage it's still too rough it's
not<00:03:22.280> helping<00:03:23.280> with<00:03:23.400> my<00:03:23.549> forms<00:03:23.940> it's<00:03:24.090> not

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
not helping with my forms it's not

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.280 
not helping with my forms it's not
making<00:03:24.510> this<00:03:24.630> look<00:03:24.780> like<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:25.019> building

so<00:05:14.130> if<00:05:14.160> we<00:05:14.430> have<00:05:14.669> two<00:05:14.880> of<00:05:14.970> these<00:05:15.060> to<00:05:15.210> present

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
so if we have two of these to present

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.960 
so if we have two of these to present
have<00:05:16.380> some<00:05:16.620> way<00:05:16.770> to<00:05:16.830> distinguish<00:05:17.340> the<00:05:17.669> one<00:05:17.820> you

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
have some way to distinguish the one you

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.340 
have some way to distinguish the one you
know<00:05:18.060> of<00:05:18.300> course<00:05:18.510> top<00:05:18.660> and<00:05:18.810> bottom<00:05:19.080> is<00:05:19.169> easy

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
know of course top and bottom is easy

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.810 
know of course top and bottom is easy
but<00:05:19.500> if<00:05:19.740> you<00:05:19.860> just<00:05:19.979> put<00:05:20.130> a<00:05:20.190> number<00:05:20.310> like<00:05:20.580> one<00:05:20.729> or

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
but if you just put a number like one or

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.000 
but if you just put a number like one or
two<00:05:20.880> or<00:05:21.000> a<00:05:21.150> or<00:05:21.389> b<00:05:21.570> you<00:05:21.870> know<00:05:22.410> it<00:05:22.590> does<00:05:22.710> the<00:05:22.830> same

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
two or a or b you know it does the same

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.400 
two or a or b you know it does the same
kind<00:05:23.250> of<00:05:23.310> thing<00:05:23.729> and<00:05:23.910> the<00:05:24.210> reason<00:05:24.330> for<00:05:24.720> that<00:05:25.110> is

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
kind of thing and the reason for that is

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.690 
kind of thing and the reason for that is
you<00:05:25.770> know<00:05:25.860> I<00:05:25.890> just<00:05:26.070> write<00:05:26.220> B<00:05:26.400> you<00:05:26.490> don't<00:05:26.610> need

again<00:06:25.620> they<00:06:25.770> raise<00:06:26.039> the<00:06:26.190> a<00:06:26.220> and<00:06:26.490> B<00:06:26.639> here<00:06:26.850> so

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
again they raise the a and B here so

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.060 
again they raise the a and B here so
it's<00:06:27.180> very<00:06:27.270> very<00:06:27.660> clear<00:06:27.930> one<00:06:28.139> and<00:06:28.260> two<00:06:28.410> okay

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
it's very very clear one and two okay

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.430 
it's very very clear one and two okay
so<00:06:29.340> again<00:06:30.300> here's<00:06:30.539> the<00:06:30.690> final<00:06:30.840> image<00:06:31.229> let's

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
so again here's the final image let's

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.219 
so again here's the final image let's
take<00:06:31.560> a<00:06:31.590> quick<00:06:31.950> look<00:06:32.130> at<00:06:32.340> both<00:06:32.940> and<00:06:33.390> also<00:06:33.840> just

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
take a quick look at both and also just

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:34.879 
take a quick look at both and also just
do

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:34.889 
do

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:37.640 
do
quick<00:06:35.009> process<00:06:35.460> behind<00:06:35.610> each<00:06:35.939> one<00:06:36.650> line

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
quick process behind each one line

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.839 
quick process behind each one line
drawing<00:06:37.949> once<00:06:38.159> again<00:06:38.370> I'll<00:06:38.490> leave<00:06:38.669> those

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:38.849 
drawing once again I'll leave those

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:40.520 
drawing once again I'll leave those
turned<00:06:39.090> on<00:06:39.240> so<00:06:39.419> you<00:06:39.479> can<00:06:39.599> kind<00:06:39.780> of<00:06:39.870> see<00:06:40.020> again

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:40.530 
turned on so you can kind of see again

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.899 
turned on so you can kind of see again
this<00:06:40.620> is<00:06:40.740> done<00:06:40.949> by<00:06:41.039> my<00:06:41.159> student<00:06:41.550> this<00:06:41.669> is<00:06:41.759> not

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:41.909 
this is done by my student this is not

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:43.760 
this is done by my student this is not
my<00:06:42.060> original<00:06:42.719> line<00:06:42.870> drawing<00:06:43.229> this<00:06:43.439> is<00:06:43.590> drawn

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
my original line drawing this is drawn

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.610 
my original line drawing this is drawn
by<00:06:43.889> somebody<00:06:44.189> else<00:06:44.719> very<00:06:45.719> well<00:06:45.930> drawn<00:06:46.199> piece

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
by somebody else very well drawn piece

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.239 
by somebody else very well drawn piece
as<00:06:46.860> well

00:06:47.239 --> 00:06:47.249 
as well

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:49.629 
as well
whoops<00:06:47.550> I<00:06:47.699> just<00:06:47.909> saved<00:06:48.150> this<00:06:48.270> one<00:06:48.419> by<00:06:48.569> accident

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639 
whoops I just saved this one by accident

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.249 
whoops I just saved this one by accident
didn't<00:06:50.639> turn<00:06:51.419> the<00:06:51.509> line<00:06:51.659> drawing<00:06:51.870> on<00:06:52.020> again

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:52.259 
didn't turn the line drawing on again

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:54.369 
didn't turn the line drawing on again
which<00:06:52.409> same<00:06:52.830> line<00:06:53.009> drawing<00:06:53.249> doesn't<00:06:53.460> matter

00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:54.379 
which same line drawing doesn't matter

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:56.869 
which same line drawing doesn't matter
so<00:06:55.379> again<00:06:55.680> this<00:06:55.830> is<00:06:55.979> a<00:06:56.009> quick<00:06:56.370> way<00:06:56.550> to<00:06:56.580> learn

00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:56.879 
so again this is a quick way to learn

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:59.779 
so again this is a quick way to learn
how<00:06:57.029> to<00:06:57.060> paint<00:06:57.360> by<00:06:57.840> working<00:06:58.229> quickly<00:06:58.789> right

00:06:59.779 --> 00:06:59.789 
how to paint by working quickly right

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:02.269 
how to paint by working quickly right
with<00:07:00.090> a<00:07:00.120> some<00:07:00.569> kind<00:07:00.719> of<00:07:00.840> common<00:07:01.199> goal<00:07:01.469> so<00:07:02.159> you

00:07:02.269 --> 00:07:02.279 
with a some kind of common goal so you

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:04.040 
with a some kind of common goal so you
got<00:07:02.400> to<00:07:02.550> do<00:07:02.669> a<00:07:02.699> few<00:07:02.999> a<00:07:03.060> few<00:07:03.389> of<00:07:03.479> these<00:07:03.599> to<00:07:03.930> me

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050 
got to do a few a few of these to me

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.219 
got to do a few a few of these to me
let's<00:07:04.919> just<00:07:05.069> leave<00:07:05.189> this<00:07:05.370> one<00:07:05.550> on<00:07:05.699> here<00:07:06.169> so<00:07:07.169> you

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:07.229 
let's just leave this one on here so you

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:08.510 
let's just leave this one on here so you
could<00:07:07.379> take<00:07:07.469> a<00:07:07.529> line<00:07:07.830> drawing<00:07:08.069> that<00:07:08.189> you<00:07:08.310> like

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 
could take a line drawing that you like

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.909 
could take a line drawing that you like
and<00:07:08.819> do<00:07:09.300> in<00:07:09.509> or<00:07:09.599> three<00:07:09.870> four<00:07:10.139> different<00:07:10.289> passes

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:10.919 
and do in or three four different passes

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:12.800 
and do in or three four different passes
and<00:07:11.099> each<00:07:11.639> time<00:07:11.879> you<00:07:11.909> do<00:07:12.150> it<00:07:12.180> try<00:07:12.330> to<00:07:12.509> change

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:12.810 
and each time you do it try to change

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:13.939 
and each time you do it try to change
the<00:07:12.930> story<00:07:13.199> trying<00:07:13.409> to<00:07:13.529> change<00:07:13.680> the<00:07:13.800> scenario

00:07:13.939 --> 00:07:13.949 
the story trying to change the scenario

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:16.189 
the story trying to change the scenario
or<00:07:14.279> to<00:07:14.669> a<00:07:14.699> set<00:07:15.090> to<00:07:15.389> challenge<00:07:15.719> yourself<00:07:16.050> for

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.199 
or to a set to challenge yourself for

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:18.529 
or to a set to challenge yourself for
example<00:07:16.259> to<00:07:16.680> a<00:07:16.710> snow<00:07:16.979> scene<00:07:17.250> but<00:07:17.729> all<00:07:17.969> three<00:07:18.419> or

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:18.539 
example to a snow scene but all three or

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:20.600 
example to a snow scene but all three or
four<00:07:18.810> of<00:07:18.900> these<00:07:18.990> images<00:07:19.289> have<00:07:19.919> different<00:07:20.340> type

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:20.610 
four of these images have different type

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.640 
four of these images have different type
of<00:07:20.819> approach<00:07:21.389> to<00:07:21.419> snow<00:07:21.900> so<00:07:22.139> these<00:07:22.349> are<00:07:22.469> all

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:22.650 
of approach to snow so these are all

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.140 
of approach to snow so these are all
good<00:07:22.919> ways<00:07:22.949> that<00:07:23.430> you<00:07:23.699> know<00:07:23.789> that's<00:07:23.939> what<00:07:24.060> we

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:24.150 
good ways that you know that's what we

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:25.879 
good ways that you know that's what we
do<00:07:24.300> to<00:07:24.449> our<00:07:24.539> where<00:07:25.229> we<00:07:25.259> teach<00:07:25.469> our<00:07:25.590> students

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:25.889 
do to our where we teach our students

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:27.890 
do to our where we teach our students
just<00:07:26.099> as<00:07:26.219> well<00:07:26.400> so<00:07:26.969> because<00:07:27.240> in<00:07:27.449> production

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:27.900 
just as well so because in production

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.749 
just as well so because in production
you're<00:07:28.169> never<00:07:28.589> really<00:07:28.860> working<00:07:29.339> with<00:07:29.460> one<00:07:29.729> of

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 
you're never really working with one of

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:30.379 
you're never really working with one of
anything

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:30.389 
anything

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:33.230 
anything
your<00:07:30.599> job<00:07:31.439> is<00:07:31.589> a<00:07:31.620> designer<00:07:32.069> so<00:07:32.699> as<00:07:32.819> a<00:07:32.849> designer

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.240 
your job is a designer so as a designer

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.969 
your job is a designer so as a designer
you've<00:07:33.449> got<00:07:33.539> to<00:07:33.629> be<00:07:34.110> able<00:07:34.349> to<00:07:34.529> provide

00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:34.979 
you've got to be able to provide

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:36.469 
you've got to be able to provide
solutions<00:07:35.279> and<00:07:35.819> multiple<00:07:36.300> different

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 
solutions and multiple different

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:38.659 
solutions and multiple different
solutions<00:07:36.990> not<00:07:37.080> just<00:07:37.289> one<00:07:37.499> so<00:07:38.099> this<00:07:38.490> is<00:07:38.550> a

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:38.669 
solutions not just one so this is a

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:41.959 
solutions not just one so this is a
great<00:07:38.939> way<00:07:39.180> to<00:07:39.210> kind<00:07:39.870> of<00:07:40.339> teach<00:07:41.339> yourself<00:07:41.699> or

00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:41.969 
great way to kind of teach yourself or

00:07:41.969 --> 00:07:44.450 
great way to kind of teach yourself or
learn<00:07:42.210> how<00:07:42.240> to<00:07:42.659> work<00:07:43.589> in<00:07:43.800> a<00:07:43.889> production

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:44.460 
learn how to work in a production

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.089 
learn how to work in a production
pipeline<00:07:44.669> ok<00:07:45.330> so<00:07:45.779> again<00:07:46.620> this<00:07:46.889> week's
