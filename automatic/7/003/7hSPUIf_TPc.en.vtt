00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.259
 somehow I 'm a bit confused 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.480
 Well, in any case, there was the mail 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.980

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.410
 Let's have a look 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.250
 you can see here is of course now 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.560
 not much 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.230
 the winter was so clear away this was one 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.730

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:33.750

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.700

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.850
 very tasty 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.449
 then you should praline here 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.629

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.070
 two glasses okay because macadamia cream 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.979
 is not for me i'm not that 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.009
 macadamia fan but grandma and therefore there is 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.100
 that then for that is practically it 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.740
 So far, I have a very sweet box 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.350

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.560

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.420
 the macadamia attacked here but is only 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.570
 try what and then just what 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.680
 otherwise it is easy with granny 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.939
 or so here just really seems cute 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.750
 hardly to be in there because there is also here 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.570
 still truffles 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.700
 So that's really tasty 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.079

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.840

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:21.890

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.810

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:56.750

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.610
 yes I have a colorful mixed box and 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.480
 definitely worth more than five euros 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:36.410
 So I found the box cool 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:40.519
 I think it's awesome I find you calories 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:43.430
 technically not good but definitely so 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:46.970
 Yummy and Christmas time is yes 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.310
 also time to balk and I think so 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.450
 It fits very well, I think, really 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.450

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.070
 to cheat there will be mine 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:04.160

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:06.739
 I find a candy box from dm 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.140
 well and i would like to know how 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.180

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.290
 candy boxes are this time 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.120

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.060
