00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:14.380
 hello what scoreboards and we start very very 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.390
 well before you start with all the 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.880
 data the five data that we are going to give 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.970
 I want to say that it took me almost two months 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.610
 in pulling out this episode and the reasons are 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.300
 are two reasons one gave me a lot 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:31.210
 lazy but a lot but a lot of laziness 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.340
 and good are three reasons two almost 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.980
 they always comment on the same and the same 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.540
 and the same curious data and good for 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.460
 that reason I had to do the special of 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.710
 100 curious facts but still they followed 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.149
 putting the same curious data like this 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.430
 that it was very difficult to find new 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.870
 curious data and good to have I could 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.010
 find five so let's go with the 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.710
 number 21 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.370
 remember that if you have a curious fact 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.600
 comment it so you can continue 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.949
 making more videos so we're going to 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.690
 start with the first do not you think or 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.820
 we go very well we can start with the 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.770
 first data of the community and when I 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.260
 send the user 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.110
 bryan garcía if I'm not wrong and 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.490
 he says he listens differently 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.290
 sounds of the blocks of notes when 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.490
 they are surrounded by sun sanz so 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.490
 well let's try 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.520
 hear that the sound is heard like this 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.110
 as dry as hard and instead 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.530
 with one is surrounded by holy sun it 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.530
 listen like that 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.860
 we can very well start with the 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.530
 second data of the community when what 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.810
 send to the works which tells us that 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.040
 if we put a good one when we are 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.440
 doing with a blake the way more 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.240
 Effective to beat it is with snowballs 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:41.920
 and that's the right thing to do, because if we give it 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:51.360
 hits 1 20 20 to treat it with goal 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:53.950
 we painted 20 and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.690
 and very well let's start with the third 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.470
 community data which does not send 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:03.369
 fernando with serum today they fled will not be 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.229
 granted and I know all but 90% of 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.940
 you know him but good that everything 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.310
 the world knows him does not take away the fact of 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.650
 it is a curious fact and the fact 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.540
 create infinite water as in this case 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.580
 you can see a great example on the right 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.870
 I take off and go back to doing quito and 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.970
 returns to do quito and it is done again 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.850
 to do this we are this good the 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.830
 easiest way is to put to make a 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:29.550
 picture so easy and good we can 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.350
 2 and is with two buckets of water you 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.810
 can still do infinite and use it or the 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.660
 Sometimes you want very well we go with the 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.400
 fourth data this is thanks to a friend 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.550
 it's called skyline he realized 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.170
 this is what tells us is that you can 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.880
 destroy what is good we are to that 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.160
 a distance of three blocks 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.140
 we can choose this block with we are 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.780
 in creative but when we are in 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.890
 survival we are going to put the 10 which 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.510
 we are in your neighborhood you can see that 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.040
 we do not reach and although we put chip not 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.900
 let's achieve that means that 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.090
 when we are in creative mode we can 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.560
 reach things that are further away very 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.600
 Well, we're going to have to be a number 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.000
 21 of 5 curious facts with this data that 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.590
 it's really something amazing even 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.330
 for me and good for this right now is a 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.160
 snow golem already know two blocks of 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.720
 snow and up the pumpkin and that what 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.130
 it's good, so you have to have it 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.630
 locked up and you have to approach in such a 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.910
 way you can see through it and 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.220
 there is a face there is a secret face 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.870
 inside the golem as you can see or 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.430
 look at the face or nothing to see then 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.430
 that's another secret face 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.230
 imagine what you can see inside of 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.600
 a clip in images of what you can see 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.030
 inside of thousands of secrets that can 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.830
 have inside a dragon inside a 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.860
 pig but in this case here is a 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.500
 smile like a smile of returned or 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.180
 something so good those are the five data 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.040
