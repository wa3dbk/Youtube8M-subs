00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
valves family finally through a timing

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.880 
valves family finally through a timing
light<00:01:41.420> on<00:01:41.719> the<00:01:41.810> points<00:01:42.229> i'm<00:01:42.469> going<00:01:42.710> to<00:01:42.770> leave

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
light on the points i'm going to leave

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.219 
light on the points i'm going to leave
the<00:01:43.009> points<00:01:43.310> in<00:01:43.460> there<00:01:43.609> for<00:01:43.789> now<00:01:43.820> i<00:01:44.179> have<00:01:45.109> an

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
the points in there for now i have an

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.279 
the points in there for now i have an
electronic<00:01:45.590> ignition<00:01:46.189> but<00:01:47.020> it's<00:01:48.020> running

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
electronic ignition but it's running

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.270 
electronic ignition but it's running
great<00:01:48.439> so<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:50.210> points<00:01:50.539> are<00:01:50.740> kind<00:01:51.740> of<00:01:51.829> original

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280
