00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 good afternoon dear friends with you again 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.720
 code sergeevich best teacher 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.360
 Russia and we continue to disassemble 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.530
 water themes social games 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.639
 today we will talk about 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.219
 the final ones 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.800
 21st century threat or global problem 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.350
 humanity and the beginning is worth remembering 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.660
 term scientific revolution or 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.890
 ntr abbreviated that this is a cat 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.359
 qualitative leap in development 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.099
 productive forces 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.070
 based on computerization and 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.380
 informatization of modern society but 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.989
 the technical revolution begins at 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.660
 mid twentieth century and here you can 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.670
 recall such events that 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.329
 globally changed the human 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.390
 the world is like a manned space flight 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:50.460
 the emergence of a computer network development 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.190
 Internet and many other times like any 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.270
 like a socio-economic phenomenon 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.760
 scientific and technological revolution is reflected 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.399
 simultaneously on all walks of life 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.230
 I remember societies with the help of what with 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.539
 using public relations this 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.369
 the term we already know now 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.350
 let's see how life has changed 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.930
 human society connection with 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.610
 scientific and technological revolution 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.060
 how is this a complex phenomenon it caused 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.850
 are both positive 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.549
 line and at the same time but determined 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.520
 any problems that arise 6 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.289
 the development of technology above all and so 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.689
 changed the scientific and technological revolution she 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.390
 changed the improvement of production 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.130
 she automated again stormy 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.560
 technology development happens 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.380
 a single economic market is emerging 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.899
 common economic space and both 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.670
 world culture is drawn as 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.979
 automation affects development 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.990
 society's positive points here 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.770
 Naturally this is an extension of the commodity 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.649
 production 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.759
 it is a relief to the labor of man he 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.170
 turns from physical own 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.479
 problems that arise while doing so 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.830
 going on deepening the world 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.649
 economic crises 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.830
 become more and more goods and arises 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.539
 overproduction crisis increases 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.130
 unemployment as a technique can 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.860
 displace human labor 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.620
 the rapid development of technology it leads to 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.799
 the fact that technology is improving around us 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.810
 improves easier to be human 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.190
 there is a huge amount of new products and 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.600
 devices that allow a person 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.690
 live more comfortable 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.730
 cozier same time problem occurs 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.130
 tougher requirements for the specialist 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.820
 the specialist must be more 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.500
 highly qualified higher 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.350
 formed to be able to 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.489
 handle sophisticated technology 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.010
 The responsibility of scientists for 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.830
 products open them 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.769
 After all, scientists and should understand that he 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.470
 need to answer for what he produced 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:47.200
 any misuse of equipment 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.239
 and the latest equipment can lead to 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.840
 catastrophic consequences remember 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.569
 at least 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.920
 nuclear power plant accident 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.980
 Chernobyl at that time she was the most 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.450
 walls almond globalization world 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.970
 economic processes leads 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.790
 First, the formation of a common market to 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.950
 the fact that more accelerated transmitted 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.629
 technologies accordingly more accelerated 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.819
 developing economies and accelerating 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.920
 economic cooperation is erased 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.989
 economic boundaries of humanity 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.609
 gets more and more goods 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.750
 however there are negative points 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:25.060
 tougher competition on world 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.980
 markets the consequence of this is not developed and 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.290
 developing countries find themselves in 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.290
 unfavorable conditions they suffer defeat 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.239
 in the fight for these markets and intensifies in 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.299
 the result is a gap between the richest 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:40.169
 countries and the poorest fear what 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.459
 this will lead we will find out a little later and 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:44.859
 globalization of culture is accelerating 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.840
 Internet communication processes 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.250
 allowed to connect the world space in 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.680
 one you can contact any 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.810
 man anywhere in the world is not 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.790
 making special effort to that 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.950
 before again it was impossible the same 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.290
 time is increasing cultural integration 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.410
 happens with the process of bringing people closer 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.240
 among themselves the example of the European Union in 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.250
 integration wears and for years 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.450
 and political cultural and social 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.340
 character 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:14.410
 here is the most bright and the lens 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.300
 who is this integration at all is a process 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.970
 approximation of mutual enrichment of cultures 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.720
 different nations with the help of mutual 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.140
 influences 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.810
 them at each other at the same time arise 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.300
 such problems as the threat of loss by small 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.860
 peoples of their identity 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.710
 language and cultural autonomy 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.680
 comes aggressive anglo-american 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.970
 culture this process is called 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.590
 Westernization in what it is expressed 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.870
 it is expressed in the formation of sustainable 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:46.180
 Western stereotyping patterns 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:49.140
 life type thinking ideology i language 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.140
