00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
here's a clip of me using this low level

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.790 
here's a clip of me using this low level
class<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.240> high<00:00:30.480> level<00:00:30.869> game<00:00:31.050> cuz<00:00:31.410> I'm<00:00:31.529> level

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
class in a high level game cuz I'm level

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.160 
class in a high level game cuz I'm level
40<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:33.059> play<00:00:33.239> with<00:00:33.329> our<00:00:33.450> levels<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.960> I

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
40 and I play with our levels and I

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.470 
40 and I play with our levels and I
tried<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.680> out<00:00:34.770> on<00:00:34.980> these<00:00:35.430> higher<00:00:35.880> levels<00:00:36.329> and

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
tried it out on these higher levels and

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.660 
tried it out on these higher levels and
it's<00:00:36.930> pretty<00:00:37.230> damn<00:00:37.530> effective<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.340> check<00:00:38.640> it

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
it's pretty damn effective so check it

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.389 
it's pretty damn effective so check it
out<00:00:39.170> alright<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.440> here<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.710> get<00:00:40.950> stunned<00:00:41.250> by

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
out alright so here I get stunned by

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.360 
out alright so here I get stunned by
some<00:00:41.730> B's<00:00:42.000> can't<00:00:42.719> see<00:00:43.020> him<00:00:43.170> but<00:00:43.500> make<00:00:44.160> sure<00:00:44.190> to

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
some B's can't see him but make sure to

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.520 
some B's can't see him but make sure to
hit<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.760> person<00:00:45.420> with<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.600> electoral<00:00:46.260> bolt

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
hit the person with the electoral bolt

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.950 
hit the person with the electoral bolt
and<00:00:46.890> then<00:00:47.190> use<00:00:47.879> your<00:00:47.910> pistol<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.539> finish<00:00:48.809> them

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
and then use your pistol to finish them

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.240 
and then use your pistol to finish them
off<00:00:49.079> easy<00:00:49.770> combo<00:00:50.399> make<00:00:51.390> sure<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.750> research

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
off easy combo make sure to research

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.010 
off easy combo make sure to research
which<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.399> why<00:00:53.579> expert<00:00:54.329> researcher<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.870> your

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
which is why expert researcher is your

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.350 
which is why expert researcher is your
tonic<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.500> speeds<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.860> up<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.129> lot<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.670> then

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
tonic it speeds it up a lot and then

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.760 
tonic it speeds it up a lot and then
when<00:00:57.480> you're<00:00:57.600> faced<00:00:57.809> with<00:00:57.840> multiple<00:00:58.469> enemies

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
when you're faced with multiple enemies

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.799 
when you're faced with multiple enemies
it's<00:00:58.980> probably<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.760> best<00:01:00.000> idea<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.510> use<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
it's probably the best idea to use the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.510 
it's probably the best idea to use the
nail<00:01:00.989> gun<00:01:01.020> because<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.500> shits<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:02.039> multiple

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
nail gun because it shits on multiple

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.630 
nail gun because it shits on multiple
people<00:01:02.699> look<00:01:03.570> at<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.870> screen<00:01:04.199> double

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
people look at that on screen double

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.859 
people look at that on screen double
alright<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:05.850> here<00:01:06.060> I'm<00:01:06.210> getting<00:01:06.420> shocked<00:01:06.689> by

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
alright so here I'm getting shocked by

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.740 
alright so here I'm getting shocked by
do<00:01:07.200> shining<00:01:07.650> on<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.860> second<00:01:08.220> story<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.790> I

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
do shining on the second story and I

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.380 
do shining on the second story and I
research<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.290> guy<00:01:10.470> for<00:01:10.740> some<00:01:10.830> good<00:01:11.010> measures

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
research this guy for some good measures

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.660 
research this guy for some good measures
so<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.659> guy<00:01:12.780> jumps<00:01:13.200> down<00:01:13.380> lecturer<00:01:14.250> bolted

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
so this guy jumps down lecturer bolted

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.450 
so this guy jumps down lecturer bolted
and<00:01:15.080> that's<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.259> end<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.470> guy<00:01:16.710> let<00:01:17.400> me

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
and that's the end of that guy let me

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.780 
and that's the end of that guy let me
speed<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.850> up<00:01:18.030> again<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.369> here's<00:01:20.369> somebody

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
speed this up again and here's somebody

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.149 
speed this up again and here's somebody
maybe<00:01:21.600> just<00:01:22.110> spawned<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.680> don't<00:01:22.860> know<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.130> just

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
maybe just spawned I don't know it just

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.670 
maybe just spawned I don't know it just
wasn't<00:01:23.580> moving<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.170> that's<00:01:25.170> just<00:01:25.350> an<00:01:25.530> easy

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
wasn't moving and that's just an easy

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.940 
wasn't moving and that's just an easy
kill<00:01:25.970> this<00:01:26.970> class<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.720> really<00:01:28.020> effective<00:01:28.770> at

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
kill this class is really effective at

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.940 
kill this class is really effective at

then<00:02:04.320> you're<00:02:05.250> going<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.430> want<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.729> use<00:02:05.939> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
then you're going to want to use the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.139 
then you're going to want to use the
electro<00:02:06.930> bolt<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.350> stun<00:02:07.710> anybody<00:02:08.220> then<00:02:08.879> your

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
electro bolt to stun anybody then your

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.510 
electro bolt to stun anybody then your
elephant<00:02:09.599> going<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.929> go<00:02:10.050> for<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.289> head<00:02:10.530> shot<00:02:10.560> and

elephant going to go for a head shot and
that's<00:02:12.060> just<00:02:12.300> about<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:13.080> then

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
that's just about it and then

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.220 
that's just about it and then
research<00:02:14.010> them<00:02:14.340> for<00:02:15.030> more<00:02:15.270> points<00:02:15.750> this<00:02:15.990> is

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
research them for more points this is

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.190 
research them for more points this is
very<00:02:16.530> very<00:02:16.650> lucrative<00:02:17.570> also<00:02:18.570> keeps<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.930> kills

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
very very lucrative also keeps the kills

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.740 
very very lucrative also keeps the kills
high<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.740> deaths<00:02:20.010> low<00:02:20.520> there's<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.510> clip<00:02:21.720> of

high in the deaths low there's a clip of

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.150 
high in the deaths low there's a clip of
me<00:02:21.870> hacking<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.500> vending<00:02:22.740> machine<00:02:22.980> because

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
me hacking the vending machine because

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.010 
me hacking the vending machine because
that's<00:02:23.310> exhilarating<00:02:23.780> here's<00:02:24.780> someone

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
that's exhilarating here's someone

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.600 
that's exhilarating here's someone
across<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.530> bridge<00:02:25.770> I<00:02:25.950> pick<00:02:26.160> them<00:02:26.280> off<00:02:26.430> from

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
across the bridge I pick them off from

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.530 
across the bridge I pick them off from
long<00:02:26.910> range<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.890> then<00:02:28.890> just<00:02:29.760> use<00:02:30.360> this

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
long range and then just use this

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.000 
long range and then just use this
concept<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.230> you're<00:02:31.320> good<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.500> go<00:02:31.620> for<00:02:31.740> the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
concept and you're good to go for the

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.820 
concept and you're good to go for the
most<00:02:32.220> part<00:02:32.460> I<00:02:32.760> go<00:02:33.750> on<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:33.960> nine<00:02:34.170> kill<00:02:34.500> streak

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
most part I go on a nine kill streak

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.440 
most part I go on a nine kill streak
here<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.430> shows<00:02:35.700> how<00:02:35.880> effective<00:02:36.330> this

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
here it shows how effective this

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.630 
here it shows how effective this
strategy<00:02:37.020> is<00:02:37.050> because<00:02:37.740> these<00:02:38.130> are<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.370> high

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
strategy is because these are the high

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.080 
strategy is because these are the high
level<00:02:38.940> people<00:02:39.330> 40s<00:02:40.020> and<00:02:40.140> what<00:02:40.290> not<00:02:40.470> um<00:02:41.090> the

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
level people 40s and what not um the

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.060 
level people 40s and what not um the
shotguns<00:02:42.660> there<00:02:42.960> in<00:02:43.110> case<00:02:43.320> you<00:02:43.590> miss<00:02:43.830> your

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
shotguns there in case you miss your

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.770 
shotguns there in case you miss your
headshot<00:02:44.610> it's<00:02:44.820> there<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.060> clean<00:02:45.270> up<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.540> kill

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
headshot it's there to clean up the kill

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.740 
headshot it's there to clean up the kill
um<00:02:46.520> this<00:02:47.520> is<00:02:47.730> also<00:02:48.030> probably<00:02:48.390> really<00:02:48.720> good

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
um this is also probably really good

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.750 
um this is also probably really good
against<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.530> douchebags<00:02:50.070> that<00:02:50.250> like<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:50.640> use

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
against the douchebags that like to use

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.840 
against the douchebags that like to use
grenade<00:02:51.090> launchers<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:52.040> then<00:02:53.040> another<00:02:53.550> thing

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
grenade launchers and then another thing

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.520 
grenade launchers and then another thing
you<00:02:53.940> might<00:02:54.060> want<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.360> do<00:02:54.510> is<00:02:54.780> if<00:02:55.140> you're<00:02:55.290> facing

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
you might want to do is if you're facing

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.200 
you might want to do is if you're facing
douchebags<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.610> like<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.850> use<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.090> grenade

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
douchebags I like to use the grenade

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.440 
douchebags I like to use the grenade
launchers<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:57.840> may<00:02:58.020> be<00:02:58.080> home<00:02:58.380> in<00:02:58.620> grenades<00:02:59.040> Oh

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
launchers and may be home in grenades Oh

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.850 
launchers and may be home in grenades Oh
might<00:03:00.450> want<00:03:00.600> to<00:03:00.660> put<00:03:00.780> telekinesis<00:03:01.530> on<00:03:01.680> there

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
might want to put telekinesis on there

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.250 
might want to put telekinesis on there
and<00:03:01.980> catch<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.370> grenades<00:03:02.730> if<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.060> can<00:03:03.300> throw

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
and catch the grenades if you can throw

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.570 
and catch the grenades if you can throw
them<00:03:04.380> back<00:03:04.560> at<00:03:04.800> them<00:03:04.950> as<00:03:05.040> your<00:03:05.160> secondary

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
them back at them as your secondary

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.280 
them back at them as your secondary
plasmid<00:03:06.150> but<00:03:06.300> you<00:03:06.390> probably<00:03:06.630> won't<00:03:06.870> need<00:03:07.140> to

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
plasmid but you probably won't need to

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.380 
plasmid but you probably won't need to
this<00:03:07.950> will<00:03:08.160> probably<00:03:08.310> just<00:03:08.760> take<00:03:09.000> care<00:03:09.270> of

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
this will probably just take care of

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.950 
this will probably just take care of
business<00:03:10.760> so<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.910> killstreak<00:03:12.420> just<00:03:12.600> goes<00:03:12.750> on

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
business so the killstreak just goes on

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:32.410 
business so the killstreak just goes on
here<00:03:13.200> I'm<00:03:13.290> just<00:03:13.320> gonna<00:03:13.530> let<00:03:13.710> it<00:03:13.830> play
