00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:15.110
 Hi, we're going to have a little one today. 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.270
 Different, I'll teach you to start 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.050
 to teach you to try 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:25.160
 tel I did this landscape for you 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.800
 see it has size 50 by 70 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:33.430
 I looked for a simple drawing that 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:38.539
 I have many colors to start from. 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:41.600
 more similar to live than 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:47.359
 You guys can do it, I like it. 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:51.769
 always use landscapes the beginning because 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:58.909
 I find it easier to run the 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:01:02.149
 brush have more possibilities in the background 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:04.250
 The bigger we get to work the better 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:08.000
 when we do other types of 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:13.600
 fruit flowers wines we have to have 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:18.050
 installed more accurate then I think the 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:22.880
 landscape the best thing to start 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:28.130
 to paint this is a picture with a landscape 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:32.930
 which has few details the painting in 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:36.280
 canvas as any painting has countless 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:44.240
 paintings that we do many 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:51.440
 possibilities of light as the sun sets 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:55.070
 have are the colors change the flowers change 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:59.360
 changes the style of trees according to 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:03.410
 where we live the style of 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.440
 pine trees of cypress 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.810
 everything changes so it's a thing so the 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.170
 people always have things to learn 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.900
 There is something new 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.730
 the nature is perfect 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.290
 God made a 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:24.409
 way no one has a question 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:28.370
 We'll start with the painting 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:29.269
 in acrylic paint I really like 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.580
 to work 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.920
 there are people who do not like it for sure 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.459
 very fast but we will use the 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:45.530
 average a crisis any help enough 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:52.160
 and there is composition in ink I use this 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:59.209
 black acrylic paint 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:03.260
 she has the other sticky makeup 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:07.599
 brands I already used we're painting arrives 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:11.750
 at a point in the painting that she is 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:14.030
 sticky can no longer work in 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.519
 end up taking the ink off 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:21.730
 we go there then the cat inks 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.730
 black to those she does not go many colors 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:30.739
 Let's go to the 384 reference brushes that 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:37.639
 it's boring 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:43.299
 Let's go to that 386 cat tongue and also 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:47.840
 Let's reference 385 that he is 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:51.260
 round these bristle brushes 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.620
 Soft to work but they are 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:58.400
 very firm films that I use for the 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.109
 and I think it's great for 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.930
 work with acrylic 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:05.930
 I really like to use these too. 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:17.120
 tanquinhos the two because they have 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:20.690
 here is the risk that we clean 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.570
 the brush in that way so he takes 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.630
 all over it looks like a 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.600
 even the little one takes all the excess from the 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.500
 ink helps a lot to clean the bristle 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.960
 brush 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.570
 on this other side that people deposit 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.890
 put water and let the brush in the waiting myth 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.890
 I do not want too much time 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:47.660
 What we use to clean the brush is 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:49.940
 water in a way that then can give 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.490
 a little bit of softener a detergent 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:59.300
 liquid to remove excess paint 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:05:05.200
 will get the brush well on the screen 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:13.690
 I'm going to 50 60 I'm going to use this screen 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:13.690
 size 40 by 50 a screen and wood 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:22.790
 I'll do the freehand drawing. 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:26.570
 let's also get an easel an easel 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:31.330
 you can have several different brands 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:38.210
 styles various prices each one uses 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:41.780
 as we screen supports and works 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:44.990
 with her I'm going to draw mine by hand 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:49.750
 I'm going to leave this week's drawing free 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:52.850
 40 for 50 advice per drawing on the blog and 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:56.690
 higher then you can always enlarge 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:58.610
 remembering the drawing is essential in 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.980
 Any job we're going to do 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:04.730
 So, how can I not teach the class? 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:07.790
 design perspective all for you I will 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:10.580
 posting the drawings on the blog 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.200
 if the drawing has done wrong to the future 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:16.960
 does not look cool 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.960
 then it is very important the drawing 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:26.680
 and I'll use an ordinary pencil do not like 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:31.180
 much of the 6b side in this case because he 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:33.460
 can spot with mubarak that is easy it 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:41.400
 can stain my work I go 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:41.400
 to draw common 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:07:19.270
 he's draw can use more neighbor 

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.310
 a more velvety touch is one thing 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:25.350
 interesting to do but if you do not 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:33.750
 want do not need drawing 

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:33.750
 another sketch even paying
