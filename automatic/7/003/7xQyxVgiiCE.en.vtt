00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.149 
changes but that's my ki advice to that
one<00:01:44.430> but<00:01:44.610> anyways<00:01:45.140> um<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.649> know<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
one but anyways um you know so the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.789 
one but anyways um you know so the
