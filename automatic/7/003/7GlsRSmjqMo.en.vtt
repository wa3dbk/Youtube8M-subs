00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
it kind of just slides into place where

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.690 
it kind of just slides into place where
you<00:01:06.780> would<00:01:06.960> just<00:01:07.380> line<00:01:07.680> up<00:01:07.710> for<00:01:08.400> your<00:01:08.549> regular

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
you would just line up for your regular

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.899 
you would just line up for your regular
size<00:01:09.119> SIM<00:01:09.360> card<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.080> that's<00:01:10.860> your<00:01:11.159> micro<00:01:11.729> SIM

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
size SIM card so that's your micro SIM

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.510 
size SIM card so that's your micro SIM
itthere<00:01:12.330> regular<00:01:13.140> sized<00:01:13.380> SIM<00:01:13.619> card<00:01:13.860> slot<00:01:14.250> and

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
itthere regular sized SIM card slot and

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.480 
itthere regular sized SIM card slot and
so<00:01:15.299> all<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.659> do<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:15.869> just<00:01:16.259> sort<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.590> slip<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.340> in

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
so all you do is just sort of slip it in

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.240 
so all you do is just sort of slip it in
just<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.830> you<00:01:19.830> just<00:01:19.860> sort<00:01:20.189> of

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
just like that and you just sort of

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.300 
just like that and you just sort of
a-line<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.270> where<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.840> would<00:01:21.930> go<00:01:22.310> there's

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
a-line it to where it would go there's

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.340 
a-line it to where it would go there's
sometimes<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.880> may<00:01:24.119> have<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.420> put<00:01:24.600> take<00:01:25.170> about

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
sometimes you may have to put take about

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.230 
sometimes you may have to put take about
your<00:01:25.500> back<00:01:25.619> out<00:01:25.740> realign<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.700> up<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.000> have<00:01:27.119> to

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
your back out realign it up you have to

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.819 
your back out realign it up you have to
make<00:01:27.360> sure<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.659> perfectly<00:01:28.140> get<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.590> slot

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
make sure you perfectly get it in slot

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.249 
make sure you perfectly get it in slot
but<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.090> much<00:01:30.299> easier<00:01:30.329> solution<00:01:30.630> than

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
but this is a much easier solution than

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.950 
but this is a much easier solution than
having<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.740> keep<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.189> purchasing<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.060> new<00:01:33.390> SIM

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
having to keep on purchasing a new SIM

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.450 
having to keep on purchasing a new SIM
card<00:01:34.229> or<00:01:34.320> switching<00:01:34.710> your<00:01:34.770> SIM<00:01:34.979> card<00:01:35.009> or<00:01:35.310> your

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
card or switching your SIM card or your

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.249 
card or switching your SIM card or your
student<00:01:35.729> number<00:01:35.820> on<00:01:36.119> your<00:01:36.360> actual<00:01:36.600> account<00:01:37.020> so

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
student number on your actual account so

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.859 
student number on your actual account so
there<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.040> go<00:01:38.159> micro<00:01:38.700> SIM<00:01:38.909> card<00:01:39.180> inside<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.780> a

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
there you go micro SIM card inside of a

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.810 
there you go micro SIM card inside of a
regular<00:01:40.049> sized<00:01:40.500> SIM<00:01:40.710> card<00:01:40.890> slot<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.549> does

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
regular sized SIM card slot it does

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.810 
regular sized SIM card slot it does
works<00:01:42.060> with<00:01:42.570> some<00:01:42.810> other<00:01:43.049> phones<00:01:43.409> but<00:01:43.979> not<00:01:44.549> all

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
works with some other phones but not all

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.389 
works with some other phones but not all
devices<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.869> do<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.619> with<00:01:46.770> BlackBerry's<00:01:47.369> and

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
devices so I do it with BlackBerry's and

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.830 
devices so I do it with BlackBerry's and
iPhones<00:01:47.640> all<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.090> time<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.329> always<00:01:48.540> switch

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
iPhones all the time I always switch
