00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.970
 good these sounds still did not live good 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:06.529
 pretty interesting video how good I 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.029
 I think to put a little in situation not 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.900
 with the theme of crash bandicoot and others 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:15.619
 you know it 's very fashionable indeed 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:17.779
 is still every month the game of 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.759
 atlantic others to quarry on 1 on 2 on 3 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.419
 and the kraft in racing in the first 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:25.759
 four posts always the best sellers 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:29.119
 to the game the best-selling saga and the 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:31.130
 best-selling game in need of interest 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.260
 classics is basically always in the 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.510
 top of the best selling classics 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.730
 whereupon the saga obviously to the 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.649
 people are still interested and really 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.449
 it's a shame you already know that after 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.460
 come out a kind of photo that good that 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.230
 it was more fake than anything else but 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.969
 investigating investigating a news 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.600
 that at the time I did not see and that is 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.850
 quite interesting 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.949
 sincerely very interesting seems to be 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.989
 that if activision according to a law of 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.160
 activision does not do anything concrete antich 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.360
 hotel 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:05.150
 by 2021, he would lose the 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.370
 license completely worth here wants 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.410
 say this good this was a law that 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.870
 you have to basically say that if 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.690
 It happens some time and it is not used I do not know 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.520
 how old are they if they are 11 12 10 or 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.510
 how much but good the deadline 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.880
 would end in 2021 just in and good 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.840
 basically, that can not be done now 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.160
 can use the lose in what happens have 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.300
 that making a game for it does not 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.729
 simply with a simple drawing of 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.890
 Crash Bandicoot alexia would serve 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.930
 even a figurine or a shirt and 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.670
 would basically serve them what they have 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.229
 what to do is something they still have not 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.630
 done and since they see from here the 2021 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.610
 there are six years left if in six years 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.000
 they do absolutely nothing as I say 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.890
 even if it's a drawing a t-shirt or a 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.590
 figurine completely lose the 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.320
 license is investigating what would happen 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.040
 with this license and I found nothing not 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.350
 I know if I would go back 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.390
 by hand among its creators or not 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.930
 will lose it could no longer be used for anyone 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.180
 or if he would miss out on it if they had to 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.430
 they would have to bid someone again 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.220
 to get it I do not have the most 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.560
 remote idea but but as I say then there 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.720
 are the hopes that arrive 2021 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.540
 and pass something or something like that 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.480
 surely activision will do something or 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.040
 before that date so as not to lose 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.030
 license because it takes out a figurine a 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.140
 T-shirt or something would seem a little 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.060
 disappointing especially people 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.390
 also the pair had very disappointing 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.370
 so you guys do not know there you have there 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.400
 you have that the news has its time 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.709
 but as I say now ebro is the 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.940
 moment do not say it and nothing at all we guys 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.209
 we see in the next video until the 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.209
 next
