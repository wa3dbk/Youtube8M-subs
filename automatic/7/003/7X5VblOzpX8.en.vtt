00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.320
 and 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.720
 to fish english for it 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.830
 We will use a cane Englishwoman 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.920
 three sections 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.780
 We are going to use hooks of 10 or 12 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.670
 one 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.490
 millions 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.770
 for the English some ball for 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.060
 course our English ones that 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.120
 graduates report to us 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.329
 use joked a reel and a 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.030
 particularity 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.239
 and what we are going to use is a thread 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.850
 special that when you throw yourself in the water 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.950
 and the tense sinks and thus we avoid the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.579
 tail 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.790
 Well, let's start now 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.040
 cheat me 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.740
 one of the characteristics of the cane 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.100
 English is the number of rings that 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.100
 have 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.869
 let's go the three sections 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.299
 then we see that it is perfectly 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.299
 aligned is perfectly aligned 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.780
 we put the reel in this case 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.630
 it's pretty easy to put it together 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.659
 and then what we are going to do is pass 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.280
 all the thread 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.280
 by our rings 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.830
 we go 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.420
 is to pass it by our 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.520
 well we have passed all the thread by 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.170
 our rings below what 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.390
 first thing we're going to do is going to be 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.210
 place a knot the knots can be 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.390
 do but I prefer these ones that already 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.100
 they're done 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.409
 they are faster and the truth is that I 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.590
 as I do not have much practice for me they are 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.549
 much more secure and simple to be able 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:04.579
 a small tube is passed through the tube 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:04.579
 it is passed to the thread that is pulled down 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.280
 it lends a little 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.280
 and we have ready 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.439
 then we put a pearl 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.440
 after the pearlite 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.510
 we passed a scullery 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.430
 is where our cork goes 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.590
 English there are other systems 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.230
 but I use this with the scullery 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.390
 because in the case of breaking the cork or 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.990
 whatever it is or need another cost to 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:49.290
 fishing changes very quickly 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.290
 and finally we will try our line 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.080
 and here will be where it is united in our 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.080
 line bass 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.500
 what I usually do is in the knot 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.040
 gets wet a little bit with saliva 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.040
 that runs well 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.319
 secrete 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.319
 then these two those that are left over 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.740
 of cutting the flat arms of the tone 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.150
 as you see 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:50.840
 I'll put 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.840
 we have our rig ready 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.200
 where we put 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.080
 the English course 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.629
 in the water here, I will not let you
