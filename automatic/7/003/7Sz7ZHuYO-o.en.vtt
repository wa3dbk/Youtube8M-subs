00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:11.110
 Well, here is the room where 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.160
 there is a mirror of his skin 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:17.530
 called on the mirror 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:22.600
 time now we enter this room 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:25.930
 it is a small width I'm in the subway 60 or on 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:31.890
 four meters has an oblong 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:36.990
 elongated shape available 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.990
 lighting fresh air 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:44.089
 designs are made 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.489
 by the strut method of two sheets one of 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:53.289
 them lying down on the floor 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:55.059
 another upstairs set were racks 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:01:01.809
 bricks 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:05.119
 30 by 45 in my opinion is not important 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.750
 enough strength I chose such 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.750
 bosco size 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.630
 these bars were sheathed 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.490
 plywood sheets panel 3 millimeter 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.450
 usually 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.590
 birch in my here such here 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.049
 the design turned out 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.789
 I had to increase because the size 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:32.500
 standard plywood sheet size 53 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:32.500
 which is clearly not enough for full 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.610
 for high-grade energy 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:43.459
 reflections that is, I decided to increase 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:47.649
 above another about 30 centimeters here you are 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:52.659
 see them now though the strip 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:58.719
 which strengthened cast stars new 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:02:01.250
 from the main sheet and strip the scope for 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:04.990
 provide stiffness 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:10.810
 wholeness could i applied 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:17.330
 here's this type of lining or something yes 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:19.450
 which enshrined on the bottom sheet when 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:26.290
 help rivets 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:31.910
 conventional construction rivets and top 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:38.170
 no longer fixing on the pad using 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:44.959
 set it as a molding exactly 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:46.450
 extra sheets were fastened this all 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:53.330
 on screws 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:54.620
 because groups allow at 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.190
 need to disassemble bones 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:06.799
 rebuild it differently 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:12.950
 differently clean cylinder diameter 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:15.440
 I get about fifty meters is 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.790
 I think that's enough to have 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.690
 produce some experiments so far 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.690
 I can not say anything 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:30.739
 why struts struts we secured yet 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:33.890
 additionally building corners here 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:37.070
 so calculate them then the corner 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.860
 all Russians are enough for each piece 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.400
 stand vertically mounted on 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.400
 level 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.620
 a little bit 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:54.690
 the width of the sheet in the hut was not enough therefore 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:59.300
 we got out one bar outside the sheet 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:04.849
 Well, not much spacer 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.849
 set it up about the flow 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.770
 this is self-supporting construction 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:24.850
 law trump requirements him so 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:27.310
 called mandatory attachment 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.620
 only conductive and energetic 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.600
 conductive sheets in which as 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:38.140
 which we used offset sheets 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:42.310
 which are used in most 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:45.160
 typography is still a technology in set 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.050
 practiced quite widely therefore with 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:52.360
 these sheets in each city in general 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:54.420
 problems should not be for the price not 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:05:02.920
 so expensive in general 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:04.200
 Well, let's say so these sheets are available with one 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:09.850
 the parties have this view 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:12.120
 Apparently some photo layer is applied 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.120
 colors 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.470
 blue or turquoise that I love 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:22.750
 other side of the sheet 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:25.930
 has that is it is pure aluminum very 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:29.910
 smooth smooth course already with installation 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.910
 try not to deform it 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:39.750
 design turns until all 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:44.490
 in addition I will be more 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.490
 give information later thanks
