00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.500
 hacks and kisses sparkles victims and me 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.670
 I must say I have all four and me

 have made up this beautiful curls 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.009
 then just stay tuned 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.719
 First, I have my face with 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.039
 a day cream creamed around my 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.500
 make the face appear fresher 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.659
 I will green the new s in the residential area 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.969
 in fact only use 2 netware and 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:42.600
 I will spread them on my face 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:44.700
 and mine for an eye make-up 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.060
 more durable which of smc 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.729
 use allofs take aways and get them 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.810
 also give my eye away and also one 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.810
 bit at the bottom 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.990
 because it is mainly with pigments 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.119
 i will be working the skc base 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.100
 Use and I'll do it right 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.050
 I'll wear my pigments later 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.360
 ask for a complete song 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.880
 i will use the eyeshadow color in the 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.760
 driver 58 cappuccino been praised and 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.760
 I will also apply it in the corner of my eye 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.540
 b 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.120
 July 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.719
 I will be the first pigment to be the color 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.310
 11 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.840
 because they used and will mean 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.920
 children are not wet because of me 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.530
 really a natural result 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.450
 but if you want to get the brush 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.769
 the result will be wet, of course 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.329
 much more intense 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.640
 I'm going to help a paperback 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.590
 take so that you really segment only on 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:46.400
 dearest and not everywhere 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:49.040
 face is distributed and that me 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.909
 I'll just use strawberry in the 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.920
 color 14 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.379
 and I will put in my league 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.400
 around the eye a bit of definition and 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.400
 to give a bit of depth 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.730
 I wear the same color too 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.730
 lower lash line 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.980
 for a more beautiful color gradient 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.430
 I will get the color again 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.799
 cappuccino britin the 58 use it and it 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.890
 really only in the first third of the eye 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.599
 occurred 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:30.080
 Now I will grill alone in the 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:33.730

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.709
 I'll draw a line with it 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.420
 I start from the second third of mine 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.420
 to wear a back song 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:58.470
 Of course, anyone can make such a mistake 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.690
 The most important thing is not to happen 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.879
 immediately wipe away but really 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.680
 to wait until the father dried up 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.680
 and then to first take away 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.930

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.600
 lines the top and the bottom 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.540
 connect with each other and then turn them off 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.250
 Marl with a cotton swab we can 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.020
 now really all potter wipe away 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.380
