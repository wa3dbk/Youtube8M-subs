00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.610
 yes hello dear we talk TV spectators 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.559
 are today at the vsg altglienicke where 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.269
 behind us on this place next 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.170
 Year no league more takes place 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.779
 Today we have Daniel BÃ¶hm with us 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.070
 first get used to it as were the 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.510
 decision making that it 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.670
 It has finally come to that 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.800
 has withdrawn from the oberliga 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.320
 because you have the first signs where 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.079
 One has noticed this league is for us 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.239
 no longer the right one in the end 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.290
 the thing moves us the whole 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.820
 second round and in principle it is so 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.670
 that is known that with us 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.020
 the infrastructure was not up to par 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.090
 has been like the last few years 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.440
 sporty success we are in the 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.100
 last ten years, seven times on me 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.610
 against and any amount of work to do 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.170
 is and where we are in the top league 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.550
 hochlagen are 2012 masters of berlin 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.680
 We were actually a conversion 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.490
 then it was assured again 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.530
 Found the hbd or whatever 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.799
 this was then canceled 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.970
 2013 moved to where we then again 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.720
 have decided on the league 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.110
 participate 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.790
 now it is so that will also end in 2014 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.070
 2014 was postponed and 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.259
 accordingly , main reason waited 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.640
 let's say the berliner go down because 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.619
 the infrastructure is simply not 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.520
 given is league to play we 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.350
 actually have the previous one 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.630
 And in addition we are next 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.420
 year yes on a job site and then 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.420
 league game operation is to perform 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.250
 almost impossible 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.020
 of course you can say okay now 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.490
 infrastructure is definitely one 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.560
 the main reasons maybe still existed 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.960
 so other financial sticking points the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.720
 travel costs maybe again 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.750
 to have played because ultimately 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.520
 The league is something like that 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.640
 regionalliga a little bit smaller 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.860
 maybe it just costs too much 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.960
 than that it was ultimately worth it 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.599
 maybe also because of the top league 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.510
 not so attractive is therefore 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:15.239
 basically the first three sentences 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.950
 to determine if we are now 45 years 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.450
 earlier were being held a small 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.129
 regionalliga is not at the moment 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.060
 more so the top league is for me 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:26.579
 relatively dead league and there is mine 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.950
 opinion known the league can 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.390
 actually serve only for the purpose there 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.190
 to march through the regionalliga 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.650
 which is very attractive with 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.210
 super attractive teams yes but 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.270
 the league itself in the shape of her 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.100
 Now there can be no permanent 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.570
 stay for anyone were up by 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.850
 the relatively high cost but 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.950
 especially by him, the 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.570
 appearance and appeal of the league that 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.780
 is just does not stand in any 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.520
 cost-benefit ratio they would become 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.230
 so definitely the expert 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.680
 join the say top league 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.680
 abolish 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:10.160
 yes, I basically say yes 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:13.310
 Of course, the question is how many 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.570
 still create the leap in the 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.450
 hear from the berlin league in the 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.940
 Regionalliga so from our point of view or 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.560
 In my view, that's the one 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.610
 superlative useless but from the view of 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.140
 Of course, I can combine that with others 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.880
 not talk when someone say simplistic 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.260
 let's just say it's the berlin league 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.850
 so at hertha zehlendorf or plasma 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.930
 We absolutely want to go to the top league 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.250
 rising up 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.640
 But it is not far the goals of 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.730
 but those are basically I think 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.450
 this league in the wake of the reform now 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.239
 happened 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.239
 three years ago superfluous
