00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
it's going to curl your fabric you don't

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.110 
it's going to curl your fabric you don't
want<00:03:25.450> this<00:03:25.569> to<00:03:25.750> happen<00:03:25.780> so<00:03:26.609> I'm<00:03:27.609> hoping<00:03:27.940> that

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
want this to happen so I'm hoping that

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.370 
want this to happen so I'm hoping that
you<00:03:28.209> can<00:03:28.239> see<00:03:28.389> the<00:03:28.690> reason<00:03:28.989> why<00:03:29.139> they<00:03:29.349> call

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
you can see the reason why they call

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.559 
you can see the reason why they call
this<00:03:29.709> a<00:03:29.769> back<00:03:30.099> stitch<00:03:30.430> because<00:03:30.849> each<00:03:31.209> time<00:03:31.510> I

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
this a back stitch because each time I

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.240 
this a back stitch because each time I
make<00:03:31.780> a<00:03:31.810> stitch<00:03:32.109> I'm<00:03:32.319> going<00:03:32.709> back<00:03:32.980> at<00:03:33.160> an

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
make a stitch I'm going back at an

make a stitch I'm going back at an
eighth<00:03:33.459> of<00:03:33.609> an<00:03:33.760> inch<00:03:33.880> back<00:03:34.239> and<00:03:34.660> to<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.319> left

eighth of an inch back and to the left

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.860 
eighth of an inch back and to the left
what<00:03:36.099> this<00:03:36.280> does<00:03:36.519> is<00:03:36.730> create<00:03:36.760> a<00:03:37.299> successive

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
what this does is create a successive

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.520 
what this does is create a successive
chain<00:03:38.680> of<00:03:38.950> loops<00:03:39.269> each<00:03:40.269> loop<00:03:40.750> locks<00:03:41.260> the

fabric and the thread together so that

way it won't move or shift now I've been

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.360 
way it won't move or shift now I've been
making<00:03:46.780> these<00:03:47.109> stitches<00:03:47.380> at<00:03:47.709> a<00:03:47.769> very<00:03:48.040> slow

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
making these stitches at a very slow

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.280 
making these stitches at a very slow
pace<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.880> way<00:03:49.000> you<00:03:49.060> can<00:03:49.299> see<00:03:49.599> what<00:03:49.810> this<00:03:49.989> looks

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
pace the way you can see what this looks

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.170 
pace the way you can see what this looks
like<00:03:50.380> you<00:03:50.980> normally<00:03:51.459> want<00:03:51.609> to<00:03:51.669> try<00:03:51.910> to<00:03:51.970> be<00:03:52.150> a

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
like you normally want to try to be a

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.270 
like you normally want to try to be a
little<00:03:52.359> bit<00:03:52.510> quicker<00:03:52.780> than<00:03:52.900> this<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:53.470> as<00:03:53.980> you

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
little bit quicker than this and as you

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.909 
little bit quicker than this and as you
successfully<00:03:55.239> make<00:03:55.569> your<00:03:56.049> stitches<00:03:56.380> you<00:03:56.799> will

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
successfully make your stitches you will

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:58.559 
successfully make your stitches you will
find<00:03:57.189> yourself<00:03:57.610> doing<00:03:57.939> so<00:03:58.180> without<00:03:58.420> even

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
find yourself doing so without even

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.410 
find yourself doing so without even
thinking<00:03:59.170> about<00:03:59.230> it<00:03:59.790> now<00:04:00.790> let's<00:04:00.969> say<00:04:01.090> this<00:04:01.239> is

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
thinking about it now let's say this is

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.850 
thinking about it now let's say this is
the<00:04:01.540> end<00:04:01.689> of<00:04:01.780> your<00:04:01.930> row<00:04:02.110> of<00:04:02.260> stitches

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
the end of your row of stitches

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.000 
the end of your row of stitches
I'm<00:04:03.160> going<00:04:03.640> to<00:04:03.760> loop<00:04:04.030> back<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.750> end<00:04:05.380> up<00:04:05.620> where

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
I'm going to loop back and end up where

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.550 
I'm going to loop back and end up where
I<00:04:06.070> just<00:04:06.460> ended<00:04:06.760> up<00:04:06.850> at<00:04:09.660> in<00:04:10.660> other<00:04:11.200> words<00:04:11.380> I'm

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
I just ended up at in other words I'm

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:23.340 
I just ended up at in other words I'm
making<00:04:11.860> another<00:04:12.100> tack<00:04:20.579> and<00:04:21.810> then<00:04:22.810> after<00:04:23.200> that

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
making another tack and then after that

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.780 
making another tack and then after that
I'll<00:04:23.800> go<00:04:24.490> ahead<00:04:24.700> and<00:04:24.790> make<00:04:24.910> a<00:04:24.940> tiny<00:04:25.360> stitch<00:04:25.840> and

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
I'll go ahead and make a tiny stitch and

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.360 
I'll go ahead and make a tiny stitch and
then<00:04:27.790> pull<00:04:28.030> my<00:04:28.510> stitch<00:04:28.840> through<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:29.560> loop<00:04:29.890> and

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
then pull my stitch through the loop and

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.120 
then pull my stitch through the loop and
tie<00:04:31.120> it<00:04:31.180> off<00:04:31.420> so<00:04:32.350> let's<00:04:32.530> check<00:04:32.830> what<00:04:33.010> our

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
tie it off so let's check what our

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.820 
tie it off so let's check what our
stitch<00:04:33.400> is<00:04:33.550> done<00:04:33.580> on<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.240> outside<00:04:34.690> you<00:04:35.680> can

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
stitch is done on the outside you can

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.740 
stitch is done on the outside you can
see<00:04:36.040> the<00:04:36.190> row<00:04:36.370> of<00:04:36.400> stitches<00:04:37.060> peeking<00:04:37.630> out

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
see the row of stitches peeking out

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.600 
see the row of stitches peeking out
through<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.230> fabric<00:04:38.470> for<00:04:39.010> two<00:04:39.160> reasons

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
through the fabric for two reasons

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.370 
through the fabric for two reasons
number<00:04:39.790> one<00:04:40.240> is<00:04:40.390> because<00:04:40.660> this<00:04:40.810> is<00:04:40.990> a<00:04:41.020> very

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
number one is because this is a very

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.440 
number one is because this is a very
loose<00:04:41.740> linen<00:04:42.190> and<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:42.790> other<00:04:42.940> reason<00:04:43.330> is

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
loose linen and the other reason is

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.480 
loose linen and the other reason is
because<00:04:43.480> we're<00:04:44.110> using<00:04:44.140> a<00:04:44.620> contrasting<00:04:45.430> thread

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
because we're using a contrasting thread

sure that the seam allowance is open
underneath<00:05:30.910> the<00:05:31.060> iron<00:05:31.210> and<00:05:31.540> then<00:05:32.350> you're

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
underneath the iron and then you're

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.380 
underneath the iron and then you're
going<00:05:32.680> to<00:05:32.860> press<00:05:33.130> down<00:05:33.400> and<00:05:33.700> release<00:05:33.880> it<00:05:34.270> with

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:47.330 
going to press down and release it with
some<00:05:34.570> steam

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.180 

pull<00:05:48.340> back<00:05:48.580> and<00:05:48.850> look<00:05:49.720> at<00:05:49.840> the<00:05:49.960> stitch<00:05:50.230> now

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
pull back and look at the stitch now

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.650 
pull back and look at the stitch now
that<00:05:51.400> we've<00:05:51.520> opened<00:05:51.670> up<00:05:51.940> the<00:05:52.000> same<00:05:52.330> I'm<00:05:52.480> going

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
that we've opened up the same I'm going

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.110 
that we've opened up the same I'm going
to<00:05:52.720> pull<00:05:52.900> on<00:05:52.930> this<00:05:53.110> fabric<00:05:53.530> really<00:05:54.160> hard<00:05:54.850> I'm

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
to pull on this fabric really hard I'm

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.840 
to pull on this fabric really hard I'm
using<00:05:55.690> all<00:05:55.990> of<00:05:56.020> my<00:05:56.140> strength<00:05:56.230> as<00:05:56.710> I<00:05:57.310> pull<00:05:57.610> you

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
using all of my strength as I pull you

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.490 
using all of my strength as I pull you
can<00:05:57.970> see<00:05:58.210> that<00:05:58.390> the<00:05:58.480> different<00:05:58.840> tensions<00:05:59.350> are

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
can see that the different tensions are

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.020 
can see that the different tensions are
pulling<00:05:59.830> the<00:05:59.950> fabric<00:06:00.130> in<00:06:00.460> different<00:06:00.820> ways

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
pulling the fabric in different ways

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:07.440 
pulling the fabric in different ways
creating<00:06:01.900> ripples<00:06:03.870> and<00:06:06.000> some<00:06:07.000> of<00:06:07.120> the<00:06:07.180> seams

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
creating ripples and some of the seams

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.660 
creating ripples and some of the seams
are<00:06:07.690> opening<00:06:08.050> up<00:06:08.140> more<00:06:08.500> than<00:06:08.800> others<00:06:09.070> this

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.670 
are opening up more than others this

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.000 
are opening up more than others this
means<00:06:09.970> that<00:06:10.270> the<00:06:10.900> ones<00:06:11.140> up<00:06:11.320> here<00:06:11.350> on<00:06:11.650> the<00:06:11.770> top

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
means that the ones up here on the top

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.120 
means that the ones up here on the top
are<00:06:12.340> probably<00:06:13.060> a<00:06:13.180> little<00:06:13.390> bit<00:06:13.570> too<00:06:13.600> loose<00:06:14.130> the

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
are probably a little bit too loose the

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.130 
are probably a little bit too loose the
ones<00:06:15.370> here<00:06:15.700> in<00:06:15.730> the<00:06:15.820> middle<00:06:16.150> seem<00:06:16.720> to<00:06:16.870> be<00:06:16.990> the

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
ones here in the middle seem to be the

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.870 
ones here in the middle seem to be the
strongest<00:06:18.840> the<00:06:19.840> strongest<00:06:20.350> and<00:06:20.530> most<00:06:20.590> snug<00:06:21.130> so

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
strongest the strongest and most snug so

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.670 
strongest the strongest and most snug so
that's<00:06:22.060> how<00:06:22.210> to<00:06:22.270> make<00:06:22.420> a<00:06:22.480> back<00:06:22.780> stitch<00:06:23.080> once

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
that's how to make a back stitch once

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.170 
that's how to make a back stitch once
again<00:06:23.920> this<00:06:24.040> is<00:06:24.190> a<00:06:24.220> finishing<00:06:24.700> stitch<00:06:24.940> that's

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
again this is a finishing stitch that's

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.060 
again this is a finishing stitch that's
going<00:06:25.540> to<00:06:25.720> last<00:06:25.960> on<00:06:26.230> the<00:06:26.320> garment<00:06:26.710> for<00:06:26.740> years

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
going to last on the garment for years

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.010 
going to last on the garment for years
if<00:06:27.280> you<00:06:27.370> do<00:06:27.490> it<00:06:27.610> correctly<00:06:28.000> and<00:06:28.210> it's<00:06:28.870> also

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
if you do it correctly and it's also

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.870 
if you do it correctly and it's also
going<00:06:29.320> to<00:06:29.410> add<00:06:29.500> to<00:06:29.710> the<00:06:29.830> shape<00:06:30.100> of<00:06:30.310> comfort<00:06:30.730> and
