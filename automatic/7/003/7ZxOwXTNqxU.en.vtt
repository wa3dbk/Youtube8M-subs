00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.490
 low cost 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.740
 Today I have a very important role 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.850
 dermatologist for cancer prevention 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.770
 cutaneous 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.330
 the patient has the duty to go to the 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.770
 dermatologist a duty that to wait 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.880
 first of all against you 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.350
 same 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.680
 today we are noticing a remarkable one 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.590
 increase in incidence, that is, the number 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.720
 of diagnosis per year of melanomas then 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.940
 butal malignant tumors but a reduction 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.040
 of mortality as we explain it 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.840
 we can explain this in the way 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.930
 as simple as possible 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.030
 the patient is better at showing himself to 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.199
 get checked by looking before 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.570
 all his skin and being 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.299
 aware of a chance of familiarity 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.390
 for example they are patients who have 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.190
 a personal or family medical history 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.500
 positive for those tumors 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.680
 people deserve more than others 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.900
 those are the dermatological controls 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.210
 people who have other types of factors 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.000
 of risk beyond a personal analysis o 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.890
 familial for skin cancers or less name 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.909
 even three more risk factors 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.350
 important 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.630
 we recognize the predisposition 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.110
 individual that is true genetics e 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.180
 own but above all the phototype i 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.330
 skin types 1 and 2 are the most important phototypes 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.700
 clear that they therefore deserve a check 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.280
 then periodic dermatology 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.050
 let us go to the dermatologist to do 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.600
 evaluate our skin to do that is 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.760
 a complete other skin check-up 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.340
 risk factors are the presence of 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.380
 a considerable number of moles for example a 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.360
 number that must already start 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.150
 alert the patient to a number 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.800
 higher than 30 in the other factors of 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.390
 still risk for the development of tumors 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.290
 cutaneous or even melanoma 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.440
 and development in the pediatric age of 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.310
 frequent or age-related sun rashes 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.680
 adult 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.690
 intermittent solar exposure 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.870
 let us think, for example, of ours 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.530
 habits of going out trips for example 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.050
 in tropical countries they can expose more 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.600
 frequently than in age and type 50 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.510
 years ago to frequent solar burns 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.590
 hence the development of skin neoplasms 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:37.200
 in addition to various skin damage to various 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.760
 levels for example sun spots 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.830
 Seborrheic keratoses that are 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.040
 simply benign or tumors 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.230
 even to basal cell carcinomas or 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.040
 spinocellular which are malignant tumors 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.280
 but local malignancy that is rarely the 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.810
 low tumor basal cell carcinoma 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.190
 metastasizes the more he attended the more 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.150
 frequently carcinoma 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.019
 spinocellulare has the possibility of 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.260
 metastasize the level of info 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.760
 regional nodes but the most worrying is 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.400
 definitely melanoma 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.590
 when then start to worry 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.510
 of our ray I had said when 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.519
 we have many when we know we have 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.380
 suffered pressure when we know the 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.510
 our father our mother or a relative 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.989
 first grade developed a tumor 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.030
 of the skin but above all when later 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.030
 careful self-examination of the moles 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.310
 here is that it is very important 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.630
 the patient's attention 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.300
 the relationship of trust that is established 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.760
 patient doctor said when 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.770
 looking at ourselves in the mirror or making ourselves 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.050
 help from some close relative 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:43.370
 we have the opportunity to note the 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:47.360
 famous abcde then the variations of 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:50.030
 to asymmetry of bobby that transform 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.989
 from regular and irregular or jagged 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.090
 c color changes to alterations 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.540
 of the dimensions and above all 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.880
 look at it and the Italian expansion 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.610
 that is expansion in a flat sense 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.730
 circular of a mole or even in 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.530
 general evolution for example lo 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.480
 bleeding development the 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.720
 you have to worry about bleeding 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.850
 especially when it is spontaneous there are 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.620
 even if post traumatic expansions that 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.090
 must be made, however, to assess the 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.100
 specialist in dermatology 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.950
 but the most worrying is bleeding 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.979
 spontaneous that could indicate the launcher 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:31.070
 action of a possible melanoma and therefore 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:34.610
 make a diagnosis more necessary 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.140
 possible early we talk here and 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.680
 but the medical office guarnieri us 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.630
 we use manual equipment 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.380
 to digital 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:47.090
 we have a manual dermatoscope here 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.830
 takes advantage of the dermatologist's eye 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.820
 that the most important tool of 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.650
 evaluation for us that optically one 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.380
 of the best equipment with 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.690
 what he stands on the neo that 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.620
 we consider more than worthy of evaluation 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.060
 others 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.919
 and we can therefore appreciate the 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.600
 so-called image of the moscone pica 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.000
 the image of the moscone pica is 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.849
 an image that allows us to evaluate 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.179
 there 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:14.459
 in depth then as I love to say the 

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:15.360
 skin in addition to the epidermis what is there 

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:17.520
 under the skin 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.869
 le pigment architecture 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.349
 characteristics of vascularization 

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:24.119
 of a mole the presence of patterns like vi 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:24.959
 that is, we ask for structures 

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:27.689
 details inside 

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:29.849
 of the architecture of the neo that can 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:33.240
 alert the patient here but above all 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:34.169
 the doctor to indicate only if necessary 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.110
 if necessary 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:39.330
 there are surgical removal of the mole 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.189
 then other types of equipment such as 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.279
 this digital endoscope video 

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:47.459
 which allows us to appreciate the image 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:48.179
 of the pica wood but to do so of the to 

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:51.649
 follow up 

00:05:48.179 --> 00:05:54.629
 follow up is a particular type of 

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:56.399
 medical advice for which the doctor does 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:59.369
 poses towards a patient who 

00:05:56.399 --> 00:06:01.110
 for example to many in advising them 

00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:03.979
 the so-called mapping of the moles 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:07.740
 her mapping is an investigation 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:10.740
 instrumental that goes just like the gods 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.990
 more details those more debts 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.809
 dermatological interest and that there 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.199
 then allows after photographing a 

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:18.719
 mole 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:21.240
 here after demonizing the image 

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:23.099
 clinic to also memorize the image 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.800
 of the moscone pica that is what we 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:27.959
 we get in epiluminescence so 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.860
 such as to guarantee the comparison of the 

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:32.309
 images 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.619
 at a distance of time what time the 

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:36.839
 dermatologist will decide the periodicity 

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:39.659
 of the checks that can be made to 

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:41.849
 3 months to 6 months to a year depending on 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:44.490
 delirium of technology but above 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:46.790
 from the type of patient of the 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:50.510
 type of person we are 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.830
 it is therefore very important indeed 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.690
 role of the theme I remove in the diagnosis 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.670
 early but also the role of 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.430
 dermatologist for cancer prevention 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.470
 skin that can be completed 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:03.230
 basically through the adoption of 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:06.190
 personal protective equipment 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:08.420
 see for example in cambe people 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.800
 the use of the leather hat 

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.900
 scalp that one of the more seats 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.190
 Frequent development of tumors 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.380
 skin precisely because leather 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.960
 like the face, the pavilions 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:20.180
 earphones the backs of the hands are the 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.120
 areas especially in our beautiful 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:25.850
 apulia and at our latitudes 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:28.520
 chronically exposed to the sun and therefore mi 

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:31.250
 I always recommend using a sun milk 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:33.260
 who has a sun protection factor 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:38.120
 therefore a sun protection factor 

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:40.910
 50 more and we learn to evaluate in a manner 

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:43.990
 accurate and take the same ones more 

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.990
 of all our skin
