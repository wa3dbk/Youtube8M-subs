way<00:02:15.100> back<00:02:15.130> when<00:02:15.790> I<00:02:15.910> live<00:02:16.090> with<00:02:16.210> my<00:02:16.360> parents<00:02:16.420> I

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
way back when I live with my parents I

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.240 
way back when I live with my parents I
think<00:02:16.990> a<00:02:17.500> couple<00:02:17.770> years<00:02:18.250> ago<00:02:18.450> but<00:02:19.450> um<00:02:20.220> got<00:02:21.220> a

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
think a couple years ago but um got a

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.600 
think a couple years ago but um got a
great<00:02:21.430> pocket<00:02:21.970> clip<00:02:22.150> so<00:02:22.330> nice<00:02:22.480> deep<00:02:22.750> carry

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
great pocket clip so nice deep carry

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.550 
great pocket clip so nice deep carry
it's<00:02:24.610> got<00:02:24.970> this<00:02:25.120> it's<00:02:25.390> good<00:02:25.930> stainless<00:02:26.350> steel

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
it's got this it's good stainless steel

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.920 
it's got this it's good stainless steel
so<00:02:27.070> it's<00:02:27.190> got<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.340> really<00:02:27.640> nice<00:02:27.970> weight<00:02:28.330> to<00:02:28.360> it<00:02:28.630> I

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
so it's got a really nice weight to it I

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.900 
so it's got a really nice weight to it I
mean<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.770> doesn't<00:02:30.040> matter<00:02:30.160> how<00:02:30.310> heavy<00:02:30.490> these

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
mean it doesn't matter how heavy these

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.870 
mean it doesn't matter how heavy these
are<00:02:31.150> when<00:02:31.330> there's<00:02:31.480> this<00:02:31.870> small<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:32.230> know<00:02:32.880> the

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
are when there's this small you know the

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.110 
are when there's this small you know the
wages<00:02:34.240> makes<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.630> quality<00:02:35.050> feel<00:02:36.030> feels<00:02:37.030> like

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
wages makes the quality feel feels like

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.470 
wages makes the quality feel feels like
there's<00:02:37.270> more<00:02:37.360> quality<00:02:37.750> they're<00:02:37.870> basically

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
there's more quality they're basically

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.850 
there's more quality they're basically
and<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.570> would<00:02:40.690> think<00:02:40.870> with<00:02:41.080> such<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.620> small

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
and you would think with such a small

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.830 
and you would think with such a small

knife<00:03:21.130> itself<00:03:21.930> so<00:03:23.850> that's<00:03:24.850> that<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:25.420> then<00:03:25.980> you

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
knife itself so that's that and then you

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.130 
knife itself so that's that and then you
know<00:03:27.070> next<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.610> that<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:28.120> less<00:03:28.570> functional

nama<00:03:34.360> kadett<00:03:34.930> I<00:03:35.080> mean<00:03:35.590> it<00:03:35.710> the<00:03:36.520> grasshopper

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
nama kadett I mean it the grasshopper

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.440 
nama kadett I mean it the grasshopper
looks<00:03:37.240> a<00:03:37.330> little<00:03:37.480> longer<00:03:37.810> but<00:03:39.150> but<00:03:40.150> it's<00:03:40.300> not

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
looks a little longer but but it's not

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.180 
looks a little longer but but it's not
as<00:03:40.630> a<00:03:40.660> big<00:03:41.620> of<00:03:41.800> a<00:03:41.890> small<00:03:42.190> knife<00:03:42.370> as<00:03:42.700> this<00:03:42.820> one<00:03:43.030> is

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
as a big of a small knife as this one is

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.960 
as a big of a small knife as this one is
but<00:03:45.190> I<00:03:45.660> think<00:03:46.660> they<00:03:46.750> go<00:03:46.870> for<00:03:47.080> about<00:03:47.730> sixty<00:03:48.730> two

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
but I think they go for about sixty two

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.110 
but I think they go for about sixty two
I've<00:03:49.210> seen<00:03:49.390> even<00:03:49.600> a<00:03:49.690> hundred<00:03:49.840> dollars<00:03:50.370> if<00:03:51.370> you

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120

I've seen even a hundred dollars if you
can<00:03:52.270> find<00:03:52.540> one<00:03:53.310> but<00:03:54.310> it's<00:03:54.520> got<00:03:54.700> tip<00:03:55.060> down<00:03:55.680> our

just I can't really describe how great
it<00:04:11.290> feels<00:04:11.410> we've<00:04:11.709> got<00:04:11.800> a<00:04:11.830> couple<00:04:11.980> grip<00:04:12.340> options

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
it feels we've got a couple grip options

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.690 
it feels we've got a couple grip options
you<00:04:12.910> can<00:04:13.000> grip<00:04:13.180> up<00:04:13.360> farther<00:04:13.660> down<00:04:13.930> here<00:04:14.170> so<00:04:15.040> dig

you can grip up farther down here so dig

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.880 
you can grip up farther down here so dig

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
grip up a little farther for the fine

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.560 
grip up a little farther for the fine
work<00:04:20.109> this<00:04:21.010> is<00:04:21.160> very<00:04:21.520> nice<00:04:22.080> came<00:04:23.080> so<00:04:23.470> sharp

I<00:04:24.690> highly<00:04:25.620> recommend<00:04:25.740> this<00:04:26.190> one<00:04:26.780> if<00:04:27.780> you<00:04:27.900> get

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
I highly recommend this one if you get

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.700 
I highly recommend this one if you get
your<00:04:28.080> hands<00:04:28.500> on<00:04:28.700> go<00:04:29.700> for<00:04:30.030> it<00:04:30.320> but<00:04:31.320> i'm<00:04:31.470> not

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
your hands on go for it but i'm not

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.380 
your hands on go for it but i'm not
really<00:04:32.010> the<00:04:32.130> biggest<00:04:32.400> fan<00:04:32.670> of<00:04:32.910> stainless

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
really the biggest fan of stainless

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.610 
really the biggest fan of stainless
steel<00:04:33.420> handles<00:04:34.170> but<00:04:34.700> this<00:04:35.700> is<00:04:35.850> changing<00:04:36.300> my

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
steel handles but this is changing my

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.560 
steel handles but this is changing my
opinion<00:04:37.620> on<00:04:37.890> that<00:04:38.040> I've<00:04:38.730> never<00:04:39.000> really<00:04:39.360> had

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
opinion on that I've never really had

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.600 
opinion on that I've never really had
one<00:04:39.870> yet<00:04:40.170> I<00:04:40.350> always<00:04:40.500> go<00:04:40.710> for<00:04:40.890> the<00:04:40.920> g10<00:04:41.340> or<00:04:41.550> the
