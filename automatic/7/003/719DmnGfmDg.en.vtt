we're going to show you how to riff
caliber<00:00:12.480> on<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.840> 92<00:00:13.620> Mazda<00:00:14.130> Miata<00:00:14.630> you<00:00:15.630> got<00:00:15.809> to

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
caliber on the 92 Mazda Miata you got to

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.599 
caliber on the 92 Mazda Miata you got to
take<00:00:16.080> off<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.379> wheel<00:00:16.410> for<00:00:16.830> us<00:00:16.949> we<00:00:17.460> got<00:00:17.550> a

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
take off the wheel for us we got a

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.140 
take off the wheel for us we got a
racked<00:00:17.910> up<00:00:18.090> here<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:19.109> could<00:00:19.230> do<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.529> with<00:00:19.859> the

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
racked up here you could do it with the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.580 
racked up here you could do it with the
floor<00:00:21.150> jacks<00:00:21.449> if<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.689> wanted<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.230> safety

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
floor jacks if you wanted to and safety

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.060

stands<00:00:22.970> still<00:00:23.970> racks<00:00:24.210> easier<00:00:24.710> so<00:00:25.710> here's<00:00:25.949> the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
stands still racks easier so here's the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.759 
stands still racks easier so here's the
caliper<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.640> we're<00:00:27.599> going<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.779> take<00:00:28.380> off<00:00:28.560> this

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
caliper and we're going to take off this

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.589 
caliper and we're going to take off this
little<00:00:28.830> rubber<00:00:29.279> boot<00:00:29.550> down<00:00:29.760> here<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.390> got<00:00:30.539> to

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
little rubber boot down here you got to

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.720 
little rubber boot down here you got to
take<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.840> off<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.230> get<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.529> bolt<00:00:31.769> comes

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
take this off to get to the bolt comes

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.020 
take this off to get to the bolt comes
off<00:00:32.940> just<00:00:33.149> like<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:34.610> so<00:00:35.610> if<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.820> go<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:35.940> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
off just like that so if you go on the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.600 
off just like that so if you go on the
back<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.390> your<00:00:36.480> caliper<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.469> just<00:00:37.829> bolt<00:00:38.399> right

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
back of your caliper is just bolt right

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.270 
back of your caliper is just bolt right
here<00:00:39.170> that's<00:00:40.170> your<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.500> cap<00:00:41.430> for<00:00:41.760> your<00:00:42.050> manual

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
here that's your a cap for your manual

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.200 
here that's your a cap for your manual
adjusting<00:00:44.280> screw<00:00:45.210> for<00:00:46.020> your<00:00:46.200> caliper<00:00:46.920> piston

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
adjusting screw for your caliper piston

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.520 
adjusting screw for your caliper piston
so<00:00:48.210> when<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.450> take<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.629> bolt<00:00:49.050> off<00:00:49.260> you'll

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
so when you take that bolt off you'll

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.610 
so when you take that bolt off you'll
see<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:49.860> there<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.910> barely

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
see you in there just barely

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.970 
see you in there just barely
there's<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.680> little<00:00:53.420> allen<00:00:54.420> key<00:00:54.600> or<00:00:54.649> hex<00:00:55.649> key

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
there's a little allen key or hex key

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.360 
there's a little allen key or hex key
bolt<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.850> there<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.239> have<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.600> unscrew<00:00:58.500> it

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
bolt in there and you have to unscrew it

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.389 
bolt in there and you have to unscrew it
to<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.699> left<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.710> retract<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.829> piston<00:01:02.010> back

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
to the left to retract the piston back

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.759 
to the left to retract the piston back
in<00:01:02.609> developer<00:01:03.180> right<00:01:03.960> now<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.170> can<00:01:04.379> see<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
in developer right now you can see the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.240 
in developer right now you can see the
allen<00:01:05.309> key<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.909> there<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.890> this<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.040> very

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
allen key is in there and this is a very

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.620 
allen key is in there and this is a very
important<00:01:08.670> step<00:01:08.880> because<00:01:09.119> if<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.330> do<00:01:09.479> not

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
important step because if you do not

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.770 
important step because if you do not
back<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.409> off<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.830> won't<00:01:10.950> be<00:01:11.130> able<00:01:11.280> to

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
back that off you won't be able to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.249 
back that off you won't be able to
compress<00:01:12.780> your<00:01:13.710> piston<00:01:14.600> now<00:01:15.600> we<00:01:15.659> go<00:01:15.810> back<00:01:16.049> to

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
compress your piston now we go back to

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.590 
compress your piston now we go back to
that<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.560> bottom<00:01:17.220> bolt<00:01:17.430> took<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.150> cover<00:01:18.390> up

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
that a bottom bolt took that cover up

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.350 
that a bottom bolt took that cover up
I'm<00:01:18.869> taking<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.290> one<00:01:19.500> off<00:01:19.680> here<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.159> after<00:01:21.150> we

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
I'm taking this one off here so after we

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.700 
I'm taking this one off here so after we
take<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.659> bottom<00:01:22.080> bolt<00:01:22.259> off<00:01:22.470> there's

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
take this bottom bolt off there's

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.220 
take this bottom bolt off there's
actually

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
actually

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.890 
actually
a<00:01:23.290> second<00:01:23.860> bolt<00:01:24.040> it's<00:01:24.250> just<00:01:24.430> a<00:01:24.550> sliding<00:01:24.940> pin<00:01:25.150> so

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
a second bolt it's just a sliding pin so

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.370 
a second bolt it's just a sliding pin so
you<00:01:25.960> pivot<00:01:26.260> up<00:01:26.640> caliper<00:01:27.640> like<00:01:27.820> this<00:01:28.380> should

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
you pivot up caliper like this should

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.270 
you pivot up caliper like this should
slide<00:01:29.650> right<00:01:29.830> off<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.920> you<00:01:32.980> want<00:01:33.130> make<00:01:33.250> sure

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
slide right off so you want make sure

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.130 
slide right off so you want make sure
you<00:01:33.550> hang<00:01:33.700> up<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:33.970> caliper<00:01:34.420> that<00:01:34.480> way<00:01:34.720> you

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
you hang up the caliper that way you

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.110 
you hang up the caliper that way you
don't<00:01:35.230> pinch<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.710> lines<00:01:35.920> use<00:01:36.730> a<00:01:36.760> piece<00:01:37.000> of

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
don't pinch the lines use a piece of

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.170 
don't pinch the lines use a piece of
baling<00:01:37.300> wire<00:01:37.480> or<00:01:38.080> you<00:01:38.470> know<00:01:38.860> bungee<00:01:39.280> cord<00:01:39.520> so

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
baling wire or you know bungee cord so

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.660 
baling wire or you know bungee cord so
this<00:01:40.300> is<00:01:40.390> what<00:01:40.540> that<00:01:40.570> little<00:01:40.960> allen<00:01:41.320> key

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
this is what that little allen key

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.340 
this is what that little allen key
ratcheting<00:01:42.670> bolt<00:01:43.300> looks<00:01:43.690> like<00:01:43.900> it's<00:01:44.230> the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
ratcheting bolt looks like it's the

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.330 
ratcheting bolt looks like it's the
front<00:01:44.620> part<00:01:44.860> with<00:01:46.290> side<00:01:47.290> that's<00:01:47.980> the<00:01:48.130> part

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
front part with side that's the part

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.150 
front part with side that's the part
that<00:01:48.550> turns<00:01:48.910> in<00:01:49.180> your<00:01:49.360> piston<00:01:49.750> be<00:01:50.680> cool

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
that turns in your piston be cool

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.970 
that turns in your piston be cool
you'll<00:01:52.030> make<00:01:52.180> sure<00:01:52.240> that<00:01:52.510> goes<00:01:52.660> back<00:01:52.900> in<00:01:53.110> very

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
you'll make sure that goes back in very

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.310 
you'll make sure that goes back in very
important<00:01:54.360> now<00:01:55.360> that<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:55.660> CalPERS<00:01:55.870> out<00:01:56.230> of

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
important now that the CalPERS out of

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.370 
important now that the CalPERS out of
the<00:01:56.380> way<00:01:56.500> we<00:01:56.680> can<00:01:57.180> just<00:01:58.180> slide<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.840> pads<00:01:59.080> right

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
the way we can just slide the pads right

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.220 
the way we can just slide the pads right
off<00:01:59.820> put<00:02:00.820> our<00:02:00.910> new<00:02:01.030> pads<00:02:01.270> on<00:02:01.510> these<00:02:02.080> are

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
off put our new pads on these are

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.260 
off put our new pads on these are
actually<00:02:02.500> already<00:02:02.710> new<00:02:02.830> pads<00:02:03.100> so<00:02:03.400> we're<00:02:04.180> going

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
actually already new pads so we're going

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.450 
actually already new pads so we're going
to<00:02:04.360> leave<00:02:04.480> these<00:02:04.660> on<00:02:04.870> but<00:02:05.170> all<00:02:06.010> right<00:02:06.100> so<00:02:06.340> when

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
to leave these on but all right so when

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.340
