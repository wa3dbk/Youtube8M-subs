00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:20.659

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.410

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.380

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.840

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.230

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.960
 Before the end of July with a lot of fun also about the variety 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.260
 purely legal needs to have options 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.930
 do not have to improvise 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.060
 Different games the players need the planner 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.170
 Streets of Interlaken is live go to Jens Kerstan 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.320
 how much we asked just one game to practice her 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.850
 Gudula might still expect it 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.220
 How old are they 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.690
 but so much praise is 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.560
 I am now 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.560
 also almost 39 years old 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.190
 not very good experiences 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.460
 Sonny Thet in focus 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.250
 played football earlier or passionately 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.300
 also relatively successful 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.330
 By the way, other sports operated like the teens 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.830
 the system is 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.980
 Georg and 5 in the gym 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.980
 Barrel to get annoying or allegations 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.090
 my profession is also 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.090
 Burton from the label back that 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.960
 biggest hits this made the puck rest in the sixth tournament game tomorrow 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.140
 the judges their verdict 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.470
 greatest successes 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.519
 Thomas Haller Complaint 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.610
 That was what I was trying to do with the host cells 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:17.769
 or in the year 2030 two citizens to finance the means 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.189
 second title 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:21.879
 achieved at that time 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.209
 that was great success 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.529
 despite all worries 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:26.929
 sometimes say 

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:30.429
 8 years more up and the previous desperate step up to 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:33.429
 Mayors in Texas were 97 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.949
 and then I have various tournaments showing this one 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:40.169
 It's all called Service Gateway 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:43.869
 among other things that's what it's about 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:48.019
 to thank is now the number championship 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.019
 his last year has been very successful 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:56.169
 this is the 10th 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.439
 Rostock SID 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.989
 Roman of her especially good 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.120
 one can 11 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.099
 basically find is in the cathedral 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.329
 just a stone of liquidity which she does a little bit of strategy is really good 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:13.319
 no one else thinks it's nobody left SC on the major Texas titles 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.109
 were 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.299
 that you just adjust to the situation that you have everything 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:18.039
 you offer 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:21.939
 the melancholic valences occupied 30 starters plays 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:25.470
 the netbook is going to go extreme plan the opponent enters 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:30.099
 and I think they're actually losing a lot to figure out 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.239
 Stevenson 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.239

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.349
 out of the lead 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.239
 Norbert Nieszery scene 

00:03:58.179 --> 00:04:01.179
 but that's exactly the newspaper 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.389
 like Christina 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:07.959
 Stay on Topic 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.679
 matching black ones 

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:12.509
