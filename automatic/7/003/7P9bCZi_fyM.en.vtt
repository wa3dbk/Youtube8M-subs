00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
think our games would complement each

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.320 
think our games would complement each
other<00:04:03.690> well<00:04:03.800> I'm<00:04:04.800> just<00:04:05.010> saying<00:04:05.280> we<00:04:06.060> could<00:04:06.090> take

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330
