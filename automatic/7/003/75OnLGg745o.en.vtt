00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.060
 once again to all users of 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.910
 youtube today in this video tutorial 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:12.350
 We will see how to restore a motorola defy 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:16.090
 Motorola 320 x Mini 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.090
 how can you see that is to determine 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.519
 this restoration serves more than anything 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:27.550
 if your terminal stays on the screen 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:30.370
 of start and does not turn on, it should be noted that 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.450
 this cell phone is from the telcel company 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.140
 let's proceed to restore it 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.060
 you just have to follow these 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.280
 simple steps 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.280
 we proceed to insert the battery 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.500
 we have to keep the button pressed 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.780
 ignition that is in the part 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.659
 top left and the two buttons on 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.409
 volume up and volume down the three 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:56.409
 at the same time 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.710
 once it vibrates we leave the two 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.710
 buttons pressed at the same time 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.220
 As you can see, it enters a recovery mode 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.970
 we press the off button to 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.190
 enter the options 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.770
 let's u and datafactory options 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.330
 reset cache and press the button 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.330
 access to the camera to select 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.440
 let's give it 10 and we move with the 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.440
 volume buttons 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.430
 we must restore after we go to with 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.430
 partition cache 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:43.880
 and it has already been restored, we give in the option 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.829
 of bounce system or one more time 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.850
 and this would be all to restore the 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:51.030
 motorola defy mini 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.610
 In another chapter I will show you how 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.100
 install cloud what more 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.540
 and this do a root access to have 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.540
 better performance of this terminal 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.940
 as we see that it is lighting 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.989
 and as you can see is from the 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.989
 telcel company 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.640
 continue restoring this process can 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.040
 take between two or three minutes in 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.569
 that I reload the restart this 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.700
 it would be like a factory reset and it's 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.069
 as if it were the first time that the 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.840
 term is turning it on so no 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.230
 worry if it takes too long 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.230
 turn on 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.310
 remember to comment if you want to know something 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.849
 more about some other terminal that gives them 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.849
 interest 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.830
 favor inflation and install courses 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.230
 when bieber the terminal means that 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.360
 is already restarting well as we can 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.300
 see we already have the lock screen 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.250
 we slide and he welcomes us 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.870
 all we have to do is to 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.550
 new reconfigure our 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.550
 terminal to be able to use it 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.990
 and as I come to the end it has been the 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.990
 restorer 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:12.330
 this procedure is in case its screen 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:16.730
 stays in the logo in the mission boot of 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.730
 telcel and he does not want to work anymore 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.930
 we can not keep fluid never 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.490
 problems would be from this to be erased 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.950
 all its applications well and they would have 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.020
 to reconfigure remember 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.250
 comment and like the video if you 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.940
 taste 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.940
 Thank you
