00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.080
 the production of coconut 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.080
 remains a valid alternative for Paraguay 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:14.239
 this plant 

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:16.740
 we have it for any purpose 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.070
 many times because of ignorance 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.919
 it starts is cut 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.919
 without knowing the industrial value of Japan 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.899
 the other wolf carlos 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:28.149
 we are going 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:29.579
 when mentioning 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.260
 what is the new alternative that there is about the production of coconut 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.430
 It is essential to know what 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.750
 this plant 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.830
 It serves many things between one of them is to produce 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.220
 well they say notions 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.210
 some things 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.800
 that we can prepare by pure good Hindu Canada 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.260
 to be able to reach 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.520
 all paraguay coconut production 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.170
 haarde of the year 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.549
 also 900 

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:59.460
 87 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.820
 we are with him project to cultivate rationally our 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.250
 the unknown mouth 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.740
 this plant is somewhat attended to a native plant of our country 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.230
 our Paraguayan 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.370
 only in our country is known it was separated from it little cusco peru a 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.420
 fireman already common and moral 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.880
 We are understanding this project in the conviction that 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.230
 the mouth is already 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.640
 the immediate future 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.400
 which would 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.210
 an economic income 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.510
 safe 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.430
 cheap 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.500
 easy to do for our sector and cultores 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.850
 read our Paraguay 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.850
 we have the advantage that he 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.579
 coconut summons is already a native plant therefore it is 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.050
 as a 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.870
 everything to our soils and our climate 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.260
 it's not an exotic plant so it's easy 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.360
 read who can grow the coconut in Paraguay has until today 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.170
 unfortunately it has not been done except on a small scale 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.150
 and very sporadically the act is time that memo some plantations north the 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.509
 Wye area 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:18.509
 I was here accompanied by his life leitao plus some other 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:22.989
 part of Paraguay but very well very little very small and see the amount 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.949
 of hectares ten plants 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:27.449
 cultivate up 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:31.939
 the cultivation of the mouth and we can do directly through seedlings 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.779
 pantin client is that we can pick up 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:37.499
 choosing mother plants 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:41.829
 i below the mother plants we choose then the little plants that grow 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.729
 spontaneously 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:46.289
 The ideal size for 

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:50.559
 the palates plantitas or the seedlings to collect in person that they 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:55.469
 dekker that have two leaves as we are showing doboj milestones 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.549
 bonao - look a 20 to 30 centimeters tall 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:05.469
 digging with a very deep tip shovel for love hurt especially 

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:09.579
 in the cookie that we call the coconut 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.219
 which is what we can take altered 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:16.199
 for aranda mozart to cultivate and densify our culture 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.310
 we have to see then what this cookie will not be depleted in any 

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:22.419
 moment 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:26.609
 you are after other extras against globetrotters plus pots 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:31.009
 ian paid with 50% of natural soil henao 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.739
 percent we have then when 20% of 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:38.199
 This is the cabbage of bird 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:41.359
 and cow dung 20% â€‹â€‹and a little then of 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.939
 either starts like this 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:47.469
 for example regional serry indicated 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:49.939
 after coco pericarp 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:54.290
 then for a hundred a stewardess the seedlings for new pots we go 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.779
 latina facets 

00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:57.969
 we wait three months 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:02.649
 we also put in half shade with abundant watering if possible all the 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:07.269
 days and up to twice a day as much as possible for three months 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.689
 once we reach the 8 ms we can already take to the final place 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:16.070
 where again we have the merlot under irrigation at least 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.650
 once a week 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.079
 at least as well or not another three months so that on the plants 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.159
 on the radio the Gaddafi roots reports that on the eighth floor then there 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.939
 grown up 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:29.150
 You can now 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.930
 stay osorio 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.180
 as well as the team the 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.400
 the seedlings 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.159
 we also have to know what the mother plants 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:41.029
 mother plants are those that have the best development in terms of 

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:42.150
 its soon 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.349
 that has the least possible of thorns 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.300
 the leafy that the debt leaves from the leaves 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.460
 if someone loses well developed 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.569
 the tape that is set wide 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:58.270
 island the height of the model copom in the plant more or less that has 1 8 meters 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.810
 pickett of him photo has to be uniform of a size of more or less 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:06.689
 35 to 40 millimeters in diameter 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:10.439
 and those are the mother plants that best adapt then 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:11.339
 for what 

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:14.800
 the seedlings below are useful for our 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.839
 draft 

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:17.879
 culture 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:21.770
 the crop that we are going to make these percent and ideal 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.659
 so that it is that of farmers who have 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:29.270
 no more than five hectares all those ministers a daily as 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.379
 because the 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:33.180
 is what the coconut is a plant that 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.490
 hood does not take up much space idc you can take advantage 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.310
 the land 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.949
 where he shakes the coconut for 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:41.270
 to have crops 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.290
 associates 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.440
 with other items, for example the bean, as in this case cassava or 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.189
 can be 

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:49.370
 the swimmer left 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.889
 it can be corn 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:53.460
 all any 2d consumer product 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.910
 You can make use of idc completed in the same plot 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:03.620
 that our focus happened to him then I like that the terrain is clean 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.190
 there was no dislike doubt that both weeds compete 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.690
 then it appears 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.570
 the associated crop we can always maintain 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.970
 our coconut tree with eight as such 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.970
 cleansed 

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:36.239
 and incipient bloc
