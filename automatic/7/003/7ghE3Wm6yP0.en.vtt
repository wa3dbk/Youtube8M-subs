00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.840 

I've<00:00:00.539> been<00:00:00.719> asked<00:00:00.989> over<00:00:01.170> and<00:00:01.350> over<00:00:01.530> again<00:00:01.850> what

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
I've been asked over and over again what

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.930 
I've been asked over and over again what
is<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.030> difference<00:00:03.600> between<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:04.670> blender<00:00:05.670> and

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
is the difference between a blender and

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.450 
is the difference between a blender and
a<00:00:06.540> food<00:00:06.779> processor<00:00:07.440> when<00:00:07.859> it<00:00:07.980> comes<00:00:08.220> to

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
a food processor when it comes to

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.330 
a food processor when it comes to
actually<00:00:09.120> processing<00:00:09.870> food<00:00:10.200> so<00:00:10.950> I<00:00:10.980> thought

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
actually processing food so I thought

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.980 
actually processing food so I thought
I'd<00:00:11.460> take<00:00:11.580> some<00:00:11.639> time<00:00:12.120> to<00:00:12.330> explain<00:00:12.750> and

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
I'd take some time to explain and

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.330 
I'd take some time to explain and
actually<00:00:13.259> show<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.920> difference<00:00:14.280> between

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
actually show the difference between

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.689 
actually show the difference between
these<00:00:14.820> two<00:00:15.059> machines<00:00:15.859> now<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.920> permit<00:00:17.550> we'll

these two machines now the permit we'll

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.290 
these two machines now the permit we'll
start<00:00:17.970> with<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:19.170> by<00:00:19.500> far<00:00:19.770> our<00:00:20.300> most

blades are going at high velocity and
that<00:00:52.260> means<00:00:52.500> even<00:00:53.010> if<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> blades<00:00:53.430> aren't

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
that means even if the blades aren't

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.729 
that means even if the blades aren't
super<00:00:54.180> sharp<00:00:54.510> they're<00:00:55.110> still<00:00:55.289> going<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.530> break

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
super sharp they're still going to break

down anything that you can care to put

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.760 
down anything that you can care to put
in<00:00:57.750> there<00:00:58.340> all<00:00:59.340> right<00:01:00.050> the<00:01:01.050> power<00:01:01.289> mill<00:01:01.559> comes

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
in there all right the power mill comes

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.119 
in there all right the power mill comes
with<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> two-year<00:01:02.550> warranty<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.890> it's<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
with a two-year warranty and it's a

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.700 
with a two-year warranty and it's a
polycarbonate<00:01:06.030> jug<00:01:06.420> which<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.409> non

polycarbonate jug which is a non
leeching<00:01:08.130> polycarbonate<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.150> it's<00:01:09.390> fairly

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
leeching polycarbonate so it's fairly

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.480 
leeching polycarbonate so it's fairly
indestructible<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.710> drop<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.430> a

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
indestructible you can drop it on a

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.120 
indestructible you can drop it on a
concrete<00:01:12.000> floor<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.450> it'll<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.780> bounce<00:01:13.130> so

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
concrete floor and it'll just bounce so

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.179 
concrete floor and it'll just bounce so
that's<00:01:14.460> another<00:01:14.729> feature<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:15.840> got

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
that's another feature of it it's got

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:22.160 
that's another feature of it it's got
the<00:01:17.189> blades<00:01:17.520> if<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.030> can<00:01:18.180> see<00:01:19.130> in<00:01:20.130> there<00:01:21.170> it's

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
the blades if you can see in there it's

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.620 
the blades if you can see in there it's
got<00:01:22.290> four<00:01:22.560> blades<00:01:22.770> angled<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.369> different<00:01:24.210> on

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
got four blades angled that different on

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.899 
got four blades angled that different on
different<00:01:25.049> angles<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:26.400> especially

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
different angles and it's especially

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.990 
different angles and it's especially
designed<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.840> really<00:01:28.500> puree<00:01:29.159> things<00:01:29.549> really

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
designed to really puree things really

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.780 
designed to really puree things really
break<00:01:30.360> things<00:01:30.600> down<00:01:30.720> for<00:01:31.590> instance<00:01:31.920> if<00:01:32.520> you

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
break things down for instance if you

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.870 
break things down for instance if you
were<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.000> drop<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.270> date<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.840> there<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.880> you

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
were to drop a date in there and you

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.039 
were to drop a date in there and you
forgot<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.840> take<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.650> seed<00:01:37.890> out<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:39.840> date

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
forgot to take the seed out the date

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.800 
forgot to take the seed out the date
seed<00:01:40.380> would<00:01:40.619> end<00:01:40.799> up<00:01:40.950> being<00:01:41.250> broken<00:01:41.610> down

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
seed would end up being broken down

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.859 
seed would end up being broken down
eventually<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.259> pureed<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.250> there

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
eventually and pureed in there

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.960 
eventually and pureed in there
now<00:01:45.869> if<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.649> were<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.770> put<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.040> date<00:01:47.280> seed<00:01:47.640> say

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
now if you were to put a date seed say

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.230 
now if you were to put a date seed say
into<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> food<00:01:48.570> processor<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.710> meji<00:01:50.009> mix

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
into a food processor like the meji mix

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.510 
into a food processor like the meji mix
5200<00:01:51.240> what<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.840> find<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> date<00:01:52.619> seed<00:01:53.250> gets

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
5200 what I find is the date seed gets

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.730 
5200 what I find is the date seed gets
stuck<00:01:53.790> onto<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.240> blade<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.380> doesn't<00:01:55.680> get

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
stuck onto the blade and it doesn't get

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.550 
stuck onto the blade and it doesn't get
broken<00:01:56.040> down<00:01:56.189> so<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.420> primary<00:01:58.229> difference

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
broken down so a primary difference

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.380 
broken down so a primary difference
between<00:01:58.680> these<00:01:59.070> two<00:01:59.280> machines<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.030> this

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
between these two machines is this this

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.899 
between these two machines is this this
purees<00:02:00.960> things<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:01.439> really<00:02:01.890> breaks<00:02:02.579> through

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
purees things this really breaks through

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.929 
purees things this really breaks through
fiber<00:02:03.299> breaks<00:02:04.020> things<00:02:04.290> down<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.939> this

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
fiber breaks things down and this

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.930 
fiber breaks things down and this
machine<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.229> similar<00:02:07.740> power<00:02:07.950> it's<00:02:08.190> 1100

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
machine is a similar power it's 1100

watt induction motor it's an industrial
motor<00:02:11.580> in<00:02:11.849> this<00:02:12.000> it's<00:02:12.270> like<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.540> rolls-royce

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
motor in this it's like the rolls-royce

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.670 
motor in this it's like the rolls-royce
of

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
of

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.869 
of
of<00:02:13.920> food<00:02:14.250> processors<00:02:16.010> but<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.400> spinning<00:02:17.700> at

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
of food processors but it is spinning at

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.210 
of food processors but it is spinning at
a<00:02:17.939> much<00:02:18.180> it's<00:02:18.390> geared<00:02:18.689> at<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:18.989> slower<00:02:19.650> speed<00:02:19.799> so

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
a much it's geared at a slower speed so

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.670 
a much it's geared at a slower speed so
the<00:02:20.459> blade<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:20.909> spinning<00:02:21.360> at<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.720> much<00:02:21.930> lower

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
the blade is spinning at a much lower

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.039 
the blade is spinning at a much lower

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
velocity now the magic's 5200 comes with

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.920 
velocity now the magic's 5200 comes with
a<00:02:28.079> 10<00:02:28.470> year<00:02:28.950> warranty<00:02:29.099> on<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.790> motor<00:02:29.970> so<00:02:30.629> it

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
a 10 year warranty on the motor so it

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.780 
a 10 year warranty on the motor so it
really<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.379> the<00:02:31.530> rolls-royce<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:32.310> they<00:02:32.459> they

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
really is the rolls-royce and they they

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.580 
really is the rolls-royce and they they
stand<00:02:33.120> behind<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.540> product<00:02:33.959> it's<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.349> best

what<00:02:58.019> we<00:02:58.170> do<00:02:58.349> find<00:02:58.590> is<00:02:58.799> it's<00:02:58.980> better<00:02:59.159> for

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
what we do find is it's better for

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.819 
what we do find is it's better for
mixing<00:02:59.879> if<00:03:00.780> you're<00:03:00.989> just<00:03:01.109> wanting<00:03:01.439> to<00:03:01.470> say

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
mixing if you're just wanting to say

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.339 
mixing if you're just wanting to say
grind<00:03:02.459> some<00:03:02.939> breaks<00:03:03.359> and<00:03:03.599> nuts<00:03:03.810> down<00:03:04.049> but<00:03:04.290> you

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
grind some breaks and nuts down but you

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.690 
grind some breaks and nuts down but you
don't<00:03:04.409> want<00:03:04.709> them<00:03:04.829> pureed<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:05.400> want<00:03:05.579> them

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
don't want them pureed you want them

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.910 
don't want them pureed you want them
still<00:03:05.939> lumpy<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:06.810> can<00:03:06.989> pulse<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.739> you've

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
still lumpy you can pulse it and you've

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.099 
still lumpy you can pulse it and you've
got<00:03:08.069> more<00:03:08.250> control<00:03:08.489> over<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:09.180> consistency<00:03:10.079> of

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
got more control over the consistency of

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.670 
got more control over the consistency of
something<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:10.849> while<00:03:11.849> they<00:03:12.120> do<00:03:12.260> overlap<00:03:13.260> like

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
something so while they do overlap like

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.460 
something so while they do overlap like
you<00:03:13.859> can<00:03:14.129> do<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:14.939> can<00:03:15.150> puree<00:03:15.510> things<00:03:15.840> in<00:03:16.079> here

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
you can do you can puree things in here

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.979 
you can do you can puree things in here
you<00:03:17.159> won't<00:03:17.340> get<00:03:17.609> it<00:03:17.730> as<00:03:17.879> fine<00:03:18.150> or<00:03:18.359> creamy<00:03:18.660> as<00:03:18.840> in

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
you won't get it as fine or creamy as in

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.839 
you won't get it as fine or creamy as in
here<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:19.379> if<00:03:19.739> you're<00:03:19.859> trying<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.190> say<00:03:20.340> get

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
here and if you're trying to say get

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.240 
here and if you're trying to say get
some<00:03:21.060> nuts<00:03:21.269> into<00:03:21.569> an<00:03:21.780> even<00:03:22.590> but<00:03:22.769> crunchy

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
some nuts into an even but crunchy

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.789 
some nuts into an even but crunchy
texture<00:03:23.790> broken<00:03:24.299> down<00:03:24.480> into<00:03:24.750> pieces<00:03:25.019> this

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
texture broken down into pieces this

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.349 
texture broken down into pieces this
will<00:03:26.040> puree<00:03:26.340> out<00:03:26.579> whether<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:26.910> like<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.120> or

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
will puree out whether you like it or

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.420 
will puree out whether you like it or
not<00:03:27.510> I<00:03:27.569> mean<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.109> the<00:03:28.440> blades<00:03:28.949> are<00:03:29.099> just<00:03:29.220> going

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
not I mean the the blades are just going

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.119 
not I mean the the blades are just going
too<00:03:29.639> fast<00:03:29.849> all<00:03:30.810> right<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:31.230> let's<00:03:31.470> actually<00:03:31.680> put

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
too fast all right so let's actually put

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.809 
too fast all right so let's actually put
this<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.549> the<00:03:32.579> test<00:03:32.900> so<00:03:34.430> one<00:03:35.430> of<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.609> main

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
this to the test so one of the main

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.479 
this to the test so one of the main
things<00:03:36.090> we<00:03:36.180> use<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:37.290> food<00:03:37.530> processor<00:03:37.560> for<00:03:38.280> the

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
things we use the food processor for the

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.420 
things we use the food processor for the
power<00:03:38.699> mill<00:03:38.970> is<00:03:39.180> green<00:03:39.959> smoothies<00:03:40.500> especially

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
power mill is green smoothies especially

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.180 
power mill is green smoothies especially
because<00:03:41.609> it's<00:03:42.599> so<00:03:42.930> effective<00:03:43.169> breaking<00:03:44.040> down

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
because it's so effective breaking down

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.159 
because it's so effective breaking down
the<00:03:44.310> fiber<00:03:44.579> in<00:03:44.819> greens<00:03:45.150> so<00:03:45.750> we're<00:03:45.959> going<00:03:46.079> to

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
the fiber in greens so we're going to

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:47.899 
the fiber in greens so we're going to
demonstrate<00:03:46.319> a<00:03:46.650> green<00:03:46.919> smoothie<00:03:47.069> right<00:03:47.639> here

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
demonstrate a green smoothie right here

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:49.819 
demonstrate a green smoothie right here
and<00:03:48.060> now<00:03:48.209> in<00:03:48.449> both<00:03:48.750> these<00:03:48.900> machines<00:03:49.109> we're

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
and now in both these machines we're

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.159 
and now in both these machines we're
going<00:03:49.949> to<00:03:50.010> exactly<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.729> same<00:03:50.940> ingredients<00:03:51.569> so

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
going to exactly the same ingredients so

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.250 
going to exactly the same ingredients so
here<00:03:52.440> we've<00:03:52.590> got<00:03:52.799> some<00:03:53.340> banana<00:03:53.669> pineapple

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
here we've got some banana pineapple

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.729 
here we've got some banana pineapple
some<00:03:55.260> tamarillo<00:03:56.389> passion<00:03:57.389> fruit<00:03:57.680> this<00:03:58.680> is

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
some tamarillo passion fruit this is

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.379 
some tamarillo passion fruit this is
actually<00:03:59.129> a<00:03:59.159> broccoli<00:03:59.519> leaf<00:03:59.879> highly

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
actually a broccoli leaf highly

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.420 
actually a broccoli leaf highly
nutritious<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:01.079> a<00:04:01.169> spinach<00:04:01.500> leaf<00:04:01.709> so<00:04:02.220> let's

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
nutritious and a spinach leaf so let's

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:11.490 
nutritious and a spinach leaf so let's
try<00:04:02.699> this

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.140 

and<00:04:12.500> tamarillos<00:04:13.100> have<00:04:13.280> quite<00:04:13.550> tough<00:04:13.910> little

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
and tamarillos have quite tough little

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.449 
and tamarillos have quite tough little
seeds<00:04:14.510> and<00:04:14.750> I<00:04:14.810> think<00:04:15.110> the<00:04:15.290> magic<00:04:15.470> mix<00:04:15.800> is<00:04:16.310> going

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
seeds and I think the magic mix is going

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:17.940 
seeds and I think the magic mix is going
to<00:04:16.610> have<00:04:16.700> trouble<00:04:16.880> breaking<00:04:17.239> them<00:04:17.570> down

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
to have trouble breaking them down

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.170 
to have trouble breaking them down
though<00:04:18.950> I<00:04:18.980> think<00:04:19.130> the<00:04:19.400> power<00:04:19.610> will<00:04:19.880> have<00:04:20.000> no

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
though I think the power will have no

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:28.180 
though I think the power will have no
trouble<00:04:23.200> that's<00:04:24.200> my<00:04:24.380> guess<00:04:24.590> anyway<00:04:27.190> alright

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
trouble that's my guess anyway alright

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.030 
trouble that's my guess anyway alright
and<00:04:28.430> then<00:04:28.520> we've<00:04:28.670> got<00:04:28.820> our<00:04:28.850> greens<00:04:29.830> and<00:04:30.830> to<00:04:30.890> put

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
and then we've got our greens and to put

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.860 
and then we've got our greens and to put
stalks<00:04:31.370> and<00:04:31.550> all<00:04:31.670> in<00:04:31.820> to<00:04:31.970> really<00:04:32.300> put<00:04:32.480> both

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
stalks and all in to really put both

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.950 
stalks and all in to really put both
these<00:04:33.020> machines<00:04:33.200> to<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:33.800> test<00:04:34.100> and<00:04:34.750> I'll<00:04:35.750> put

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
these machines to the test and I'll put

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.760 
these machines to the test and I'll put
in<00:04:36.170> exactly<00:04:36.830> one<00:04:37.100> glass<00:04:37.310> of<00:04:37.520> water<00:04:38.620> and<00:04:39.620> we're

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
in exactly one glass of water and we're

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.260 
in exactly one glass of water and we're
going<00:04:39.890> to<00:04:39.920> do<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:40.190> same<00:04:40.370> now<00:04:40.640> on<00:04:40.790> the<00:04:40.880> magic

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
going to do the same now on the magic

00:04:41.270 --> 00:05:07.370 
going to do the same now on the magic
mix<00:04:42.400> and<00:04:43.400> here<00:04:44.150> we<00:04:44.270> go

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.110 

okay<00:05:08.380> so<00:05:08.440> we<00:05:08.680> just<00:05:08.710> had<00:05:09.070> those<00:05:09.250> blending<00:05:09.790> for

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
okay so we just had those blending for

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.570 
okay so we just had those blending for
about<00:05:10.540> one<00:05:10.810> minute<00:05:11.050> so<00:05:11.860> let's<00:05:12.100> take<00:05:12.310> a<00:05:12.340> look

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
about one minute so let's take a look

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.670 
about one minute so let's take a look
and<00:05:12.700> see<00:05:12.820> what<00:05:12.940> the<00:05:13.030> difference<00:05:13.390> is<00:05:13.600> we'll<00:05:14.470> try

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
and see what the difference is we'll try

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.750 
and see what the difference is we'll try
the<00:05:14.740> taste<00:05:15.070> test<00:05:16.740> so<00:05:17.740> this<00:05:17.980> is<00:05:18.160> from<00:05:18.370> the<00:05:18.520> power

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
the taste test so this is from the power

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.420 
the taste test so this is from the power
mill<00:05:19.260> looking<00:05:20.260> nice<00:05:20.470> and<00:05:20.770> creamy

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.040 

the<00:05:24.430> magic<00:05:24.790> mix<00:05:24.970> I<00:05:25.090> can<00:05:25.240> straightaway<00:05:25.690> see

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
the magic mix I can straightaway see

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.080 
the magic mix I can straightaway see
there's<00:05:26.350> chunks<00:05:26.680> of<00:05:26.950> green<00:05:27.130> in<00:05:27.460> there<00:05:27.640> which

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
there's chunks of green in there which

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.420 
there's chunks of green in there which
is<00:05:28.120> what<00:05:28.480> we're<00:05:29.140> trying<00:05:29.410> to<00:05:29.650> avoid<00:05:29.980> in<00:05:30.160> a<00:05:30.220> green

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
is what we're trying to avoid in a green

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.190 
is what we're trying to avoid in a green
smoothie<00:05:30.610> part<00:05:31.450> of<00:05:31.540> the<00:05:31.600> idea<00:05:31.870> of<00:05:31.960> a<00:05:32.020> green

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
smoothie part of the idea of a green

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.650 
smoothie part of the idea of a green
smoothie<00:05:32.350> is<00:05:32.710> that<00:05:32.890> the<00:05:33.010> Greens<00:05:33.280> of<00:05:33.520> the<00:05:34.420> cell

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
smoothie is that the Greens of the cell

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.300 
smoothie is that the Greens of the cell
walls<00:05:34.930> are<00:05:35.140> actually<00:05:35.230> broken<00:05:35.740> down<00:05:36.070> to

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
walls are actually broken down to

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.250 
walls are actually broken down to
release<00:05:36.520> the<00:05:36.580> nutrition<00:05:37.360> and<00:05:37.690> apart<00:05:38.200> from

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
release the nutrition and apart from

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.840 
release the nutrition and apart from
that<00:05:38.440> it's<00:05:38.620> just<00:05:38.800> not<00:05:38.980> so<00:05:39.190> much<00:05:39.220> fun<00:05:39.640> when

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
that it's just not so much fun when

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:40.950 
that it's just not so much fun when
you're<00:05:39.970> drinking<00:05:40.150> a<00:05:40.360> smoothie<00:05:40.450> and<00:05:40.750> getting

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
you're drinking a smoothie and getting

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.600 
you're drinking a smoothie and getting
bits<00:05:41.140> of<00:05:41.290> bitter<00:05:41.500> greens<00:05:41.830> if<00:05:42.070> it's<00:05:42.220> not<00:05:42.370> you

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
bits of bitter greens if it's not you

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:53.040 
bits of bitter greens if it's not you
know<00:05:42.730> fully<00:05:42.940> blended<00:05:43.330> in<00:05:51.450> alright<00:05:52.450> so<00:05:52.660> this<00:05:52.840> is

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
know fully blended in alright so this is

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.890 
know fully blended in alright so this is
the<00:05:53.230> power<00:05:53.590> meal<00:05:53.890> smoothie<00:05:54.640> and<00:05:54.880> it's<00:05:55.690> quite

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
the power meal smoothie and it's quite

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.170 
the power meal smoothie and it's quite
clear<00:05:56.200> that<00:05:56.290> you<00:05:57.190> know<00:05:57.310> you<00:05:57.370> can<00:05:57.670> barely<00:05:57.910> see

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
clear that you know you can barely see

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.790 
clear that you know you can barely see
any<00:05:58.330> flecks<00:05:58.660> of<00:05:58.810> green<00:05:58.990> in<00:05:59.230> there<00:05:59.380> it's<00:05:59.530> fairly

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
any flecks of green in there it's fairly

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.370 
any flecks of green in there it's fairly
consistent<00:06:00.270> now<00:06:01.270> looking<00:06:01.570> at<00:06:01.630> the<00:06:01.750> magic<00:06:01.930> mix

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
consistent now looking at the magic mix

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.650 
consistent now looking at the magic mix
there's<00:06:03.190> still<00:06:03.460> big<00:06:03.670> chunks<00:06:04.030> of<00:06:04.120> green<00:06:04.420> and

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.660 
there's still big chunks of green and

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.390 
there's still big chunks of green and
now<00:06:04.750> it<00:06:04.810> hasn't<00:06:05.080> broken<00:06:05.440> down<00:06:05.740> the<00:06:05.950> smoothie

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
now it hasn't broken down the smoothie

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:14.370 
now it hasn't broken down the smoothie
to<00:06:06.580> the<00:06:06.940> same<00:06:07.150> extent<00:06:12.750> okay<00:06:13.750> so<00:06:13.810> that's<00:06:14.110> very

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
to the same extent okay so that's very

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:20.550 
to the same extent okay so that's very
smooth<00:06:18.120> there's<00:06:19.120> tons<00:06:19.300> of<00:06:19.510> fiber<00:06:19.720> in<00:06:19.990> that<00:06:20.200> so

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
smooth there's tons of fiber in that so

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.980 
smooth there's tons of fiber in that so
if<00:06:21.130> you<00:06:21.280> like<00:06:21.460> fibre<00:06:21.760> go<00:06:22.390> for<00:06:22.600> them<00:06:22.720> add<00:06:22.840> you

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
if you like fibre go for them add you

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.170 
if you like fibre go for them add you
mix<00:06:23.200> if<00:06:23.740> you<00:06:23.860> like<00:06:24.010> it's<00:06:24.190> smooth<00:06:24.430> this<00:06:24.880> is<00:06:24.940> the

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
mix if you like it's smooth this is the

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.360 
mix if you like it's smooth this is the
one
