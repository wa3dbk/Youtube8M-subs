he caught him and shot behind the line
very<00:03:10.050> well<00:03:11.330> but<00:03:12.330> you<00:03:12.480> had<00:03:12.570> taken<00:03:12.870> 14<00:03:13.230> so<00:03:14.220> before

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
very well but you had taken 14 so before

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.620 
very well but you had taken 14 so before
the<00:03:14.580> game<00:03:14.730> you<00:03:14.850> kind<00:03:15.030> of<00:03:15.060> said<00:03:15.239> you'd<00:03:15.390> have<00:03:15.510> to

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
the game you kind of said you'd have to

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.860 
the game you kind of said you'd have to
see<00:03:15.810> how<00:03:16.050> Kobe<00:03:16.320> be<00:03:16.830> able<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.100> go<00:03:17.220> on

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.840 

he<00:03:22.870> was<00:03:23.020> I<00:03:23.050> think<00:03:23.560> when<00:03:23.680> he<00:03:23.770> was<00:03:23.950> warming<00:03:24.550> the

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
he was I think when he was warming the

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.400 
he was I think when he was warming the
first<00:03:25.090> half<00:03:25.300> you<00:03:25.750> know<00:03:25.840> if<00:03:25.960> they<00:03:26.080> just<00:03:26.200> went

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
first half you know if they just went

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.270 
first half you know if they just went
really<00:03:26.620> well<00:03:27.000> second<00:03:28.000> I<00:03:28.030> have<00:03:28.150> not<00:03:28.360> so<00:03:28.540> much

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
really well second I have not so much

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.100 
really well second I have not so much
the<00:03:30.280> four<00:03:30.550> guards<00:03:30.940> that<00:03:31.090> they<00:03:31.240> played<00:03:31.510> shot<00:03:31.900> a

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
the four guards that they played shot a

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.170 
the four guards that they played shot a
combined<00:03:32.380> sixty-four<00:03:32.980> percent<00:03:33.100> in<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:33.940> field

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
combined sixty-four percent in the field

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.730 
combined sixty-four percent in the field
and<00:03:34.420> is<00:03:34.930> that<00:03:35.110> something<00:03:35.140> you're<00:03:35.470> just<00:03:35.650> gonna

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
and is that something you're just gonna

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.950 
and is that something you're just gonna
say<00:03:36.430> is<00:03:36.490> that's<00:03:37.240> just<00:03:37.450> what<00:03:37.570> happened<00:03:37.870> it

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
say is that's just what happened it

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.800 
say is that's just what happened it
wasn't<00:03:38.080> our<00:03:38.230> defenders<00:03:38.740> or<00:03:38.970> is<00:03:39.970> there<00:03:40.330> what

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
wasn't our defenders or is there what

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.170 
wasn't our defenders or is there what
stake<00:03:41.050> is<00:03:41.230> it<00:03:41.380> that<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.650> lakers<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.790> guards

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
stake is it that the lakers the guards

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.260 
stake is it that the lakers the guards
just<00:03:43.390> didn't<00:03:43.630> take<00:03:43.750> take<00:03:44.080> care<00:03:44.260> of<00:03:44.320> business

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
just didn't take take care of business

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.449 
just didn't take take care of business
you<00:03:46.270> know<00:03:46.420> I<00:03:46.450> I<00:03:46.900> put<00:03:47.709> it<00:03:47.800> on<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.070> big<00:03:48.250> guys

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
you know I I put it on the big guys

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.060 
you know I I put it on the big guys
basically<00:03:49.150> at<00:03:49.600> halftime<00:03:49.840> not<00:03:50.590> getting<00:03:50.920> back

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
basically at halftime not getting back

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.949 
basically at halftime not getting back
in<00:03:51.130> the<00:03:51.370> paint<00:03:51.550> clothes<00:03:51.910> only<00:03:52.150> loss<00:03:52.630> of<00:03:52.930> a

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
in the paint clothes only loss of a

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.070 
in the paint clothes only loss of a
couple<00:03:53.290> times<00:03:53.500> when<00:03:53.800> he<00:03:53.890> drove<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.250> lane

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
couple times when he drove the lane

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.449 
couple times when he drove the lane
obviously<00:03:56.080> guards<00:03:56.500> try<00:03:56.709> to<00:03:56.770> stay<00:03:57.040> in<00:03:57.070> front<00:03:57.310> of

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
obviously guards try to stay in front of

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.380 
obviously guards try to stay in front of
them<00:03:57.520> but<00:03:57.790> it's<00:03:58.600> a<00:03:58.690> team<00:03:58.900> defensive

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
them but it's a team defensive

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.260 
them but it's a team defensive
responsibilities<00:04:02.430> are<00:04:03.430> big<00:04:03.730> guys<00:04:03.940> basically

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270
