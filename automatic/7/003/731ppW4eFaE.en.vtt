00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:09.720
 [Music] 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.380
 or not 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.660
 [Music] 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.230
 in this practice we will demonstrate the 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.640
 first operation of the signals 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.570
 with introns genre and more or less 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.510
 than an induction motor that we've 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.860
 exceeded the speed of the field 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.900
 rotary 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.920
 for this we have 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:37.690
 with two induction motors 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:41.159
 and physicists of four poles of 1,360 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:45.129
 revolutions per minute at 50 hertz 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:48.089
 1650 to 60 in principle we will use 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.089
 another 50 hertz 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.290
 keep in mind that this engine has 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.920
 pretty slip 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.769
 if the peoples 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.200
 one of the engines we feed it with a 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:04.520
 inverter 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:07.610
 with them we will continue to exceed 50 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.530
 hertz and so overcome the field the 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.810
 rotating field speed of 50 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.420
 hertz and the second engine that 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.190
 we will use as a generator we do not have 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.190
 mechanically coupled 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.890
 to the engine that we are going to feed 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.400
 and with this engine we have commented about 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.000
 capacitors that will serve us 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.000
 for 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.539
 eliminate it and our capacitors 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.490
 we have connected in star and to 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.909
 same time we have connected too 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.909
 a star 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.560
 three 40 watt bulbs one each 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.619
 phase 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.659
 we will use the capacitors 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:54.500
 to compensate for the current 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:57.120
 negative generator in this case a 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.190
 induction motor 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.630
 and so this reactive current is going to 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.790
 create the magnetic field needed to 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.810
 the production of 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.810
 of necessity 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.710
 how these engines have very low 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.710
 humanization 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.819
 if we start 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.720
 the motor 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.590
 but not the frequency 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.910
 we are 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.910
 at 24 discharges 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.640
 but 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.140
 [Music] 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.140
 the essential light bulbs 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.920
 this is due 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.900
 to little power 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.879
 of motor mobilization 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.580
 does not have any magnetism of 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.869
 way 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.869
 [Music] 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.630
 we stop the engine 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.630
 we light 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.980
 [Music] 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:22.200
 now we are feeding from the network 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.200
 electric light bulbs 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.280
 and the engine 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:31.690
 [Music] 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.690
 we turn on the variator 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.330
 right now we're fine 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.940
 through this line 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.860
 consuming electric current 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.860
 but we are returning it 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.000
 in fact yes 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.400
 [Music] 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:20.220
 we remove the electric current 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.220
 the light bulbs are still on 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:30.509
 continue watching 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.509
 have there 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.360
 this tension comes through one's own 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.360
 cable 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.360
 how 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.689
 plus 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:54.709
 since this current 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:54.709
 is generated 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:01.220
 [Music] 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.220
 this second motor 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.780
 of illusion 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.760
 [Music] 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:32.419
 [Music] 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:35.539
 thanks to the fantastic advantage in 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.539
 these minutes 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.809
 [Music] 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.280
 the sequence so that you overcome the field 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.840
 rotary 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:10.790
 you have to go up to 64 prices 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:14.750
 this is due to the large slip that 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:17.530
 has this engine is an engine that he does not 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.530
 it has very good performance 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.960
 so that the dilution engine can generate 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:27.550
 electric current 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.550
 they need the capacitors 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:35.500
 are the capacitors will compensate for energy 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:38.820
 reactive so that the motor 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.820
 I can have a field 

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:49.779
 once it has disappeared 

00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:49.779
 the strength with which we re-start 

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:56.460
 because he does not have 

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:01.889
 more the same 

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.629
 the rotor of this engine 

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:05.560
 and it does not produce 40 electric again 

00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:08.200
 we need 

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.410
 a first start so that we go back to 

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.410
 to have 

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:13.500
 we do not ask them
