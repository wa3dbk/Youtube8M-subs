more<00:00:53.280> interesting<00:00:53.899> but<00:00:54.899> on<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.410> one<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.620> did<00:00:55.829> a

more interesting but on this one I did a

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.220 
more interesting but on this one I did a
rolled<00:00:56.250> nylon<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.570> think<00:00:57.809> they<00:00:57.899> provide<00:00:58.199> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
rolled nylon so I think they provide a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.720 
rolled nylon so I think they provide a
little<00:00:58.440> less<00:00:58.649> hook<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.219> little<00:00:59.460> little

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
little less hook and a little little

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.209 
little less hook and a little little
little<00:01:00.030> less<00:01:00.899> tight<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.680> with<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> high

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
little less tight so with the high

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.529 
little less tight so with the high
pocket<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.730> going<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.910> be<00:01:02.969> coming<00:01:03.090> off<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.300> it
