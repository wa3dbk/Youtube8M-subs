certain cases purposely a little bit

certain cases purposely a little bit

bedroom and office I would say in

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.799 
bedroom and office I would say in
general<00:00:58.369> the<00:00:58.699> idea<00:00:58.729> of<00:00:59.030> the<00:00:59.089> bedrooms<00:00:59.479> is<00:00:59.659> that

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
general the idea of the bedrooms is that

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.869 
general the idea of the bedrooms is that
they're<00:01:00.019> for<00:01:00.229> sleeping<00:01:00.619> and<00:01:00.979> so<00:01:01.369> they're

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
they're for sleeping and so they're

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.810 
they're for sleeping and so they're
purposely<00:01:02.390> just<00:01:02.869> big<00:01:03.619> enough<00:01:03.860> to<00:01:04.250> make<00:01:04.670> it

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
purposely just big enough to make it

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.030 
purposely just big enough to make it
comfortable<00:01:05.059> for<00:01:05.330> a<00:01:05.869> normal<00:01:06.290> sized<00:01:06.470> bed<00:01:06.799> with

comfortable for a normal sized bed with
enough<00:01:07.250> room<00:01:07.490> to<00:01:07.520> circulate<00:01:08.030> around<00:01:08.119> it

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
enough room to circulate around it

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.539 
enough room to circulate around it
because<00:01:08.840> on<00:01:09.439> the<00:01:09.590> small<00:01:09.799> footprint<00:01:10.220> we<00:01:10.400> want

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
because on the small footprint we want

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.550 
because on the small footprint we want
to<00:01:10.610> have<00:01:10.729> as<00:01:10.850> much<00:01:11.150> space<00:01:11.479> as<00:01:11.540> possible<00:01:11.990> for

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
to have as much space as possible for

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:24.399 
to have as much space as possible for
the<00:01:12.770> big<00:01:12.890> rooms

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.340 

in<00:01:24.950> order<00:01:25.640> to<00:01:25.700> make<00:01:25.939> a<00:01:25.969> smallish<00:01:26.630> bedroom<00:01:27.079> feel

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
in order to make a smallish bedroom feel

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.980 
in order to make a smallish bedroom feel
bigger<00:01:27.740> than<00:01:28.430> moving<00:01:28.640> partition<00:01:29.360> solves<00:01:29.899> that

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
bigger than moving partition solves that

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.410 
bigger than moving partition solves that
great<00:01:30.259> because<00:01:30.710> at<00:01:31.310> times<00:01:31.670> it's<00:01:31.939> just<00:01:32.299> the

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
great because at times it's just the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.609 
great because at times it's just the
size<00:01:32.600> you<00:01:32.780> need<00:01:32.930> to<00:01:33.079> have<00:01:33.200> a<00:01:33.229> nice<00:01:33.380> private

that<00:03:55.380> we<00:03:55.590> could<00:03:55.739> have<00:03:55.829> had<00:03:55.980> on<00:03:56.069> the<00:03:56.160> ground

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
that we could have had on the ground

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.759 
that we could have had on the ground
floor<00:03:56.669> and<00:03:56.970> it<00:03:57.780> has<00:03:57.930> these<00:03:58.139> benefits<00:03:58.680> that

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
floor and it has these benefits that

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.620 
floor and it has these benefits that
because<00:03:59.280> it's<00:03:59.430> raised<00:03:59.760> up<00:03:59.970> from<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.359> street

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
because it's raised up from the street

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.930 
because it's raised up from the street
it's<00:04:01.230> a<00:04:01.260> lot<00:04:01.440> more<00:04:01.590> private<00:04:02.069> and<00:04:02.489> and

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
it's a lot more private and and

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.659 
it's a lot more private and and
therefore<00:04:03.599> much<00:04:04.139> more<00:04:04.169> intimate<00:04:04.769> to<00:04:04.799> the

therefore much more intimate to the

therefore much more intimate to the

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
occupants that are here you know so it

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.409

comfortable in this space it's it's a

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.490 
comfortable in this space it's it's a
precision<00:04:26.039> that<00:04:26.669> I<00:04:26.729> think<00:04:27.180> you<00:04:27.389> you<00:04:27.630> feel<00:04:28.020> more

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
precision that I think you you feel more

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.920 
precision that I think you you feel more
as<00:04:28.889> you<00:04:29.160> experience<00:04:29.669> the<00:04:29.880> building<00:04:30.210> then<00:04:30.510> then

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
as you experience the building then then

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.170 
as you experience the building then then
you<00:04:31.050> really<00:04:31.349> see<00:04:31.710> it<00:04:32.010> makes<00:04:32.310> a<00:04:32.490> difference<00:04:32.940> on

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
you really see it makes a difference on

you really see it makes a difference on
how<00:04:33.449> how<00:04:34.050> right<00:04:34.410> everything<00:04:34.949> feels

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
how how right everything feels

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
many of the decisions that were made and

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.990 
many of the decisions that were made and
so<00:04:39.840> on<00:04:39.960> but<00:04:40.620> there<00:04:41.010> were<00:04:41.130> so<00:04:41.370> many<00:04:41.460> other<00:04:41.699> neat

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
so on but there were so many other neat

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.689 
so on but there were so many other neat
ideas<00:04:42.419> that<00:04:42.750> we<00:04:42.930> came<00:04:43.440> across<00:04:43.500> that<00:04:44.340> I<00:04:44.370> had<00:04:44.610> to

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
ideas that we came across that I had to

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.490 
ideas that we came across that I had to
give<00:04:44.849> up<00:04:44.970> because<00:04:45.090> they<00:04:45.300> just<00:04:45.419> didn't<00:04:45.810> fit<00:04:46.080> and

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
give up because they just didn't fit and

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.490 
give up because they just didn't fit and
so<00:04:47.370> if<00:04:47.490> I<00:04:47.669> got<00:04:47.880> another<00:04:48.150> lot<00:04:48.419> this<00:04:48.599> size<00:04:48.870> I've

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
so if I got another lot this size I've

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.779 
so if I got another lot this size I've
got<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:49.889> head<00:04:50.039> start<00:04:50.430> because<00:04:50.490> I've<00:04:50.669> already

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
got the head start because I've already

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.610 
got the head start because I've already
got<00:04:50.910> seven<00:04:51.539> other<00:04:51.690> great<00:04:52.020> ideas<00:04:52.410> already

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
got seven other great ideas already

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.620 
got seven other great ideas already
coming<00:04:52.979> if<00:04:53.370> I<00:04:53.580> were<00:04:53.699> to<00:04:53.789> start<00:04:54.030> that<00:04:54.210> right<00:04:54.449> now

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
coming if I were to start that right now

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.060 
coming if I were to start that right now
today

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
today

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.710 
today
it<00:04:55.430> would<00:04:55.640> be<00:04:55.790> nothing<00:04:56.060> like<00:04:56.360> any<00:04:56.570> of<00:04:56.600> those

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
it would be nothing like any of those

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.760 
it would be nothing like any of those
seven<00:04:57.080> it<00:04:57.200> would<00:04:57.290> be<00:04:57.380> something<00:04:57.620> completely

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
seven it would be something completely

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:09.050 
seven it would be something completely
different<00:04:58.100> again

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.690
