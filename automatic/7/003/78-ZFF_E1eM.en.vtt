fossils have been found in North Africa
and<00:00:13.820> it<00:00:14.820> lived<00:00:15.210> around<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.900> hundred<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.800> 90

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
and it lived around a hundred to 90

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.980 
and it lived around a hundred to 90

there<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.449> still<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.019> question<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.710> whether

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
there is still this question of whether

there is still this question of whether

find other dinosaurs but Spinosaurus is
proven<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.020> be<00:00:40.230> one<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> most<00:00:40.739> interesting

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
dinosaurs that has ever been found we

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.010 
dinosaurs that has ever been found we
have<00:00:44.219> evidence<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.390> fish<00:00:45.750> eating

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
have evidence that this is a fish eating

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.049 
have evidence that this is a fish eating
dinosaur<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.250> also<00:00:47.460> likely<00:00:47.879> that

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
dinosaur and it is also likely that

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.200 
dinosaur and it is also likely that
Spinosaurus<00:00:48.739> fed<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:50.010> other<00:00:50.250> dinosaurs<00:00:50.969> that

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
Spinosaurus fed on other dinosaurs that

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.549 
Spinosaurus fed on other dinosaurs that
lived<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.660> air<00:00:51.899> view<00:00:52.110> but<00:00:52.350> with<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
that Spinosaurus could possibly growth

that Spinosaurus could possibly growth
17<00:00:57.030> metres<00:00:57.510> long<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.620> absolutely

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
17 metres long that is absolutely

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.520 
17 metres long that is absolutely
amazing<00:00:59.750> even<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.840> little<00:01:01.050> bits<00:01:01.350> of

Spinosaurus have been found there is
still<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.170> lot<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.439> don't<00:01:04.619> know<00:01:04.920> about<00:01:05.010> this

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
still a lot we don't know about this

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.950 
still a lot we don't know about this
dinosaur<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.240> we<00:01:06.330> are<00:01:06.479> still<00:01:06.810> waiting

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
dinosaur and we are still waiting

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.620 
dinosaur and we are still waiting
together<00:01:07.500> skeleton<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.820> animal<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.420> is

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
together skeleton of this animal that is

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.160 
together skeleton of this animal that is
fairly<00:01:10.140> complete<00:01:10.740> but<00:01:11.670> for<00:01:11.939> now<00:01:12.119> even<00:01:13.020> though

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
fairly complete but for now even though

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.840 
fairly complete but for now even though
we<00:01:13.350> are<00:01:13.500> learning<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:14.070> lot<00:01:14.280> about<00:01:14.340> this

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
we are learning a lot about this

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.960 
we are learning a lot about this
dinosaur<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.979> still<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.400> one<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.850> most

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
dinosaur it still is one of the most

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.480 
dinosaur it still is one of the most
mysterious<00:01:18.530> dinosaurs<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.979> has<00:01:20.100> ever<00:01:20.340> been

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
mysterious dinosaurs that has ever been

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.090 
mysterious dinosaurs that has ever been
discovered<00:01:21.020> but<00:01:22.020> one<00:01:22.259> thing<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.710> thought<00:01:23.070> I

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
discovered but one thing I thought I

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.490 
discovered but one thing I thought I
would<00:01:23.250> clear<00:01:23.610> up<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.630> some<00:01:24.869> people<00:01:25.290> say

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
would clear up is that some people say

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.380 
would clear up is that some people say
that<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.950> Spinosaurus<00:01:26.790> chief<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.150> hollow

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
that the Spinosaurus chief is hollow

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.319 
that the Spinosaurus chief is hollow
inside<00:01:27.689> but<00:01:28.470> actually<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.189> isn't<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:30.150> reason

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
inside but actually it isn't the reason

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.990 
inside but actually it isn't the reason
why<00:01:30.720> people<00:01:31.290> think<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.920> Spinosaurus<00:01:32.369> t4

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
why people think that Spinosaurus t4

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.580 
why people think that Spinosaurus t4
hollow<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.420> because<00:01:33.810> at<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.049> base<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
hollow is because at the base of the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.030 
hollow is because at the base of the
teeth<00:01:34.860> there<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.670> space<00:01:36.030> where<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.590> teeth

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
teeth there is space where the teeth

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.190 
teeth there is space where the teeth
that<00:01:38.340> would<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.610> been<00:01:38.670> underneath<00:01:39.200> would

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
that would have been underneath would

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.289 
that would have been underneath would
have<00:01:40.409> replaced<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:41.310> too<00:01:41.610> when<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.180> became

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
have replaced this too when it became

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.080 
have replaced this too when it became
damaged<00:01:43.049> we<00:01:44.009> have<00:01:44.220> also<00:01:44.670> learned<00:01:44.970> that

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
damaged we have also learned that

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.539 
damaged we have also learned that
Spinosaurus<00:01:45.659> wasn't<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.619> only<00:01:46.799> predator

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
Spinosaurus wasn't the only predator

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.380 
Spinosaurus wasn't the only predator
that<00:01:48.180> lived<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.899> its<00:01:49.229> environment<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.790> it

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
that lived in its environment and so it

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.149 
that lived in its environment and so it
would<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:51.869> been<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.049> contemporary<00:01:52.950> with

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
would have been a contemporary with

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.910 
would have been a contemporary with
dinosaurs<00:01:53.700> like<00:01:54.229> carcharodontosaurus<00:01:55.229> so

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
dinosaurs like carcharodontosaurus so

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.969 
dinosaurs like carcharodontosaurus so
like<00:01:56.490> today<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.390> Africa<00:01:58.049> where<00:01:58.259> lions<00:01:58.829> are

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
like today in Africa where lions are

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.399 
like today in Africa where lions are
contemporaries<00:01:59.759> with<00:02:00.030> hyenas<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.840> tutors

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
contemporaries with hyenas and tutors

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.859 
contemporaries with hyenas and tutors
and<00:02:01.560> leopards<00:02:02.040> perhaps<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.329> age<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.750> the
