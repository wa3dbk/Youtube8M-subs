this so let's just get right into it we
can<00:00:14.940> go<00:00:15.420> over<00:00:15.450> initial<00:00:16.170> impressions<00:00:23.779> some

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
can go over initial impressions some

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:33.080 
can go over initial impressions some
stickers<00:00:25.199> cube<00:00:27.380> card<00:00:28.699> cards<00:00:30.920> so<00:00:31.920> let's<00:00:32.579> check

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
stickers cube card cards so let's check

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:41.810 
stickers cube card cards so let's check
out<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.270> cube<00:00:33.630> here<00:00:40.010> box<00:00:41.010> doesn't<00:00:41.340> matter<00:00:41.640> to

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
out the cube here box doesn't matter to

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:55.069 
out the cube here box doesn't matter to
me<00:00:45.739> okay<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.190> here<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:53.660> it's<00:00:54.660> pretty<00:00:54.960> small

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
me okay so here it is it's pretty small

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.439 
me okay so here it is it's pretty small
i<00:00:55.289> actually<00:00:55.980> i've<00:00:56.160> tried<00:00:56.460> one<00:00:56.699> before<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:57.239> i

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
i actually i've tried one before this i

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.330 
i actually i've tried one before this i
this<00:00:57.480> has<00:00:57.899> been<00:00:58.050> sitting<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:58.379> my<00:00:58.469> mailbox<00:00:58.739> for

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
this has been sitting in my mailbox for

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.790 
this has been sitting in my mailbox for
like<00:01:00.210> 10<00:01:00.539> days<00:01:00.570> i<00:01:00.960> was<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.170> my<00:01:01.260> girlfriend's

like 10 days i was in my girlfriend's

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.759 
like 10 days i was in my girlfriend's
house<00:01:01.949> for<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> while<00:01:03.049> but<00:01:04.049> while<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.260> was<00:01:04.409> there

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
house for a while but while I was there

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.130 
house for a while but while I was there
I<00:01:04.830> had<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.159> cube<00:01:05.519> or<00:01:05.640> stop<00:01:06.330> by<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.689> visit<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.049> I

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
I had a cube or stop by and visit and I

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.740 
I had a cube or stop by and visit and I
got<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.409> try<00:01:07.590> his<00:01:07.770> for<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> bit<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.750> it's

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
got to try his for a bit and it's

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.260 
got to try his for a bit and it's
smaller<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.650> mean<00:01:10.979> that's<00:01:11.729> what<00:01:11.880> it's<00:01:12.000> meant<00:01:12.119> to

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
smaller I mean that's what it's meant to

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.880 
smaller I mean that's what it's meant to
be<00:01:12.299> it's<00:01:12.990> not<00:01:13.170> really<00:01:13.380> supposed<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.770> be

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
be it's not really supposed to be

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.710 
be it's not really supposed to be
anything<00:01:14.159> different<00:01:14.700> it's<00:01:14.880> really<00:01:15.509> just

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
anything different it's really just

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.460 
anything different it's really just
supposed<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.140> be<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> smaller<00:01:16.650> I'll<00:01:17.640> sue<00:01:18.439> but<00:01:19.439> I

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
supposed to be a smaller I'll sue but I

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.350 
supposed to be a smaller I'll sue but I
think<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.799> will<00:01:20.070> help<00:01:20.220> with<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.729> three<00:01:21.240> by

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
think that will help with the three by

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.960 
think that will help with the three by
three<00:01:21.600> stage<00:01:21.810> just<00:01:22.320> due<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.400> outer<00:01:23.640> layers

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
three stage just due to the outer layers

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.929 
three stage just due to the outer layers
being<00:01:24.360> easier<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.930> turn<00:01:25.430> but<00:01:26.430> out<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.759> box

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
being easier to turn but out of the box

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.210 
being easier to turn but out of the box
it's<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.630> like<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:28.140> regular<00:01:28.590> house<00:01:28.860> ooh<00:01:29.040> it's

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
it's just like a regular house ooh it's

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.330 
it's just like a regular house ooh it's
very<00:01:29.460> dry<00:01:29.820> feels<00:01:30.780> like<00:01:30.930> there's<00:01:31.170> some<00:01:31.350> stock

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
very dry feels like there's some stock

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.749 
very dry feels like there's some stock
lube<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> cube<00:01:33.320> so<00:01:34.320> off<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.979> break<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.670> and

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
lube in the cube so off to break it and

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.230 
lube in the cube so off to break it and
clean<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.090> out<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.479> whatnot<00:01:37.079> but<00:01:37.920> um<00:01:38.240> yeah

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
clean that out and whatnot but um yeah

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.510 
clean that out and whatnot but um yeah
this<00:01:39.600> out<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.470> box<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.860> just<00:01:41.130> like<00:01:41.310> a

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
this out of the box is just like a

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.770 
this out of the box is just like a
regular<00:01:43.340> I'll<00:01:44.340> sue<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.790> mean<00:01:45.030> can't<00:01:45.630> really

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
regular I'll sue I mean can't really

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.170 
regular I'll sue I mean can't really
expect<00:01:46.049> anything<00:01:46.200> different<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:47.030> just<00:01:48.030> as<00:01:48.149> a

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
expect anything different but just as a

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.179 
expect anything different but just as a
quick<00:01:48.420> size<00:01:48.780> comparison<00:01:49.500> if<00:01:49.680> you're<00:01:49.950> curious

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
quick size comparison if you're curious

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.429 
quick size comparison if you're curious
here<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:51.259> regular<00:01:52.670> four<00:01:53.670> by<00:01:53.820> four<00:01:54.090> or<00:01:54.439> a

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
here is a regular four by four or a

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.980 
here is a regular four by four or a
regular<00:01:56.369> I'll<00:01:56.670> sue<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.270> can<00:01:57.390> kind<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.630> see<00:01:57.689> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
regular I'll sue you can kind of see the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.679 
regular I'll sue you can kind of see the
size<00:01:58.350> difference<00:01:58.380> there<00:01:58.920> it's<00:01:59.729> really<00:02:00.060> pretty

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
size difference there it's really pretty

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.230 
size difference there it's really pretty
like<00:02:01.680> it's<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.159> minuscule<00:02:02.700> difference<00:02:03.030> but<00:02:03.210> it

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
like it's a minuscule difference but it

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.170 
like it's a minuscule difference but it
does<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.780> when<00:02:04.380> I'm<00:02:04.500> solving<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:05.040> does<00:02:05.399> feel

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
does I when I'm solving it does feel

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.490 
does I when I'm solving it does feel
like<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.420> makes<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.689> difference<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.350> outer

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
like it makes a difference the outer

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.639 
like it makes a difference the outer
layers<00:02:07.799> are<00:02:07.979> much<00:02:08.129> easier<00:02:08.160> for<00:02:08.700> me<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.649> handle

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
layers are much easier for me to handle

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.050 
layers are much easier for me to handle
and<00:02:10.920> use

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
and use

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.910 
and use
so<00:02:12.360> I'm<00:02:12.840> going<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.110> break<00:02:13.260> this<00:02:13.440> in<00:02:13.650> for<00:02:13.860> a

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
so I'm going to break this in for a

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.770 
so I'm going to break this in for a
little<00:02:14.040> while<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.520> then<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.239> will<00:02:15.300> come<00:02:15.599> back

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
little while and then I will come back

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.960 
little while and then I will come back
with<00:02:16.020> a<00:02:16.080> review<00:02:16.470> hopefully<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.489> review<00:02:17.819> will

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
with a review hopefully the review will

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.479 
with a review hopefully the review will
be<00:02:18.030> out<00:02:18.390> pretty<00:02:19.170> quickly<00:02:19.500> I'm<00:02:19.890> starting<00:02:20.400> an

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
be out pretty quickly I'm starting an

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.770 
be out pretty quickly I'm starting an
internship<00:02:20.640> January<00:02:21.599> sixth<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:23.780> hopefully

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
internship January sixth so hopefully

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.510 
internship January sixth so hopefully
that<00:02:25.140> doesn't<00:02:25.349> interfere<00:02:25.650> with<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.160> but<00:02:26.489> i

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
that doesn't interfere with this but i
