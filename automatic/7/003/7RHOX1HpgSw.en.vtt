 copy and paste again a year rest up 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.240

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.830
 I'm done too, yes, and so am I. 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.560
 Now we have our castle from below 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.690
 So up top made summer to top 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.180
 unfortunately not quite there is still the 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.090
 mansard he is the one since 100 years 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.090
 not cleaned since 150 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:03.520
 to be exact every day and 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.520
 Everybody needs to be able to film 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.360
 we sunday georg what if heydebreck 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.640
 that's why we need spring summer 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.210
 autumn and winter and this is clean too 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.060
 do 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.649
 Let's get started right away 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.280
 because one of you will fall a good one 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:29.050
 excuse me to do it later 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.050
 Okay, but it was worth a try 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.270
 I think I have a good one 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.740
 Excuse me 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.479
 this looks like a sweetie like that 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.259
 seen the spring cleaning was yes 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.740
 a great idea 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.549
 what's on it for the treasure? 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.140
 Find 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:00.909
 follow the quiet what hints 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:09.039
 how to find a light to drive rod on 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:14.410
 it's getting banners out waiting for tax 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:16.090
 on me there is the flagpole and that 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.010
 there's something to be up there 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.989
 somebody had to climb up and 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:27.750
 look there you are yes you come exactly 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:30.250
 really exactly right but for what 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.550
 both my knees started to shake 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.830
 because he wiggle on then lose 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.019
 I still balance 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.670
 you must not prove you yes you 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.480
 All must stand still otherwise I can 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.720
 do not read 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.140
 Can you finally make it happen? 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.680
 to the beach and search the golden bottle 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:54.280
 buried in the sand is a bottle 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.590
 that means you can quickly dare to venture 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.760
 whoever has this hint up here 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.660
 he has attached it very much 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.660
 and what about me 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:24.569
 you do not forget how could we get you 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.769
 Ever forget georg you know the best 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.769
 Abbreviation of a lock 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.190
 I'll be crazy so much nicer 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.190
 but how can we get the golden bottle 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.930
 we will find search teams set up 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.790
 who swarm and look under 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.900
 to every grain of sand even if that 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.240
 would take weeks 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.580
 I would say that's one 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.890
 possibility maybe you have one 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.510
 better idea luzie we can just 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.850
 stay here and do nothing 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.190
 what should that be good for and wait until 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.810
 then the clouds has warped 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.650
 namely the golden bottle in the moonlight 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.480
 shine 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.970
 I really want something better 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.110
 idea and while we can wait we can 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.110
 build a great sand castle 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.229
 Well finally the result is gone 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:39.360
 there's the golden bottle and there 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:39.360
 the second note is in it 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.509
 and what does it look like this time 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.280
 clear to the cave because you appreciate 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:50.380
 actually mostly in caves 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.210
 So if the treasure is in the envelope 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.400
 why did not stand on the 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.280
 city map to look for again 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.820
 so it makes more fun that is true 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.820
 let's go 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.100
 how should we find the cave in the forest? 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.160
 of which she is the bats have us 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.160
 in guided 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:24.929
 so all open my eyes so that we can 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:24.929
 sweetheart find there is a note 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.960
 we do not share anything 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.830
 then the treasure has to be there all the time 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.020
 have been 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:37.320
 a clever darling card no 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.630
 problem we are back here again 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.479
 is a coffer estimated then had to 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.680
 be hidden 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.590
 this treasure chest comes to me somehow 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.720
 known before 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:52.169
 Here is a treasure card that we have 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:57.330
 already previously found instant in there 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:06:00.080
 is still something a duster the leg 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:12.060
 you absolutely right the bottom chamber is 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:16.669
 Totally dusty a duster from the 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.669
 alone works a real sweetheart 

00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:27.799
 matschie 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.719
 I have to say this treasure hunt has 

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:41.400
 really worth it now we can 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:41.999
 the spring cleaning on ghost from 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.249
 break up 

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:46.020
 and when we are done we look 

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:48.680
 see the treasure map again 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.680
 what we still find
