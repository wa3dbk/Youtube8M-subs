00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.929
 the usa 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.429
 well welcome to a 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.019
 new world of warcraft mists of 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:20.089
 pandaria baths video 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:23.329
 we'll see another one today 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:24.439
 Scenario and a storm bride 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.409
 together 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.089
 yes, the title is wise because it 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:31.929
 is about a pandaren, respectively 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:35.140
 around a pandaren lady who is here 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:37.699
 in the middle of years soon up on a mountain 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.219
 special beer brews with help 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.260
 a storm the lightning strike him 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.019
 enter the barrels and enter 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.629
 wonderful brew your task here on 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.730
 The beginning is on the one hand this 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.980
 flashing yes by dipping straight 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.579
 full can stand in it and the other 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.170
 to release the burning barrels 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.789
 No topic at all really needs 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.710
 always look where the lightning strikes where 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.730
 just dodge it 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.550
 delete dodge 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.490
 then it comes pretty nimble 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.170
 And sour rock reminds me 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.689
 somehow to conjure but I leave it 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.210
 stand in the room and have to stand against it 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:17.810
 then you just become easy 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.390
 kill ads and the whole thing goes approx 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.549
 because two minutes then you have the 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.530
 you also see this down 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.360
 counter how many strokes she still has 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.200
 needs until the brew is ready and so 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.180
 on and on 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.909
 So you can guess how about 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.680
 long the event lasts i have to 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.259
 Notice now that this 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.119
 Scenario One of the shortest is the 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.030
 whole room at all was only eleven 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:44.000
 minutes 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.490
 I do not know if that's the way it is or if 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.200
 it was still packed because of the beta and so on 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.670
 Considering it is still the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.170
 beta but i think that it is intended 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.329
 is I have in the blizzard website 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.000
 looked up at the fair's website 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.859
 I looked at the screenshots and 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.659
 could not change anything on the screenshots 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:06.950
 but always just what 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.509
 I experienced playing here 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.580
 so I think that's right 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.830
 but definitely packaged 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.850
 the indication under the minimap where phase 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.380
 one thing stands 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.020
 because that does not change until the 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.240
 conclusion I suspect the phase 1 here 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.540
 now actually completed and 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.280
 phase 2 in which escort exists before the 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.010
 map seen as escort now almost 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.980
 the pandaren master brew back to 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.350
 monastery and it becomes easy on the way 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.830
 Again and again attacked here by 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.150
 These creatures must be protected 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.430
 no problem at all 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.830
 There are no special skills 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.500
 at least not at the beginning 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.240
 against later there will be pugs that you 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.740
 try to fall off the cliffs 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.490
 by whirling you around 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.840
 Shoot and I think I need 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.030
 no longer say so here 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:02.600
 cut it now and show you 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:05.050
 this mob just mentioned mob in 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.610
 They are pretty near the end of the path 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.670
 Now this is a bit too 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.780
 bigger one has a little bit more life 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.430
 Unfortunately, the trees were sometimes from time to time 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.260
 in the way but you still recognize the same 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.810
 he then costs the same time and again 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.220
 cyclone for example here and 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.450
 hurled it at a player suits 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.940
 that you always with the back 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.530
 to this rock face stands 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.600
 and honestly I do not know if that 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.770
 mob before i came again 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.790
 looked at but I have none now 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.770
 seen more 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.930
 so I think it's just this 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.120
 one is everything else before is trash 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.070
 they come up the cliffs 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.630
 crawled and come from behind especially 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.560
 you have to look a bit 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.600
 keep open 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.090
 but all in all, no 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.790
 no problem at all you can do it 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.800
 quite easy to play down after 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.720
 he then defeated this mob , it goes 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.520
 straight on to the monastery above 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.770
 bridge and so no mops come more 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:59.090
 afterwards at the monastery is waiting for you 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:01.790
 but a boss and he has one 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.490
 few skills on the one hand he conjures 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.800
 always new eds that means you 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.890
 you have to take care of the ads and the 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.540
 Boss at the same time the boss has one 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.940
 ability I do not remember everything is 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.250
 something like earthquake so he has one 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.840
 pretty big areal 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.550
 an earthquake is caused where you are 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.010
 You have to be careful when walking out 

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.080
 you get here from the woman times 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.610
 start a skill you see 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.710
 downstairs I just got over it 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.020
 had 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.540
 so you can use the normal network 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.250
 normal mobs hiir one jock as her 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.290
 next to interest target uses this 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.990
 the object load is analyzed in peace 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.270
 and then they are just dead here 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.310
 you see the earthquake now fits 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.900
 Just come on where it's coming from 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.850
 These spikes from the ground 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.350
 it is quite large but one 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.810
 can avoid him well if you have one 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.710
 So it stays that way 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.900
 no big deal anyway and that is 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.840
 even the whole fight fits the 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.710
 ads on you are calling again 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.050
 reinforcement 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.060
 take care of the ads with your ray 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.220
 what you get from the pandaren woman 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.680
 have and then take care of the boss 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:16.050
 evades the earthquake and the big one 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:17.910
 and it was all over then 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.950
 bosque then take sometime if you 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.990
 caused enough damage and that 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.220
 Scenario is over, that's it 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.510
 really really short 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.040
 I have one more here now 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.830
 bit cut as I said 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.380
 altogether it went eleven minutes so 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:34.590
 one was really fix finished nothing in the 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:37.080
 contrary to mrs. moonfest or like that 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.740
 Another scenario it's 20 to 30 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.320
 minutes went 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.060
 Here again the always nice to evade 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.340
 no topic at all 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.860
 deep-seated justice points 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.180
 get everything in the bag and we have ourselves 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.460
 wondered if all this 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.770
 was synonymous because just this phase 1 pact 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.230
 but on the liveserver it will be 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.900
 hopefully everything will be ok 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.340
 it was me with the scenario a 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.750
 storm is brewing together 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.000
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.710
 inform you if yes please seitz 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.750
 affair and give me the thumbs up 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.510
 I would be very happy here 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.200
 youtube and we'll see each other next 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:15.389
 again 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.389
 I'm doing now and I'm out
