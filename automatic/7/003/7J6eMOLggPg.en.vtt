little<00:00:16.410> programmed<00:00:16.859> link<00:00:17.390> and<00:00:18.390> so<00:00:19.230> having

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
little programmed link and so having

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.769 
little programmed link and so having
several<00:00:19.890> ideas<00:00:20.070> one<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.550> them<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.359> changes

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
several ideas one of them the changes

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.140 
several ideas one of them the changes
particularly<00:00:22.109> autumn<00:00:22.800> was<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.100> lollipop<00:00:23.760> maybe

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
particularly autumn was a lollipop maybe

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.750 
particularly autumn was a lollipop maybe
where<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:25.380> would<00:00:25.590> basically<00:00:25.769> see<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.369> red<00:00:26.550> and

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
where it would basically see the red and

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.109 
where it would basically see the red and
yellow<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.900> green<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.859> basically<00:00:29.760> go<00:00:29.970> out

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
yellow and green and basically go out

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.150 
yellow and green and basically go out
Melton<00:00:30.900> was<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.170> some<00:00:31.380> azz<00:00:31.619> asleep<00:00:31.980> in

Melton was you some azz asleep in

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.740 
Melton was you some azz asleep in
popular<00:00:32.550> scene<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.000> at<00:00:33.090> one<00:00:33.329> point<00:00:33.360> we're

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
popular scene and at one point we're

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.420 
popular scene and at one point we're
going<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.989> find<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.469> lollipop<00:00:34.829> ladies<00:00:35.160> with

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
euthanasia for cyclists but i'm cycling

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.060 
euthanasia for cyclists but i'm cycling
Silas<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.570> end<00:00:39.690> we<00:00:39.750> decided<00:00:39.890> we<00:00:40.890> kind

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
Silas so in the end we decided we kind

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.130 
Silas so in the end we decided we kind
of<00:00:41.100> broke<00:00:41.670> out<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:41.940> Eve<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.450> decided<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.960> we

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
of broke out of Eve and decided that we

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.020 
of broke out of Eve and decided that we
would<00:00:43.350> cry<00:00:44.309> make<00:00:44.489> her<00:00:44.579> aware<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.879> her

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
would cry make her aware of her

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.389 
would cry make her aware of her
surroundings<00:00:45.350> so<00:00:46.350> we<00:00:46.800> went<00:00:46.950> back<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.219> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
surroundings so we went back to the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.130 
surroundings so we went back to the
basics<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.940> how<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.149> arms<00:00:48.390> moving<00:00:48.809> everything

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
basics of how the arms moving everything

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.020 
basics of how the arms moving everything
in<00:00:49.379> decided<00:00:49.739> we<00:00:49.829> try<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.160> make<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> point<00:00:50.730> to

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
in decided we try and make a point to

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.900 
in decided we try and make a point to
positions<00:00:51.690> they're<00:00:52.289> outside<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:53.070> her<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.789> we

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
positions they're outside of her so we

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.810 
positions they're outside of her so we
basically<00:00:54.210> try<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.750> teach<00:00:55.020> her<00:00:55.670> what's<00:00:56.670> in

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
basically try to teach her what's in

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.029 
basically try to teach her what's in
room<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.390> what's<00:00:57.510> outside<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:58.109> room<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
room and what's outside of room and the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.490 
room and what's outside of room and the
idea<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.550> it's<00:01:00.210> an<00:01:00.449> extendable<00:01:01.050> project

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
idea is that it's an extendable project

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.729 
idea is that it's an extendable project
so<00:01:02.100> we've<00:01:02.730> also<00:01:02.910> got<00:01:03.270> we're<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:04.260> breaking

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
so we've also got we're just breaking

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.700 
so we've also got we're just breaking
into<00:01:05.250> at<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.729> moment<00:01:06.180> where<00:01:06.900> she<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.500> much

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
into at the moment where she is so much

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.649 
into at the moment where she is so much
were<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.979> facing<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.210> she<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.510> then

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
were you facing so that she can then

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.170 
were you facing so that she can then
reorient<00:01:10.290> ate<00:01:10.470> everything<00:01:11.030> so<00:01:12.030> she<00:01:12.090> doesn't

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
reorient ate everything so she doesn't

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.030 
reorient ate everything so she doesn't
just<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.049> point<00:01:13.200> north<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.680> do<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.920> whole

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
just have to point north to do the whole

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.880 
just have to point north to do the whole
thing<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:15.119> idea<00:01:15.420> then<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.350> see<00:01:16.619> as

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
thing and the idea then is to you see as

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.460 
thing and the idea then is to you see as
we've<00:01:17.070> talked<00:01:17.520> about<00:01:17.549> hardware<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.509> use<00:01:18.780> like

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
we've talked about hardware and use like

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.990 
we've talked about hardware and use like
compass<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.040> back<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.400> then<00:01:20.759> we<00:01:20.850> wouldn't

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
compass in the back and then we wouldn't

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.490 
compass in the back and then we wouldn't
even<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.420> tell<00:01:21.570> aware<00:01:21.810> sure<00:01:21.960> which<00:01:22.320> way

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
even have to tell aware sure which way

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.469 
even have to tell aware sure which way
she's<00:01:22.650> faces<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.250> would<00:01:23.369> know<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.240> we<00:01:24.390> have

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
she's faces you would know and we have

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.480 
she's faces you would know and we have
to<00:01:24.570> translate<00:01:24.930> everything<00:01:25.290> round<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:26.220> idea

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
to translate everything round the idea

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:35.310 
to translate everything round the idea
is<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.759> can<00:01:27.000> do<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.330> starter

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:50.510 

CC<00:01:36.320> creeping

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.660 

what<00:01:51.520> direction<00:01:51.909> am<00:01:52.240> I<00:01:52.420> facing<00:01:52.890> west<00:01:55.080> west

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
what direction am I facing west west

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.219 
what direction am I facing west west
thank<00:01:57.670> you<00:01:59.400> so<00:02:00.400> now<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.580> idea<00:02:00.790> is<00:02:01.090> that<00:02:01.229> sure

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
thank you so now the idea is that sure

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.620 
thank you so now the idea is that sure
