00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:06.980 

Nogueira<00:01:01.969> who<00:01:02.969> fought<00:01:03.329> Muir<00:01:05.299> had<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.330> really

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
actually predicted the bj penn with lose

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.069 
actually predicted the bj penn with lose
because<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.560> how<00:01:46.740> Vijay<00:01:47.610> pan<00:01:47.970> lost<00:01:48.360> two<00:01:48.750> and

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
because of how Vijay pan lost two and

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.350 
because of how Vijay pan lost two and
it's<00:01:52.079> not<00:01:52.229> like<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.530> Keith<00:01:53.070> Jardine<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
it's not like that Keith Jardine is the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.840 
it's not like that Keith Jardine is the
gonna<00:01:55.290> fight<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.860> way<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.250> Georges<00:01:56.610> st.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
gonna fight the way that Georges st.

gonna fight the way that Georges st.
Pierre<00:01:57.149> did<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:58.170> going<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.380> be<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.530> stand-up

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
Pierre did it's going to be a stand-up

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.469 
Pierre did it's going to be a stand-up
fight<00:01:59.490> and<00:02:00.860> Keith<00:02:01.860> Jardine<00:02:02.369> has<00:02:02.880> kind<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.329> an

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
fight and Keith Jardine has kind of an

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.410 
fight and Keith Jardine has kind of an
awkward<00:02:03.659> style<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.619> he<00:02:04.860> hits<00:02:05.100> really<00:02:05.790> really

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
awkward style and he hits really really

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.440 
awkward style and he hits really really
hard<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:07.079> think<00:02:08.069> it's<00:02:08.280> whoever<00:02:08.640> gets<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.179> first

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
hard I think it's whoever gets the first

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.860 
hard I think it's whoever gets the first
big<00:02:10.050> shot<00:02:10.470> in<00:02:10.849> he<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:12.120> could<00:02:12.300> go<00:02:12.420> either<00:02:12.450> way

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
big shot in he it could go either way

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.850 
big shot in he it could go either way
but<00:02:13.050> it's<00:02:13.500> gonna

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
but it's gonna

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.980 
but it's gonna
and<00:02:14.040> knock<00:02:14.400> out<00:02:14.700> there's<00:02:15.150> no<00:02:15.390> question<00:02:15.900> about
