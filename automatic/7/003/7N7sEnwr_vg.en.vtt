I bring this one up here and this one up
here<00:04:05.209> basically<00:04:06.230> sometimes<00:04:07.230> you<00:04:07.380> have<00:04:07.670> more

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
here basically sometimes you have more

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.940 
here basically sometimes you have more
than<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.540> other<00:04:09.660> times<00:04:09.989> but<00:04:10.290> this<00:04:10.530> basically

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
than the other times but this basically

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:18.979 
than the other times but this basically
way<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.459> do<00:04:11.730> it<00:04:15.890> and<00:04:16.890> apparently<00:04:17.390> it<00:04:18.390> ended<00:04:18.840> the

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
way to do it and apparently it ended the

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.560 
way to do it and apparently it ended the
replay<00:04:19.530> but<00:04:19.950> I'll<00:04:20.820> show<00:04:21.030> what<00:04:21.180> you<00:04:21.239> have<00:04:21.299> to<00:04:21.450> do

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
replay but I'll show what you have to do

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.990 
replay but I'll show what you have to do
now<00:04:21.810> this<00:04:22.530> one<00:04:22.800> knee<00:04:22.979> or<00:04:23.130> tank<00:04:23.520> there<00:04:23.760> laughs

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
now this one knee or tank there laughs

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.650 
now this one knee or tank there laughs
of<00:04:24.300> course

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
of course

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.710 
of course
and<00:04:24.840> then<00:04:24.960> you<00:04:25.260> up<00:04:25.500> this<00:04:26.070> one's<00:04:26.310> walk<00:04:26.940> down<00:04:27.360> you

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
and then you up this one's walk down you

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.909 
and then you up this one's walk down you
supposed<00:04:28.080> to<00:04:28.290> attack<00:04:28.740> them<00:04:29.270> so<00:04:30.740> that<00:04:31.740> your

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
supposed to attack them so that your

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.880 
supposed to attack them so that your
horses<00:04:32.280> are<00:04:32.310> destroyed<00:04:33.240> a<00:04:33.570> lot<00:04:34.250> x-men<00:04:35.250> and

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
horses are destroyed a lot x-men and

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.560 
horses are destroyed a lot x-men and
your<00:04:38.510> x-men<00:04:39.510> destroyed<00:04:40.100> Lancers<00:04:41.100> and

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
your x-men destroyed Lancers and

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.930 
your x-men destroyed Lancers and
eventually<00:04:42.570> when<00:04:42.720> you<00:04:42.780> just<00:04:42.930> really<00:04:43.169> ask<00:04:43.200> me

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.600 

them<00:04:47.940> died<00:04:48.240> so<00:04:48.860> that's<00:04:49.860> basically<00:04:50.190> other<00:04:50.460> way

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
them died so that's basically other way

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.380 
them died so that's basically other way
to<00:04:50.669> do<00:04:50.940> this<00:04:51.120> mission<00:04:51.360> your<00:04:51.840> to<00:04:52.169> do<00:04:52.350> is<00:04:52.560> before

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
to do this mission your to do is before

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.610 
to do this mission your to do is before
that's<00:04:54.390> why<00:04:54.570> you<00:04:54.630> have<00:04:54.900> to<00:04:55.050> destroy<00:04:55.380> their

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
that's why you have to destroy their

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.770 
that's why you have to destroy their
artists<00:04:56.010> so<00:04:56.130> quickly<00:04:56.580> because<00:04:57.000> they<00:04:57.540> are

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
artists so quickly because they are

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.950
