00:00:04.267 --> 00:00:08.267
 Real pilots will never stop because they know 

00:00:08.367 --> 00:00:10.233
 It’s the speed that makes the plane fly in the air. 

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.000
 Here is the "Join Stunt Squadron"! 

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:25.100
 As usual, let’s first take a look at how players are successful. 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.533
 Complete the route of the previous episode 

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:31.400
 This task is not simple, but the players have shown some impressive results. 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.433
 We even decided to change the way we distribute gold coins between winners. 

00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:40.867
 Now, those players who are only a few seconds behind the winner can still get the main reward. 

00:00:40.967 --> 00:00:44.433
 Gold Coin Awards will be distributed among the winners in the following ways: 

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:49.467
 You can find the game video of the player who completed the route the fastest in the description. 

00:00:49.567 --> 00:00:52.400
 Of course, there are also many spectacular crash videos. 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.867
 Every player with master "Grass Darts" technology gets a thousand gold coins. 

00:00:56.967 --> 00:00:59.733
 Now let’s move on to the new challenge. 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.367
 Players who sent us this route 

00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:06.867
 You can see that his nickname is now on the screen. 

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:10.233
 And he should have 6,000 gold coins in his pocket. 

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:14.567
 Drive your Heinkel He 112 to get to the map above Harbor 

00:02:11.933 --> 00:02:15.567
 Everyone needs to complete this task as accurately as possible. 

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:17.533
 Also, follow the list of key elements 

00:02:17.633 --> 00:02:19.833
 You can find this list in the video description. 

00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:20.733
 I wish you all the best! 

00:02:20.833 --> 00:02:21.900
 So much now 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.467
 Our email address is unchanged: tryrepeat@wargaming.net 

00:02:26.567 --> 00:02:30.367
 Everyone has to indicate the number of "joining stunt squadrons" in the title. 

00:02:30.467 --> 00:02:33.533
 Your nickname, region - North America or Europe 

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:38.467
 Also attach the time to complete the path, or mark it as "failed" 

00:02:38.567 --> 00:02:41.167
 There have been many errors in the format of some emails before. 

00:02:41.267 --> 00:02:43.000
 So please be sure to pay attention 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.867
 We look forward to your feedback on the game video and feedback on the new program mode. 

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:48.167
 Goodbye!
