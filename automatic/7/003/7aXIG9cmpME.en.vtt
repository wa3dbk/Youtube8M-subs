00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.550

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.770
 I decided to make it more dramatic and just like 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.450

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.579

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.710

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.560
 now that letter in thanks rebellion 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.810
 It is also sent a few weeks ago 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.720
 and the truth is the colors are super 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.309
 super parents how can you see here this 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.500
 Manito I love the truth you look 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.579
 super cool but I used the colors 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.940
 as darker as that one here and 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.000
 the black and it's from here to its flowers that 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.559
 I you this palette for the look of today 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.359
 you also the shade of cole pop 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.940
 you know they are my favorites right now 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.699
 at the moment I am using the day to 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.770
 The truth is they are great and more will be 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.070
 here you can use it daily if not more than 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.710
 the super simple and good thing 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.479
 it should not be longer if you 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.050
 They want to know how to withdraw this 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.760
 makeup you know keep watching but 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.950
 let's start with this color that 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.590
 Flame textile row of the palette 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.780
 l'escaleta nasarre religious and we're going 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.270
 to apply throughout the eye socket and 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.460
 let's blur very well this is another 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.860
 same witch that comes in the palette of 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.259
 We will apply vanilla color in the 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.170
 eyebrow bargain so that it gives us a 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.030
 little bit of light and also reality that 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.399
 color that we just applied now 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.460
 using this coffee as it is not like a 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.500
 coffee is good coffee as a reddish not 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.830
 I can explain very well let's apply in 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.680
 the outside part as you can see here 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.570
 and we're going to bring it in but 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.289
 just in the eye socket we are going to 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.880
 leave the eyelid mobile with nothing and already 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.520
 there we are going to use the skewer which is a 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.979
 little bit more loose that is the other side 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.220
 of this brochita to try to sign 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.860
 all those lines that are leaving us 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.210
 so they define very well and from there we go 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.170
 to be applying 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.120
 and the surprise that coming from fuck to 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.790
 we're going to apply that throughout 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.850
 mobile eyelid and I feel that pigment 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.990
 more when we apply it with little fingers 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.520
 when I pick it with the brush I feel that 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.520
 to see if he keeps all the product 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.720
 from there we go to the brush to try 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.340
 blur and add a little 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.500
 colors do not look like lines 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.840
 and already once we have applied this 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.690
 let's go back with him two shots and let's go 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.910
 to blur all the colors together and 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.660
 I'll show you how I'm doing 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.280
 my nador using the liquid stench here 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.160
 I'm going to leave the name of 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.260
 this eyeliner that I like a lot and 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.500
 I leave here to look how I 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.500
 I make 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.970
 two 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.140
 and well, that's saying the part 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.739
 delineated to apply lashes 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:27.700
 plate and black liner either 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:30.160
 his taste this x 24/7 of organdÃ­ cake that 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.450
 I like it very much now with a shadow 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.640
 black of the same palette we are going to 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.950
 apply it in the water line to 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.230
 seal the pencil and we will also bring 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.569
 a little down just below the 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.120
 eyelashes and using the coffee as with 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:46.069
 reddish we are going to blur that black to 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.799
 that they have not finished more smoking 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.900
 already once we've done that we're going to 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.840
 apply the favorite mascara to the eyelashes 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.609
 from below and above to my first 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.530
 favorite watching this from Milan level but 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:59.299
 I'm running out of money 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.690
 approximately about 4 hours in the 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.670
 pharmacy 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.490
 and there applied a little bit of the shadow of the 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.860
 hammer pop in the animal area and now 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.360
 let's announce the face this is the 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.800
 outline kit of the classes because 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.950
 I feel that I like it a little more than the 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.530
 of next and just to tan for 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.470

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.670
 I'm not outlining I'm just 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.710
 Sun tanning 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.870

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.590
 very dramatic and eyebrows so that 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.540

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.040
 they ask in the photos what is 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.170
 this here that is being my 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.270
