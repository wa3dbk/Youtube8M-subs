that data so it uses zero copper and two

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.140 
that data so it uses zero copper and two
medium<00:01:34.680> leather<00:01:34.860> for<00:01:35.130> for<00:01:35.340> goal<00:01:35.549> total<00:01:35.850> and

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
the value of that item on the auction

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.270 
the value of that item on the auction
house<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.150> thinks<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.810> eight<00:01:40.500> gold<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.159> it

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
house it thinks is eight gold and it

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.270 
house it thinks is eight gold and it
bases<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.420> actually<00:01:42.780> three<00:01:42.990> gold<00:01:43.200> but<00:01:44.189> it

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
bases that is actually three gold but it

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.889 
bases that is actually three gold but it
says<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.610> it's<00:01:44.729> disenchant<00:01:45.329> abul<00:01:45.570> for<00:01:45.780> eight

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.429 
says that it's disenchant abul for eight
gold<00:01:47.240> so<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.420> figures<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.110> can<00:01:49.290> make<00:01:49.409> a

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
gold so it figures that you can make a

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.440 
gold so it figures that you can make a
profit<00:01:49.770> off<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.070> making<00:01:50.520> bronze<00:01:50.759> great<00:01:51.060> swords

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
profit off of making bronze great swords

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.410 
profit off of making bronze great swords
by<00:01:51.659> disenchanting<00:01:52.290> them<00:01:52.850> to<00:01:53.850> find<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.149> items

that's<00:02:49.440> based<00:02:49.709> on<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:49.980> fact<00:02:50.190> that<00:02:50.280> all<00:02:50.519> the

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
that's based on the fact that all the

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.220 
that's based on the fact that all the
obsidium<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.180> sold<00:02:51.420> out<00:02:51.510> on<00:02:51.690> this<00:02:51.810> realm<00:02:52.049> right

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
obsidium is sold out on this realm right

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.440 
obsidium is sold out on this realm right
now<00:02:52.349> so<00:02:52.890> this<00:02:53.040> is<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.220> little<00:02:53.430> bit<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:54.299> high

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
now so this is a little bit of a high

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.470 
now so this is a little bit of a high
value<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:54.989> that<00:02:55.110> is<00:02:55.200> true<00:02:55.410> for<00:02:55.799> most<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.250> these

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
value and that is true for most of these

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.270 
value and that is true for most of these
you'll<00:02:57.480> want<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.810> check<00:02:58.019> your<00:02:58.440> own<00:02:58.590> realm<00:02:58.860> to
