you're also taking 16 20 strands of

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.229 
you're also taking 16 20 strands of
snares<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.739> strapping<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.730> bottom<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.180> the

let me show you when it's tightened up

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.470 
let me show you when it's tightened up
like<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.870> you<00:00:54.870> get<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.050> lot<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.260> articulation

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
like this you get a lot of articulation

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:04.570 
like this you get a lot of articulation
lends<00:00:57.480> itself<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.840> busier<00:00:58.289> playing<00:00:58.620> like

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.440 

right<00:01:05.580> fast<00:01:05.970> tempos<00:01:06.619> articulations<00:01:07.619> alright

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
right fast tempos articulations alright

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.950 
right fast tempos articulations alright
now<00:01:09.450> let's<00:01:10.350> detune<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.159> snares<00:01:11.810> which<00:01:12.810> is

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
now let's detune the snares which is
