live in a time where there are a lot of
global<00:00:26.010> issues<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.090> we're<00:00:27.930> working<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.439> these

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
global issues and we're working in these

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.009 
global issues and we're working in these
new<00:00:28.890> paradigms<00:00:29.699> where<00:00:30.000> people<00:00:30.359> realize<00:00:30.599> we

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
new paradigms where people realize we

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.110 
new paradigms where people realize we
can<00:00:31.170> use<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.410> power<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.830> Internet<00:00:32.309> to

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
can use the power of the Internet to

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.270 
can use the power of the Internet to
work<00:00:33.329> together<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.960> solve<00:00:34.200> our<00:00:34.380> common<00:00:34.829> common

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
work together to solve our common common

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.420 
work together to solve our common common
problems<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.290> in<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.410> specific<00:00:37.649> case<00:00:38.160> we're

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
problems and in this specific case we're

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.430 
problems and in this specific case we're
working<00:00:38.460> on<00:00:38.879> bee<00:00:39.120> declines<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:39.840> we<00:00:39.960> recognize

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
working on bee declines so we recognize

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.770 
working on bee declines so we recognize
that<00:00:40.739> bees<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.399> their<00:00:41.969> populations<00:00:42.600> are

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
that bees and their populations are

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.110 
that bees and their populations are
starting<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.290> dwindle<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.610> want<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.910> study

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
starting to dwindle and we want to study

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.119 
starting to dwindle and we want to study
that<00:00:45.450> through<00:00:45.870> global<00:00:46.590> networks<00:00:46.920> of

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
that through global networks of

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.430 
that through global networks of
scientists<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:48.450> not<00:00:48.629> official<00:00:49.230> academic

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
scientists but not official academic

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.100 
scientists but not official academic
scientists<00:00:50.370> more<00:00:50.520> like<00:00:50.760> citizens<00:00:51.360> working

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
scientists more like citizens working

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.650 
scientists more like citizens working
together<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.739> study<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.160> problem<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:54.420> we're

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
together to study the problem so we're

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.180 
together to study the problem so we're
taking<00:00:54.899> sensors<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.739> we're<00:00:55.829> putting<00:00:56.100> them

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
taking sensors and we're putting them

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.939 
taking sensors and we're putting them
inside<00:00:56.699> beehives<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.480> we're<00:00:58.230> streaming<00:00:58.559> data

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
inside beehives and we're streaming data

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.650 
inside beehives and we're streaming data
about<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.579> hives<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.239> internet<00:01:00.629> so

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
about the hives to the internet so

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.869 
about the hives to the internet so
anybody<00:01:01.170> can<00:01:01.469> look<00:01:01.680> at<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.100> issue<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.670> try

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
anybody can look at the issue and try

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.310 
anybody can look at the issue and try
and<00:01:03.030> understand<00:01:03.420> what's<00:01:03.750> causing<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
and understand what's causing the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.039 
and understand what's causing the
problem<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:05.610> open<00:01:06.060> source<00:01:06.180> hardware<00:01:06.450> makes<00:01:06.900> it

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
problem so open source hardware makes it

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.230 
problem so open source hardware makes it
possible<00:01:07.439> for<00:01:07.500> everyone<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.159> just<00:01:08.369> download<00:01:08.970> a

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
person they'll be high for free it means

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.170 
person they'll be high for free it means
that<00:01:12.810> anyone<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.439> download<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.130> file<00:01:14.520> which

anytime<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.399> have<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.550> lot<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.879> power<00:02:09.780> and

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
anytime you have a lot of power and

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.130 
anytime you have a lot of power and
authority<00:02:10.910> centralized

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
authority centralized

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.210 
authority centralized
that<00:02:12.350> that<00:02:12.950> central<00:02:13.340> body<00:02:13.520> is<00:02:13.910> not<00:02:14.569> always

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
that that central body is not always

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.920 
that that central body is not always
responsible<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.550> people<00:02:16.580> that<00:02:17.030> are<00:02:17.090> it's

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
responsible to the people that are it's

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.180 
responsible to the people that are it's
supposed<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.260> serve<00:02:18.530> there's<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:18.950> lot<00:02:19.100> of

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
supposed to serve there's a lot of

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.730 
supposed to serve there's a lot of
corruption<00:02:19.670> that<00:02:19.700> can<00:02:19.910> happen<00:02:20.120> when<00:02:20.740> things

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
corruption that can happen when things

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.070 
corruption that can happen when things
are<00:02:21.920> consolidates<00:02:22.490> and<00:02:22.900> consolidated<00:02:23.900> so

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
are consolidates and consolidated so

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.540 
are consolidates and consolidated so
instead<00:02:24.500> what<00:02:24.680> we<00:02:24.770> want<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.040> do<00:02:25.130> is<00:02:25.280> create

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
instead what we want to do is create

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.270 
instead what we want to do is create
these<00:02:26.050> decentralized<00:02:27.050> networks<00:02:27.500> where

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
these decentralized networks where

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.370 
these decentralized networks where
nobody<00:02:28.580> owns<00:02:28.880> anything<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.900> data<00:02:30.110> is

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
nobody owns anything and the data is

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.680 
nobody owns anything and the data is
available<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:31.610> everyone<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.090> everyone<00:02:32.540> can

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
available to everyone and everyone can

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.230 
available to everyone and everyone can
participate<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.709> so<00:02:34.520> we<00:02:34.640> think<00:02:34.880> that<00:02:35.000> we'll

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
participate and so we think that we'll

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.210 
participate and so we think that we'll
have<00:02:35.270> higher<00:02:35.720> fidelity<00:02:36.140> within<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.010> data

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
have higher fidelity within the data

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.880 
have higher fidelity within the data
itself<00:02:37.790> it's<00:02:38.570> more<00:02:38.870> democratic<00:02:39.080> and<00:02:39.770> it's

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
itself it's more democratic and it's

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.030 
itself it's more democratic and it's
more<00:02:40.100> trustworthy<00:02:40.520> in<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:40.970> long<00:02:41.150> run<00:02:42.040> thanks

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
more trustworthy in the long run thanks
