00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
holding the camera so first you open

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:26.970 
holding the camera so first you open
your<00:00:17.760> flash<00:00:18.090> program<00:00:23.960> okay

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.730 

so<00:00:27.700> let's<00:00:28.570> say<00:00:28.750> you<00:00:28.810> want<00:00:28.990> to<00:00:29.050> do<00:00:29.170> a<00:00:29.200> really

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
are the frame usually it's 12 frames per

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.870 
are the frame usually it's 12 frames per
second<00:00:40.840> so<00:00:41.670> 12<00:00:42.670> drawings<00:00:43.059> per<00:00:43.570> second<00:00:44.880> when

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
second so 12 drawings per second when

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.620 
second so 12 drawings per second when
you<00:00:46.030> draw<00:00:46.300> you<00:00:46.360> can<00:00:46.660> do<00:00:46.840> stick<00:00:47.650> figures<00:00:48.070> with

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630 
you draw you can do stick figures with

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.560 
you draw you can do stick figures with
thick<00:00:49.630> lines<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:51.100> I<00:00:51.130> do<00:00:51.309> them<00:00:51.790> with<00:00:52.059> the

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
thick lines but I do them with the

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.820 
thick lines but I do them with the
paintbrush<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:55.030> is<00:00:55.300> the<00:00:55.510> buildin<00:00:55.960> this<00:00:56.590> is<00:00:56.800> a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
paintbrush this is the buildin this is a

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.210 
paintbrush this is the buildin this is a
bit<00:00:57.070> big

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
bit big

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.609 
bit big
okay<00:01:00.900> so<00:01:01.900> first<00:01:02.620> when<00:01:03.010> you<00:01:03.310> make<00:01:03.580> a<00:01:04.619> really

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
okay so first when you make a really

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:14.370 
okay so first when you make a really
basic<00:01:07.170> guy<00:01:09.210> standing<00:01:10.210> right<00:01:10.479> there<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:14.110> is

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
basic guy standing right there this is

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.760 
basic guy standing right there this is
the<00:01:14.530> port<00:01:15.180> important<00:01:17.490> if<00:01:18.490> you<00:01:18.850> want<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.770> keep

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
frame you gotta press f6 so you just

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:35.639 
frame you gotta press f6 so you just
copied<00:01:33.429> your<00:01:33.610> frame<00:01:33.880> like<00:01:34.630> this<00:01:34.899> so<00:01:35.170> you<00:01:35.440> can

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:18.720 
go to the next frame and you make
another<00:03:11.410> one<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:14.880> so<00:03:15.880> on<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.390> so<00:03:16.630> on<00:03:16.660> I<00:03:17.730> don't

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
another one and so on and so on I don't

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.550 
another one and so on and so on I don't
think<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.390> result<00:03:19.780> is<00:03:19.900> going<00:03:20.080> to<00:03:20.140> be<00:03:20.200> very

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
think the result is going to be very

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.690 
think the result is going to be very
good<00:03:20.800> because<00:03:22.650> I'm<00:03:23.650> doing<00:03:23.920> it<00:03:24.220> there<00:03:24.490> really

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
good because I'm doing it there really

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.640 
good because I'm doing it there really
fast<00:03:26.670> but<00:03:27.810> maybe<00:03:28.810> it's<00:03:29.080> going<00:03:29.200> to<00:03:29.260> be<00:03:29.320> funny

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
fast but maybe it's going to be funny

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.920
