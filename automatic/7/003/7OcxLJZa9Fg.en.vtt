00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.790 
out because I think they were almost
getting<00:00:06.480> caught<00:00:06.870> when<00:00:07.440> that<00:00:08.150> that<00:00:09.150> particular

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:09.800 
getting caught when that that particular

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.680 
getting caught when that that particular
the<00:00:10.800> clip<00:00:11.070> there<00:00:11.340> but<00:00:11.700> did<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.120> see<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.450> tease

of<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.080> stopper<00:00:13.320> suit<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:14.190> also<00:00:14.370> should<00:00:14.969> have

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
of the stopper suit you also should have

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.420
