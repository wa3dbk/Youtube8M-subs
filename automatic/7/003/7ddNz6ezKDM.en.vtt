 will be canducci here we are again in a 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.140
 new video to talk about 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.130
 a recently introduced application 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.590
 on the app store 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.350
 we are therefore talking about crisis jobs ed 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.840
 just an application that comes from a 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.529
 all-Italian software house though 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.510
 however talking about the next is one 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.920
 all Italian software house that 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.350
 precisely he has realized this 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.760
 application that brings on all our 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.050
 iphone 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.840
 the beauty of playing jokes once 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.879
 we went down the street trying to do 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.910
 of the candid rooms is good today 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.059
 candid camera is made with the iphone 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.789
 you must know that it still exists 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.789
 people of 2012 who are afraid to take 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.370
 holding an iphone for the terror that is 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.549
 break that something explodes 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.340
 of evil substantially well 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.060
 developers and valentina and andrea have 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.240
 thought it has just this type 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.530
 of users precisely to implement 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.720
 these jokes 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.270
 then let's talk about crisis jobs 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.509
 inside there is a library 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.030
 with different we say jokes like ad 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.299
 example the glass that crumbles when 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:35.329
 we try to plug nikon and 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:38.610
 own home screen let's say or 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:42.360
 strange vibrations associated with functions 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.060
 That said, let's go to 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.470
 see this application let's say in 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.150
 operates and therefore I will try to simulate one 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.720
 fright 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.910
 said this needle the video very well a 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.840
 this point we are going to open ours 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:03.360
 the corani crisis jobs on our iphone ed 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.710
 let's read the instructions he wants 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.440
 scare your friends this 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.630
 hilarious up does for you crisis jobs 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.160
 contains a sacconi jokes to take 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.410
 around the two victims as soon as the 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.970
 unfortunate will touch the screen part 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.550
 to the joke while the camera 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.680
 front for the devices that are 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:24.390
 gifted therefore it is clear that in the case of 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.890
 a 3gs will not be possible to take one 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.930
 photo of your victim 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.150
 in the end I could save it on your iphone 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.709
 sent by email or share it on 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.350
 twitter and facebook then 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.200
 basically the app snaps a 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.060
 image to the frightened photo but the 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.790
 frightened face of the victim 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.280
 ok let's go ahead follow the instructions 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.270
 first get out of why you have to do 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.000
 a screenshot of the screen 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.770
 of the iphone where you have the ok icons so 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.720
 we are already wrong so we go out 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.400
 let's go to a main screen and 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.720
 let's take screenshots to make one 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.560
 screenshot we have to press the button 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.370
 ignition plus the Hon 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.370
 like this here 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.380
 and let's go back to opening crisis jobs ok e 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.650
 go on 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.810
 did this re- opened crisis jobs done e 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.700
 in the next screen choose 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.260
 the image you just got from 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.370
 iPhone camera roll e 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:23.750
 went on then now let's select 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.750
 our image 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.670
 here it is and we continue now you don't 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.769
 it remains that to raise the volume to the maximum 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.080
 of the iPhone to choose the joke is 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.400
 invented an excuse to deliver 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.080
 the iphone to the victim 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.330
 if lots like not to forget about 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.580
 vote for it so you can help us create new ones 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.320
 fun jokes with crisis jobs 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.030
 here the developers hold to 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.080
 specify that 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.060
 will periodically release say 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.400
 updates to expand the 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.770
 joke library so that's all 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.990
 in your interest leave yours 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.060
 opinions in the app store after having it 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.860
 purchased then then we go to 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.100
 turn up the volume so let's make sure 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.370
 that the iPhone is not in mutual so e 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.550
 let's raise the volume to the maximum ok said 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.920
 this we can proceed as we said 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.090
 first we have one available 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.320
 library back different let's say 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.160
 joke then we have the alarm 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.900
 critical the broken glass to horror 12 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.790
 discourages any screen signal 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.190
 white then from for example we can 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.240
 take them no signal and press up 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.230
 start 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.940
 as you can see the iphone has taken the 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.030
 main screen we wrote 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.560
 been before so it looks normal ok 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.830
 it does not seem that at this moment there is 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.180
 open application bono prank 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.540
 we can safely leave the 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.160
 our iphone so bonino and find one 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.470
 good excuse to attract ours 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.690
 victim when our victim goes to 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.060
 pick up the iPhone and press 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:02.660
 anything I know tries to make one 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.660
 slide for example mum happens to you 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.490
 and basically and then this screen 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.050
 that I screwed with photography 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.730
 obviously I unfortunately in this 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.520
 moment I was not looking at the iPhone 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.710
 in fact it's my head 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:26.830
 ok so i'd say play again maybe 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:30.040
 choosing another zip trick 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.100
 at this point fart around the iphone 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:38.850
 so as to face him 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:38.850
 hence our iphone oddio 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.500
 intelligent expressions I did 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.320
 I must say that a great thing 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.560
 oh well let's lower a pitiful veil said 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.570
 let's try another one 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.780
 Trick that has horror 1 personally 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:01.930
 my favorite start we gave the 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:05.020
 our iphone we know and it's out one 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.660
 status notification approached 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.550
 then we will approach this 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.460
 so that I or rather not us but the 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:17.700
 unfortunate will approach by mere 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.700
 some more spoons 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:32.569
 then now probably many of you 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:35.580
 they will be laughing saying but what is there 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:37.500
 scary in all this is good I can 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.319
 make sure that the first time I have it 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:44.310
 I found myself at two millimeters 

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:47.340
 from the screen practically and ho 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:51.349
 made a jump of misery because to me 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:54.620
 I need little to scare me though anyway 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:57.360
 the fatal effect did well here 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.729
 then what about crisis jobs is 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:03.680
 a really simple application e 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:07.349
 functional and respects perfectly 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:09.300
 perfectly the only description 

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:12.509
 something that maybe there are some 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:15.110
 few let's say effects though despite 

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:18.360
 this the developers have 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:21.180
 specified that he is currently at 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.240
 work to implement new ones in the 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.560
 next updates so what to say 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:28.139
 crisis jobs is definitely an application 

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.479
 very very nice so there 

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:33.259
 I recommend reading our article 

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:35.880
