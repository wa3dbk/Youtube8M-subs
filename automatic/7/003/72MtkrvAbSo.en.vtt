00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
the computer car tutorials so recently

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.209 
the computer car tutorials so recently
there<00:00:07.799> was<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:07.980> ticket<00:00:08.639> update<00:00:09.179> and<00:00:10.070> when<00:00:11.070> the

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
there was a ticket update and when the

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.980 
there was a ticket update and when the
server<00:00:11.519> was<00:00:11.700> updated<00:00:12.150> it<00:00:12.240> decided<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.630> wipe

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
all of my floppy discs so they're all

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.180 
all of my floppy discs so they're all
empty<00:00:15.420> now<00:00:15.690> which<00:00:16.619> means<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.890> lost<00:00:17.010> all<00:00:17.160> my

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
empty now which means I lost all my

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.540 
empty now which means I lost all my
programs<00:00:18.080> there's<00:00:19.080> not<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.230> big<00:00:19.380> problem<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:20.070> was

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
programs there's not a big problem I was

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.340 
programs there's not a big problem I was
planning<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.150> rewriting<00:00:21.720> everything<00:00:21.990> in

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
planning on rewriting everything in

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.710 
planning on rewriting everything in
these<00:00:22.470> tutorials<00:00:22.619> anyway<00:00:23.250> so<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:24.510> will<00:00:24.630> give

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
these tutorials anyway so this will give

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.330 
these tutorials anyway so this will give
me<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.840> fresh<00:00:25.050> start<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.590> we<00:00:25.740> can<00:00:25.920> start<00:00:26.220> from

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
me a fresh start and we can start from

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.460 
me a fresh start and we can start from
scratch<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.570> can<00:00:27.869> see<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.230> whole

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
scratch and you can see the whole

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.980 
scratch and you can see the whole
process<00:00:29.070> which<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.789> great<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.269> was<00:00:30.779> gonna<00:00:30.900> do

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
process which is great I was gonna do

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.299 
process which is great I was gonna do
that<00:00:31.080> anyway<00:00:31.260> but<00:00:31.380> now<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.800> can't<00:00:32.099> actually

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
that anyway but now I can't actually

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.569 
that anyway but now I can't actually
cheat<00:00:32.579> I've<00:00:32.790> got<00:00:32.910> my<00:00:33.000> old<00:00:33.180> code<00:00:33.420> that's<00:00:34.020> fine

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
cheat I've got my old code that's fine

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.010 
cheat I've got my old code that's fine
so<00:00:35.579> this<00:00:36.120> episode<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.660> going<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.809> be<00:00:36.899> about

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
so this episode is going to be about

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.459 
so this episode is going to be about
arrays<00:00:37.520> which<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.790> arrays<00:00:39.600> our<00:00:39.780> special<00:00:40.230> kind

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
arrays which is arrays our special kind

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.380 
arrays which is arrays our special kind
of<00:00:40.620> variable<00:00:41.070> which<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.550> did<00:00:41.790> not<00:00:41.820> talk<00:00:42.210> about

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
of variable which I did not talk about

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.279 
of variable which I did not talk about
the<00:00:42.780> episode<00:00:43.020> about<00:00:43.110> variables<00:00:44.870> so<00:00:45.870> let<00:00:46.200> me

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
the episode about variables so let me

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.959 
the episode about variables so let me
show<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.559> how<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.280> works<00:00:49.670> micro<00:00:50.670> called

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
show you how this works micro called

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.569 
show you how this works micro called
arrays<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.750> what<00:00:52.289> an<00:00:52.379> array<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.250> a

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
arrays so what an array is it's a

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.119 
arrays so what an array is it's a
variable<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.329> can<00:00:54.629> store<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.289> large<00:00:55.710> number

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
variable that can store a large number

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.619 
variable that can store a large number
of<00:00:56.280> data<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.239> store<00:00:57.390> multiple

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
of data so you can store multiple

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.040 
of data so you can store multiple
numbers<00:00:58.500> or<00:00:58.829> letters<00:00:59.100> or<00:00:59.489> words<00:00:59.550> in<00:01:00.000> there<00:01:00.239> in

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
numbers or letters or words in there in

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.920 
numbers or letters or words in there in
a<00:01:01.140> single<00:01:01.440> variable<00:01:02.180> which<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.539> be<00:01:03.660> very

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
a single variable which can be very

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.740 
a single variable which can be very
useful<00:01:04.199> at<00:01:04.260> times<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.850> it's<00:01:05.850> also<00:01:06.060> very

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
useful at times and it's also very

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.929 
useful at times and it's also very
useful<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.680> combination<00:01:08.280> with<00:01:08.369> lists<00:01:08.760> as<00:01:08.850> you

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
useful in combination with lists as you

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.420 
useful in combination with lists as you
could<00:01:09.090> loop<00:01:09.360> through<00:01:09.720> these<00:01:10.470> variables<00:01:11.130> and

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
could loop through these variables and

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.499 
could loop through these variables and
all<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.970> data<00:01:12.420> they<00:01:12.659> contain<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.360> can

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
all the data they contain and you can

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.070 
all the data they contain and you can
create<00:01:15.840> very<00:01:16.049> efficient<00:01:16.530> or<00:01:17.750> small<00:01:18.750> amounts

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
create very efficient or small amounts

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.960 
create very efficient or small amounts
of<00:01:19.140> code<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.409> does<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:20.009> bunch<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.490> things<00:01:20.640> at

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
of code that does a bunch of things at

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.499 
of code that does a bunch of things at
once<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.479> that's<00:01:22.470> great

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
once so that's great

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.910 
once so that's great
so<00:01:24.509> I'll<00:01:24.600> show<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.810> how<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.049> create<00:01:25.380> one<00:01:25.470> we

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
so I'll show you how to create one we

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.999 
so I'll show you how to create one we
create<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> variable<00:01:27.439> now<00:01:28.439> normally<00:01:28.799> when<00:01:28.890> you

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
create a variable now normally when you

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.530 
create a variable now normally when you
create<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> variable<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.670> go<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.119> equal<00:01:30.420> to

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
create a variable you go is equal to

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.100 
create a variable you go is equal to
some<00:01:30.750> kind<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:30.960> number<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:32.640> create<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.150> list<00:01:33.780> or

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
some kind of number to create a list or

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.690 
some kind of number to create a list or
an<00:01:34.350> array<00:01:34.590> I'm<00:01:34.799> gonna<00:01:34.950> stick<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> word

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
an array I'm gonna stick to the word

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.490 
an array I'm gonna stick to the word
array<00:01:35.909> for<00:01:36.090> now<00:01:36.180> that's<00:01:37.170> where<00:01:37.380> it's

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
array for now that's where it's

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.499 
array for now that's where it's
officially<00:01:37.770> called<00:01:37.950> looma<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.970> use<00:01:39.360> these

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
officially called looma you use these

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.300 
officially called looma you use these
curly<00:01:39.900> brackets<00:01:40.049> use<00:01:40.619> an<00:01:40.799> opening<00:01:41.100> one<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
curly brackets use an opening one the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.789 
curly brackets use an opening one the
closing<00:01:41.610> one<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.060> that's<00:01:42.210> it

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
closing one and that's it

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.679 
closing one and that's it
and<00:01:43.799> then<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.759> have<00:01:44.909> your<00:01:45.030> array<00:01:45.299> and

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
and then you have your array and

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.170 
and then you have your array and
normally<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.409> put<00:01:46.619> something<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.610> variable

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
normally to put something in a variable

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.639 
normally to put something in a variable
you<00:01:48.299> would<00:01:48.360> do<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.810> equal<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.200> five<00:01:49.439> or

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
you would do is equal to five or

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:50.830 
you would do is equal to five or
something

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
something

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.230 
something
for<00:01:51.409> an<00:01:51.500> array<00:01:51.770> what<00:01:52.100> you<00:01:52.220> do<00:01:52.430> is<00:01:52.909> you<00:01:53.060> need<00:01:53.210> to

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
for an array what you do is you need to

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.200 
for an array what you do is you need to
use<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:54.770> straight<00:01:55.130> brackets<00:01:55.549> and<00:01:55.790> then

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
use the straight brackets and then

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.109 
use the straight brackets and then
choose<00:01:56.630> which<00:01:57.260> place<00:01:58.070> in<00:01:58.400> the<00:01:58.520> list<00:01:58.729> or<00:01:59.000> the

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
choose which place in the list or the

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.719 
choose which place in the list or the
array<00:01:59.360> you<00:01:59.810> want<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:00.170> store<00:02:00.500> your<00:02:00.530> number<00:02:01.520> or

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
array you want to store your number or

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.270 
array you want to store your number or
letter<00:02:01.880> over<00:02:02.360> whether<00:02:02.540> you're<00:02:02.840> pissing<00:02:03.110> in<00:02:03.280> so

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
letter over whether you're pissing in so

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.399 
letter over whether you're pissing in so
we're<00:02:04.400> gonna<00:02:04.490> go<00:02:04.700> on<00:02:04.729> place<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:05.090> 1<00:02:05.360> for<00:02:05.600> now<00:02:05.690> and

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
we're gonna go on place a 1 for now and

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.340 
we're gonna go on place a 1 for now and
we<00:02:06.590> close<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.430> bracket<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.810> now<00:02:08.959> we<00:02:09.020> can<00:02:09.200> do

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
we close the bracket and now we can do

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.110 
we close the bracket and now we can do
what<00:02:09.500> we<00:02:09.590> always<00:02:09.709> do<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.429> store<00:02:10.670> a<00:02:10.700> number<00:02:10.880> in

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
what we always do and store a number in

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.830 
what we always do and store a number in
there<00:02:11.739> now<00:02:12.739> an<00:02:13.459> array<00:02:13.730> has<00:02:14.060> basically

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
there now an array has basically

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.260 
there now an array has basically
infinite<00:02:15.500> number<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:16.100> places<00:02:16.910> where<00:02:17.180> you<00:02:17.209> can

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
infinite number of places where you can

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.550 
infinite number of places where you can
store<00:02:17.540> things<00:02:17.690> week<00:02:17.930> of<00:02:18.050> saw<00:02:18.230> something<00:02:18.500> on

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
store things week of saw something on

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.309 
store things week of saw something on
the<00:02:18.650> second<00:02:18.950> place<00:02:19.130> of<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.430> array<00:02:19.670> you<00:02:20.319> can

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
the second place of the array you can

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.560 
the second place of the array you can
even<00:02:21.709> even<00:02:22.010> go<00:02:22.160> into<00:02:22.700> negative<00:02:22.970> numbers<00:02:23.480> I

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
even even go into negative numbers I

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.430 
even even go into negative numbers I
believe<00:02:23.840> so<00:02:24.200> we<00:02:24.260> want<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.470> store<00:02:24.620> up<00:02:24.680> place<00:02:25.459> -1

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.400 

make<00:02:30.440> it<00:02:30.560> something<00:02:30.800> like<00:02:30.830> that

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
make it something like that

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.009 
make it something like that
and<00:02:33.410> you<00:02:34.250> can<00:02:34.430> go<00:02:34.640> as<00:02:35.269> high<00:02:35.540> if<00:02:35.600> you<00:02:35.750> want<00:02:35.900> as

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
and you can go as high if you want as

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.320 
and you can go as high if you want as
well<00:02:36.140> you<00:02:37.130> can<00:02:37.280> also<00:02:37.430> skip<00:02:37.730> much<00:02:37.940> of<00:02:38.060> numbers

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
well you can also skip much of numbers

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.600 
well you can also skip much of numbers
and<00:02:38.450> go<00:02:38.540> straight<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:38.840> 100<00:02:39.370> so<00:02:40.370> or<00:02:40.459> something

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
and go straight to 100 so or something

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.780 
and go straight to 100 so or something
will<00:02:40.790> place<00:02:40.970> a<00:02:41.000> hundred<00:02:42.519> you<00:02:43.519> don't<00:02:43.640> have<00:02:43.730> to

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
will place a hundred you don't have to

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:44.920 
will place a hundred you don't have to
store<00:02:43.910> numbers<00:02:44.209> either<00:02:44.330> you<00:02:44.480> can<00:02:44.630> store

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
store numbers either you can store

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.190 
store numbers either you can store
letters<00:02:45.530> as<00:02:45.650> well<00:02:45.680> if<00:02:45.860> you<00:02:45.950> like<00:02:46.959> so<00:02:47.959> they<00:02:48.050> just

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
letters as well if you like so they just

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.759 
letters as well if you like so they just
print<00:02:48.500> all<00:02:48.620> of<00:02:48.739> these<00:02:48.890> for<00:02:49.130> you<00:02:50.530> so<00:02:51.530> that's<00:02:51.650> how

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
print all of these for you so that's how

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.710 
print all of these for you so that's how
you<00:02:51.830> store<00:02:52.010> things<00:02:52.190> in<00:02:52.250> them<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.670> access<00:02:52.850> you

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
you store things in them to access you

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.229 
you store things in them to access you
do<00:02:53.870> exactly<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.380> same<00:02:54.590> so<00:02:55.489> we<00:02:55.579> just<00:02:55.730> go<00:02:55.910> array

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
do exactly the same so we just go array

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.360 
do exactly the same so we just go array
1<00:02:56.540> and<00:02:56.959> we<00:02:57.049> can<00:02:57.170> print<00:02:57.470> it<00:02:57.560> like<00:02:57.590> that

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.180 

just<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:03.150> as<00:03:03.240> well

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.089 

bring<00:03:08.190> all<00:03:08.370> of<00:03:08.430> them

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
bring all of them

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:16.399 
bring all of them
yeah<00:03:11.099> prints<00:03:11.989> array<00:03:13.519> 100<00:03:15.049> there<00:03:16.049> we<00:03:16.110> go

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
yeah prints array 100 there we go

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:23.000 
yeah prints array 100 there we go
so<00:03:17.370> let's<00:03:18.030> see<00:03:18.180> how<00:03:18.239> this<00:03:18.360> goes<00:03:21.080> 5<00:03:22.080> 10<00:03:22.440> minus<00:03:22.799> 5

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
so let's see how this goes 5 10 minus 5

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.220 
so let's see how this goes 5 10 minus 5
big<00:03:23.459> good<00:03:23.849> that's<00:03:24.510> correct

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.500 

excellent<00:03:28.230> now<00:03:28.519> like<00:03:29.519> I<00:03:29.549> said<00:03:29.819> I<00:03:30.030> raised<00:03:30.360> them

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
excellent now like I said I raised them

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.649 
excellent now like I said I raised them
loops<00:03:30.930> of<00:03:31.140> friends<00:03:31.909> so<00:03:32.909> let<00:03:33.060> me<00:03:33.150> show<00:03:33.390> you<00:03:33.420> that

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
loops of friends so let me show you that

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:41.860 
loops of friends so let me show you that
I<00:03:34.700> get<00:03:35.700> rid<00:03:35.790> of<00:03:35.849> all<00:03:36.060> this<00:03:36.209> crap<00:03:36.540> for<00:03:36.750> now

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.929 

so<00:03:42.870> as<00:03:43.079> a<00:03:43.349> race<00:03:43.709> user<00:03:44.090> index<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:46.879> show<00:03:47.879> you

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:47.939 
so as a race user index to show you

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:52.069 
so as a race user index to show you
where<00:03:48.599> you<00:03:49.170> want<00:03:49.319> to<00:03:49.379> store<00:03:49.709> your<00:03:50.540> items<00:03:51.540> or

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
where you want to store your items or

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.490 
where you want to store your items or
numbers<00:03:52.560> or<00:03:52.829> letters<00:03:53.040> or<00:03:53.430> whatever<00:03:53.870> and<00:03:54.870> also

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
numbers or letters or whatever and also

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.780 
numbers or letters or whatever and also
read<00:03:55.709> them<00:03:56.810> this<00:03:57.810> index<00:03:58.290> here<00:03:58.560> is<00:03:58.739> a<00:03:59.010> number

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
read them this index here is a number

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.449 
read them this index here is a number
that<00:03:59.970> goes<00:04:00.120> from<00:04:00.359> one<00:04:00.689> until<00:04:01.500> millions<00:04:02.010> if<00:04:02.370> you

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
that goes from one until millions if you

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.059 
that goes from one until millions if you
like<00:04:02.609> so<00:04:03.510> this<00:04:03.629> is<00:04:03.780> great<00:04:04.140> for<00:04:04.379> loops<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:04.980> we

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
like so this is great for loops so we

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.379 
like so this is great for loops so we
could<00:04:05.220> make<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.640> for<00:04:05.970> loop<00:04:07.879> with<00:04:08.879> the<00:04:09.030> variable

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
could make a for loop with the variable

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:15.249 
could make a for loop with the variable
I<00:04:09.530> and<00:04:10.530> make<00:04:10.829> it<00:04:10.980> equal<00:04:11.099> to<00:04:11.459> one<00:04:11.819> until<00:04:12.620> say<00:04:13.620> 100

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:15.259 
I and make it equal to one until say 100

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:20.029 
I and make it equal to one until say 100
and<00:04:16.259> do<00:04:16.590> and<00:04:18.109> what<00:04:19.109> you<00:04:19.199> do<00:04:19.380> is<00:04:19.560> you<00:04:19.650> take<00:04:19.829> the

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
and do and what you do is you take the

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.610 
and do and what you do is you take the
array<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.639> you<00:04:20.669> put<00:04:21.539> things<00:04:21.930> in<00:04:22.169> place<00:04:22.320> I

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
array and you put things in place I

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.740 
array and you put things in place I
which<00:04:22.979> is<00:04:23.009> going<00:04:23.190> from<00:04:23.400> 1<00:04:23.639> to<00:04:23.820> 100<00:04:24.000> so<00:04:24.509> you<00:04:24.599> can

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
which is going from 1 to 100 so you can

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.409 
which is going from 1 to 100 so you can
very<00:04:25.020> quickly<00:04:25.349> fill<00:04:25.979> this<00:04:26.669> up<00:04:26.729> with<00:04:27.120> whatever

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
very quickly fill this up with whatever

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.499 
very quickly fill this up with whatever
you<00:04:27.599> like<00:04:27.630> we<00:04:27.870> could<00:04:27.930> fill<00:04:28.139> that<00:04:28.169> with<00:04:28.410> I<00:04:29.509> times

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:30.509 
you like we could fill that with I times

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:34.159 
you like we could fill that with I times
I<00:04:31.009> end<00:04:32.009> it<00:04:32.250> so<00:04:33.000> this<00:04:33.090> is<00:04:33.210> basically<00:04:33.660> creating

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
I end it so this is basically creating

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.189 
I end it so this is basically creating
an<00:04:34.440> array<00:04:34.740> which<00:04:35.160> has<00:04:35.190> all<00:04:36.060> of<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.509> squares<00:04:36.780> of

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
an array which has all of the squares of

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.700 
an array which has all of the squares of
the<00:04:38.130> numbers<00:04:38.400> of<00:04:38.490> 1<00:04:38.580> until<00:04:38.789> 100<00:04:39.349> so<00:04:40.349> if<00:04:40.440> we<00:04:40.530> want

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
the numbers of 1 until 100 so if we want

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:50.750 
the numbers of 1 until 100 so if we want
to<00:04:40.800> print<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.310> square<00:04:41.729> of<00:04:44.630> 69<00:04:48.229> let's<00:04:49.229> take<00:04:49.760> 50

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
to print the square of 69 let's take 50

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:58.189 
to print the square of 69 let's take 50
for<00:04:51.770> array<00:04:53.780> 54<00:04:56.330> and<00:04:57.330> this<00:04:57.659> is<00:04:57.750> gonna<00:04:57.870> give<00:04:58.110> you

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
for array 54 and this is gonna give you

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.719 
for array 54 and this is gonna give you
the<00:04:58.320> square<00:04:58.620> of<00:04:58.650> 54<00:04:59.190> and<00:04:59.220> of<00:04:59.370> course<00:04:59.550> you<00:04:59.610> could

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
the square of 54 and of course you could

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.850 
the square of 54 and of course you could
just<00:04:59.760> go<00:04:59.940> 54<00:05:00.330> times<00:05:00.570> 54<00:05:00.900> print<00:05:01.229> that<00:05:01.380> but<00:05:01.620> I'm

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
just go 54 times 54 print that but I'm

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.589 
just go 54 times 54 print that but I'm
just<00:05:01.949> trying<00:05:02.310> to<00:05:02.340> make<00:05:02.580> a<00:05:02.639> point<00:05:02.880> here

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:06.599 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:09.320 

there<00:05:07.559> we<00:05:07.650> go<00:05:07.770> that's<00:05:08.159> the<00:05:08.279> square<00:05:08.729> of<00:05:08.879> 54

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
there we go that's the square of 54

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.469 
there we go that's the square of 54
excellent

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
excellent

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.619 
excellent
so<00:05:12.479> it's<00:05:12.629> stored<00:05:13.129> for<00:05:14.129> the<00:05:14.400> numbers<00:05:14.849> one<00:05:15.270> until

00:05:15.619 --> 00:05:15.629 
so it's stored for the numbers one until

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:18.409 
so it's stored for the numbers one until
one<00:05:15.719> hundred<00:05:16.050> is<00:05:16.199> stored<00:05:16.499> the<00:05:17.339> number<00:05:17.699> I<00:05:17.849> times

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
one hundred is stored the number I times

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.629 
one hundred is stored the number I times
itself<00:05:18.870> which<00:05:19.409> is<00:05:19.529> the<00:05:19.650> square<00:05:19.949> of<00:05:20.009> course<00:05:20.309> and

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
itself which is the square of course and

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.499 
itself which is the square of course and
then<00:05:21.629> we<00:05:21.749> can<00:05:21.930> read<00:05:22.139> any<00:05:22.439> number<00:05:22.770> of<00:05:22.889> that<00:05:23.069> and

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:23.509 
then we can read any number of that and

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:26.059 
then we can read any number of that and
print<00:05:24.509> it<00:05:24.599> on<00:05:24.659> the<00:05:24.719> screen<00:05:24.990> if<00:05:25.529> we<00:05:25.770> want<00:05:25.979> we

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:26.069 
print it on the screen if we want we

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:28.029 
print it on the screen if we want we
could<00:05:26.159> also<00:05:26.339> just<00:05:26.580> make<00:05:26.909> a<00:05:26.939> for<00:05:27.240> loop

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
could also just make a for loop

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:36.929 
could also just make a for loop
and<00:05:29.039> we<00:05:29.129> could<00:05:29.249> take<00:05:29.400> I<00:05:29.610> is<00:05:30.419> equal<00:05:30.779> to

00:05:36.929 --> 00:05:36.939 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:41.409 

when<00:05:37.939> my<00:05:38.120> ears<00:05:38.300> go<00:05:38.479> here<00:05:38.629> we<00:05:38.689> go<00:05:40.300> let's<00:05:41.300> say<00:05:41.360> you

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
when my ears go here we go let's say you

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:46.899 
when my ears go here we go let's say you
want<00:05:41.569> to<00:05:41.599> print<00:05:41.809> the<00:05:41.900> ones<00:05:42.050> from<00:05:42.999> 30<00:05:43.999> to<00:05:44.270> 35<00:05:45.909> we

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:46.909 
want to print the ones from 30 to 35 we

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:48.700 
want to print the ones from 30 to 35 we
want<00:05:47.089> to<00:05:47.150> know<00:05:47.240> those<00:05:47.419> ones<00:05:47.659> exactly<00:05:48.110> well

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
want to know those ones exactly well

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.760 
want to know those ones exactly well
there's<00:05:48.979> no<00:05:49.069> problem<00:05:52.029> whoops<00:05:53.029> just<00:05:53.719> prints<00:05:54.650> it

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
there's no problem whoops just prints it

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:06.000 
there's no problem whoops just prints it
rather<00:05:54.919> do<00:05:55.580> nothing<00:05:56.559> array<00:05:57.559> I<00:06:00.129> and

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:11.490 

and<00:06:06.520> the<00:06:06.820> raise<00:06:08.910> there<00:06:09.910> we<00:06:09.970> go<00:06:10.290> so<00:06:11.290> here's<00:06:11.410> the

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
and the raise there we go so here's the

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.670 
and the raise there we go so here's the
first<00:06:11.650> one<00:06:11.770> our<00:06:11.920> sprinting<00:06:12.310> is<00:06:13.110> 2916<00:06:14.110> and<00:06:14.440> then

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
first one our sprinting is 2916 and then

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:22.890 
first one our sprinting is 2916 and then
the<00:06:14.880> 3435<00:06:16.230> 996<00:06:17.490> 1024<00:06:18.490> and<00:06:18.700> so<00:06:19.060> forth<00:06:21.900> edit

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
the 3435 996 1024 and so forth edit

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.300 
the 3435 996 1024 and so forth edit
raise<00:06:25.530> so<00:06:26.530> yeah<00:06:26.650> that's<00:06:26.830> a<00:06:26.920> quick

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
raise so yeah that's a quick

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.330 
raise so yeah that's a quick
introduction<00:06:27.640> to<00:06:27.820> arrays<00:06:28.800> of<00:06:29.800> course<00:06:30.070> you<00:06:30.220> can

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340 
introduction to arrays of course you can

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:37.870 
introduction to arrays of course you can
also<00:06:30.490> store<00:06:31.620> letters<00:06:32.620> in<00:06:32.800> it<00:06:32.950> whoops

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:37.880 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:45.329 

is<00:06:38.420> equal<00:06:38.570> to<00:06:38.810> see<00:06:38.990> you<00:06:39.610> blink<00:06:40.610> I<00:06:40.940> go

00:06:45.329 --> 00:06:45.339 

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:48.929 

got<00:06:45.849> to<00:06:45.939> give<00:06:46.059> it<00:06:46.089> to<00:06:46.209> place<00:06:46.419> of<00:06:46.569> course<00:06:47.939> we

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:48.939 
got to give it to place of course we

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:53.140 
got to give it to place of course we
don't<00:06:49.029> 101

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.120 

and<00:06:53.720> you<00:06:53.810> can<00:06:53.930> also<00:06:54.080> do<00:06:54.380> that<00:06:54.530> in<00:06:54.830> combination

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.130 
and you can also do that in combination

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.700 
and you can also do that in combination
with<00:06:55.660> numbers<00:06:56.660> in<00:06:56.780> exactly<00:06:57.110> the<00:06:57.260> same<00:06:57.470> array

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:57.710 
with numbers in exactly the same array

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.430 
with numbers in exactly the same array
as<00:06:57.830> well<00:06:58.060> although<00:06:59.060> I<00:06:59.360> wouldn't<00:06:59.750> advise<00:07:00.110> doing

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.440 
as well although I wouldn't advise doing

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.260 
as well although I wouldn't advise doing
that<00:07:00.710> very<00:07:01.040> often<00:07:01.250> but<00:07:03.580> just<00:07:04.580> for<00:07:04.760> an<00:07:04.850> example

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:05.270 
that very often but just for an example

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:14.240 
that very often but just for an example
for<00:07:05.389> now<00:07:09.310> there<00:07:10.310> we<00:07:10.370> go

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.250 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.710 

so<00:07:15.250> that's<00:07:15.580> the<00:07:15.759> quick<00:07:16.120> introduction<00:07:16.630> on

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 
so that's the quick introduction on

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.719 
so that's the quick introduction on
arrays<00:07:16.930> especially<00:07:17.860> you<00:07:18.009> store<00:07:18.340> a<00:07:18.370> bunch<00:07:18.550> of

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:18.729 
arrays especially you store a bunch of

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:21.570 
arrays especially you store a bunch of
things<00:07:18.970> in<00:07:19.240> a<00:07:19.330> single<00:07:19.630> variable<00:07:20.370> you<00:07:21.370> just

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:21.580 
things in a single variable you just

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.659 
things in a single variable you just
have<00:07:21.699> to<00:07:21.850> give<00:07:22.810> the<00:07:22.960> location<00:07:23.560> of<00:07:23.740> where<00:07:24.370> the

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:24.669 
have to give the location of where the

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:27.779 
have to give the location of where the
list<00:07:24.910> you<00:07:25.570> want<00:07:25.720> to<00:07:25.750> store<00:07:25.990> it<00:07:26.430> so<00:07:27.430> thanks<00:07:27.699> for

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:27.789 
list you want to store it so thanks for

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:30.719 
list you want to store it so thanks for
watching<00:07:28.120> and<00:07:28.330> we'll<00:07:28.840> see<00:07:29.169> I<00:07:29.380> raise<00:07:29.590> a<00:07:29.620> lot<00:07:30.160> in

00:07:30.719 --> 00:07:30.729 
watching and we'll see I raise a lot in

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:32.610 
watching and we'll see I raise a lot in
the<00:07:31.000> coming<00:07:31.419> videos<00:07:31.449> probably<00:07:31.960> especially

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:32.620 
the coming videos probably especially

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.430 
the coming videos probably especially
when<00:07:32.740> we<00:07:32.830> start<00:07:33.039> implementing<00:07:34.440> actually

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.440 
when we start implementing actually

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.210 
when we start implementing actually
implementing<00:07:36.220> things<00:07:36.370> on<00:07:36.880> Turtles<00:07:37.979> so<00:07:38.979> see

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:39.220 
implementing things on Turtles so see

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.129 
implementing things on Turtles so see
you<00:07:39.310> next<00:07:39.340> time<00:07:39.580> the<00:07:40.449> next<00:07:40.660> video<00:07:40.930> will<00:07:41.110> talk

you next time the next video will talk

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:42.900 
you next time the next video will talk
about<00:07:41.320> functions<00:07:41.979> which<00:07:42.580> will<00:07:42.699> be<00:07:42.820> an

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:42.910 
about functions which will be an

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:45.779 
about functions which will be an
important<00:07:43.360> part<00:07:43.389> of<00:07:44.100> the<00:07:45.100> whole<00:07:45.220> structure<00:07:45.610> of

00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:45.789 
important part of the whole structure of

00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:48.390 
important part of the whole structure of
our<00:07:46.030> actual<00:07:46.300> programs<00:07:46.800> so<00:07:47.800> see<00:07:47.979> then<00:07:48.130> thanks

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:48.400 
our actual programs so see then thanks

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.449 
our actual programs so see then thanks
for<00:07:48.430> watching<00:07:48.520> bye
