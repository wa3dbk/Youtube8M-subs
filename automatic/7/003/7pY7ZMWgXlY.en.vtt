00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
really care for the 40 heat so we won't

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.390

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
putting products in it it starts to get

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.170 
putting products in it it starts to get
tangled<00:02:33.060> on<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.420> ends<00:02:34.080> I'm<00:02:34.590> beyond<00:02:35.519> beyond

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
belief it just gets so tangled is so bad

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.000
