dying<00:01:50.000> actually<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.149> game<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.570> very

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
dying actually the game is very

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.609 
dying actually the game is very
sensitive<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:52.740> when<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.610> for<00:01:54.600> example<00:01:54.840> fly<00:01:55.380> as

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
sensitive so when you for example fly as

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.030 
sensitive so when you for example fly as
an<00:01:55.799> eagle<00:01:55.979> over<00:01:56.640> some<00:01:57.180> pit<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:58.770> can

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
barely touch the spiky branch and you're

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.670 
barely touch the spiky branch and you're
already<00:02:04.380> dead

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680
