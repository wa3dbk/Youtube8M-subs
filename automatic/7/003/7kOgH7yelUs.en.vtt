but I'm glad to have this opportunity to
discuss<00:00:12.480> your<00:00:13.080> question<00:00:13.650> about<00:00:13.799> values<00:00:14.670> and

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289 
discuss your question about values and

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:17.720 
discuss your question about values and
you<00:00:16.289> said<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.740> never<00:00:16.949> know<00:00:17.190> how<00:00:17.369> dark<00:00:17.609> to

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
you said that you never know how dark to

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.609 
you said that you never know how dark to
go<00:00:17.850> with<00:00:18.000> your<00:00:18.119> values<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:19.050> always<00:00:19.289> feel

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
go with your values and you always feel

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.950 
go with your values and you always feel
like<00:00:19.710> your<00:00:20.340> drawings<00:00:20.789> are<00:00:20.939> too<00:00:21.119> light<00:00:21.330> but

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
like your drawings are too light but

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.630 
like your drawings are too light but
then<00:00:22.140> when<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.320> darken<00:00:22.650> them<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.189> seems<00:00:23.430> like

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
then when you darken them it seems like

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.880 
then when you darken them it seems like
they<00:00:23.789> become<00:00:24.090> too<00:00:24.269> dark<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:24.750> how<00:00:25.470> do<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:25.680> know

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
they become too dark so how do you know

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.150 
they become too dark so how do you know
when<00:00:26.099> you're<00:00:26.220> drawing<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.760> just<00:00:27.150> right<00:00:28.160> this

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
when you're drawing is just right this

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.660 
when you're drawing is just right this
is<00:00:29.519> such<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.029> common<00:00:30.710> problem<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.750> I<00:00:33.750> tried<00:00:34.200> to

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
is such a common problem and I tried to

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.119 
is such a common problem and I tried to
help<00:00:35.670> people<00:00:36.239> with<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.719> idea<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.350> we<00:00:37.860> want

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
help people with the idea that we want

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.750 
help people with the idea that we want
to<00:00:38.219> build<00:00:38.460> our<00:00:38.899> darkest<00:00:39.899> values<00:00:40.290> first<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.950> we

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
to build our darkest values first and we

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.420 
to build our darkest values first and we
also<00:00:42.000> want<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.570> stay<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:42.809> control<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.649> do<00:00:44.340> it

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
also want to stay in control and do it

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.389 
also want to stay in control and do it
gradually<00:00:44.750> it<00:00:45.750> may<00:00:45.989> seem<00:00:46.050> like<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.710> takes<00:00:46.980> time

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
gradually it may seem like it takes time

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.299 
gradually it may seem like it takes time
but<00:00:47.760> i<00:00:47.820> think<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.480> overall<00:00:48.649> if<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:50.010> see

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
but i think that overall if you can see

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.750 
but i think that overall if you can see
the<00:00:50.489> development<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.239> know<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:53.070> have<00:00:53.730> a

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
the development and know that you have a

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.389 
the development and know that you have a
sense<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.210> whether<00:00:54.390> they're<00:00:54.600> too<00:00:54.719> dark<00:00:54.960> or<00:00:55.110> not

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
sense of whether they're too dark or not

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.920 
sense of whether they're too dark or not
and<00:00:56.399> see<00:00:56.730> them<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:56.969> balance<00:00:57.210> with<00:00:57.480> everything

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
and see them in balance with everything

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.479 
and see them in balance with everything
else<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.230> your<00:00:58.289> picture<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.250> can<00:00:59.370> be<00:00:59.460> a

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
else in your picture that it can be a

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.880 
else in your picture that it can be a
great<00:00:59.760> advantage<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.480> don't<00:01:01.289> like<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.530> go<00:01:01.770> any

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
great advantage I don't like to go any

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.920 
great advantage I don't like to go any
darker<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.879> but<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.449> want<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.809> be

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
darker and I have to but I want to be

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.050 
darker and I have to but I want to be
able<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.170> seek<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.559> tour<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.949> curve<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.549> that's

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
able to seek on tour and curve so that's

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.330 
able to seek on tour and curve so that's
why<00:01:06.360> when<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.750> start<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.530> darkest<00:01:07.979> areas

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
why when I start in the darkest areas

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.570 
why when I start in the darkest areas
first<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.939> always<00:01:09.780> try<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.110> show<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> gradation

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
first I always try to show a gradation

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.609 
first I always try to show a gradation
out<00:01:12.150> from<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.659> particular<00:01:12.840> edge<00:01:13.350> where<00:01:13.590> I

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
out from that particular edge where I

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.520 
out from that particular edge where I
started<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:14.970> see<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> range<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:16.080> value

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
started so that I see a range of value

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.580 
started so that I see a range of value
the<00:01:17.280> reason<00:01:17.670> i<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.119> do<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.590> primarily

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
the reason i like to do this primarily

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.609 
the reason i like to do this primarily
is<00:01:19.890> because<00:01:20.369> i<00:01:20.610> don't<00:01:21.390> want<00:01:21.509> those<00:01:22.049> darks<00:01:22.439> to

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
is because i don't want those darks to

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.789 
is because i don't want those darks to
contrast<00:01:23.250> too<00:01:23.909> much<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.780> at<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.530> stage

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
contrast too much so at the stage

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.850 
contrast too much so at the stage
they're<00:01:26.159> at<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.700> want<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.570> something<00:01:28.530> in

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
they're at I want to have something in

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.560 
they're at I want to have something in
those<00:01:28.979> dark<00:01:29.250> areas<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.060> wouldn't<00:01:30.360> be<00:01:30.450> as

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
those dark areas but it wouldn't be as

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.929 
those dark areas but it wouldn't be as
dark<00:01:30.840> as<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.170> may<00:01:31.350> go<00:01:31.500> later<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.009> want<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.790> be<00:01:32.880> able

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
dark as I may go later I want to be able

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.569 
dark as I may go later I want to be able
to<00:01:33.090> judge<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.509> as<00:01:33.659> i<00:01:33.780> go<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.170> i<00:01:34.860> also<00:01:35.070> want<00:01:35.520> to

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
to judge that as i go and i also want to

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.870 
to judge that as i go and i also want to
be<00:01:35.700> able<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:36.210> have<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.229> opportunity<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:38.159> reach

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
be able to have the opportunity to reach

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.630 
be able to have the opportunity to reach
into<00:01:39.270> those<00:01:39.600> lighter<00:01:39.930> areas<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:41.040> white<00:01:41.280> part

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
into those lighter areas the white part

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.730 
into those lighter areas the white part
to<00:01:41.790> your<00:01:41.939> paper<00:01:42.210> maybe<00:01:42.869> it's<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.229> highlights

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
to your paper maybe it's the highlights

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.980 
to your paper maybe it's the highlights
or<00:01:43.979> even<00:01:44.280> across<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.610> forehead<00:01:45.210> or<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> cheek<00:01:45.780> and

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
or even across a forehead or a cheek and

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.649 
or even across a forehead or a cheek and
have<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.130> opportunity<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.759> get<00:01:48.000> some<00:01:48.060> value

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
have the opportunity to get some value

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.050 
have the opportunity to get some value
in<00:01:48.689> there<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.710> i<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.070> contour<00:01:50.909> it

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
in there so that i can contour it

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.270 
in there so that i can contour it
because<00:01:51.780> if<00:01:51.930> there's<00:01:52.110> nothing<00:01:52.619> on<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.040> paper

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
because if there's nothing on the paper

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.749 
because if there's nothing on the paper
it<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:54.119> going<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.479> be<00:01:54.509> flat<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.200> if<00:01:56.009> i<00:01:56.189> make<00:01:56.729> the

it is going to be flat and if i make the

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.600 
it is going to be flat and if i make the

darks too dark and i go to the extreme
and<00:01:59.880> i<00:02:00.329> have<00:02:00.570> no<00:02:00.869> more<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.710> put<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.100> there<00:02:02.280> I

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
and i have no more to put in there I

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.120 
and i have no more to put in there I
can't<00:02:02.460> contour<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.659> either<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.439> don't<00:02:04.950> want

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
can't contour that either I don't want

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.219 
can't contour that either I don't want
anything<00:02:05.310> that's<00:02:05.579> flat<00:02:05.880> that's<00:02:06.540> why<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.810> am

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
anything that's flat that's why I am

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.669 
anything that's flat that's why I am
obsessed<00:02:08.039> with<00:02:08.160> contour<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.209> curve<00:02:09.959> because

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
obsessed with contour and curve because

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.080 
obsessed with contour and curve because
I<00:02:10.800> always<00:02:11.160> want<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.940> see<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.150> dimension<00:02:12.930> to

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
I always want to see that dimension to

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.140 
I always want to see that dimension to
developing<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.629> that<00:02:14.290> wonderful<00:02:14.590> uh<00:02:15.190> you

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
developing and that wonderful uh you

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.300 
developing and that wonderful uh you
know<00:02:16.239> contour<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:17.050> face<00:02:17.319> or<00:02:17.620> a<00:02:17.680> forehead<00:02:18.129> or

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
know contour of a face or a forehead or

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.500 
know contour of a face or a forehead or
cheek<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:20.230> if<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:21.010> do<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.340> slowly<00:02:21.610> you

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
cheek and so if you do it slowly you

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.570 
cheek and so if you do it slowly you
will<00:02:22.660> gradually<00:02:23.290> be<00:02:23.500> able<00:02:23.800> to<00:02:23.950> reach<00:02:24.160> farther

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
will gradually be able to reach farther

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.699 
will gradually be able to reach farther
and<00:02:24.970> farther<00:02:25.269> and<00:02:25.540> farther<00:02:25.840> into<00:02:26.050> those<00:02:26.470> white

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
and farther and farther into those white

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.390 
and farther and farther into those white
spaces<00:02:27.129> if<00:02:27.550> you<00:02:28.239> haven't<00:02:28.540> gotten<00:02:29.440> the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
spaces if you haven't gotten the

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.820 
spaces if you haven't gotten the
adequate<00:02:31.090> value<00:02:31.660> in<00:02:31.840> those<00:02:32.049> white<00:02:32.440> spaces

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
adequate value in those white spaces

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.640 
adequate value in those white spaces
you're<00:02:33.549> going<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.269> see<00:02:34.569> a<00:02:34.750> greater<00:02:35.049> contrast

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
you're going to see a greater contrast

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.830 
you're going to see a greater contrast
as<00:02:35.920> well<00:02:36.099> with<00:02:36.370> what<00:02:36.580> you<00:02:36.730> did<00:02:36.940> in<00:02:37.629> the<00:02:37.810> dark

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
as well with what you did in the dark

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.059 
as well with what you did in the dark
areas<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.590> so<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.700> becomes<00:02:40.379> more<00:02:41.379> evident<00:02:41.440> if

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
areas and so it becomes more evident if

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.250 
areas and so it becomes more evident if
you're<00:02:42.519> not<00:02:42.670> patient<00:02:42.970> as<00:02:43.299> well<00:02:43.480> again<00:02:43.900> and

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
you're not patient as well again and

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.770 
you're not patient as well again and
develop<00:02:44.620> your<00:02:44.739> darks<00:02:45.069> too<00:02:45.340> quickly<00:02:45.640> this<00:02:46.540> will

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
develop your darks too quickly this will

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.460 
develop your darks too quickly this will
also<00:02:46.860> create<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:48.040> larger<00:02:48.489> contrast<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:49.470> it

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
also create a larger contrast and it

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.830 
also create a larger contrast and it
gets<00:02:50.890> hard<00:02:51.340> because<00:02:51.760> if<00:02:52.209> you<00:02:52.329> can<00:02:52.510> see<00:02:52.690> the

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
gets hard because if you can see the

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.339 
gets hard because if you can see the
balance<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:53.700> think<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:54.910> way<00:02:55.180> so<00:02:55.959> that<00:02:55.989> you

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
balance and think that way so that you

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.250 
balance and think that way so that you
are<00:02:56.500> staying<00:02:57.040> control<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:58.090> putting<00:02:58.569> just

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
are staying control and putting just

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.410 
are staying control and putting just
enough<00:02:59.650> then<00:03:00.519> you're<00:03:00.760> going<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.060> have<00:03:01.150> an

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
enough then you're going to have an

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.059 
enough then you're going to have an
opportunity<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:02.049> have<00:03:02.319> a<00:03:02.349> better<00:03:02.650> feeling

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
opportunity to have a better feeling

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.600 
opportunity to have a better feeling
about<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.489> so<00:03:04.150> I<00:03:04.420> hope<00:03:05.319> that<00:03:05.590> that<00:03:05.739> helps<00:03:05.799> you<00:03:06.370> a

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610
