00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.899
 we shape the ears of jack russell terriers 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:16.020
 treating the fly a little bit of vodka or 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:19.279
 alcohol mobile phone we cut plaster 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:24.029
 strips to the inside of the ear 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:26.119
 like a fabric adhesive with good glue 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.099
 layer several layers will glue 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:33.920
 glue on the inside of the fold with care 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.920
 we turn down the sides opening the fly 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:42.510
 glue a strip of plaster 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.350
 then the next one more tab is 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.350
 leveling them up becomes a circle lies 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.010
 Exactly not forward at first until the patch 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.969
 ear stiffness will be a little bit 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:59.750
 hang around but it will hang straight ahead 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.059
 and getting a dog will be hard back 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:10.970
 that's when just remove it should 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:15.780
 hang as it should be forward but 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.670
 gradually folds smooth the patch 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.070
 stiffens and take it off 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:26.670
 inside and it will be difficult for us 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:31.579
 fabric adhesive tape on a very thin imported 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:36.110
 scotch it is better to take domestic 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:39.290
 tough easiest domestic 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:44.100
 patch in coil which are sold 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:47.180
 let another strip so here they are 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.900
 aligned a little bit looking forward but 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:54.490
 then hang 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.490
 forward as it should be 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:05.770
 but now we are trying to take a close-up shot. 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.410
 here is the strip inside the shortened here is the strip 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.360
 inside ear 2 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:14.590
 here she heard the sound growled but 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:18.580
 failed to take her ears back now 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:24.900
 strips of patches give out care to start 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:27.989
 the ears are back and keeps the folds longitudinal 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.959
 or they do not give, and ears fold 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:36.510
 strips of plaster holding up 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:40.560
 ears in the plane like this glue same beauty 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.560
 eat but in one way
