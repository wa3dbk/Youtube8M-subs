sure not to glue the opening part which

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.640 
sure not to glue the opening part which
is<00:01:47.640> parallel<00:01:48.090> from<00:01:48.540> your<00:01:48.780> folds<00:01:49.140> at<00:01:49.260> the

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
is parallel from your folds at the

is parallel from your folds at the
opening<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.460> time<00:01:50.910> to<00:01:51.270> place<00:01:51.690> your<00:01:51.930> cord<00:01:52.320> in

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
opening it's time to place your cord in

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.340 
opening it's time to place your cord in
between<00:01:53.550> the<00:01:53.850> 1-inch<00:01:54.360> fold<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:55.020> we<00:01:55.170> made

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
between the 1-inch fold that we made

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.469 
between the 1-inch fold that we made
earlier<00:01:55.860> place<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:56.760> glue<00:01:56.940> along<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.330> edge

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
earlier place the glue along the edge

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.859 
earlier place the glue along the edge
and<00:01:58.080> make<00:01:58.800> sure<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.190> cord<00:01:59.580> is<00:01:59.820> close<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.600> that

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
and make sure the cord is close to that

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.920 
and make sure the cord is close to that
fold<00:02:01.140> line<00:02:01.229> then<00:02:02.220> press<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.060> down<00:02:03.090> just<00:02:03.780> like

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
fold line then press it down just like

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.920 
fold line then press it down just like
so<00:02:04.220> make<00:02:05.220> sure<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.430> repeat<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.180> same<00:02:06.420> step<00:02:06.780> on

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
so make sure to repeat the same step on

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.370 
so make sure to repeat the same step on
the<00:02:07.020> other<00:02:07.260> side<00:02:08.630> we<00:02:09.630> are<00:02:09.660> down<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.259> last

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
the other side we are down to the last

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.500 
the other side we are down to the last
few<00:02:10.770> steps<00:02:11.100> all<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.580> have<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.820> do<00:02:11.970> now<00:02:12.209> is

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
few steps all you have to do now is

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.710 
few steps all you have to do now is
insert<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.290> locks<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:13.980> strings<00:02:14.640> on<00:02:14.910> the

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
insert the locks to the strings on the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.780 
insert the locks to the strings on the
sides<00:02:16.050> just<00:02:16.350> like<00:02:16.680> how<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.040> have<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.400> right<00:02:17.730> here

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
sides just like how I have it right here

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.600 
sides just like how I have it right here
because<00:02:18.600> we<00:02:19.080> are<00:02:19.200> doing<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.560> non<00:02:19.709> so<00:02:20.010> method

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
because we are doing the non so method

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.090 
because we are doing the non so method
with<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.270> loose<00:02:21.450> ends<00:02:22.050> ties<00:02:22.680> them<00:02:22.890> together

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
with the loose ends ties them together

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.310 
with the loose ends ties them together
like<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:24.090> this<00:02:24.600> will<00:02:24.810> also<00:02:25.080> make<00:02:25.290> it

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
like so this will also make it

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.680 
like so this will also make it
adjustable<00:02:25.980> just<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.520> case<00:02:26.790> if<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.120> find<00:02:27.510> this

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
adjustable just in case if you find this

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.260 
adjustable just in case if you find this
to<00:02:27.900> be<00:02:28.020> too<00:02:28.260> long<00:02:28.530> or<00:02:28.830> too<00:02:28.890> short<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:30.120> can

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
to be too long or too short you can

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.199 
to be too long or too short you can
always<00:02:30.480> adjust<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:31.140> by<00:02:31.320> loosening<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.950> nuts

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
always adjust this by loosening the nuts

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.180 
always adjust this by loosening the nuts
it<00:02:33.209> is<00:02:33.420> now<00:02:33.600> time<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:34.020> close<00:02:34.440> our<00:02:34.680> bag<00:02:34.920> together

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
it is now time to close our bag together

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.690 
it is now time to close our bag together
so<00:02:35.910> place<00:02:36.390> some<00:02:36.690> glue<00:02:36.739> along<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.950> edges<00:02:38.520> on

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
so place some glue along the edges on

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.830 
so place some glue along the edges on
each<00:02:39.360> side<00:02:40.320> of<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.830> bag<00:02:41.450> carefully<00:02:42.450> press<00:02:42.690> the

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
each side of the bag carefully press the

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.720 
each side of the bag carefully press the
sides<00:02:43.080> down<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:44.870> let<00:02:45.870> this<00:02:46.049> set<00:02:46.410> for<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.250> good

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
sides down and let this set for a good

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.860 
sides down and let this set for a good
couple<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.690> hours<00:02:49.040> before<00:02:50.040> using<00:02:50.610> it<00:02:50.910> I'm
