00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
to finish the daytime look I'm using a

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.040

Revlon lipstick and it's pretty nude

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.439 
Revlon lipstick and it's pretty nude
color<00:04:31.380> it's<00:04:32.280> got<00:04:32.400> a<00:04:32.430> nice<00:04:32.639> gloss<00:04:33.120> to<00:04:33.330> it

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
color it's got a nice gloss to it

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.219 
color it's got a nice gloss to it
actually<00:04:33.810> I<00:04:33.870> love<00:04:34.139> it<00:04:34.289> and<00:04:34.500> it's<00:04:34.919> called<00:04:35.130> blush

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.140 
so it's a really great daytime lipstick
and<00:04:40.470> I<00:04:40.710> think<00:04:40.889> it's<00:04:41.039> a<00:04:41.190> good<00:04:41.400> lipstick<00:04:41.910> for

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.689 
and I think it's a good lipstick for
this<00:04:42.300> whole<00:04:42.510> look<00:04:42.840> so<00:04:43.770> that's<00:04:44.160> my<00:04:44.310> daytime
