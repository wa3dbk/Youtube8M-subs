00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.450
 though not to a movie of not only one 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.130
 quite a formula on the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.049
 canvas does not ban the story 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.660
 behind it seems very interesting too 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.320
 and we would be up to that 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.320
 the butler 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.180
 are they paying politically mister games 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.349

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.730
 I had to agree with you 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.649

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.699

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.730
 then you are going to make something out of it now 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.730
 but no bad word about the hero 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.420

 I like those trailer not too much 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.970
 But betray the right mood 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:52.890
 transport and for more 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.780
 Information is just this 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.610
 Formats trailer checks in the butler 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.049
 will the goods or at least to the 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.239
 inspiring true events 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:04.440
 story of butler eugene alina counts 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.269
 almost 30 years between 1957 and 1986 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.370
 as butler in openoffice respectively 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.590
 worked in the white house and doing so 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.420
 seven us presidents has come and 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.890
 go see and in many moments in 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.390
 where history was written 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.890
 was that's in itself a 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.239
 exciting story and maybe too 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.790
 could influence here and there 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.560
 played by forest whitaker the role 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.540
 But here is armchair games 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.400
 changed in this respect and I think so 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.230
 to see an exciting topic 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.579
 if you pack this all under 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.530
