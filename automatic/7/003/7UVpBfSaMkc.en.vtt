00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 greetings is starting one more edition 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.330
 of today in the world tek 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.230
 you will see nvidia ads and also 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.660
 htc has a concept that unites them with 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.460
 windows phone and other highlights 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.820
 so stay connected when it's time to stay 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:24.390
 updated a Brazilian figured as 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.010
 would be s 7 and windows phone 8 together and 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.230
 elaborated a very interesting concept 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.720
 with this the designer marcelo ivory 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.410
 consider s the most advanced system 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.690
 currently but suffers in customization and 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.030
 interactivity on the home screen in this 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.739
 designer's opinion at the same time and 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.570
 find the windows nice phone 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.719
 precisely because it allows customization 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.329
 the home screen that the concept 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.820
 notifications appear inside the icons 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.489
 the designer added two buttons to the 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.670
 device a key back on a shortcut 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.070
 to activate Mr. 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.879
 did you think of this concept like no 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.980
 liked a lot 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.729
 leave your opinion in the comments of 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.280
 According to a developer android 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.830
 4.4 point 3 to be released soon 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.470
 this developer uses the lexon nickname and 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.630
 published on your twitter the information of 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.689
 that google is already testing the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.740
 update to the qat kit that 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:22.770
 will probably correct a problem 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.210
 reported by some owners of link 5 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.479
 the one from which the photography application 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.460
 it consumes a lot of processing google not 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.130
 commented officially on the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.710
 availability of this update 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.290
 windows xp is still present in more 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.720
 of 10 percent of the computers in the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.630
 Brazil the data is from the security company 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.860
 kaspersky that states that in the last 30 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.930
 10.88 per cent of computers in the 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.700
 brazil were still running this 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.490
 system but this will become a great 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.890
 problem because windows xp will let 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.119
 to receive microsoft support from here 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.280
 two weeks 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.619
 and then these machines will become more 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.990
 vulnerabilities for cybercriminals 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.119
 example Microsoft itself says that 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.209
 xp users become infected three times 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.640
 more than users view or 7 in 10 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.300
 times more than users of Windows 8 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.950
 this on account of my 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.140
 security organizations of that system 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.630
 which are already obsolete 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.600
 another Russian site that already had access to 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.360
 galaxy 5 tested the water resistance of 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.060
 device now was the turn of mobile site 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.890
 review the smartphone was submerged in a 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.860
 meter in an area 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.700
 very dirty the appliance stayed eight 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.890
 minutes there 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.870
 then came a call normally 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.360
 then we can say that according to this 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.970
 test it was okay people point out 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.370
 that the certificate 25 guarantees protection 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.130
 against solid particles 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.710
 resistance to liquids is ensured in 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.630
 in case of water jets or in case of 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.480
 temporary immersion which was what 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.000
 test made the video presented its new 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.460
 gpu that has the pascal name 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.310
 the great novelty is the architecture of 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.860
 differentiated memory that includes new 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.270
 technologies like it see link and chips of 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.550
 3d memory 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.980
 this technology increases the efficiency of 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.630
 modules and reduces energy consumption in 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.850
 up to four times 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.520
 the new pascal cpus will be compatible 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.520
 also with the traditional express pci 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:25.680
 they should arrive in 2016 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:30.280
 has also been announced to taito z that has 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:33.880
 5,760 cores cuda 12 gb of memory and 8 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:39.070
 will have flops processing but the price 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:40.810
 z the rate is 999 US dollars to 2000 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.470
 nor to make the accounts of how much will be in the 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.160
 Brazil 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.800
 htc revealed n8 is a device with 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.380
 interesting features it has full screen 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.100
 5-inch hd processor cualcomm 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:57.700
 garrett 2.3 snapdragon 801 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.370
 some markets or 2.5 gigahertz in 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:04.000
 other 2 gb of ram and 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.120
 16 or 32 gb expandable storage 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.640
 with android system microsd 4.4 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.500
 several sensors two speakers in the 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.470
 front and with resources to improve 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.560
 battery life of up to 20 hours in 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.109
 connection and almost 500 hours in stand by 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.110
 the rear camera is 4 megapixels with 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.330
 ultra-fixed technology and it has two 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.800
 this second lens provides 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.560
 depth effects 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.110
 can give special touches the photos is 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.060
 possible to adjust the focus of the image after 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.800
 that it was taken for example the 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.389
 still has a front facing camera. 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.009
 5 megapixels 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.710
 onemi 8 will be available globally 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:44.379
 from the month of April more devices 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.479
 I do not usually come here for the 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:49.180
 Brazil and this was another edition of 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.069
 Today in the world, the links of everything
