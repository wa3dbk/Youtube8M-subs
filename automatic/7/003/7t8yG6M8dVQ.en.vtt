level 3 I take my W so when I go for

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.870 
level 3 I take my W so when I go for
ganks<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.630> slows<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.920> slow<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.220> amazing

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
ganks it slows and that slow is amazing

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.399 
ganks it slows and that slow is amazing
for<00:01:54.060> ganks<00:01:54.329> because<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:54.780> pretty<00:01:55.110> much<00:01:55.350> like

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
for ganks because it's pretty much like

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.440 
for ganks because it's pretty much like
an<00:01:55.829> exhaust<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:56.790> has<00:01:56.909> like<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.149> 10

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
because I was kind of hurt and it

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.400 
because I was kind of hurt and it
wouldn't<00:03:13.739> be<00:03:13.830> good<00:03:13.950> for<00:03:14.190> me<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.340> go<00:03:14.459> on<00:03:14.580> a<00:03:14.670> gank

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
this low for my team because it probably

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.599 
this low for my team because it probably
would<00:03:18.450> ended<00:03:18.750> up<00:03:18.930> with<00:03:19.170> us<00:03:19.350> dying<00:03:19.829> and<00:03:20.220> that's

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
would ended up with us dying and that's

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.940 
would ended up with us dying and that's
just<00:03:21.030> not<00:03:21.269> fun<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:21.840> it<00:03:21.989> just<00:03:22.530> doesn't<00:03:22.829> help

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
just not fun and it just doesn't help

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.069 
just not fun and it just doesn't help
and<00:03:23.160> matter<00:03:23.910> of<00:03:24.030> fact<00:03:24.090> this<00:03:24.450> freaking<00:03:24.870> red
