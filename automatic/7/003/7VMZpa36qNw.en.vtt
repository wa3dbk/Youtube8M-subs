is not good for you because of the

is not good for you because of the
estrogen<00:00:57.800> let's<00:00:58.800> be<00:00:58.980> really<00:00:59.250> clear<00:00:59.280> soy<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.330> a

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
estrogen let's be really clear soy is a

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.860 
estrogen let's be really clear soy is a
bean<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:01.140> doesn't<00:01:01.830> contain<00:01:02.220> hormones

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
bean it doesn't contain hormones

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.050 
bean it doesn't contain hormones
vertebrates<00:01:03.870> like<00:01:04.110> humans<00:01:04.800> and<00:01:05.100> mammals<00:01:05.580> and

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
vertebrates like humans and mammals and

even insects have hormones beans do not

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.100 
even insects have hormones beans do not
so<00:01:10.380> while<00:01:10.590> there<00:01:10.860> are<00:01:10.940> hormones<00:01:11.940> in<00:01:12.330> cow's

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
so while there are hormones in cow's

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.260

the confusion and the misinformation

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.190 
the confusion and the misinformation
stems<00:01:48.390> from<00:01:48.690> this<00:01:49.369> soy<00:01:50.369> contains<00:01:51.200> isoflavones
