area<00:00:05.370> this<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:05.640> where<00:00:05.940> we<00:00:06.150> talk<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.899> our

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
area this is where we talk to our

spacecraft

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.140 

tonight<00:00:14.049> we're<00:00:14.379> going<00:00:15.099> to<00:00:15.190> be<00:00:15.369> getting<00:00:16.059> the

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
tonight we're going to be getting the

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.859 
tonight we're going to be getting the
data<00:00:16.360> back<00:00:16.449> from<00:00:16.630> a<00:00:17.200> magnetometer<00:00:17.740> roll

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
data back from a magnetometer roll

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.080 
data back from a magnetometer roll
calibration<00:00:19.869> maneuver<00:00:20.320> and<00:00:20.860> that<00:00:21.759> maneuver

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
calibration maneuver and that maneuver

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.760 
calibration maneuver and that maneuver
actually<00:00:22.539> happened<00:00:23.020> on<00:00:23.140> the<00:00:23.259> Voyager<00:00:23.619> 1

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
actually happened on the Voyager 1

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.429 
actually happened on the Voyager 1
spacecraft<00:00:23.919> more<00:00:24.699> than<00:00:25.000> 16<00:00:25.480> hours<00:00:25.660> ago<00:00:25.809> but

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
spacecraft more than 16 hours ago but

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:27.870 
spacecraft more than 16 hours ago but
the<00:00:26.559> data<00:00:26.710> is<00:00:26.860> finally<00:00:27.279> making<00:00:27.460> it<00:00:27.669> back<00:00:27.820> to

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
the data is finally making it back to

the data is finally making it back to
the<00:00:28.149> earth<00:00:28.349> what<00:00:29.349> we're<00:00:29.500> doing<00:00:29.770> is<00:00:29.890> a<00:00:29.919> roll

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
the earth what we're doing is a roll

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.150 
the earth what we're doing is a roll
about<00:00:30.460> this<00:00:30.910> high<00:00:31.090> gain<00:00:31.300> antenna<00:00:31.750> and<00:00:32.439> so<00:00:32.770> if

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
about this high gain antenna and so if

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.130 
about this high gain antenna and so if
if<00:00:33.550> the<00:00:33.670> high<00:00:33.790> gain<00:00:33.969> antenna<00:00:34.329> here<00:00:34.600> is<00:00:34.750> pointed

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
if the high gain antenna here is pointed

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.139 
if the high gain antenna here is pointed
out<00:00:35.290> toward<00:00:35.680> the<00:00:35.739> earth<00:00:36.040> we're<00:00:36.820> gonna<00:00:36.940> be

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
out toward the earth we're gonna be

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.950 
out toward the earth we're gonna be
rolling<00:00:37.390> the<00:00:37.719> spacecraft<00:00:39.090> along<00:00:40.090> that<00:00:40.360> I<00:00:40.570> gain

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
rolling the spacecraft along that I gain

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.770 
rolling the spacecraft along that I gain
antenna<00:00:41.440> that<00:00:41.829> roll<00:00:42.130> is<00:00:42.340> done<00:00:42.640> so<00:00:43.000> that<00:00:43.240> we<00:00:43.480> can

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
antenna that roll is done so that we can

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.280 
antenna that roll is done so that we can
calibrate<00:00:44.200> the<00:00:44.650> instrument<00:00:45.160> so<00:00:46.060> that<00:00:46.170> when<00:00:47.170> we

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
calibrate the instrument so that when we

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.800 
calibrate the instrument so that when we
take<00:00:47.500> data<00:00:47.770> we<00:00:48.520> know<00:00:48.760> what<00:00:49.210> magnetic<00:00:49.630> field

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
take data we know what magnetic field

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.120 
take data we know what magnetic field
belongs<00:00:50.050> to<00:00:50.230> the<00:00:50.320> Sun<00:00:50.500> and<00:00:50.680> what<00:00:50.800> what

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
means it's 11 billion miles out and

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.229 
means it's 11 billion miles out and
Voyager<00:01:01.600> 2<00:01:01.840> is<00:01:02.350> 9<00:01:02.559> billion<00:01:03.130> miles<00:01:03.340> out<00:01:03.640> there

the boundary we don't know how close

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.460 
the boundary we don't know how close
because<00:01:13.180> no<00:01:13.360> spacecraft<00:01:13.659> has<00:01:14.110> ever<00:01:14.260> been

because no spacecraft has ever been

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.039 
because no spacecraft has ever been
there<00:01:14.650> before<00:01:14.710> but<00:01:15.700> it<00:01:15.820> could<00:01:16.030> be<00:01:16.150> another<00:01:16.420> few

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
there before but it could be another few

months it could be another few years but
it's<00:01:19.360> probably<00:01:19.780> not<00:01:19.960> much<00:01:20.200> longer<00:01:20.650> than<00:01:20.799> that

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
it's probably not much longer than that

creates<00:01:26.920> around<00:01:27.369> itself<00:01:27.670> because<00:01:28.299> it's

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
creates around itself because it's

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.080

Voyager<00:02:04.960> 1<00:02:05.170> will<00:02:05.350> leave<00:02:05.560> this<00:02:05.770> thick<00:02:06.040> region

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
Voyager 1 will leave this thick region

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.029 
Voyager 1 will leave this thick region
and<00:02:06.640> enter<00:02:07.210> interstellar<00:02:07.750> space<00:02:08.140> it's<00:02:08.979> really

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
and enter interstellar space it's really

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.520 
and enter interstellar space it's really
remarkable<00:02:09.610> we<00:02:10.060> have<00:02:10.269> a<00:02:10.299> 20<00:02:10.840> watt<00:02:11.049> transmitter

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
remarkable we have a 20 watt transmitter

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.190 
remarkable we have a 20 watt transmitter
on<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.010> spacecraft<00:02:12.329> transmitting<00:02:13.329> over<00:02:13.480> 11

billion<00:02:14.500> miles<00:02:14.980> away<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.209> it<00:02:16.329> comes<00:02:16.540> in

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
billion miles away and so it comes in

billion miles away and so it comes in
very<00:02:16.959> slowly<00:02:17.560> but<00:02:18.280> every<00:02:18.610> bit<00:02:18.910> left<00:02:19.420> that

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
very slowly but every bit left that

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.760 
very slowly but every bit left that
spacecraft<00:02:19.930> over<00:02:20.410> 16<00:02:20.950> hours

spacecraft over 16 hours
every<00:02:22.250> bit<00:02:22.460> is<00:02:22.610> telling<00:02:22.940> us<00:02:23.090> something<00:02:23.360> new

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
every bit is telling us something new

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.020 
every bit is telling us something new
that<00:02:23.990> we<00:02:24.110> haven't<00:02:24.380> known<00:02:24.560> before
