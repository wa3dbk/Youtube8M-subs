00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
been using tablets that long I reckon it

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.580 
been using tablets that long I reckon it
I<00:00:17.250> wouldn't<00:00:17.760> need<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.720> don't<00:00:18.900> not<00:00:19.230> do

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
anything really complicated so here's

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.420

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
bamboo capture it doesn't have the sign

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.029 
bamboo capture it doesn't have the sign
up<00:00:27.150> buttons<00:00:27.570> across<00:00:27.689> here<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.380> it's<00:00:28.890> not

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
up buttons across here and it's not

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.849 
up buttons across here and it's not
multi-touch<00:00:29.580> but<00:00:30.330> that's<00:00:30.449> okay<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.900> don't<00:00:31.650> need

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
multi-touch so that's good so let's see

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.479 
multi-touch so that's good so let's see
our<00:00:35.790> way<00:00:36.059> around<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.360> box<00:00:36.920> so<00:00:37.920> personalized

software<00:03:46.840> so<00:03:47.840> this<00:03:48.139> is<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.410> driver<00:03:48.680> this<00:03:49.400> is<00:03:49.579> a

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
software so this is the driver this is a

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.090 
software so this is the driver this is a
software<00:03:50.060> bundle<00:03:50.299> that<00:03:50.660> includes<00:03:50.720> all<00:03:51.350> disc

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100

software bundle that includes all disc
SketchBook<00:03:52.730> Express<00:03:52.850> and<00:03:53.980> we<00:03:54.980> don't<00:03:55.069> need

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
SketchBook Express and we don't need

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.550 
SketchBook Express and we don't need
that<00:03:55.430> so<00:03:56.290> put<00:03:57.290> that<00:03:57.440> aside

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.330 

so<00:04:01.160> let's<00:04:01.340> get<00:04:01.459> to<00:04:01.520> tablet<00:04:02.300> and<00:04:05.530> so<00:04:06.530> it's<00:04:06.680> a<00:04:06.860> bit

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
so let's get to tablet and so it's a bit

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.150 
so let's get to tablet and so it's a bit
thick<00:04:07.610> but<00:04:07.849> you<00:04:08.630> have<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:08.870> move<00:04:09.110> but<00:04:09.739> overall

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
thick but you have to move but overall

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.520 
thick but you have to move but overall
it's<00:04:10.489> pretty<00:04:10.640> simple<00:04:11.270> oh<00:04:13.840> okay<00:04:14.840> that<00:04:15.080> comes<00:04:15.290> in

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
it's pretty simple oh okay that comes in

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.409 
it's pretty simple oh okay that comes in
you<00:04:16.430> know<00:04:16.549> every<00:04:17.209> light<00:04:18.130> polystyrene<00:04:19.130> type

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
you know every light polystyrene type

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.240 
you know every light polystyrene type
packaging<00:04:20.419> okay<00:04:21.320> and<00:04:21.500> there's<00:04:21.919> piece<00:04:22.130> of

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
packaging okay and there's piece of

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.330 
packaging okay and there's piece of
paper<00:04:22.430> which<00:04:22.790> protects<00:04:23.360> something<00:04:24.169> I<00:04:24.350> think

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
paper which protects something I think

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.159 
paper which protects something I think
maybe<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:25.790> velocity<00:04:26.450> is<00:04:26.600> some<00:04:26.960> glossy

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
maybe the velocity is some glossy

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.230 
maybe the velocity is some glossy
plastic<00:04:27.500> here<00:04:28.010> which<00:04:28.639> needs<00:04:28.910> to<00:04:28.940> be<00:04:29.000> protected

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
plastic here which needs to be protected

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.520 
plastic here which needs to be protected
so<00:04:30.940> rather<00:04:31.940> I<00:04:32.120> think<00:04:32.389> I<00:04:32.480> just<00:04:32.540> rip<00:04:33.229> the<00:04:33.350> tape

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
so rather I think I just rip the tape

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:41.230 
so rather I think I just rip the tape
off<00:04:36.880> ok<00:04:37.880> so<00:04:38.180> here<00:04:38.990> is<00:04:39.260> then<00:04:39.700> here<00:04:40.700> is<00:04:40.850> a<00:04:40.880> green

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
off ok so here is then here is a green

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.629 
off ok so here is then here is a green
bottom<00:04:41.630> it's<00:04:42.470> actually<00:04:42.710> nice<00:04:42.860> and<00:04:42.919> dense<00:04:43.280> and

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
bottom it's actually nice and dense and

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.170 
bottom it's actually nice and dense and
I<00:04:44.510> bought<00:04:44.990> the<00:04:45.080> old<00:04:45.200> bamboo<00:04:45.710> multi<00:04:46.700> touch<00:04:46.880> pen

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
I bought the old bamboo multi touch pen

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.540 
I bought the old bamboo multi touch pen
and<00:04:47.330> touch<00:04:47.450> and<00:04:47.720> this<00:04:48.470> feels<00:04:48.650> a<00:04:48.800> bit<00:04:49.220> more

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
and touch and this feels a bit more

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.969 
and touch and this feels a bit more
dense<00:04:49.820> maybe<00:04:50.120> because<00:04:50.900> of<00:04:51.050> its<00:04:51.169> inner<00:04:51.470> profile

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
dense maybe because of its inner profile

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:56.590 
dense maybe because of its inner profile
um<00:04:53.410> that<00:04:54.410> feels<00:04:54.440> like<00:04:54.830> that<00:04:55.250> way<00:04:55.430> here<00:04:56.389> comes

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
um that feels like that way here comes

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.170 
um that feels like that way here comes
with<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:58.060> strap<00:04:59.060> where<00:04:59.270> you<00:04:59.330> hold<00:04:59.450> the<00:04:59.570> pen<00:04:59.919> so

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
with the strap where you hold the pen so

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:09.370 
with the strap where you hold the pen so
get<00:05:02.180> the<00:05:02.300> pin<00:05:02.479> out<00:05:02.510> really<00:05:02.870> quickly<00:05:07.240> okay<00:05:08.380> so

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
get the pin out really quickly okay so

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.909 
get the pin out really quickly okay so
you're<00:05:10.100> just<00:05:10.280> only<00:05:10.729> you're<00:05:10.850> done<00:05:11.770> slide<00:05:12.770> the

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
you're just only you're done slide the

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.029 
you're just only you're done slide the
pin<00:05:13.130> through<00:05:13.340> here<00:05:13.660> which<00:05:15.039> actually

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
pin through here which actually

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.659
