00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 I would like to recommend my friends 

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:05.879
 go to the cinemax channel goal and see 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.069
 videos 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.260
 cybersport direction and that is 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.929
 each video takes no more than 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.150
 30 seconds and so you can see 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.000
 fast with pleasure and deliver 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.230
 like a fat come see link in 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.840
 description hello hello to all who love 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:28.349
 watch watch the spectrum again dust2 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.730
 but here we have what I already have a lot 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.829
 patrols reviewed on this particular map 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.899
 probably the easiest way to roll those who 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.570
 here and so shoots a little in advance 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.149
 Like this one with speed at the moment 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.120
 more under all flash drives 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:48.539
 which flew out of the slots banks up well 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:55.320
 so here so we look at the scoreboard over 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:57.899
 bummer 10 7 score 45 in favor of 54 more precisely 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.059
 favor of terrorists 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:08.159
 attacks round for special forces his tones whose 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:10.650
 and here is a classic of the genre of us second aspect 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.369
 Savika my somehow he transferred so on 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.119
 parapet interestingly he kills an iceberg 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:23.390
 just like the name beer go to the point 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:25.890
 used two children potsyk and destroy from so 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.210
 913 saved our aspects of you 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.939
 oh already 9 he kills donkey who is either 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.030
 hung on a general stood looking somewhere 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.360
 incomprehensibly dies without a task and 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.920
 the next round before our eyes so 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.920
 he knows that there aviki 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.500
 we don't want to go out on aviki kill with 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.659
 bison shot just the length of it 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.820
 brother on and us aspect just like 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.100
 rooted to the spot is looking at the spawn 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.020
 so moves the gun why why are you 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.630
 move the sight apparently felt that 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.369
 someone jumped on concrete blocks 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:06.030
 so fly fly taken knowing today 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.100
 cheating trend we may know about 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.200
 what 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.780
 usually there was a hacker they buy 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.080
 sniper rifles whether that be 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.870
 aviki like flies or nose nose 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.959
 wiki of course when there is enough money 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:24.800
 why because when you had a hack 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:28.850
 you can shoot in advance so we 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:32.420
 battle battles states aspect awaits release 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.970
 canary of this so here you can when these 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.040
 wall hack you can know in advance when 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.530
 shoot and you don't even need to move 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.780
 You took aim at one place and 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.739
 you look the guy runs out and into it 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:49.010
 you shoot everything just if you have a 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:52.730
 they are something you already buy the usual 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.190
 rifles such as the AK-47 to imho 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.370
 to run and destroy the enemy in 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.620
 head so here is this typical suspect 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.100
 repeatedly we have already seen it with 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.540
 and for centuries a sum with flies that shoot 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.640
 in advance it is already a classic classic and 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.310
 it is possible therefore when you look 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.459
 their patrols just therefore already 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.549
 to determine if AIDS runs on 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.730
 for centuries with a fly and shoots in advance no 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:27.650
 pink will not help him no he was not pink 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.780
 otmazhet it specifically shaft hacker order 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.540
 more here is how you see it, he monitors 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.970
 monitor where the enemy is located 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.420
 just the feeling that he was given cheats 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.060
 and he says that he is dealing with cheats 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.209
 and what to do with them is he somehow not 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:48.010
 applies his super abilities to 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:51.019
 order to raise the score of your team 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.530
 you see that it seems when we noticed 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.840
 what he has here waiting here so 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.140
 so op op click click click on 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:03.260
 got a button 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:06.260
 than bad uhack you just saw 1 he 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.859
 killed in the head lucky can be said about 2 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:14.090
 he simply could not aim the sight 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:16.160
 risochki bring to the head so yes wow 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.970
 how good it is but you still need to shoot 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.530
 be able to 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.410
 yourself com just click on the button 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.480
 right moment so exiting . b action action 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.090
 keep giving let's press 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.680
 press click well well what are you for 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.130
 counter-strike so when you look 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.970
 on 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:34.810
 type can not kill him does not know not 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:38.000
 knows what he do so ran 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:41.390
 kill the gate type and not scanned 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.240
 right side and on the right is god and his just 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:47.810
 killed well what is logical three types 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.180
 1 left will be 2 of the rise of one rush 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.760
 so he observes intently in a jar 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.480
 probably something knows something our knows 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.910
 the guy knows something about the reaction yes 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.310
 what is the reaction there just shoots you 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:05.180
 You see that straight is the best type and immediately 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:09.860
 got to the head 2 handsome same 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.980
 the most nothing but decided to invent how 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.950
 come out just like your bro 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:18.830
 it is necessary to run out to run out at the foot force 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:22.160
 heroic and finish the tower 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:25.340
 this sniper the more fly has 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.750
 a chance for a miss or even if you hit 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.750
 you have a chance to kill and you 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.840
 again fall for the canary he feels 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:38.090
 so looking and see what went in here 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.970
 gut and with aids of course moved to 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:44.180
 point kill guy but you see here 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:48.680
 and very easy arithmetic is nothing 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:51.350
 come up don't need help aiming 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:54.020
 there is no detection there are others no and 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:58.390
 minor violation not under about 1 at home 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:03.050
 no, too, so using detection 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:05.060
 publish come on kazgu fastz.ru 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.220
 leave items and win bets 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.140
 Others make skins and to achieve 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.180
 maximum number of players and their 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.190
 threw off the system determines the winner 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:17.960
 the chance of winning depends on the cost 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:18.880
 skins you made link in description 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.120
 so he 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:25.110
 that there aviki it something like that under 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.110
 chicago cycle and
