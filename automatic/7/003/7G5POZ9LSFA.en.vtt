all right this is the latest steam beta
with<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.670> in-home<00:00:09.360> streaming<00:00:10.160> so<00:00:11.160> right<00:00:11.340> now

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
with the in-home streaming so right now

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.110 
with the in-home streaming so right now
I'm<00:00:11.730> in<00:00:12.240> my<00:00:12.270> regular<00:00:13.310> big<00:00:14.310> picture<00:00:14.670> mode<00:00:14.850> here

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
I'm in my regular big picture mode here

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.529 
I'm in my regular big picture mode here
I'm<00:00:15.870> playing<00:00:16.350> on<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.560> laptop<00:00:16.820> which<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:18.000> more

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
I'm playing on a laptop which is more

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.160 
I'm playing on a laptop which is more
there<00:00:22.100> so<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.280> all<00:00:23.550> done<00:00:23.580> locally<00:00:24.020> but<00:00:25.020> if

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
there so this is all done locally but if

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.189 
there so this is all done locally but if
I<00:00:25.289> check<00:00:25.500> out<00:00:25.619> my<00:00:25.770> library<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.460> have<00:00:27.119> all<00:00:27.960> my

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
I check out my library I have all my

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.850 
I check out my library I have all my
games<00:00:28.410> here<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:29.300> I<00:00:30.300> have<00:00:30.480> on<00:00:30.660> my<00:00:30.860> stationary

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
games here that I have on my stationary

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.380 
games here that I have on my stationary
PC<00:00:32.809> so<00:00:33.809> I'll<00:00:34.260> just<00:00:34.700> start<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:35.850> BioShock

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
PC so I'll just start this BioShock

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.479 
PC so I'll just start this BioShock
Infinite<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.680> actually<00:00:38.100> on<00:00:38.280> my

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
Infinite so this is actually on my

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.600 
Infinite so this is actually on my
stationary<00:00:39.120> PC<00:00:39.500> so<00:00:40.500> it's<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.800> stream<00:00:41.309> here

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
stationary PC so it's a stream here

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.650 
stationary PC so it's a stream here
instead<00:00:41.970> I'll<00:00:42.390> zoom<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:43.970> it's<00:00:44.970> a<00:00:45.090> stream<00:00:45.420> there

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
instead I'll zoom in it's a stream there

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.459 
instead I'll zoom in it's a stream there
and<00:00:46.910> what<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.059> means<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:49.440> will

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
and what that means is that it will

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.130 
and what that means is that it will
actually<00:00:49.800> stream<00:00:50.370> from<00:00:50.820> my<00:00:51.000> stationary<00:00:51.570> PC<00:00:51.870> to

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
actually stream from my stationary PC to

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.000 
actually stream from my stationary PC to
my<00:00:52.320> laptop<00:00:52.670> and<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:55.410> stationary<00:00:55.890> is

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
my laptop and so the the stationary is

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.889 
my laptop and so the the stationary is
doing<00:00:56.219> all<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.460> heavy<00:00:56.579> lifting<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.239> my

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
doing all the heavy lifting and my

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.340 
doing all the heavy lifting and my
laptop<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.829> just<00:00:59.300> displaying<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.930> images

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
laptop is just displaying the the images

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.850 
laptop is just displaying the the images
basically<00:01:02.090> so<00:01:03.090> I'll<00:01:03.180> start<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.680> we'll<00:01:04.680> see

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
basically so I'll start that we'll see

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.740 
basically so I'll start that we'll see
if<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.039> works<00:01:05.250> because<00:01:05.579> I've<00:01:06.000> had<00:01:06.210> some<00:01:06.450> sync

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
if it works because I've had some sync

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.030 
if it works because I've had some sync
issues<00:01:08.690> once<00:01:09.690> you<00:01:09.810> start<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.170> here<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.590> will<00:01:10.770> be

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
issues once you start it here it will be

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.630 
issues once you start it here it will be
some<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:12.090> will<00:01:12.270> show<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> warning<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.520> now<00:01:14.520> it

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
some it will show a warning and now it

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.170 
some it will show a warning and now it
works<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.830> won't<00:01:16.830> complain<00:01:17.180> unnecessarily

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
works so I won't complain unnecessarily

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.480 
works so I won't complain unnecessarily
I<00:01:20.479> skip<00:01:21.479> these<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.500> now<00:01:22.650> actually<00:01:22.860> not

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
I skip these so this is now actually not

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:34.560 
I skip these so this is now actually not
running<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.970> laptop

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.580 

so<00:01:35.170> if<00:01:35.320> I<00:01:35.500> just<00:01:36.010> start<00:01:36.430> a<00:01:36.520> game<00:01:36.670> here<00:01:36.910> and<00:01:37.590> the

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
so if I just start a game here and the

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.710 
so if I just start a game here and the
first<00:01:38.830> reaction<00:01:39.040> sigh<00:01:39.520> I<00:01:39.550> mean<00:01:39.910> this<00:01:40.360> is

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
first reaction sigh I mean this is

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.500 
first reaction sigh I mean this is
really<00:01:41.260> smooth<00:01:44.190> the<00:01:45.190> input<00:01:45.490> latency<00:01:45.640> is<00:01:46.030> slow

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
really smooth the input latency is slow

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.820 
really smooth the input latency is slow
I<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:48.340> it<00:01:48.550> I'll<00:01:49.360> bring<00:01:49.870> up<00:01:49.960> my<00:01:50.020> controller<00:01:50.470> so

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
I like it I'll bring up my controller so

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.510 
I like it I'll bring up my controller so
maybe<00:01:51.250> you<00:01:51.370> can<00:01:51.520> see<00:01:52.979> get<00:01:53.979> a<00:01:54.010> feeling<00:01:54.370> for

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
maybe you can see get a feeling for

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:02.580 
maybe you can see get a feeling for
about<00:01:54.790> how<00:01:55.920> how<00:01:56.920> long<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.400> latency<00:01:57.820> is<00:02:01.590> so

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
about how how long the latency is so

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.609 
about how how long the latency is so
there<00:02:02.770> we<00:02:02.890> go<00:02:04.440> I'm<00:02:05.440> on<00:02:05.910> what's<00:02:06.910> this<00:02:07.060> called

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
there we go I'm on what's this called

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.880 
there we go I'm on what's this called
something<00:02:08.619> Beach<00:02:08.830> maybe<00:02:09.420> anyway<00:02:10.620> so<00:02:11.620> if<00:02:11.740> I

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
something Beach maybe anyway so if I

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.480 
something Beach maybe anyway so if I
move<00:02:12.190> around<00:02:12.490> if<00:02:12.850> I<00:02:13.000> look<00:02:13.180> around<00:02:14.310> there<00:02:15.310> is<00:02:15.459> a

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
move around if I look around there is a

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.760 
move around if I look around there is a
slight<00:02:15.760> delay<00:02:15.910> but<00:02:16.300> I<00:02:16.480> mean<00:02:16.930> if<00:02:17.410> you're<00:02:17.560> using

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
slight delay but I mean if you're using

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.220 
slight delay but I mean if you're using
a<00:02:18.010> controller<00:02:18.400> it<00:02:18.730> won't<00:02:19.030> be<00:02:19.240> that<00:02:19.450> that's<00:02:19.900> not

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
a controller it won't be that that's not

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.870 
a controller it won't be that that's not
an<00:02:20.380> obstacle<00:02:20.830> anyway<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:23.100> so<00:02:26.370> I'll<00:02:27.370> zoom<00:02:27.430> in<00:02:27.760> a

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
an obstacle anyway so so I'll zoom in a

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:35.220 
an obstacle anyway so so I'll zoom in a
bit<00:02:27.910> more<00:02:28.239> I<00:02:28.270> think

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:42.420 

and<00:02:35.560> just<00:02:36.280> here's<00:02:36.819> the<00:02:36.910> button<00:02:37.209> sir<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.830> this

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
and just here's the button sir and this

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.339 
and just here's the button sir and this
is<00:02:42.610> absolutely<00:02:43.209> doable

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.880 

maybe<00:02:47.349> not<00:02:47.560> for<00:02:47.709> multiplayer<00:02:48.099> games<00:02:48.370> I<00:02:48.640> mean

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
maybe not for multiplayer games I mean

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.410 
maybe not for multiplayer games I mean
that<00:02:50.890> I<00:02:51.160> think<00:02:51.489> that<00:02:51.940> would<00:02:52.060> be<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:52.209> bit

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
that I think that would be a bit

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.870 
that I think that would be a bit
frustrating<00:02:53.040> but<00:02:54.040> for<00:02:54.220> single-player<00:02:54.519> games

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
frustrating but for single-player games

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.780 
frustrating but for single-player games
this<00:02:55.060> works<00:02:55.360> really<00:02:56.080> quite<00:02:56.260> actually<00:02:56.790> I'm

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
this works really quite actually I'm

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:58.290 
this works really quite actually I'm
impressed

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
impressed

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.839 
impressed
I'm<00:02:58.690> running<00:02:59.080> this<00:02:59.200> at<00:02:59.470> 720p<00:03:00.930> right<00:03:01.930> now

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
I'm running this at 720p right now

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.699 
I'm running this at 720p right now
battleship<00:03:03.849> Bay<00:03:04.060> okay<00:03:04.510> so<00:03:04.959> it<00:03:05.080> wasn't<00:03:05.260> beach

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.039 

so<00:03:08.709> if<00:03:09.190> we<00:03:09.310> go<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:09.580> look<00:03:09.700> how<00:03:09.880> it<00:03:10.000> looks<00:03:10.030> on<00:03:10.989> the

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
so if we go and look how it looks on the

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:21.140 
so if we go and look how it looks on the
stationary<00:03:11.530> PC<00:03:12.599> this<00:03:13.599> is<00:03:13.720> running<00:03:13.989> here<00:03:14.140> now

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.430 

and<00:03:22.150> here<00:03:22.599> it's<00:03:22.690> running<00:03:22.959> as<00:03:23.049> well<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.380> you

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
and here it's running as well and you

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.220 
and here it's running as well and you
can<00:03:23.590> hear<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.890> sound<00:03:24.130> and<00:03:24.340> everything<00:03:24.819> I

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
can hear the sound and everything I

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.170 
can hear the sound and everything I
wonder<00:03:26.230> if<00:03:26.290> I<00:03:26.410> can<00:03:26.700> yeah<00:03:27.700> I<00:03:27.730> can<00:03:27.910> move<00:03:28.060> around

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
wonder if I can yeah I can move around

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.780 
wonder if I can yeah I can move around
here<00:03:28.480> as<00:03:28.569> well

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:45.780 

so<00:03:33.790> if<00:03:33.910> I<00:03:34.030> look<00:03:34.360> to<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.870> sea<00:03:35.230> here

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.270 

so<00:03:46.790> this<00:03:46.969> works<00:03:47.180> really<00:03:47.780> well<00:03:48.499> but<00:03:49.010> there<00:03:49.159> are

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
so this works really well but there are

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.349 
so this works really well but there are
some<00:03:49.519> games<00:03:49.670> that<00:03:49.819> don't<00:03:50.120> work<00:03:50.359> as<00:03:50.599> well<00:03:52.090> if<00:03:53.090> I

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
some games that don't work as well if I

00:03:53.359 --> 00:04:00.849 
some games that don't work as well if I
quit<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.959> desktop<00:03:58.389> and<00:03:59.389> start<00:03:59.900> for<00:04:00.439> example

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
quit the desktop and start for example

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:07.179 
quit the desktop and start for example
Metro<00:04:01.450> last<00:04:02.450> light<00:04:05.290> for<00:04:06.290> some<00:04:06.500> reason<00:04:06.889> this

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:07.189 
Metro last light for some reason this

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:12.640

game<00:04:07.900> chugs<00:04:08.900> along<00:04:10.209> way<00:04:11.209> now<00:04:12.079> it<00:04:12.200> seems<00:04:12.409> to<00:04:12.469> run

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
game chugs along way now it seems to run

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.240 
game chugs along way now it seems to run
fine

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.229 

can<00:04:16.090> ya<00:04:17.280> this<00:04:18.280> is<00:04:18.400> a<00:04:18.430> bit<00:04:18.670> after<00:04:19.000> all

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
can ya this is a bit after all

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.020 
can ya this is a bit after all
last<00:04:19.930> time<00:04:20.079> I<00:04:20.230> launched<00:04:20.590> it<00:04:20.650> I<00:04:20.799> got<00:04:21.040> like<00:04:21.310> five

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
last time I launched it I got like five

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.850 
last time I launched it I got like five
frames<00:04:22.360> per<00:04:22.600> second<00:04:22.960> so<00:04:23.910> but<00:04:24.910> this<00:04:25.000> is<00:04:25.060> nice<00:04:25.860> so

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
frames per second so but this is nice so

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.150 
frames per second so but this is nice so
I'll<00:04:26.920> try<00:04:27.100> to<00:04:27.160> start<00:04:27.430> this<00:04:27.610> as<00:04:27.820> well<00:04:31.980> yeah<00:04:32.980> now

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
I'll try to start this as well yeah now

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.040 
I'll try to start this as well yeah now
it<00:04:33.280> works<00:04:33.460> fine<00:04:33.700> this<00:04:34.540> is<00:04:34.660> great

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
it works fine this is great

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.870 
it works fine this is great
I<00:04:36.540> mean<00:04:37.540> Chuck's<00:04:37.810> a<00:04:38.140> bit<00:04:38.440> sometimes<00:04:39.280> but<00:04:39.640> for

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
I mean Chuck's a bit sometimes but for

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.010 
I mean Chuck's a bit sometimes but for
the<00:04:40.780> most<00:04:40.960> part<00:04:41.260> it<00:04:41.410> works<00:04:41.740> well<00:04:42.340> I<00:04:42.840> guess<00:04:43.840> that

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
the most part it works well I guess that

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.430 
the most part it works well I guess that
depends<00:04:44.350> on<00:04:44.560> how<00:04:45.450> lower<00:04:46.450> the<00:04:46.630> volume<00:04:46.870> in<00:04:47.170> it<00:04:47.200> I

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
depends on how lower the volume in it I

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.770 
depends on how lower the volume in it I
guess<00:04:47.860> that<00:04:48.010> depends<00:04:48.340> on<00:04:48.490> how<00:04:49.830> how<00:04:50.830> good

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
guess that depends on how how good

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.180 
guess that depends on how how good
reception<00:04:52.780> you<00:04:52.870> have<00:04:52.990> on<00:04:53.110> your<00:04:53.230> Wi-Fi<00:04:53.650> and<00:04:53.680> and

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
reception you have on your Wi-Fi and and

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.240 
reception you have on your Wi-Fi and and
so<00:04:54.400> on<00:04:54.550> or<00:04:54.850> you<00:04:55.600> could<00:04:55.720> do<00:04:55.840> this<00:04:56.130> with<00:04:57.130> an

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
so on or you could do this with an

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.710 
so on or you could do this with an
Ethernet<00:04:57.610> cable<00:04:57.790> that<00:04:58.120> would<00:04:58.270> probably<00:04:58.480> work

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
Ethernet cable that would probably work

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.360 
Ethernet cable that would probably work
best<00:04:59.050> but<00:05:01.110> how<00:05:02.110> do<00:05:02.170> i<00:05:02.350> I've<00:05:02.740> never<00:05:02.800> played<00:05:03.190> with

best but how do i I've never played with

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.390 
best but how do i I've never played with

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
a controller before so where is the

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:17.760 
a controller before so where is the
flashlight<00:05:06.640> do<00:05:07.060> I<00:05:07.120> even<00:05:07.270> have<00:05:07.390> one
