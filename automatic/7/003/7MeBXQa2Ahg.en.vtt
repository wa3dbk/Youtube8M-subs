cannot go wrong s0 32 is a great
helicopter<00:02:34.359> one<00:02:35.359> of<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.569> best<00:02:35.840> in<00:02:36.709> a<00:02:36.769> size

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.879 

this<00:02:40.910> so<00:02:41.209> is<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.950> be<00:02:43.130> 388<00:02:44.290> but<00:02:45.290> it<00:02:45.380> has<00:02:45.500> more<00:02:45.829> of

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:45.889 
this so is to be 388 but it has more of

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:49.569 
this so is to be 388 but it has more of
a<00:02:46.069> light<00:02:46.250> show<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:48.470> i<00:02:48.709> think<00:02:49.010> is<00:02:49.190> spectacular

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
a light show and i think is spectacular

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.750 
a light show and i think is spectacular
and<00:02:50.239> i<00:02:50.750> think<00:02:50.989> it's<00:02:51.139> just<00:02:51.410> a<00:02:51.620> little<00:02:52.069> tad

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
and i think it's just a little tad

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.020 
and i think it's just a little tad
better<00:02:53.230> than<00:02:54.230> s03<00:02:54.980> too<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:56.540> there<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:56.870> go<00:02:58.030> s0

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
better than s03 too and there you go s0

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.809 
better than s03 too and there you go s0
32<00:02:59.920> vs<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:01.130> verify<00:03:01.810> next<00:03:02.810> we're<00:03:02.959> gonna<00:03:03.049> have
