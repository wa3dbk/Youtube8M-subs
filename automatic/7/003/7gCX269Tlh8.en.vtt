00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.830 
to do is open it for sex if you don't
like<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.310> like<00:03:07.520> I<00:03:07.640> said<00:03:07.820> before<00:03:07.970> you<00:03:08.390> can<00:03:08.420> tune

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
like it like I said before you can tune

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.200 
like it like I said before you can tune
all<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.290> settings<00:03:09.710> in<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.250> env<00:03:10.490> series<00:03:10.940> but

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
all the settings in the env series but

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.180 
all the settings in the env series but
personally<00:03:12.140> I<00:03:12.170> think<00:03:12.320> this<00:03:12.590> looks<00:03:12.800> a<00:03:12.890> lot

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
personally I think this looks a lot

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.580 
personally I think this looks a lot
better<00:03:13.430> than<00:03:13.580> default<00:03:14.270> so<00:03:14.960> it<00:03:15.200> really<00:03:15.380> is<00:03:15.560> up

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
better than default so it really is up

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.780 
better than default so it really is up
to<00:03:15.980> you<00:03:16.390> what<00:03:17.390> you<00:03:17.450> prefer<00:03:17.780> but<00:03:18.620> I'm<00:03:19.490> hoping
