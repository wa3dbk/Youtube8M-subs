the systems that we have in place going
indoors<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.020> best<00:01:13.380> shelter<00:01:13.830> but<00:01:14.640> if

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
indoors is the best shelter but if

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.120 
indoors is the best shelter but if
you're<00:01:15.150> stuck<00:01:15.450> outside<00:01:16.020> your<00:01:16.560> car<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.100> the

you're stuck outside your car is the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.760 
you're stuck outside your car is the
second<00:01:17.850> best<00:01:18.090> place<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.750> stay<00:01:19.140> safe

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
second best place to stay safe

prevention<00:01:20.250> obviously<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.090> key<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.420> don't

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
prevention obviously is key you don't

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.660 
prevention obviously is key you don't
want<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.080> be<00:01:22.170> struck<00:01:22.470> by<00:01:22.619> lightning<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.310> if
