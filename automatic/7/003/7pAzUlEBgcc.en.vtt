Fat Boy this one's got actually got a
variable<00:01:29.630> speed<00:01:29.749> on<00:01:30.079> there<00:01:30.229> so<00:01:30.439> you<00:01:30.530> can

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
variable speed on there so you can

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:32.529 
variable speed on there so you can
adjust<00:01:31.069> the<00:01:31.219> power<00:01:31.399> of<00:01:31.639> it<00:01:31.789> should<00:01:32.179> you<00:01:32.359> wish

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
adjust the power of it should you wish

adjust the power of it should you wish
to<00:01:32.889> write<00:01:33.889> well<00:01:34.159> proofs<00:01:34.460> in<00:01:34.639> the<00:01:34.670> pudding<00:01:34.759> I've

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
to write well proofs in the pudding I've

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.179 
to write well proofs in the pudding I've
got<00:01:35.600> that<00:01:35.719> bear<00:01:35.929> a<00:01:35.960> fully<00:01:36.229> loaded<00:01:36.439> up<00:01:36.799> I'm

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
got that bear a fully loaded up I'm

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:38.709 
got that bear a fully loaded up I'm
going<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:37.369> swap<00:01:37.609> it<00:01:37.729> all<00:01:37.850> on<00:01:38.030> to<00:01:38.179> this<00:01:38.329> one<00:01:38.509> here

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719 
going to swap it all on to this one here

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:40.870 
going to swap it all on to this one here
and<00:01:38.899> we'll<00:01:39.319> give<00:01:39.499> that<00:01:39.679> slope<00:01:39.950> another<00:01:40.249> go<00:01:40.490> see

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
and we'll give that slope another go see

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.029 
and we'll give that slope another go see

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
little bit literally just saw supporting

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.680 
little bit literally just saw supporting
the<00:02:51.450> weight<00:02:51.600> of<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:52.580> that<00:02:53.580> waver<00:02:53.820> easily<00:02:54.390> now<00:02:54.630> I

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
the weight of it that waver easily now I

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.750 
the weight of it that waver easily now I
can't<00:02:54.930> imagine<00:02:55.290> there's<00:02:55.470> many<00:02:55.680> likes<00:02:55.980> with<00:02:56.730> a

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
can't imagine there's many likes with a

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.319 
can't imagine there's many likes with a
slope<00:02:57.150> like<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:57.480> one<00:02:58.040> so<00:02:59.040> I<00:02:59.070> got<00:03:00.030> one<00:03:00.209> of

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
slope like that one so I got one of

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.039 
slope like that one so I got one of
these<00:03:00.500> you<00:03:01.500> can<00:03:01.620> have<00:03:01.709> no<00:03:02.010> problems<00:03:02.870> of<00:03:03.870> the

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
these you can have no problems of the

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.240 
these you can have no problems of the
unique<00:03:04.350> things<00:03:04.380> with<00:03:04.769> these<00:03:04.860> new<00:03:05.040> power

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
unique things with these new power

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.490 
unique things with these new power
porters<00:03:05.700> is<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.180> way<00:03:06.299> they<00:03:06.480> fold<00:03:06.690> down<00:03:06.840> with

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
porters is the way they fold down with

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.170 
porters is the way they fold down with
the<00:03:07.620> original<00:03:08.040> ones<00:03:08.250> you<00:03:08.790> had<00:03:08.880> a<00:03:08.910> lot<00:03:09.150> of

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
the original ones you had a lot of

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.850 
the original ones you had a lot of
weight<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.510> lift<00:03:09.930> into<00:03:10.170> your<00:03:10.290> car<00:03:10.590> because

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
weight to lift into your car because

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.170 
weight to lift into your car because
you're<00:03:10.980> lifting<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.370> whole<00:03:11.579> frame<00:03:11.940> and

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
you're lifting the whole frame and

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.300 
you're lifting the whole frame and
everything<00:03:12.840> in<00:03:13.110> one<00:03:13.320> so<00:03:13.769> there's<00:03:13.920> quite<00:03:14.070> a<00:03:14.130> lot

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
everything in one so there's quite a lot

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.660 
everything in one so there's quite a lot
of<00:03:14.340> bulk<00:03:14.640> with<00:03:15.360> this<00:03:15.630> simply<00:03:16.620> undo<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.489> two

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
of bulk with this simply undo the two

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.449 
of bulk with this simply undo the two
knobs<00:03:17.880> at<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.150> back<00:03:18.329> here<00:03:19.040> you've<00:03:20.040> got<00:03:20.160> one

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
knobs at the back here you've got one

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.479 
knobs at the back here you've got one
there<00:03:20.670> one<00:03:21.000> there<00:03:21.030> undo<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.019> battery<00:03:22.489> pop

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
there one there undo the battery pop

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.030 
there one there undo the battery pop
that<00:03:23.670> off<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:23.910> there<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.860> then<00:03:25.860> you've<00:03:25.950> got

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
that off of there and then you've got

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.870 
that off of there and then you've got
another<00:03:26.070> wire<00:03:26.519> here<00:03:26.910> just<00:03:27.840> separate<00:03:28.470> that

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
another wire here just separate that

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.630 
another wire here just separate that
literally<00:03:29.880> lift<00:03:30.690> up<00:03:30.900> there<00:03:31.110> and<00:03:31.489> the<00:03:32.489> whole

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
literally lift up there and the whole

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.840 
literally lift up there and the whole
unit<00:03:33.060> comes<00:03:33.780> separate<00:03:34.519> and<00:03:35.519> it's<00:03:35.730> not

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
unit comes separate and it's not

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.550 
unit comes separate and it's not
actually<00:03:36.000> that<00:03:36.329> heavy<00:03:36.660> but<00:03:36.810> obviously<00:03:37.170> as<00:03:37.350> it

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
actually that heavy but obviously as it

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.250 
actually that heavy but obviously as it
all<00:03:37.680> is<00:03:37.709> in<00:03:37.920> one<00:03:38.340> lump<00:03:39.060> it's<00:03:39.570> much<00:03:39.780> easier<00:03:40.140> to

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
all is in one lump it's much easier to

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.020 
all is in one lump it's much easier to
deal<00:03:40.470> with<00:03:40.500> chucking<00:03:41.250> in<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.519> out<00:03:41.610> your<00:03:41.790> car

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
deal with chucking in and out your car

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.630 
deal with chucking in and out your car
just<00:03:42.470> like<00:03:43.470> all<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.799> car<00:03:44.010> porters<00:03:44.400> they've

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
just like all the car porters they've

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.220
