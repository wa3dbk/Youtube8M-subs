00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.000
 before starting this video I want to 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.160
 thank the clan hacks for these four 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.260
 years of being part of him nobody I've 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.360
 made of the clan I left for reasons 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.330
 personal I only hope that the clan 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.580
 return to be as before hopefully one day 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.980
 I can go back hello friends 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.199
 I am run soon and in this my second 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.510
 video I will show you how to put your call of 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.380
 duty 2 in Spanish without downloading the game 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.210
 whole that weighs 3.6 gigs I repeat it's just 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.239
 for those who want to put it in Spanish 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.059
 do not come to me with things like that I already 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.100
 I had in Spanish because it's worth to me first 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.260
 we go to the description of the video and 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.110
 we will find the download links of 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.450
 the necessary files the links are 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.000
 uploaded to mediafire to facilitate the 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.640
 download I recommend downloading the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.579
 files with the help of jd download see 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.129
 Once downloaded we will have these 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.410
 eight rar files we give right click 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.870
 to the first file and we give it extract 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.719
 here and we wait for it to decompress 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.740
 once decompressed we will be left 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.409
 these 13 files called local and cds 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.420
 numbered from 0 0 to 13 the 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.060
 we select everyone and we click 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.700
 right and we choose to cut or copy as 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.009
 you prefer we look where 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.499
 we have installed the default game 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.799
 is the local disk of the files of the 

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:27.750
 activision call of duty 2 program but 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.479
 if you have it elsewhere as 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.750
 go there once in the archives of the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.849
 game we look for the main folder and the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.759
 open we give right click and we give 

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:41.429
 hit now we only have one step left to 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.649
 have our game in Spanish we look for 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.439
 files called tracked den click 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.530
 and these are numbered from 0 0 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.780
 until 10 we selected them all and 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.090
 they give you to eliminate play an endorsement of 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.459
 these files if they did not like the game 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.310
 in Spanish they can copy the backup and 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:02.069
 they will have it as before they should only stay 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.590
 I located them from spanish and that's it 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.929

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.060
