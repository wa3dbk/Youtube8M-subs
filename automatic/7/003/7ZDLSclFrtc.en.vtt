this chicken drops a block of obsidian
which<00:01:17.159> it's<00:01:17.729> pretty<00:01:17.970> nice<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.509> pretty<00:01:18.540> nice

to<00:01:18.990> have<00:01:19.020> obsidian<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.590> guess<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.280> that's<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
to have obsidian I guess so that's the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.149 
to have obsidian I guess so that's the
dark<00:01:20.759> chicken<00:01:21.119> next<00:01:21.720> up<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.290> fire<00:01:22.770> chicken

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
now there's no no big rewards if you can

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.190 
now there's no no big rewards if you can
guess<00:01:26.670> what<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.000> fire<00:01:27.210> chicken<00:01:27.479> does<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:28.140> be

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
guess what the fire chicken does to be

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.140 
guess what the fire chicken does to be
honest<00:01:28.439> he<00:01:28.590> might<00:01:28.770> even<00:01:28.979> kill<00:01:29.340> me<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.939> ready

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
lucky and this guy gave us the same

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.360 
lucky and this guy gave us the same
thing<00:04:54.210> what<00:04:54.390> even<00:04:54.600> is<00:04:54.720> that<00:04:54.930> I<00:04:55.110> have<00:04:55.740> no<00:04:56.040> idea

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
thing what even is that I have no idea

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.940 
thing what even is that I have no idea
what<00:04:56.580> that<00:04:56.730> is<00:04:57.140> it's<00:04:58.140> just<00:04:58.200> a<00:04:58.410> mossy<00:04:58.740> grass

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
what that is it's just a mossy grass

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.370 
what that is it's just a mossy grass
just<00:04:59.910> a<00:05:00.030> mossy<00:05:00.270> grass<00:05:00.450> so<00:05:00.900> these<00:05:01.080> are<00:05:01.230> really

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
just a mossy grass so these are really

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.680 
just a mossy grass so these are really
easy<00:05:01.500> to<00:05:01.830> kill<00:05:02.010> I<00:05:02.760> don't<00:05:02.970> know<00:05:03.210> if<00:05:03.300> you<00:05:03.450> can

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
easy to kill I don't know if you can

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.420 
easy to kill I don't know if you can
even<00:05:03.810> kill<00:05:04.110> them<00:05:04.230> with<00:05:04.380> one<00:05:04.560> hit<00:05:04.830> with<00:05:05.280> your

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
even kill them with one hit with your

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.880 
even kill them with one hit with your
hand<00:05:05.640> so<00:05:06.060> they're<00:05:06.330> really<00:05:06.540> easy<00:05:06.660> to<00:05:06.930> kill<00:05:07.080> and

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
hand so they're really easy to kill and

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.760 
hand so they're really easy to kill and
then<00:05:08.100> I<00:05:08.340> think<00:05:08.880> that<00:05:09.600> is<00:05:09.810> all<00:05:10.080> of<00:05:10.110> the<00:05:10.320> chickens

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
then I think that is all of the chickens

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.800 
then I think that is all of the chickens
that<00:05:11.010> is<00:05:11.190> all<00:05:11.430> of<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.610> new<00:05:11.760> chickens<00:05:12.270> that<00:05:12.690> we

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
that is all of the new chickens that we

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.630 
that is all of the new chickens that we
found<00:05:12.990> so<00:05:13.200> it's<00:05:13.320> a<00:05:13.350> pretty<00:05:13.560> cool<00:05:13.800> mod<00:05:14.010> it's

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
found so it's a pretty cool mod it's

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.520 
found so it's a pretty cool mod it's
quite<00:05:14.880> simple<00:05:15.300> quite<00:05:15.540> small<00:05:15.870> as<00:05:16.050> you<00:05:16.260> can<00:05:16.290> see

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
quite simple quite small as you can see

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.020 
quite simple quite small as you can see
you<00:05:16.710> get<00:05:16.890> loads<00:05:17.130> of<00:05:17.280> stuff<00:05:17.460> out<00:05:17.670> of<00:05:17.700> it<00:05:17.850> we've

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
you get loads of stuff out of it we've

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.600 
you get loads of stuff out of it we've
spawned<00:05:18.360> so<00:05:18.780> many<00:05:19.050> chickens<00:05:19.380> it's<00:05:19.830> absolutely
