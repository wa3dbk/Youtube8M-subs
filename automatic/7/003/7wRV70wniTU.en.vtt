could do as a photographer is get my

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.380 
could do as a photographer is get my

you<00:00:35.850> can<00:00:36.000> see<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.390> picture<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.780> took<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.200> it

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
you can see this picture I took and it

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.950 
you can see this picture I took and it
really<00:00:37.739> doesn't<00:00:38.100> tell<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.309> story<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.809> his

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
really doesn't tell a story and his

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.869 
really doesn't tell a story and his
photographers<00:00:40.500> were<00:00:40.620> visual<00:00:41.100> storytellers

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
photographers were visual storytellers

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.250 
photographers were visual storytellers
and<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.210> instead<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.510> trying<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.809> tell<00:00:42.989> all<00:00:43.200> of

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
and so instead of trying to tell all of

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.840 
and so instead of trying to tell all of
the<00:00:43.649> story<00:00:43.890> all<00:00:44.100> at<00:00:44.460> once

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
the story all at once

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.000 
the story all at once
there's<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.329> better<00:00:45.629> solution<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.739> to

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
there's a better solution and that is to

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.369 
there's a better solution and that is to
go<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.370> look<00:00:47.430> for<00:00:47.579> very<00:00:48.000> specific<00:00:48.379> stories

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
go and look for very specific stories

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.950 
go and look for very specific stories
along<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.430> street<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.629> do<00:00:51.780> that

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
along this street and I can do that

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.779 
along this street and I can do that
using<00:00:52.289> something<00:00:52.739> called<00:00:52.949> selective<00:00:53.160> focus

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
using something called selective focus

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.939 
using something called selective focus
now<00:00:54.629> we've<00:00:54.809> learned<00:00:55.050> all<00:00:55.260> about<00:00:55.289> depth<00:00:55.770> of

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
now we've learned all about depth of

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.260 
now we've learned all about depth of
field<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.370> really<00:00:56.460> what<00:00:56.699> I'm<00:00:56.760> going<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.910> do<00:00:57.090> is

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
field and really what I'm going to do is

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.270 
field and really what I'm going to do is
when<00:00:57.780> there's<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.989> longer<00:00:58.199> lens<00:00:58.530> I'm<00:00:59.039> gonna

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
when there's a longer lens I'm gonna

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.790 
when there's a longer lens I'm gonna
open<00:00:59.460> my<00:00:59.640> aperture<00:00:59.969> as<00:01:00.239> wide<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:00.870> possible<00:01:01.559> and

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
open my aperture as wide as possible and

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.650 
open my aperture as wide as possible and
then<00:01:02.370> get<00:01:02.520> my<00:01:02.670> depth<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.090> field<00:01:03.270> really

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
then get my depth of field really

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.479 
then get my depth of field really
shallow<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.199> then<00:01:04.290> I'm<00:01:04.350> just<00:01:04.470> gonna<00:01:04.619> look<00:01:04.949> for

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
shallow and then I'm just gonna look for

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.429 
shallow and then I'm just gonna look for
little<00:01:05.729> stories<00:01:06.330> along<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.780> way<00:01:06.900> maybe<00:01:07.200> it's

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
little stories along the way maybe it's

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.530

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
frame with those let them fall out of

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.419 
frame with those let them fall out of
focus<00:02:04.479> and<00:02:04.810> then<00:02:04.959> we<00:02:05.080> have<00:02:05.229> these<00:02:05.380> nice<00:02:05.920> colors

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.320 

selective<00:02:43.310> focus<00:02:43.430> is<00:02:43.730> more<00:02:43.910> than<00:02:44.120> just

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
selective focus is more than just

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.700 
selective focus is more than just
opening<00:02:44.480> up<00:02:44.810> your<00:02:44.960> aperture<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.560> get<00:02:45.680> a

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
opening up your aperture to get a

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.020 
opening up your aperture to get a
shallow<00:02:46.040> depth<00:02:46.370> of<00:02:46.490> field<00:02:46.550> what<00:02:46.940> you're

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
shallow depth of field what you're

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.540 
shallow depth of field what you're
trying<00:02:47.330> to<00:02:47.450> do<00:02:47.570> is<00:02:48.020> to<00:02:48.320> look<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:48.680> tell<00:02:48.890> stories

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
trying to do is to look and tell stories

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.060 
trying to do is to look and tell stories
that<00:02:50.030> are<00:02:50.090> small<00:02:50.630> parts<00:02:51.020> of<00:02:51.170> a<00:02:51.230> larger<00:02:51.770> story

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
that are small parts of a larger story

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.500 
that are small parts of a larger story
so<00:02:52.370> we're<00:02:52.520> looking<00:02:52.820> at<00:02:52.940> something<00:02:53.150> that<00:02:53.300> could

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
so we're looking at something that could

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.760 
so we're looking at something that could
be<00:02:53.570> as<00:02:53.720> simple<00:02:53.840> as<00:02:54.050> a<00:02:54.110> scratch<00:02:54.500> on<00:02:54.740> a

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
be as simple as a scratch on a

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.770 
be as simple as a scratch on a
motorcycle<00:02:55.130> or<00:02:55.610> a<00:02:55.640> stool<00:02:56.000> somebody's<00:02:56.450> using

motorcycle or a stool somebody's using
to<00:02:57.230> sit<00:02:57.500> on<00:02:57.680> or<00:02:57.860> a<00:02:57.890> pot<00:02:58.250> somebody's<00:02:58.700> cooking<00:02:58.970> in

all those small details to add to that
larger<00:03:23.180> story<00:03:23.720> so<00:03:23.930> I<00:03:23.990> say<00:03:24.260> selective<00:03:24.770> focus

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
larger story so I say selective focus

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.070 
larger story so I say selective focus
it's<00:03:25.580> more<00:03:26.030> than<00:03:26.270> just<00:03:26.330> opening<00:03:26.930> up<00:03:27.020> your

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
it's more than just opening up your

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.810 
it's more than just opening up your
aperture<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:27.740> getting<00:03:27.950> a<00:03:28.040> shallow<00:03:28.400> depth<00:03:28.730> of

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
aperture and getting a shallow depth of

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.970 
aperture and getting a shallow depth of
field<00:03:28.880> it's<00:03:29.540> looking<00:03:30.110> for<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.350> details<00:03:30.770> that

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
field it's looking for the details that

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.640 
field it's looking for the details that
tell<00:03:31.010> a<00:03:31.310> story<00:03:31.460> better<00:03:32.180> so<00:03:32.750> let's<00:03:32.960> continue<00:03:33.140> on

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
tell a story better so let's continue on

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.710 
tell a story better so let's continue on
our<00:03:33.680> quest<00:03:34.190> to<00:03:34.460> tell<00:03:34.760> a<00:03:34.790> better<00:03:35.000> story<00:03:35.120> of<00:03:35.630> the

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
our quest to tell a better story of the

00:03:35.720 --> 00:04:07.820 
our quest to tell a better story of the
busy<00:03:36.020> streets<00:03:36.350> of<00:03:36.470> Saigon

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.260 

well<00:04:08.830> the<00:04:08.920> next<00:04:09.160> time<00:04:09.310> you<00:04:09.490> find<00:04:09.730> yourself<00:04:09.880> in

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
well the next time you find yourself in

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.020 
well the next time you find yourself in
a<00:04:10.360> really<00:04:10.600> busy<00:04:11.110> scenario<00:04:12.100> like<00:04:12.460> a<00:04:12.700> crazy

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
a really busy scenario like a crazy

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.820 
a really busy scenario like a crazy
street<00:04:13.420> in<00:04:13.570> a<00:04:13.690> city<00:04:13.720> or<00:04:14.170> maybe<00:04:14.560> something

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
street in a city or maybe something

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.170 
street in a city or maybe something
that's<00:04:14.920> more<00:04:15.040> realistic<00:04:15.280> like<00:04:15.700> you're

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
that's more realistic like you're

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.580 
that's more realistic like you're
shooting<00:04:16.480> at<00:04:16.570> a<00:04:16.600> wedding<00:04:16.840> or<00:04:17.080> a<00:04:17.140> birthday

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
shoot everything that's happening all at

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.850 
shoot everything that's happening all at
once<00:04:21.310> look<00:04:21.880> for<00:04:22.120> specific<00:04:22.780> smaller<00:04:23.290> stories

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
once look for specific smaller stories

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.010 
once look for specific smaller stories
and<00:04:24.070> tell<00:04:24.310> those<00:04:24.610> using<00:04:25.360> selective<00:04:25.840> focus

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
and tell those using selective focus

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.930 
and tell those using selective focus
open<00:04:26.500> your<00:04:26.590> aperture<00:04:26.860> is<00:04:27.130> widest<00:04:27.520> it'll<00:04:27.730> go

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
open your aperture is widest it'll go

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.900 
open your aperture is widest it'll go
get<00:04:28.750> close<00:04:29.260> that<00:04:29.950> is<00:04:30.160> getting<00:04:30.340> you<00:04:30.430> really

get close that is getting you really

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.430 
get close that is getting you really
nice<00:04:31.060> shallow<00:04:31.480> depth<00:04:31.810> of<00:04:31.900> field<00:04:31.960> and<00:04:32.260> then<00:04:32.380> you

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
nice shallow depth of field and then you
