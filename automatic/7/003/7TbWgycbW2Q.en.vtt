00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.890
 but 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.240
 yesterday people are amazed eyes comment to 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.369
 the sewer me it's going great so today 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.869
 all new video guy so a video 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.340
 hold me potato so we get 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.630
 find I think you've seen 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.470
 in the title as I like to say it's 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.480
 not a video really that I have 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.710
 used to do but it's really 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.470
 we will say information that can be 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.140
 interesting for you so 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.150
 to be accompanied by Swiss effects 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.170
 salute so here are the scales she 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.190
 did I think that that was like 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.050
 I said even slight you saw it in 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.820
 the title was healthy with showbiz 10k 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.400
 he simply has small contacts in 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.870
 the middle of the Chinese psn and they arrive 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.940
 to have precisely he has the possibility 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.229
 to have games so any game 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.489
 so I'm sure it's because it's 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:51.820
 either exclusively on the console of 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.650
 sony 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.140
 so if you're on xbox month a city on 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.089
 xbox 360 it's dead you can leave the 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.830
 video it will not feel at all there is 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.680
 way to have games between them we're going 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.110
 say 50 and 70% off depending on the 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.060
 so basically big game I mean well 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.770
 the games he can have between 20 and 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.180
 30 euros games that are fairly recent 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.710
 again so they are pretty 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.820
 recent for example the witcher 3 which 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.549
 was released not too long ago 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.119
 how many games to have between 20 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.130
 and 30 euros 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.170
 so that's it while the game you go on 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.400
 the psn he has 70 balls no it's his voice 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.660
 to the senate will be yelling were not 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.010
 they are 100 and I here is home is 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.300
 still interesting so I want to 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.100
 specify one thing she says I'm going to 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.440
 confirm behind I'm going to say I 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.310
 touch no one will say how I 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.470
 could say I have no percentage 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.400
 you I have nothing to it 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.200
 post for the moment 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.640
 so I touch nothing at all 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.200
 to say that I'm doing this for him and for 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.790
 you in no way behind I'm going 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.660
 to touch sub something is 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.040
 just that I found that 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.210
 interesting he will propose told me lily 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.100
 that it is possible that you do the advertising 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.640
 I do not say why not and that's it 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.380
 be interesting 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.630
 then according to the request it is 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.070
 a very important thing is 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.810
 that of course since it is 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.100
 alone to handle that I do not know how much there 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.659
 will have a lot of people it's up to you 15 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.220
 which 15 teach him to manage but it's 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.900
 find it ugly 100-200 I do not know 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.000
 all I do not know how much we will say the 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.710
 life of l not touch anyone by following 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.280
 its of course if there is a demand 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.020
 strong 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.220
 he will not be able to manage alone so he will 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.870
 need to have some interest 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.489
 to wait after that I do not know 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.390
 how did it go at all where it gets 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.470
 may be it is therefore jeans 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.459
 ignorant of the wolf really this video 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.599
 lets in the house you say 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.890
 you but there I have too many requests I 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.299
 can not I can not do you but 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.230
 here I think it's going to be that can 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.970
 to be interesting for 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.530
 so games that can be very 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.120
 interesting and even games that are 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.069
 not out for example you go 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.299
 can preorder black ops you so 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.769
 for example if you go on the psn 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.360
 you can preorder black ops three 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.370
 lakes by saving an interesting idea 10 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.760
 01 and fight it sdf we can not 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.620
 to touch 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.239
 we will always have between 20 and 30 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.480
 here's always between 20 and 30 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.950
 euros 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.650
 so I wanted to say the game it's going 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.610
 depend on it will depend on the application this 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.049
 kind of things it can vary 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.400
 after that I think it can be 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.310
 interesting for you that can vary to 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.989
 50% cheaper so as I say it 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.190
 it's really very very interesting to 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.049
 take no case here I am 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.579
 just in the thing you see so for you 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.709
 to contact is what it is by facebook 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.780
 and by facebook has partly on their 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.040
 twitter and by twitter and because she 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.989
 knowing that I preferred what you 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.579
 because it is the simplest one 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.930
 because she knows more simple ok me I 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.670
 would put a lesson the sky in the 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.379
 description where he will have nothing notation that 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.060
 will appear on the screen 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.500
 there is also my twitter if you have any 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.000
 questions or if you want me 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.200
 ask them to just ask 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.730
 questions ask me something 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.290
 you can go through another 8 hours 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.510
 I'm pretty we'll say anyway 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.829
 quite often present here I am not 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.000
 if there are 50 messages could not 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.769
 respond to everything either but that's it 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.540
 I will try torments to the listened to 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.269
 So you ask me there will 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.349
 no problem after what I have 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.519
 did what i forgot about london and 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.660
 still specify that it's really 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.250
 reliable and that I have already sold to 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.870
 many people here so I can 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.389
 for example bad concrete you have 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.579
 ld just as you've sold the game 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:37.870
 precisely with bah just that it was 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.069
 will say that this price reduction that 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.389
 is interesting do not hesitate to 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.859
 put in comment do not hesitate 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.940
 this is saying it right now that's it 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.260
 reliable what kind of things that's true 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.790
 that it sounds weird and 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.910
 you see that a guy from the field but that's it 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.560
 if you're a guy from 2-3 on the day he 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.180
 sells carambars at night he sells 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.829
 juice of this job you can here referred 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.359
 surely it is still proud if 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.139
 I do the video I think when he 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:57.400
 see there is that I also trust 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.200
 in him it's someone I know 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.459
 since long gone at worst if there is 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.410
 a problem I will not hesitate to the 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.090
 to do on video saying here is lt lt 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.889
 he's a healthy guy with suburbs you 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.810
 see it's a guy that reams and who 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:09.129
 is still called too much confidence in him 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.299
 you know you can trust him 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.190
 but we go treesle frankly I 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.620
 think I trust him as I 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.730
 wanted said here that's it so that's it 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.650
 what I had to say to you after 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.720
 sites to something to add no 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.310
 usually I take the time so 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.870
 again by skype or twitter 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.370
 if you have questions you can 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.660
 to pass my pope out all 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.460
 the mans on the twitter is the daeu on 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.930
 my twitter there is no problem there 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.190
 above 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.810
 after that the offer as I say 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.620
 go varia it is variable what is it 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.310
 that I tell it is valid 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.180
 today is the 25th of May so 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.590
 maybe in three months 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.270
 normally I think if it is 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.380
 more valid I'm ready the video but 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.389
 here we never know it turns out 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.860
 in a while and will not be able to 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.270
 do or jeans serial choice we do not know to 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.949
 find a price he's going to have an accident 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.510
 horse horse riding methods 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:51.130
 value is a cul-de-sac nice weather it's 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.840
 nothing you see but no, but we 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.040
 will see but so normally this is it 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.410
 something that still should 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.060
 last in time and so I say 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.110
 really I think the game that will you 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.860
 interesting because it's true 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.180
 that my community is 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.380
 mainly focused on call of 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.760
 even if there are other games that 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.860
 may interest you it's really 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.330
 black ops you that you can have 50% 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.919
 less so after it's up to you 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.300
 see it's what you want anyway 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.160
 here I hope the video will have you 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.930
 more to go in regards to the 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.789
 forgiveness gameplay I do not know at all 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.900
 that it will be frankly it's yeah 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.520
 it's not important 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.720
 stubborn blackhawks 2 and just dance perfect 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.889
 his rules simply when I do not have 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.169
 proposed but it's not interesting 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.940
 all brief do not hesitate also to see them 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.840
 but my last sniper video is going to be 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.520
 me there it went well 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.070
 3800 like guys frankly that's it 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.240
 pleasure listen to this and tonio fd I you 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.289
 lets say the word of the end that if you 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.510
 have something else to say again 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.620
 time on exactly on your blush 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.180
 not much to say in any case thank you 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.099
 besides that it's this little goal for 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.789
