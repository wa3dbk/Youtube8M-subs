00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.100
 Very good, I'm Alex and in this video we'll see how to make a Hard Reset, a reboot 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.169
 to LG Optimus Black, better known as LG P970 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:17.750
 We will do it through two methods, in case we can do it 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.669
 see on the menu 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:22.749
 and in case we can not do it by a combination of buttons 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:25.909
 As always we will check the Android version on which it has been based 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:29.300
 This reset, since it does have an earlier version 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.970
 it varies totally 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.370
 that's why we came inside 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.570
 adjustments 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.990
 we go down to the bottom of everything 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.430
 on the phone 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.020
 software information 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.480
 and we see that it has the 4.0.4 version of Android 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.790
 We go back 2 times 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.289
 and we went inside a backup 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.440
 and restart 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.960
 under reset factory data 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.830
 restart phone 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.560
 erase everything 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.560
 Press the accept button to wait for it to restart and it would be reset 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.790
 To perform the reset through the combination of buttons you must have in 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.380
 Note that we have to have the latest version of the installed software 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.100
 Otherwise it will work for us 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.530
 so after these reset instructions, that is, at the end of the video 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.540
 We will explain how to update the software in case we have 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.760
 Locked the terminal with the security code and we do not know the password 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.470
 Well in this case we see that this phone does not have the security pattern 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.530
 blocked and we do not know it 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.810
 in this case what we have to do 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.540
 It is removing and placing the battery, it is not worth while turning off and turning on the phone 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.850
 Once pressed down, press the down buttons and the G key on the button 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.120
 lateral and press the power button to turn it on for a few seconds. 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.340
 let's release the power button but the other buttons are left until 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.339
 The Android doll appears on the screen 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:17.789
 Once it appears we wait for it to switched on and it would be reset there is not 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:20.309
 to do anything else on this phone 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:24.519
 We give you a fast camera so you can see the process but it takes about three 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:25.349
 minutes 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.429
 more or less to light up 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:33.259
 to be able to update the device with the screen locked by the pattern of 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:36.899
 security we have to install the PC Suite program 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:38.919
 We can not search google 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:44.579
 or in the LG page, in the after-sales section 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.469
 after-sales service 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:51.239
 PC Suite 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.639
 and here it gives us the option to select the device in this case phones 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:56.999
 mobile phones 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:01.869
 smartphone 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:07.469
 and even lowered, put me LG P970 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:12.219
 we accept 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.960
 Download PC Suite 4 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.889
 We hope you get it downloaded, and once we open it 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.909
 when running the exe file 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:33.809
 the installation starts install it like any other program choosing the following, accepting, installing, and so on 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:37.879
 Once opened, if we plug in the device, it will not connect to us 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.849
 The reason is because in our own device we should have one 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:42.829
 screen 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.509
 that we will have to select LG software 

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:50.059
 and we can not select it because we have the screen locked with it 

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:52.939
 security pattern 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:55.180
 In this case, what you need to do is enter 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.699
 Up to device and after recovery of firmware emergency 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:03.329
 click OK and it will appear 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:09.349
 the option to run a program called LG Mobile support tools, 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.679
 We have to run it, and once it is installed 

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:18.669
 This screen will appear, press OK, connect the device 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.660
 and at the time he recognizes it 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.039
 we have to press the start button to update that you see above 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.580
 to the left 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.370
 Once the update is installed, it may appear 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.039
 Another update available we have 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:37.120
 continue until that 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.919
 finally there is no update, then it could be 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.680
 do the reset as we indicated above through the 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.330
 button combination 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.240
 and that's it 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.130
