00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.700 
after work on the weekend and obviously
loved<00:01:54.030> my<00:01:54.210> sport<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:55.080> that<00:01:55.230> makes<00:01:55.440> it<00:01:55.590> much

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
loved my sport so that makes it much

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.240 
loved my sport so that makes it much
easier<00:01:56.120> I<00:01:57.120> mean<00:01:57.750> doing<00:01:58.110> hockey<00:01:58.440> and<00:01:58.830> selling

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
easier I mean doing hockey and selling

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.770 
easier I mean doing hockey and selling
hockey<00:01:59.550> you<00:01:59.730> know<00:01:59.850> it<00:01:59.940> just<00:02:00.060> makes<00:02:00.300> sense<00:02:00.540> so

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
hockey you know it just makes sense so

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.990 
hockey you know it just makes sense so
it<00:02:00.840> ties<00:02:01.050> in<00:02:01.200> quite<00:02:01.440> nicely<00:02:01.470> so<00:02:02.070> even<00:02:02.730> when<00:02:02.880> I'm

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
it ties in quite nicely so even when I'm

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.460 
it ties in quite nicely so even when I'm
on<00:02:03.120> the<00:02:03.270> field<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.840> know<00:02:03.870> it's<00:02:04.110> obviously

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
on the field you know it's obviously

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.440 
on the field you know it's obviously
stalled<00:02:04.800> that<00:02:04.980> you<00:02:05.160> involved<00:02:06.150> in<00:02:06.240> work

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
stalled that you involved in work

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.240 
stalled that you involved in work
somehow<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.410> that<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.740> breaks<00:02:07.980> are<00:02:08.130> much

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
somehow so that that breaks are much

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.430 
somehow so that that breaks are much
easier<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.330> think<00:02:09.570> gives<00:02:10.170> me<00:02:10.320> that

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
easier that I think gives me that

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.080 
easier that I think gives me that
balance<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:10.980> that<00:02:11.010> helps<00:02:11.340> we<00:02:11.430> do<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:12.060> know

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
balance and that helps we do you know

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.910 
balance and that helps we do you know
obviously<00:02:12.450> linked<00:02:12.780> in<00:02:12.870> my<00:02:12.960> career<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.530> know

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
obviously linked in my career I know

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.500 
obviously linked in my career I know
it's<00:02:14.040> very<00:02:14.130> difficult<00:02:14.250> for<00:02:14.820> some<00:02:15.330> hockey

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
it's very difficult for some hockey

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.940 
it's very difficult for some hockey
players<00:02:15.840> because<00:02:16.230> obviously<00:02:16.440> hockey<00:02:16.740> is<00:02:16.890> not

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
that more than the synergy sit so why I

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.810 
that more than the synergy sit so why I
like<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.370> synergy<00:03:02.730> set<00:03:03.350> is<00:03:04.350> it's<00:03:05.340> similar<00:03:05.670> to

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
like the synergy set is it's similar to

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.790 
like the synergy set is it's similar to
what<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.450> softs<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:06.900> was<00:03:07.080> like<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:07.560> used<00:03:07.740> to

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
what the softs it was like and I used to

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.520 
what the softs it was like and I used to
use<00:03:07.860> this<00:03:08.130> offset<00:03:08.540> it's<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.660> very<00:03:09.900> slight<00:03:10.170> foot

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
use this offset it's a very slight foot

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.620 
use this offset it's a very slight foot
it's<00:03:10.950> very<00:03:11.280> light<00:03:11.490> it's<00:03:11.820> about<00:03:12.000> 10<00:03:12.300> person

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
it's very light it's about 10 person

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.180 
it's very light it's about 10 person
like<00:03:12.840> that<00:03:12.870> now<00:03:13.200> with<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.440> new<00:03:13.470> technology

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
like that now with the new technology

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.070 
like that now with the new technology
that<00:03:14.220> they<00:03:14.400> added<00:03:14.700> with<00:03:15.210> the<00:03:15.300> ISO<00:03:15.510> blocks<00:03:15.900> and

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
that they added with the ISO blocks and

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.150 
that they added with the ISO blocks and
the<00:03:16.140> d3<00:03:16.560> are<00:03:16.680> firm<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.130> Platinum<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:19.160> rebound

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
the d3 are firm the Platinum the rebound

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.280 
the d3 are firm the Platinum the rebound
is<00:03:20.400> just<00:03:20.730> absolutely<00:03:21.360> incredible

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
is just absolutely incredible

is just absolutely incredible
I<00:03:22.440> don't<00:03:23.160> know<00:03:23.220> because<00:03:23.520> of<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.700> ISO<00:03:23.880> blocks<00:03:24.180> a

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
I don't know because of the ISO blocks a

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.940 
I don't know because of the ISO blocks a
slight<00:03:24.480> little<00:03:24.660> bit<00:03:24.870> harder<00:03:25.200> inside<00:03:25.650> but<00:03:25.860> the

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
slight little bit harder inside but the

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:33.920 
slight little bit harder inside but the
board<00:03:26.160> is<00:03:26.310> fun<00:03:27.560> I<00:03:32.420> think<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.540> secret

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
board is fun I think the secret

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.110 
board is fun I think the secret
ingredient<00:03:34.050> was<00:03:34.620> plain<00:03:34.830> and<00:03:35.010> simple<00:03:35.400> of<00:03:35.640> teeka

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
ingredient was plain and simple of teeka

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.970 
ingredient was plain and simple of teeka
success<00:03:36.540> it's<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.050> man<00:03:37.230> behind<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.740> bread

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980
