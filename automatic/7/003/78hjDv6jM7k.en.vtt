very<00:02:38.630> good<00:02:39.050> then<00:02:39.170> I<00:02:39.260> solve<00:02:39.500> 650<00:02:40.310> there<00:02:40.460> which

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
very good then I solve 650 there which

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.580 
very good then I solve 650 there which
you'd<00:02:41.390> only<00:02:41.570> just<00:02:41.810> been<00:02:41.960> listed<00:02:42.290> out<00:02:42.350> so<00:02:42.530> I

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
thought why not grab that one that's a

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.120 
thought why not grab that one that's a
great<00:02:44.360> profit<00:02:44.810> so<00:02:45.410> I<00:02:45.470> decided<00:02:45.740> to<00:02:45.890> pick<00:02:46.010> that

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
great profit so I decided to pick that

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.130 
great profit so I decided to pick that
up<00:02:46.190> obviously<00:02:46.430> we<00:02:47.150> can<00:02:47.300> sell<00:02:47.450> it<00:02:47.570> on<00:02:47.660> for<00:02:47.990> some
