00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
fidelity tools with it and we were

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.740 
fidelity tools with it and we were
experienced<00:03:00.730> who<00:03:00.910> carries<00:03:01.239> a<00:03:01.269> 13<00:03:01.600> megapixel

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
experienced who carries a 13 megapixel

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.460 
experienced who carries a 13 megapixel
camera<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:03.580> it<00:03:04.299> does<00:03:04.600> have<00:03:04.930> a<00:03:04.959> pretty<00:03:05.230> good

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
camera and it does have a pretty good

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.020 
camera and it does have a pretty good
amount<00:03:05.739> of<00:03:05.980> so<00:03:06.340> this<00:03:06.580> is<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.819> camera

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
amount of so this is the camera

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.660 
amount of so this is the camera
interface<00:03:07.420> of<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.110> vivo<00:03:08.380> x3<00:03:09.010> so<00:03:09.280> you<00:03:09.370> can<00:03:09.489> see

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
interface of the vivo x3 so you can see

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.300 
interface of the vivo x3 so you can see
a<00:03:09.700> lot<00:03:09.819> of<00:03:09.849> options<00:03:10.150> included<00:03:11.049> we<00:03:11.890> have<00:03:12.130> the

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
a lot of options included we have the

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.490 
a lot of options included we have the
front-facing<00:03:12.610> camera<00:03:13.299> the<00:03:13.450> filters<00:03:13.870> included

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
front-facing camera the filters included

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.970 
front-facing camera the filters included
then<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:15.760> have<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.090> flash<00:03:16.360> option<00:03:17.230> you<00:03:17.860> can

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
then you have the flash option you can

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.259 
then you have the flash option you can
see<00:03:18.160> these<00:03:18.310> are<00:03:18.489> some<00:03:18.519> of<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.819> filters

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
see these are some of the filters

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.020 
see these are some of the filters
available<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.989> modes<00:03:20.200> available<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:21.069> you

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
available the modes available and you

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.440 
available the modes available and you
can<00:03:22.180> also<00:03:22.390> see<00:03:23.099> it<00:03:24.099> has<00:03:24.340> night<00:03:24.670> mode<00:03:25.000> then<00:03:25.420> you

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
can also see it has night mode then you

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.759 
can also see it has night mode then you
can<00:03:25.660> see<00:03:25.780> these<00:03:25.930> are<00:03:26.109> the<00:03:26.140> settings<00:03:26.620> available

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
can see these are the settings available

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.800 
can see these are the settings available
so<00:03:27.579> we<00:03:27.670> can<00:03:27.820> see<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.030> picture<00:03:28.359> size<00:03:28.570> is

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
so we can see the picture size is

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.920 
so we can see the picture size is
maximum<00:03:29.350> is<00:03:29.560> a<00:03:30.100> 13<00:03:30.760> megapixel<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.450> you<00:03:31.810> can

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
maximum is a 13 megapixel and you can

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.590 
maximum is a 13 megapixel and you can
also<00:03:32.079> record<00:03:32.500> video<00:03:32.709> scene<00:03:33.160> now<00:03:33.370> full<00:03:34.030> 1080p

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
also record video scene now full 1080p

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.349 
also record video scene now full 1080p
that's<00:03:35.049> again<00:03:35.410> impressive<00:03:35.950> so<00:03:36.459> 13<00:03:36.819> megapixel

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
that's again impressive so 13 megapixel

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:38.849 
that's again impressive so 13 megapixel
camera<00:03:37.540> should<00:03:38.079> be<00:03:38.140> impressive<00:03:38.680> here

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
camera should be impressive here

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.920 
camera should be impressive here
although<00:03:39.040> we<00:03:39.250> are<00:03:39.340> not<00:03:39.390> really<00:03:40.390> tested<00:03:40.810> the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
although we are not really tested the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.289 
although we are not really tested the
conditions<00:03:41.410> outside<00:03:41.650> so<00:03:42.250> this<00:03:42.430> was<00:03:42.670> this

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
conditions outside so this was this

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.750 
conditions outside so this was this
hands-on<00:03:43.660> was<00:03:43.870> then<00:03:44.049> obviously<00:03:44.459> inside<00:03:45.459> so<00:03:45.640> we

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
hands-on was then obviously inside so we

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.030 
hands-on was then obviously inside so we
can't<00:03:45.970> really<00:03:46.120> say<00:03:46.480> whether<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:47.200> camera<00:03:47.500> is<00:03:47.680> a

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
can't really say whether the camera is a

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.830 
can't really say whether the camera is a
high-performing<00:03:48.940> camera<00:03:49.329> but<00:03:49.810> that

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
high-performing camera but that

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.780 
high-performing camera but that
interface<00:03:50.410> definitely<00:03:50.980> looks<00:03:51.250> pretty<00:03:51.549> good

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
interface definitely looks pretty good

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.710 
interface definitely looks pretty good
so<00:03:52.060> that's<00:03:52.720> a<00:03:52.930> 13<00:03:53.200> megapixel<00:03:53.350> camera<00:03:54.130> on<00:03:54.310> the

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
so that's a 13 megapixel camera on the

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.930 
so that's a 13 megapixel camera on the
vivo<00:03:55.720> x3<00:03:56.410> yes<00:03:56.590> so<00:03:56.859> all<00:03:57.069> in<00:03:57.400> all<00:03:57.489> the<00:03:57.670> device

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
vivo x3 yes so all in all the device

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.120 
vivo x3 yes so all in all the device
looks<00:03:58.420> pretty<00:03:58.690> good<00:03:59.019> it<00:03:59.350> has<00:03:59.560> really<00:03:59.829> good

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
looks pretty good it has really good

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.220 
looks pretty good it has really good
design<00:04:00.489> just<00:04:02.370> 5.9<00:04:03.370> 5mm<00:04:03.970> thick<00:04:04.239> and<00:04:04.540> it<00:04:05.200> has

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
design just 5.9 5mm thick and it has
