can do so much with this you can use it

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.449 
can do so much with this you can use it
with<00:03:36.989> twine<00:03:37.319> you<00:03:37.500> can<00:03:37.709> use<00:03:37.859> it<00:03:37.980> with<00:03:38.100> decoupage

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
with twine you can use it with decoupage

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.520 
with twine you can use it with decoupage
you<00:03:38.819> can<00:03:38.970> use<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:39.239> with<00:03:39.329> fabric<00:03:39.510> ribbons<00:03:40.260> like

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
you can use it with fabric ribbons like

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.129 
you can use it with fabric ribbons like
they<00:03:40.739> did<00:03:40.920> in<00:03:41.069> today's<00:03:41.370> example<00:03:42.139> definitely

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
they did in today's example definitely

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.420 
they did in today's example definitely

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
all the ins and outs of this project

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.229 
all the ins and outs of this project
which<00:03:46.829> I<00:03:47.040> think<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.430> lot<00:03:47.579> of<00:03:47.609> people<00:03:47.880> want<00:03:48.120> to

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.610 
bowling balls this is another one of my
favorite<00:03:53.819> projects<00:03:54.299> and<00:03:55.260> it<00:03:55.410> has<00:03:55.590> a

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
favorite projects and it has a

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.129

similarity<00:03:56.250> with<00:03:56.730> number<00:03:57.150> six<00:03:57.510> which<00:03:57.750> is<00:03:57.870> was

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
similarity with number six which is was

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:59.750 
similarity with number six which is was
the<00:03:58.260> bowling<00:03:58.500> balls<00:03:58.680> it's<00:03:59.220> using<00:03:59.519> another

your money in you can take a coffee can
and<00:04:44.570> maybe<00:04:45.570> do<00:04:45.870> some<00:04:45.900> decoupage<00:04:46.320> I<00:04:46.830> am<00:04:47.010> a<00:04:47.040> big

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
and maybe do some decoupage I am a big

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.730 
and maybe do some decoupage I am a big
decoupage<00:04:47.880> er<00:04:48.270> so<00:04:48.870> it's<00:04:49.260> really<00:04:49.530> cool<00:04:49.710> that

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
decoupage er so it's really cool that

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.320 
decoupage er so it's really cool that
you<00:04:49.890> can<00:04:50.010> customize<00:04:50.190> things<00:04:50.670> with<00:04:50.940> just<00:04:51.090> paper

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
you can customize things with just paper

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.560 
you can customize things with just paper
really<00:04:51.630> and<00:04:51.990> some<00:04:52.500> glue<00:04:52.740> number<00:04:53.520> 13<00:04:54.060> is<00:04:54.270> the

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
really and some glue number 13 is the

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.040 
really and some glue number 13 is the
water<00:04:54.840> bottle<00:04:55.320> party<00:04:55.830> lights<00:04:56.160> I<00:04:56.630> only<00:04:57.630> drink

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
water bottle party lights I only drink

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.100 
water bottle party lights I only drink
water<00:04:58.260> and<00:04:58.650> I<00:04:59.460> think<00:04:59.670> these<00:04:59.820> would<00:05:00.060> be<00:05:00.270> super

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
water and I think these would be super

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.640 
water and I think these would be super
cool<00:05:01.440> to<00:05:01.650> make<00:05:01.830> it's<00:05:02.130> just<00:05:02.760> one<00:05:02.880> of<00:05:02.910> those<00:05:03.090> like

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
cool to make it's just one of those like

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.990 
cool to make it's just one of those like
conversation<00:05:04.650> starters<00:05:05.010> like<00:05:05.310> how<00:05:05.790> did<00:05:05.940> you

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
conversation starters like how did you

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.620 
conversation starters like how did you
do<00:05:06.150> that<00:05:06.180> if<00:05:07.040> your<00:05:08.040> family<00:05:08.490> barbecues<00:05:09.240> and

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
do that if your family barbecues and

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.420 
do that if your family barbecues and
your<00:05:09.750> friends<00:05:10.080> are<00:05:10.230> over<00:05:10.410> I<00:05:10.860> think<00:05:11.160> that'd<00:05:11.400> be

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
your friends are over I think that'd be

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.910 
your friends are over I think that'd be
super<00:05:11.730> cool<00:05:12.060> to<00:05:12.270> do<00:05:12.570> and<00:05:12.930> it<00:05:13.440> would<00:05:13.560> really

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
super cool to do and it would really

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.390 
super cool to do and it would really
again<00:05:14.310> cost<00:05:14.880> you<00:05:15.150> very<00:05:15.740> minimum<00:05:16.740> which<00:05:17.370> is

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
again cost you very minimum which is
