00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.300
 Hello, my beloved ones, you too. 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.610
 here the speaker is the group is this because 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.920
 Science, let's talk about teachers 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.910
 and the curious relationship they have with 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.920
 trees 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.920
 oak professor is certainly the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.119
 pokémon professor most famous of all 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.010
 wants to be the first to appear in the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.769
 food and the only one to be present 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.150
 in all seasons in more than one 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.490
 franchise movie 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.830
 his name clearly comes from the tree 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.320
 which is known to be a tree that 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.610
 can survive for centuries and the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.399
 professor oak is one of the teachers 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.649
 oldest of the entire pokémon franchise 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.890
 you also knew that the fruit of the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.200
 Oak tree is the acorn and then 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.160
 this year pagani things ended up the binge 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.110
 The great thing is that the acorn is the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.780
 pokemon world that can be transformed 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.780
 in pokébola as we see from the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.550
 second generation 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.739
 it is in the second generation that we have the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.049
 teacher is the name that has been translated 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.339
 Portuguese is referring to the tree one 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.070
 miner 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.869
 This tree native to Europe is super 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.150
 high and resistant, the way 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.580
 It is used to make a boat. 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.140
 you should probably remember that the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.140
 first city where we live is 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.000
 in game is a city that has a lot of wind 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.270
 a super windy city 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.119
 because then a mere holds the wind very 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.310
 well and is reproduced mainly by the 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.530
 wind spreading seeds around the world 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.990
 tree that gives rise to the name of the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.750
 Teacher Bad Burti I doubt it 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.240
 you know this you know you're open there 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.460
 this native tree of the northern hemisphere 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.369
 of temperate climates 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.320
 this tree has in Russia for example or 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.939
 it has nothing to do with the weather 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.610
 bad tropical 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.220
 however the teacher burti is a disciple 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.720
 of the oak teacher and open is as if 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.490
 was a mini oak 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.700
 seemingly the choice of the name of the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.159
 The teacher there was deliberately 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.020
 the fourth generation teacher is the flight 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.200
 which translated into Portuguese is 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.660
 ice cream maker which in turn is the same 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.700
 name of a very tall shrub that loses 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.500
 leaves in winter and if a teacher 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.330
 more serious then even easy 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.300
 than it has a simpler tree 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.390
 with its name but also the fruit 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.730
 of this tree is quite bitter what 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.790
 reflects the seriousness of the teacher of 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.820
 So the teacher June and asked new is 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.830
 very good natured and super lively with 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.980
 that the tree that gave its name is the 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.410
 tree fruits are used 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.740
 in some parts of the world to temper 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.150
 the food a strong taste for a fruit of 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.670
 a tree that gives a teacher a name 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.980
 well marked in the sixth generation not 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.220
 Could the teacher be different? 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.660
 pokémon also has a name inspired by 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.120
 a tree 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.270
 Is the site teacher the death in Portuguese? 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.040
 has been translated to itself as though 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.850
 be a continent inspired by the 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.709
 Europe 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.770
 The tree that gives the teacher's name is 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.690
 african tree grows super fast 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.750
 while the teacher in question is the most 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.840
 high of all makes sense is not the 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.540
 auto teacher a tall tree and everyone 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.760
 pokémon teachers then have names 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.400
 inspired by trees we can 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.989
 then predict that the next generation 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.170
 we will also have a teacher with the name 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.330
 tree well and if in the next generation the 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.830
 continent was inspired in brazil 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.170
 will the teacher have a name 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.580
 inspired by a Brazilian tree when 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.650
 Do you think it would be the teacher's name? 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.120
 or a teacher, do not we? 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.670
 considers that she can be a teacher 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.440
 also, after all, most of the 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.690
 of teachers so far have been men 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.380
 it would make sense that the next teacher in 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.030
 truth be a teacher then let 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.190
 the comments your opinion of which 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.140
 should be the name of the next teacher 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.140
 and be sure to watch because essence 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:58.440
 where we try to imagine how it would be 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.410
 Pokémon inspired game in Brazil or 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.660
 be a Brazilian region in pokémon 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.519
 inspired here in our beautiful country 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.380
 Thank you very much, beauty for watching this 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.660
 video did not even forget to leave the 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.000

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.160
 back in style place a hug 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.160
 in the next bad video
