00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:05.649 
okay well today's project on the jeep is

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:09.190 
okay well today's project on the jeep is
actually<00:00:06.649> going<00:00:06.799> to<00:00:07.009> be<00:00:07.160> fixing<00:00:07.669> the<00:00:08.510> blinkers

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 
actually going to be fixing the blinkers

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.459 
actually going to be fixing the blinkers
and<00:00:09.730> hazard<00:00:10.730> relay<00:00:11.059> I'll<00:00:12.019> show<00:00:12.230> you<00:00:12.290> right

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:12.469 
and hazard relay I'll show you right

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.120 
and hazard relay I'll show you right
here<00:00:13.120> feet<00:00:15.400> I'll<00:00:16.400> try<00:00:16.520> to<00:00:16.580> do<00:00:16.730> it<00:00:16.790> right-handed

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
here feet I'll try to do it right-handed

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.090 
here feet I'll try to do it right-handed
okay<00:00:19.449> here's<00:00:20.449> the<00:00:20.600> hazards<00:00:20.960> oh<00:00:21.230> I<00:00:21.769> first

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
okay here's the hazards oh I first

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.560 
okay here's the hazards oh I first
noticed<00:00:22.490> was<00:00:22.640> that<00:00:22.670> the<00:00:22.970> blinkers<00:00:23.300> weren't

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
noticed was that the blinkers weren't

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.839 
noticed was that the blinkers weren't
working<00:00:23.840> you<00:00:24.050> know<00:00:24.170> you<00:00:24.230> left<00:00:24.529> right<00:00:25.039> here<00:00:25.609> if

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
working you know you left right here if

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.570 
working you know you left right here if
you<00:00:25.939> want<00:00:26.119> to<00:00:26.180> it<00:00:28.840> yeah<00:00:29.840> left<00:00:30.140> right<00:00:30.830> that's

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
you want to it yeah left right that's

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.280 
you want to it yeah left right that's
nothing

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
nothing

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.750 
nothing
and<00:00:33.290> I<00:00:33.410> thought<00:00:33.590> maybe<00:00:33.800> the<00:00:34.010> bulb<00:00:34.220> went<00:00:34.460> out<00:00:34.550> or

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
and I thought maybe the bulb went out or

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.120 
and I thought maybe the bulb went out or
maybe<00:00:35.030> blue<00:00:35.240> just<00:00:35.960> a<00:00:36.080> simple<00:00:36.470> fuse<00:00:36.710> but<00:00:36.950> if<00:00:37.040> you

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
maybe blue just a simple fuse but if you

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.100 
maybe blue just a simple fuse but if you
check<00:00:37.340> even<00:00:38.210> if<00:00:38.300> you<00:00:38.390> turn<00:00:38.480> on<00:00:38.600> the<00:00:38.720> hazards

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
check even if you turn on the hazards

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.950 
check even if you turn on the hazards
nothing<00:00:39.560> and<00:00:40.280> it'd<00:00:40.400> be<00:00:40.520> really<00:00:40.760> unusual<00:00:41.060> and

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
nothing and it'd be really unusual and

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.990 
nothing and it'd be really unusual and
it'd<00:00:42.350> be<00:00:42.380> really<00:00:42.650> unusual<00:00:42.860> for<00:00:43.430> all<00:00:43.610> of<00:00:43.910> the

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
it'd be really unusual for all of the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.700 
it'd be really unusual for all of the
blinkers<00:00:44.330> to<00:00:44.450> die<00:00:44.570> at<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:44.780> same<00:00:44.930> time<00:00:45.200> so<00:00:45.440> one

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
blinkers to die at the same time so one

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.900 
blinkers to die at the same time so one
blinker<00:00:46.070> sure<00:00:46.490> a<00:00:46.520> bulb<00:00:46.880> one<00:00:47.390> side<00:00:47.660> or<00:00:48.530> just<00:00:48.910> the

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
blinker sure a bulb one side or just the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.330 
blinker sure a bulb one side or just the
blinkers<00:00:50.360> maybe<00:00:50.720> a<00:00:50.840> fuse<00:00:51.140> but<00:00:51.380> with<00:00:51.530> you<00:00:52.250> had

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
blinkers maybe a fuse but with you had

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.460 
blinkers maybe a fuse but with you had
everything<00:00:52.670> go<00:00:52.760> wrong<00:00:53.030> it<00:00:53.870> sounds<00:00:54.320> like<00:00:54.440> a

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
everything go wrong it sounds like a

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.140 
everything go wrong it sounds like a
relay<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.010> from<00:00:55.340> what<00:00:55.460> I'm<00:00:55.550> looking<00:00:55.850> up<00:00:55.970> at

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
relay and from what I'm looking up at

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.730 
relay and from what I'm looking up at
that<00:00:56.450> sounds<00:00:56.720> like<00:00:56.840> it's<00:00:56.960> a<00:00:56.990> pretty<00:00:57.140> common

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:57.740 
that sounds like it's a pretty common

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.760 
that sounds like it's a pretty common
issue<00:00:58.070> and<00:00:58.540> two<00:00:59.540> good<00:00:59.960> news<00:01:00.110> is<00:01:00.290> that<00:01:00.470> the

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
issue and two good news is that the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.800 
issue and two good news is that the
replacement<00:01:01.250> is<00:01:01.610> pretty<00:01:01.850> straightforward<00:01:02.390> as

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:02.810 
replacement is pretty straightforward as

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.610 
replacement is pretty straightforward as
well<00:01:02.990> this<00:01:03.560> is<00:01:03.800> what's<00:01:04.010> bad<00:01:04.280> it's<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.620> let's

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
well this is what's bad it's the let's

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.310 
well this is what's bad it's the let's
see<00:01:06.800> if<00:01:06.860> we<00:01:06.980> can<00:01:07.100> get<00:01:07.220> it<00:01:07.310> to<00:01:07.430> refocus<00:01:08.320> anyway

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
see if we can get it to refocus anyway

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.830 
see if we can get it to refocus anyway
it's<00:01:09.470> the<00:01:09.820> relay<00:01:10.820> for<00:01:11.180> the<00:01:11.300> blinkers<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:11.660> the

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
it's the relay for the blinkers and the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.960 
it's the relay for the blinkers and the
hazards<00:01:12.260> or<00:01:13.040> that's<00:01:13.190> located<00:01:13.580> on<00:01:13.670> your<00:01:13.730> Jeep

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
hazards or that's located on your Jeep

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.400 
hazards or that's located on your Jeep
is<00:01:14.180> going<00:01:14.450> to<00:01:14.510> be<00:01:14.630> right<00:01:14.840> here<00:01:15.080> you<00:01:15.230> know<00:01:15.320> where

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
is going to be right here you know where

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.980 
is going to be right here you know where
your<00:01:15.530> fuse<00:01:15.770> boxes<00:01:16.190> under<00:01:16.520> here<00:01:16.820> it's<00:01:17.540> right

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
your fuse boxes under here it's right

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.330 
your fuse boxes under here it's right
about<00:01:18.350> here

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
about here

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.420 
about here
so<00:01:19.910> we're<00:01:20.030> going<00:01:20.120> to<00:01:20.180> have<00:01:20.300> to<00:01:20.390> take<00:01:20.540> off<00:01:20.750> these

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
so we're going to have to take off these

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.510 
so we're going to have to take off these
shrouds<00:01:22.430> and<00:01:22.790> then<00:01:23.570> pull<00:01:23.720> it<00:01:23.840> out<00:01:24.280> swap<00:01:25.280> in<00:01:25.490> the

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
shrouds and then pull it out swap in the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.190 
shrouds and then pull it out swap in the
new<00:01:25.670> one<00:01:25.850> we<00:01:26.180> should<00:01:26.390> be<00:01:26.480> good<00:01:26.570> to<00:01:26.630> go<00:01:26.810> so

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
new one we should be good to go so

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.690 
new one we should be good to go so
that's<00:01:27.350> what<00:01:27.470> we<00:01:27.560> do<00:01:27.680> today<00:01:30.159> first<00:01:31.159> step<00:01:31.430> is<00:01:31.610> we

that's what we do today first step is we
have<00:01:31.730> to<00:01:31.850> pop<00:01:32.120> this<00:01:32.360> off<00:01:34.390> I'm<00:01:35.390> going<00:01:35.510> to<00:01:35.600> try<00:01:35.870> to

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
have to pop this off I'm going to try to

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:44.560 
have to pop this off I'm going to try to
get<00:01:37.700> my<00:01:37.850> fingers<00:01:37.909> underneath

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:02:02.920 

there<00:01:45.560> we<00:01:45.650> go<00:01:58.270> yeah<00:02:00.850> so<00:02:01.850> I'm<00:02:01.910> just<00:02:02.090> pull<00:02:02.330> it<00:02:02.480> up

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
there we go yeah so I'm just pull it up

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.980 
there we go yeah so I'm just pull it up
to<00:02:03.260> get<00:02:03.410> it<00:02:03.500> off<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:04.850> just<00:02:04.910> pop<00:02:05.270> that<00:02:05.300> let's

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
to get it off and just pop that let's

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:16.200 
to get it off and just pop that let's
look<00:02:06.170> at<00:02:06.260> what<00:02:06.350> connectors<00:02:06.740> use<00:02:06.979> it<00:02:07.160> here

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.210 

it<00:02:16.840> looks<00:02:17.020> like<00:02:17.170> just<00:02:17.320> spring<00:02:17.740> fittings<00:02:18.130> like

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
it looks like just spring fittings like

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.130 
it looks like just spring fittings like
they<00:02:18.400> could<00:02:18.550> actually<00:02:18.670> pull<00:02:19.060> outward<00:02:19.510> rather

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
they could actually pull outward rather

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.320 
they could actually pull outward rather
than<00:02:20.350> straight<00:02:20.560> up<00:02:20.770> their<00:02:21.190> ankles<00:02:21.490> angled<00:02:22.150> so

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
than straight up their ankles angled so

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.370 
than straight up their ankles angled so
if<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.480> pull<00:02:22.690> up<00:02:22.840> on<00:02:22.990> them<00:02:23.140> they're<00:02:23.230> going<00:02:23.320> to

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
if you pull up on them they're going to

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:33.300 
if you pull up on them they're going to
be<00:02:23.500> okay<00:02:27.390> all<00:02:28.390> right<00:02:28.510> so<00:02:29.230> that's<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:32.310> there's

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
be okay all right so that's that there's

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.120 
be okay all right so that's that there's
a<00:02:33.400> better<00:02:33.580> look<00:02:33.820> inside<00:02:34.210> if<00:02:34.420> you're<00:02:34.570> curious

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
one is these two screws here these two

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.460 
one is these two screws here these two
bolts<00:04:35.670> you<00:04:36.390> can<00:04:36.570> just<00:04:36.720> pull<00:04:36.900> them<00:04:37.050> out<00:04:37.080> I'm

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
bolts you can just pull them out I'm

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.930 
bolts you can just pull them out I'm
gonna<00:04:37.710> clip<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:37.980> harness<00:04:38.310> drop<00:04:38.640> the<00:04:38.790> whole

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
gonna clip the harness drop the whole

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.410 
gonna clip the harness drop the whole
thing<00:04:39.210> I<00:04:39.480> didn't<00:04:40.260> have<00:04:40.380> access<00:04:40.560> to<00:04:40.800> it<00:04:41.420> that's

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
thing I didn't have access to it that's

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.580 
thing I didn't have access to it that's
probably<00:04:42.540> way<00:04:42.780> to<00:04:42.840> do<00:04:43.050> it<00:04:43.170> but<00:04:43.350> I<00:04:43.380> actually

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
probably way to do it but I actually

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.890 
probably way to do it but I actually
think<00:04:43.920> I'll<00:04:44.100> be<00:04:44.190> able<00:04:44.340> to<00:04:44.400> pry<00:04:45.030> that<00:04:45.180> out<00:04:45.240> put

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
think I'll be able to pry that out put

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.930 
think I'll be able to pry that out put
that<00:04:46.020> back<00:04:46.170> in<00:04:46.350> without<00:04:47.190> taking<00:04:47.610> it<00:04:47.669> out<00:04:47.790> so

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
that back in without taking it out so

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.330 
that back in without taking it out so
I'm<00:04:48.000> going<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:48.150> give<00:04:48.270> that<00:04:48.300> try<00:04:52.010> yeah<00:04:53.010> there<00:04:53.250> it

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
I'm going to give that try yeah there it

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.590 
I'm going to give that try yeah there it

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
is it's going to take a pair of pliers

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:13.760 
is it's going to take a pair of pliers
act<00:04:57.600> like<00:04:57.810> my<00:04:57.990> extended<00:04:58.410> fingers<00:05:03.200> wiggle<00:05:12.770> is

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
act like my extended fingers wiggle is

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.300 
act like my extended fingers wiggle is
that<00:05:15.320> okay<00:05:16.320> so<00:05:16.380> this<00:05:16.650> is<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:16.890> one<00:05:17.010> we<00:05:17.100> just

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
that okay so this is the one we just

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.270 
that okay so this is the one we just
took<00:05:17.430> out<00:05:18.290> you<00:05:19.290> can<00:05:19.380> see<00:05:19.590> it<00:05:19.710> has<00:05:19.890> nine

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
took out you can see it has nine

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.360 
took out you can see it has nine
connectors<00:05:24.110> part<00:05:25.110> is<00:05:25.260> five<00:05:25.680> zero<00:05:26.010> seven<00:05:26.190> three

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
connectors part is five zero seven three

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.190 
connectors part is five zero seven three
to<00:05:26.610> you<00:05:26.729> and<00:05:26.970> I<00:05:27.360> actually<00:05:27.600> think<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:28.020> one

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
to you and I actually think the one

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.740 
to you and I actually think the one
matters<00:05:29.040> more<00:05:29.250> is<00:05:29.370> at<00:05:29.550> four<00:05:29.729> six<00:05:29.940> six<00:05:30.330> oh<00:05:30.510> nine

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
matters more is at four six six oh nine

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.550 
matters more is at four six six oh nine
four<00:05:31.140> but<00:05:31.770> anyway<00:05:31.950> this<00:05:32.729> is<00:05:33.090> the<00:05:33.570> relay<00:05:33.930> now<00:05:34.530> I

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
four but anyway this is the relay now I

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.920 
four but anyway this is the relay now I
also<00:05:34.800> read<00:05:35.570> that<00:05:38.090> it's<00:05:39.090> actually<00:05:39.510> just<00:05:39.810> that

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
also read that it's actually just that

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.270 
also read that it's actually just that
over<00:05:40.590> time<00:05:40.800> the<00:05:42.590> soldering<00:05:43.590> joints<00:05:43.800> inside<00:05:44.010> go

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
over time the soldering joints inside go

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.040 
over time the soldering joints inside go
bad<00:05:44.430> so<00:05:44.640> technically<00:05:45.360> you<00:05:45.570> could<00:05:45.660> possibly

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
bad so technically you could possibly

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.870 
bad so technically you could possibly
open<00:05:46.320> this<00:05:46.380> up<00:05:46.530> actually<00:05:46.950> I<00:05:46.979> saw<00:05:47.220> one<00:05:47.460> video<00:05:47.729> of

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.150 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:19.860 

tada<00:07:13.240> blinkers<00:07:13.810> are<00:07:13.990> back<00:07:18.629> okay

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:19.870 
tada blinkers are back okay

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.179 
tada blinkers are back okay
it's<00:07:20.439> just<00:07:20.620> that<00:07:20.740> relay<00:07:21.039> Oh<00:07:22.740> me<00:07:23.740> I<00:07:23.770> got<00:07:24.009> mine

00:07:24.179 --> 00:07:24.189 
it's just that relay Oh me I got mine

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:27.409 
it's just that relay Oh me I got mine
off<00:07:24.339> at<00:07:24.490> eBay<00:07:24.699> I<00:07:24.759> think<00:07:24.999> 14<00:07:25.960> bucks<00:07:26.199> and

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:27.419 
off at eBay I think 14 bucks and

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:28.589 
off at eBay I think 14 bucks and
seriously

00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:28.599 
seriously

00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:30.390 
seriously
maybe<00:07:28.779> we'll<00:07:28.900> open<00:07:29.020> up<00:07:29.259> the<00:07:29.889> old<00:07:30.039> one<00:07:30.159> later

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 
maybe we'll open up the old one later

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.820 
maybe we'll open up the old one later
but<00:07:30.729> it<00:07:31.449> dis<00:07:31.719> looks<00:07:31.990> like<00:07:32.139> it<00:07:32.259> was<00:07:32.349> a<00:07:32.379> soldering

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:32.830 
but it dis looks like it was a soldering

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.679 
but it dis looks like it was a soldering
issue<00:07:33.069> and<00:07:33.460> so<00:07:33.729> if<00:07:33.819> you<00:07:33.909> crack<00:07:34.150> it<00:07:34.180> up<00:07:34.449> and

00:07:34.679 --> 00:07:34.689 
issue and so if you crack it up and

00:07:34.689 --> 00:07:36.179 
issue and so if you crack it up and
Industry<00:07:35.169> solder<00:07:35.409> it<00:07:35.620> you<00:07:35.710> can<00:07:35.830> have<00:07:36.009> yours

00:07:36.179 --> 00:07:36.189 
Industry solder it you can have yours

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:38.129 
Industry solder it you can have yours
done<00:07:36.400> for<00:07:36.610> free<00:07:36.789> and<00:07:37.389> if<00:07:37.810> something's<00:07:38.050> going
