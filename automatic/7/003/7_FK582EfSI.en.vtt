that<00:01:01.770> they<00:01:02.100> had<00:01:02.310> pieces<00:01:02.700> love<00:01:03.090> feedback<00:01:03.390> that

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
that they had pieces love feedback that

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.840 
that they had pieces love feedback that
were<00:01:03.960> very<00:01:03.990> prominent<00:01:04.739> about<00:01:05.400> black<00:01:05.670> book

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
were very prominent about black book

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.030 
were very prominent about black book
foundry<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.420> how<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.720> felt<00:01:07.020> unrewarding<00:01:07.829> for

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
foundry and how it felt unrewarding for

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.710 
foundry and how it felt unrewarding for
challenging<00:01:08.700> bosses<00:01:09.180> like<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.570> Iron

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
challenging bosses like the Iron

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.080 
challenging bosses like the Iron
Maiden's<00:01:10.259> to<00:01:10.770> drop<00:01:11.009> loot<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.460> was<00:01:11.670> just<00:01:11.939> as

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
Maiden's to drop loot that was just as

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.870 
Maiden's to drop loot that was just as
good<00:01:12.180> as<00:01:12.510> or<00:01:12.900> possibly<00:01:13.350> worse<00:01:13.650> than<00:01:14.490> grooves

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
good as or possibly worse than grooves

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.660 
good as or possibly worse than grooves
so<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:15.690> is<00:01:15.870> addressing<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.590> problem<00:01:16.670> we

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
so this is addressing that problem we

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.000 
so this is addressing that problem we
also<00:01:17.820> have<00:01:18.090> changes<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.870> the<00:01:19.020> personal<00:01:19.710> loot

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
system and there's going to be a brand

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.070 
system and there's going to be a brand
new<00:01:22.050> UI<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.970> this<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:24.390> literally<00:01:24.960> going

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
new UI and this is just literally going

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.430 
new UI and this is just literally going
to<00:01:25.170> allow<00:01:25.440> us<00:01:25.620> to<00:01:25.830> see<00:01:26.040> our<00:01:26.340> group<00:01:26.909> mates<00:01:27.440> what

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
to allow us to see our group mates what

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.899 
to allow us to see our group mates what

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
loot they get from the personal loot

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.430 
loot they get from the personal loot
system<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.510> apparently<00:01:30.870> we<00:01:30.990> can<00:01:31.140> celebrate

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
system so apparently we can celebrate

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.620 
system so apparently we can celebrate
what<00:01:31.890> our<00:01:32.040> friends<00:01:32.490> get<00:01:32.700> as<00:01:32.970> well<00:01:33.180> when<00:01:33.450> they

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
what our friends get as well when they

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.570

finally get an item they're looking for

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.690 
finally get an item they're looking for
but<00:01:36.270> also<00:01:36.799> they'll<00:01:37.799> be<00:01:37.979> increasing<00:01:38.549> the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
gut reaction is to feel that that's not

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.819 
gut reaction is to feel that that's not
a<00:03:47.069> good<00:03:47.340> thing<00:03:47.400> because<00:03:48.000> not<00:03:48.599> only<00:03:48.709> do<00:03:49.709> we<00:03:49.799> have

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
a good thing because not only do we have

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.270 
a good thing because not only do we have
the<00:03:50.129> RNG<00:03:50.699> of<00:03:50.940> getting<00:03:51.650> unfavorable<00:03:52.650> secondary

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
the RNG of getting unfavorable secondary

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.670 
the RNG of getting unfavorable secondary
stats<00:03:53.609> on<00:03:53.819> an<00:03:53.940> upgraded<00:03:54.510> item<00:03:54.840> but<00:03:55.349> now<00:03:55.620> we

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
stats on an upgraded item but now we

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.039 
stats on an upgraded item but now we
could<00:03:56.250> have<00:03:56.489> secondary<00:03:57.359> stats<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:57.989> are

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
could have secondary stats that are

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.339 
could have secondary stats that are
lower<00:03:58.440> than<00:03:58.650> they<00:03:59.040> could<00:03:59.099> be<00:03:59.609> now<00:04:00.389> maybe<00:04:00.989> this

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
lower than they could be now maybe this

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.289 
lower than they could be now maybe this
sentence<00:04:01.859> this<00:04:02.099> this<00:04:02.430> paragraph<00:04:02.790> I<00:04:02.970> read<00:04:03.150> to

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
sentence this this paragraph I read to

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.420 
sentence this this paragraph I read to
you<00:04:03.329> maybe<00:04:03.720> that<00:04:03.959> just<00:04:04.139> applies<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.129> fact

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
you maybe that just applies to the fact

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.179 
you maybe that just applies to the fact
that<00:04:05.579> the<00:04:05.819> eye<00:04:06.569> level<00:04:07.139> of<00:04:07.379> luton<00:04:07.769> Hellfire

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:08.189 
that the eye level of luton Hellfire

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:11.420 
that the eye level of luton Hellfire
Citadel<00:04:08.430> is<00:04:09.000> going<00:04:09.659> to<00:04:09.810> increase<00:04:10.430> throughout

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
Citadel is going to increase throughout

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.460 
Citadel is going to increase throughout
the<00:04:12.120> helps<00:04:12.419> you<00:04:12.629> know<00:04:12.750> throughout<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.229> raid

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
the helps you know throughout the raid

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.860 
the helps you know throughout the raid
so<00:04:13.799> maybe<00:04:14.159> that's<00:04:14.489> why<00:04:14.790> these<00:04:15.359> secondary

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
so maybe that's why these secondary

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.439 
so maybe that's why these secondary
stats<00:04:16.289> are<00:04:16.560> going<00:04:16.829> to<00:04:16.979> be<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.609> know<00:04:17.759> higher<00:04:18.060> or

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
stats are going to be you know higher or

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.349 
stats are going to be you know higher or
low<00:04:18.780> I<00:04:19.079> hope<00:04:19.829> that<00:04:20.070> that's<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.489> case<00:04:20.519> I<00:04:20.970> really

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
low I hope that that's the case I really

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.320 
low I hope that that's the case I really
do<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.599> don't<00:04:22.199> want<00:04:22.440> any<00:04:22.680> extra<00:04:23.340> rng<00:04:24.030> when<00:04:24.210> it

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
do I don't want any extra rng when it

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.960 
do I don't want any extra rng when it
comes<00:04:24.539> to<00:04:24.690> secondary<00:04:25.139> stats<00:04:25.560> now<00:04:26.220> one<00:04:26.669> thing<00:04:26.699> I

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
comes to secondary stats now one thing I

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.580 
comes to secondary stats now one thing I
didn't<00:04:27.210> tell<00:04:27.360> you<00:04:27.449> about<00:04:27.539> and<00:04:27.960> this<00:04:28.289> is<00:04:28.409> quite
