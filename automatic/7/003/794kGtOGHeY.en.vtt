00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 is just to the first in a little 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.000
 channel 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:13.190
 this time with a booking keyboard is 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.190
 black widow makes the environment said chan 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.340
 here on the front we have is that 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.400
 say that all keys than dodô t4 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.369
 they are cameras which is very good to play 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.980
 and for those who enjoy games in this part 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.790
 here says the same says that all postage 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.640
 all the keys are mechanical that this 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.450
 frame is p 500 is therefore more or less 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.280
 here and also from this ten types of 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.610
 antibiotic 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:52.170
 in the back 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:58.170
 this fourth time that all the keys are 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:02.699
 that you have half an hour 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.330
 ease a response from others 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.990
 normal keyboards have a has two keys 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:19.680
 for games that if that key is activated 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:23.210
 This even when God is not 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.210
 plans that we have more here 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:33.680
 in this part are more important to 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:37.470
 people have spoken of the ancient taste in 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.829
 for coarse mato and has cable cord noé 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.549
 He fixed us to help him out and 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:48.299
 Whenever we make wedges sp 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:51.590
 Now realize then open the box 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.590
 How is this? 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:03.470
 and here is the voter card or symbol 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:10.060
 of sesma 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:10.060
 I think not the top test already on the list 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:26.530
 is what we have here the point we have 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.030
 here in a little card talk 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.250
 simply that we bought the 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:40.280
 keyboard and the house men's signature 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:43.910
 the sister is the same and plans are 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.950
 the roles of the instructions and how 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.950
 install things in here 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:56.710
 also talks about the keys explaining what 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:02.290
 each one did these things 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.290
 let's the most important is the keyboard itself 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:18.640
 here we have the keyboard wrapped in a 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.640
 bread and 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:31.190
 We're here, the car, and I've heard 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:33.260
 the usb domain that connects to a keyboard and 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.740
 it's on the computer 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.760
 all parts end up in gold that's for 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.760
 also have a better answer 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:48.940
 now that the t4 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.940
 we have the keyboard here 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:04:02.660
 I think it has a beautiful design and 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:09.260
 simple as you may notice that the 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:13.490
 gain that activates and does not happen 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:16.940
 windows sunday 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:25.820
 I have English justin wilson third 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:37.010
 case and more but the sound and sound of the 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:40.370
 keys how can the mechanics 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.120
 including this fifth mother examination these 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.810
 things 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.990
 I'm going to turn on the computer for you now. 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:54.470
 to see how it is 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:05:00.220
 back are already there already the keyboard of the 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:04.130
 computer as you can see here noé 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:06.110
 When I bind the drug capsules I was 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:10.190
 green 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:13.490
 even when the dollar is here is this and 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:18.169
 to enable it to load the stf and on f10 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:21.050
 and how can you see that you were connected and 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:23.210
 off even fnf technical which 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.580
 you have to do for the achievement of a

 drive colors where they are or not and 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:29.830
 hot air is essential and if
