00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.630
 please put it once how much water 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.719
 Every German averages every day 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.609
 used to take a shower to wash 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.230
 cook hands to wash toilet too 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.859
 Rinse or wash the laundry 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.260
 it's 113 liters and that would 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.449
 suffice to have a bathtub here 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.980
 half to be filled 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.269
 and now guess how much water 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.210
 somewhere in the world 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.390
 Water cycle is withdrawn by one 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.270
 you have to make the jeans 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.559
 cotton fields better you need water 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.750
 for the production of nitrogen 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.300
 fertilizers you have to bleach the cotton 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.100
 and color dutch scientists 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.110
 have that calculated and if you are 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.449
 everything that summed up, then you come 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.940
 to 11,000 liters for a jeans 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.399
 that would be enough for 50 of these 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.260
 to fill baths here and that is 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.649
 by what they buy through their 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.730
 Consumption through their consumption habits 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.120
 Consume Water elsewhere on the 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.860
 world 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.229
 Scientists speak in this case 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.880
 of virtual water because it is indirect 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.479
 is consumed or from the so-called 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.590
 water footprint of a product of this 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.509
 virtual water of this 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.549
 water footprint always plays 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.920
 more important role in the discussion 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.049
 Water shortage of more and more regions 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.119
 concerns in the world and we want each other 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.009
 the water footprint selected 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.650
 products at some examples 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.619
 look at 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.159
 70 to 75 percent of the world 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.960
 Fresh water consumption go into the 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.140
 agriculture and especially for 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.790
 production of food 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.619
 if you drink a glass of water then 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.689
 is the water footprint of this glass it 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.560
 also about inlet water you need 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.939
 a little bit more water around the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.430
 to clean machines but that was it 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.470
 it also looks very different 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.770
 for the other products a slice 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.070
 bread virtual water consumption 40 liters 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.899
 an apple 70 liters a kilogram 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.570
 potatoes 900 liters 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.890
 and if animals come into play then 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.229
 the water footprint will be much more 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.719
 bigger if you need a lot of food and 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.200
 For that you have to invest a lot of water 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.140
 virtual water consumption of a 200 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.150
 liter just as many 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.360
 a glass of milk about one 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:21.020
 bathtub one kilogram of cheese 5000 liters 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:25.520
 one kilogram doner meat 3900 liters 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.530
 one kilogram of beef 15,500 liters 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.630
 These numbers do not say anything about it 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.550
 from whether it is only ecologically harmless 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.930
 or problematic is beef too 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.620
 There is no food in Germany 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.720
 water shortage 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.610
 if you have beef here from one of 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.440
 then a German is capable of it 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.700
 that's no problem 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.290
 it could be harder if you were to 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.380
 For example, a street got out of the 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.550
 is drought-stricken australia 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.830
 By the way, top leaders in these 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.519
 Coffee is one kilogram around 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.620
 To produce coffee you have to 21,000 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.280
 liters of water somewhere in the circulation 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.580
 revoke 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.760
 put in a cup of coffee with it 140 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.470
 liter of virtual water if you can 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.080
 drinks then only consumes one 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.980
 fifth more times 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.709
 summarized 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.870
 our consumption of real water 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.810
 shower boiling rinse wash 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.220
 that's 113 liters a day ours 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.400
 consumption of virtual water 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.760
 is fit 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.050
 times higher namely 4200 meters technology 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.670
 or one and a half million liters in the 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.830
 this amount of citizens sufficient this 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.090
 Pool to lead here twice 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.200
 we can through our 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.790
 consumer habits 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.790
 the worldwide water crisis 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.159
 this is an exciting but also longer 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.959
 history and they can do that 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:44.250
 are in the current issue of 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.250
 magazine are time
