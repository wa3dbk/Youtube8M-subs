00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.450 
and I mix it with conditioner and water
and<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:40.590> my<00:01:40.770> version<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:41.250> Co

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.740 
and this is just my version of Co
washing<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.970> hair<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.119> don't<00:01:42.450> do<00:01:42.600> this

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
washing the hair I don't do this

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.990 
washing the hair I don't do this
everyday<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:44.040> write<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.579> areas<00:01:44.970> that

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
everyday I just write on the areas that

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.030 
everyday I just write on the areas that
need<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.509> be<00:01:45.540> recur<00:01:46.110> which<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.500> usually<00:01:46.860> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
need to be recur which is usually the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.370 
need to be recur which is usually the
bottom<00:01:47.220> because<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.390> bottom<00:01:48.750> does<00:01:48.990> tend<00:01:49.290> to

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
bottom because the bottom does tend to

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.360 
bottom because the bottom does tend to
tangle<00:01:49.799> up<00:01:50.570> by<00:01:51.570> nighttime

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
tangle up by nighttime

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.040 
tangle up by nighttime
I<00:01:52.430> mean<00:01:52.760> it's<00:01:52.910> not<00:01:53.090> doesn't<00:01:53.300> matter<00:01:53.660> play

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
I mean it's not doesn't matter play

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.590 
I mean it's not doesn't matter play
crazy<00:01:54.320> but<00:01:54.620> it<00:01:54.860> does<00:01:55.490> tangle<00:01:56.000> a<00:01:56.060> little<00:01:56.420> bit

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
crazy but it does tangle a little bit

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.560 
crazy but it does tangle a little bit
now<00:01:57.560> that<00:01:57.800> it's<00:01:57.950> in<00:01:58.100> so<00:01:58.610> I<00:01:58.640> like<00:01:58.970> to<00:01:59.000> just<00:01:59.180> add<00:01:59.510> a

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
now that it's in so I like to just add a

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.150 
now that it's in so I like to just add a
little<00:01:59.750> bit<00:01:59.990> of<00:02:00.080> conditioner<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:00.620> water<00:02:00.680> to

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
little bit of conditioner and water to

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.760 
little bit of conditioner and water to
the<00:02:01.190> hair<00:02:01.490> when<00:02:02.120> I<00:02:02.380> experience<00:02:03.380> a<00:02:03.470> little<00:02:03.560> bit

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
the hair when I experience a little bit

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.390 
the hair when I experience a little bit
of<00:02:03.860> tangling<00:02:04.400> so<00:02:05.060> I<00:02:05.600> also<00:02:05.930> braid<00:02:06.890> it<00:02:07.070> for<00:02:07.250> that

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
of tangling so I also braid it for that

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.730 
of tangling so I also braid it for that
reason<00:02:07.610> now<00:02:08.000> because<00:02:08.479> when<00:02:09.170> I<00:02:09.200> braided<00:02:09.470> at

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
reason now because when I braided at

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.470 
reason now because when I braided at
night<00:02:09.920> and<00:02:10.190> I<00:02:10.310> put<00:02:10.580> a<00:02:10.610> little<00:02:10.820> bit<00:02:11.060> of<00:02:11.180> coconut

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
night and I put a little bit of coconut

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.450 
night and I put a little bit of coconut
oil<00:02:11.810> in<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:12.230> I<00:02:12.350> have<00:02:12.560> found<00:02:12.830> that<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:13.250> hair

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
oil in it I have found that the hair

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.670 
oil in it I have found that the hair
that<00:02:13.640> is<00:02:13.700> not<00:02:13.790> really<00:02:14.210> tingle<00:02:14.660> throughout<00:02:15.380> the

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
that is not really tingle throughout the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.610 
that is not really tingle throughout the
day<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:16.340> I<00:02:16.670> feel<00:02:17.240> like<00:02:17.300> when<00:02:17.660> I<00:02:17.690> braid<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.320> it's

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
day so I feel like when I braid it it's

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.880 
day so I feel like when I braid it it's
just<00:02:18.980> better<00:02:19.220> because<00:02:19.580> when<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.880> hair<00:02:20.060> curls

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
just better because when the hair curls

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.040 
just better because when the hair curls
up<00:02:21.890> throughout<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.030> day<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.300> it<00:02:23.390> dries<00:02:23.690> it

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
up throughout the day and it dries it

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.200 
up throughout the day and it dries it
tends<00:02:24.320> to<00:02:24.410> dry<00:02:24.740> bunched<00:02:25.250> up<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:25.610> then<00:02:25.940> I<00:02:26.030> have

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
tends to dry bunched up and then I have

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.970 
tends to dry bunched up and then I have
to<00:02:26.330> like<00:02:26.420> separate<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.050> curls<00:02:27.260> which<00:02:27.830> is

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
to like separate the curls which is

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.890 
to like separate the curls which is
actually<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.730> same<00:02:29.000> thing<00:02:29.270> that<00:02:29.420> happens<00:02:29.810> to

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900
