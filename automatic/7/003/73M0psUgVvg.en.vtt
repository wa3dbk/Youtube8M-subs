our<00:01:25.550> foam<00:01:25.940> body<00:01:26.240> now<00:01:27.200> I'm<00:01:27.350> going<00:01:27.620> to<00:01:27.740> apply<00:01:27.950> a

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
our foam body now I'm going to apply a

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.100 
our foam body now I'm going to apply a
little<00:01:28.220> bit<00:01:28.430> of<00:01:28.520> ZAP<00:01:28.700> gap<00:01:29.000> on<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.330> bottom<00:01:29.630> of

little bit of ZAP gap on the bottom of
the<00:01:30.229> foam<00:01:30.410> body<00:01:30.650> and<00:01:31.300> then<00:01:32.300> flip<00:01:32.570> it<00:01:32.660> around

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
the foam body and then flip it around

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.250 
the foam body and then flip it around
and<00:01:33.020> secure<00:01:33.410> it<00:01:33.500> to<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.650> top<00:01:33.890> of<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.130> hook

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
and secure it to the top of the hook

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.490 
and secure it to the top of the hook
this<00:01:36.260> will<00:01:36.470> help<00:01:36.710> hold<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:37.760> foam<00:01:38.060> in<00:01:38.300> place<00:01:38.600> so

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
this will help hold the foam in place so

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.900 
this will help hold the foam in place so
that<00:01:39.530> it<00:01:39.770> doesn't<00:01:39.800> wrap<00:01:40.340> around<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.729> hook

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
that it doesn't wrap around the hook

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.749 
that it doesn't wrap around the hook
when<00:01:41.060> you're<00:01:41.210> fishing<00:01:41.420> it<00:01:42.520> just<00:01:43.520> a<00:01:43.610> few

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
when you're fishing it just a few

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.270 
when you're fishing it just a few
seconds<00:01:44.210> should<00:01:44.390> do<00:01:44.740> once<00:01:45.740> it's<00:01:45.920> glued<00:01:46.160> in

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
seconds should do once it's glued in

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.040 
seconds should do once it's glued in
place<00:01:46.600> begin<00:01:47.600> to<00:01:47.780> secure<00:01:48.410> your<00:01:49.100> foam<00:01:49.400> down

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
place begin to secure your foam down

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.540 
place begin to secure your foam down
your<00:01:51.050> body<00:01:51.229> should<00:01:51.650> be<00:01:51.800> sitting<00:01:52.040> on<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.369> hook

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
your body should be sitting on the hook

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.160 
your body should be sitting on the hook
so<00:01:52.729> that<00:01:52.759> when<00:01:53.060> you<00:01:53.180> start<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:53.570> secure<00:01:53.930> it<00:01:53.990> down

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
so that when you start to secure it down

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.740 
so that when you start to secure it down
you<00:01:54.830> can<00:01:54.860> distinguish<00:01:55.430> a<00:01:55.610> body<00:01:55.910> from<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.450> head

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
you can distinguish a body from the head

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.740 
you can distinguish a body from the head
of<00:01:57.350> your<00:01:57.619> beetle<00:01:58.030> we<00:01:59.030> really<00:01:59.420> want<00:01:59.630> a

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
of your beetle we really want a

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.300 
of your beetle we really want a
separation<00:02:00.259> between<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.800> head<00:02:00.950> in<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:01.100> body

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
separation between the head in the body

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.580 
separation between the head in the body
so<00:02:02.210> we're<00:02:02.420> going<00:02:02.630> to<00:02:02.750> continue<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.380> wrap

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
so we're going to continue the wrap

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.400 
so we're going to continue the wrap
around<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.940> foam<00:02:05.210> so<00:02:05.690> that<00:02:05.840> we<00:02:05.960> can<00:02:06.110> clearly

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
around the foam so that we can clearly

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.320 
around the foam so that we can clearly
see<00:02:06.650> that<00:02:06.680> there's<00:02:06.950> a<00:02:07.040> head<00:02:07.220> there<00:02:07.400> and<00:02:07.640> body

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
see that there's a head there and body

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.600 
see that there's a head there and body
there<00:02:08.830> now<00:02:09.830> we're<00:02:10.009> going<00:02:10.100> to<00:02:10.160> tie<00:02:10.399> in<00:02:10.520> a

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
there now we're going to tie in a

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.790 
there now we're going to tie in a
variegated<00:02:10.940> leg<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.900> take<00:02:12.110> one<00:02:12.350> strand<00:02:12.620> and

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
variegated leg you take one strand and

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.260 
variegated leg you take one strand and
then<00:02:12.890> cut<00:02:13.130> it<00:02:13.220> in<00:02:13.310> half<00:02:13.550> so<00:02:13.850> that<00:02:14.000> we<00:02:14.120> have

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
then cut it in half so that we have

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.199 
then cut it in half so that we have
equal<00:02:14.750> size<00:02:14.959> legs<00:02:15.350> on<00:02:15.530> either<00:02:15.680> side<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:17.000> leg

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
equal size legs on either side the leg

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.420 
equal size legs on either side the leg
will<00:02:17.390> have<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.540> natural<00:02:18.080> bend<00:02:18.380> to<00:02:18.560> it<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:19.130> bend

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
will have a natural bend to it the bend

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.460 
will have a natural bend to it the bend
you<00:02:19.640> want<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:20.060> be<00:02:20.180> facing<00:02:20.570> toward<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.170> fly

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
you want to be facing toward the fly

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.710 
you want to be facing toward the fly
this<00:02:22.430> way<00:02:22.640> when<00:02:22.850> you<00:02:22.970> tie<00:02:23.209> in<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.480> legs

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
this way when you tie in the legs

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.699 
this way when you tie in the legs
they'll<00:02:24.709> have<00:02:24.920> more<00:02:25.190> of<00:02:25.340> a<00:02:25.459> spider<00:02:25.910> you<00:02:26.030> look

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
they'll have more of a spider you look

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.680 
they'll have more of a spider you look
