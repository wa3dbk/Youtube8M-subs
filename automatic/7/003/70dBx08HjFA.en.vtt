00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 but then why do not we walk 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.490
 barefoot here that would be stimulating 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.200
 but maybe a bit painful though 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.910
 and if for once instead of putting on 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.880
 our feet for markets have weighed way 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.800
 reverse that we take off our boots for 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.260
 embark on a hike fingers 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.090
 feet in complete freedom 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.250
 I propose the barefoot path of the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.170
 dull of the board for a year four 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.439
 military can we have already walked this 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:33.690
 landscaped path where these fairs get better 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.430
 but it's his game and then it sticks a 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.899
 at the foot at the start are quite 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.610
 Suitable for walking barefoot our 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.290
 shoes were born only for 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.300
 protect us from the cold and to prevent 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.809
 injuries to their program 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.219
 today wake up our primary senses 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:51.030
 paya palace on stage times he can 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.649
 to miss me sometimes what would not 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.680
 not good in your skin while there by 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.800
 example the skin is free and the relays 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.300
 hugs and then at your feet have a 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.980
 contact with the outside so you can 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.140
 feel new things with your 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.090
 foot everything and we do not walk to 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.040
 same pace without shoes it takes 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.610
 adapt his speed and look where one 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.200
 put feet 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.930
 the first impression is the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.430
 well-being serenity people have 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.280
 the impression of making a path 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.240
 poetic if we want it here because by 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.210
 feet feel different 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.920
 sensations in fact that we forgot after 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.049
 two and a half kilometers from Corsica 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.880
 straw from the hay aisne of 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.100
 stones and rocks a little bath of 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.930
 feet for boys the experience is 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.130
 conclusive 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.350
 I think I like to walk to pinet 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.079
 it's always shoes socks and 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.610
 so there it is really a big good 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.680
 walk barefoot the time of a path 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.960
 yes but could we do without our 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.939
 everyday shoes bernard joseph 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.490
 is one of those people who appreciate 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.119
 this direct contact with the earth coach 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.250
 athletic 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.350
 it mainly covers barefoot or in 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.479
 ultra minimalist sandals for him 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.850
 running without shoes is synonymous with 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.369
 well 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.590
 and fun the madness is different in 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.259
 makes them a lot more natural like 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.690
 apache shoes actually one for me 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.500
 on the back of the foot on the heel when 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.840
 we run barefoot 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.850
 we tend to put forward the 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.530
 well where the middle of the foot turns 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.290
 also with a much higher frequency 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.780
 high from 175 to 180 ba 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.170
 hit the ground every minute so that 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.959
 we spread the weight of the body over 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.020
 of not what makes each step to 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.300
 less ground pressure less impact 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.700
 only one can not therefore of the same 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.620
 way with or without yves shoes 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.600
 Bernard insists on running or walking 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.459
 long distances barefoot it takes 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.200
 an adaptation phase 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.790
 the best technique is to pass 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.120
 by transition shoes or 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.830
 minimalist I started everything at 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.840
 start to run with this shoe so 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.880
 so these shoes extremely 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.760
 minimalist that is a little more 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.650
 that the very flexible here is very light and 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.239
 the toes are separated when we pass 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.280
 conventional because before chosen 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.829
 conventional shoes with no 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.390
 badly the cushioning aa of minimalism it takes 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.430
 be very careful because our foot 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.200
 become a little lazy caused the 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.329
 shoe and so we owe their muscles 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.739
 to relearn how to run without 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.079
 shoes must be counted at least 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.080
 six months up to two years depending 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:19.960
 distances we hope to cover 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.750
 here we are just going to look at your posture 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.180
 the whole knee posture 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.400
 hips and shoulders 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.350
 as to whether the advisors of 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.390
 market without shoes meet you is 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.060
 taken with Mrs. Mendes postural 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.010
 pauliste l analyzes the link between the foot 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.870
 posture after analyzing the case of 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.850
 Bernard his verdict a product this is a 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.370
 the more he was in direct contact with the 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.680
 ground and there live information 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.850
 there he has no intermediaries if not 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.010
 candidates a shoe to a 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.720
 the additional intermediate 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.430
 injuries or the words are very few 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.860
 often related to poorly chosen shoes 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.390
 because poorly adapted to our physiology 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.860
 you have small sensors at the 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.590
 foot soles in museums in 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.530
 the tendons and the shoe can have 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.870
 affect this sensitivity there 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.360
 because she can for example if it's 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.240
 too much foam does not have enough 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.040
 information that starts at the level of 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.290
 nervous system to have a better 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.490
 proprioception yes the shoe can 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.070
 cause problems 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.609
 hence the importance of finding shoes to 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.739
 his foot 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.060
 if they do not respect the 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.730
 foot morphology 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.220
 if you do not respect the shape of the foot 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.740
 it's a constraint for the foot 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.200
 a constraint for your posture if 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.850
 you must each time adapt to 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.190
 this shoe that we who is not 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.410
 adapted bernard is promoting in 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.690
 belgium of the barefoot running the race 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.850
 barefoot followers gets off by 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.750
 curiosity for pleasure and also for 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.220
 health issues 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.660
 a decade ago I will run 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.570
 the more I had to stop because of 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.610
 knee injury is here pretty average 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.740
 boyfriend who told me about running feet 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.990
 naked I put myself little by little and more 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.240
 I managed to do 10 15 km and more 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.910
 no other cost no one happy so we 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.220
 it's a good point and once you have 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.220
 tasted this difficult barefoot race 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:09.110
 apparently to get back we will have a 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.210
 very different ground contact 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:15.650
 contact with what surrounds us very 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.880
 different and that's it if I put my 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.700
 shoes I really feel 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.490
 to be isolated from the balance no longer feel anything 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:27.770
 I do them once and I gave up 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:30.500
 I resold ended the morals of this 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.290
 story with or without shoes 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.260
 matter to nothing is no use to run it must 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.090
 to start 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.190
 well everyone his way to take his 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.050
 foot said thanks to samantha slender mast 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.060
 Aurelie vaneck Hoyt and Fanny Rock for 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.220
 this show is my dream team ma 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.050
 secret boot and we do not let go 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.550
 a sole since we already have an appointment 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.450
 you next week for a 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.870
 new everything is explained

 good evening
