I<00:00:08.750> am<00:00:09.750> going<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.049> explain<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.680> difference

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:11.459 
I am going to explain the difference

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:14.320 
I am going to explain the difference
between<00:00:11.820> hockey<00:00:12.480> skates<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.139> figure<00:00:13.500> skates

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
between hockey skates and figure skates

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.600 
between hockey skates and figure skates
figure<00:00:15.330> skates<00:00:15.690> have<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.200> long<00:00:16.529> flat<00:00:17.279> blade

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
figure skates have a long flat blade

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.749 
figure skates have a long flat blade
with<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.119> topic<00:00:18.570> at<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.869> end<00:00:19.070> the<00:00:20.070> topic<00:00:20.520> is

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:20.759 
with a topic at the end the topic is

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.390 
with a topic at the end the topic is
used<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.240> do<00:00:21.419> jumps<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.590> especially<00:00:22.830> used

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
used to do jumps and is especially used

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.070 
used to do jumps and is especially used
to<00:00:23.699> land<00:00:23.970> from<00:00:24.359> doing<00:00:24.660> jumps<00:00:26.630> hockey<00:00:27.630> skates

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
to land from doing jumps hockey skates

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.370 
to land from doing jumps hockey skates
have<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.590> short<00:00:28.980> blade<00:00:29.359> the<00:00:30.359> ends<00:00:30.750> are<00:00:30.929> rounded

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
have a short blade the ends are rounded

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.820 
have a short blade the ends are rounded
for<00:00:31.679> speed<00:00:32.239> the<00:00:33.239> boot<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:33.809> hockey<00:00:34.170> skates<00:00:34.559> are

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
for speed the boot on hockey skates are

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.299 
for speed the boot on hockey skates are
a<00:00:34.860> lot<00:00:35.190> more<00:00:35.220> loose<00:00:35.790> than<00:00:35.820> figure<00:00:36.449> skates<00:00:37.309> this

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
a lot more loose than figure skates this

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.459 
a lot more loose than figure skates this
enables<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.970> hockey<00:00:39.180> player<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.960> move<00:00:40.170> freely

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
enables the hockey player to move freely

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.049 
enables the hockey player to move freely
and<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.489> make<00:00:41.670> sudden<00:00:42.149> changes<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:42.899> direction

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
and to make sudden changes in direction

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.060 
and to make sudden changes in direction
whereas<00:00:45.059> figure<00:00:45.480> skates<00:00:45.809> have<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.680> tighter

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
whereas figure skates have a tighter

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.389 
whereas figure skates have a tighter
fitting<00:00:48.030> boot<00:00:48.390> which<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.140> more<00:00:49.500> secure<00:00:50.010> for<00:00:50.340> a

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
fitting boot which is more secure for a

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.810

here is a skater in hockey skates hockey
skates<00:01:33.530> are<00:01:33.770> a<00:01:33.830> little<00:01:34.190> harder<00:01:34.520> to<00:01:34.729> balance<00:01:34.880> in

skates are a little harder to balance in

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.870 
skates are a little harder to balance in
because<00:01:35.869> of<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.110> shorter<00:01:36.440> blade<00:01:36.650> but<00:01:37.520> because

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
because of the shorter blade but because

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.210 
because of the shorter blade but because
they<00:01:38.180> are<00:01:38.300> shorter<00:01:38.750> with<00:01:39.170> no<00:01:39.440> topic

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
hockey players can do this now that you

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.310 
hockey players can do this now that you
know<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:47.060> difference<00:01:47.509> between<00:01:47.720> hockey

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
know the difference between hockey

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.649 
know the difference between hockey

skates and figure skates and have seen

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.260 
skates and figure skates and have seen
examples<00:01:51.080> of<00:01:51.470> each<00:01:51.729> when<00:01:52.729> going<00:01:52.940> ice<00:01:53.240> skating

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
examples of each when going ice skating

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.660 
examples of each when going ice skating
for<00:01:53.690> fun<00:01:54.080> and<00:01:54.350> trying<00:01:54.619> to<00:01:54.830> decide<00:01:55.190> which<00:01:55.460> kind

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
for fun and trying to decide which kind

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.270 
for fun and trying to decide which kind
of<00:01:55.820> skates<00:01:56.180> to<00:01:56.450> get<00:01:56.659> most<00:01:57.409> of<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.710> time<00:01:57.740> figure

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
of skates to get most of the time figure

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.219 
of skates to get most of the time figure
skates<00:01:58.610> are<00:01:58.850> easier<00:01:59.270> for<00:01:59.330> beginners<00:01:59.930> because

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
skates are easier for beginners because

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.609 
skates are easier for beginners because
of<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.649> tighter<00:02:00.950> boot<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:01.550> longer<00:02:02.060> blade<00:02:02.619> but

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
of the tighter boot and longer blade but

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.919 
of the tighter boot and longer blade but
mostly<00:02:04.009> it<00:02:04.550> comes<00:02:05.000> down<00:02:05.240> to<00:02:05.570> personal

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
mostly it comes down to personal

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.679 
mostly it comes down to personal
preference
