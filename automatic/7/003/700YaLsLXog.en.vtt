00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
you have it on the 360 then when you

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.000 
you have it on the 360 then when you
upgrade<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.809> get<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> Xbox<00:00:46.530> one<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.770> get

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010

minecraft<00:00:47.250> from<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:48.270> actually<00:00:48.600> only

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
minecraft from that you actually only

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.139 
minecraft from that you actually only
have<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.930> pay<00:00:49.050> like<00:00:49.230> $4.99<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:49.950> believe<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.969> it's

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
have to pay like $4.99 I believe so it's

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.369 
have to pay like $4.99 I believe so it's
actually<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> lot<00:00:51.600> cheaper<00:00:51.629> which<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.260> thought

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
actually a lot cheaper which I thought

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.420 
actually a lot cheaper which I thought
was<00:00:52.469> kind<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.680> cool<00:00:52.860> kind<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.219> an<00:00:53.309> upgrade

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
was kind of cool kind of an upgrade

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.389 
was kind of cool kind of an upgrade
system<00:00:53.850> see<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.480> will<00:00:54.690> have<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:54.989> both<00:00:55.170> but<00:00:56.010> my

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
system see I will have it on both but my

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.360 
system see I will have it on both but my
in<00:00:56.699> my<00:00:56.969> opinion<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.780> think<00:00:57.960> Xbox<00:00:58.739> one<00:00:59.010> not

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
in my opinion I think Xbox one not

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.310 
in my opinion I think Xbox one not
necessary<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.820> can<00:00:59.879> be<00:01:00.030> better<00:01:00.300> but<00:01:00.629> right<00:01:01.170> off

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
necessary it can be better but right off

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.170 
necessary it can be better but right off
the<00:01:01.559> gate<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:02.039> think<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.670> more<00:01:02.910> people<00:01:03.030> are

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
the gate I think that more people are

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.359 
the gate I think that more people are
gonna<00:01:03.300> enjoy<00:01:03.539> xbox<00:01:04.320> one<00:01:04.589> minecraft<00:01:04.890> better

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
gonna enjoy xbox one minecraft better

new<00:01:39.450> worlds<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.619> Xbox<00:01:40.950> one<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.460> think

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
new worlds on the Xbox one I think

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.160 
new worlds on the Xbox one I think
that's<00:01:41.970> what's<00:01:42.150> gonna<00:01:42.210> give<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> edge<00:01:42.780> at

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
that's what's gonna give it the edge at

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.020 
that's what's gonna give it the edge at
least<00:01:43.409> R<00:01:43.470> at<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.710> very<00:01:43.860> beginning<00:01:44.280> I'm<00:01:44.399> sure

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
least R at the very beginning I'm sure

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.969 
least R at the very beginning I'm sure
that<00:01:45.299> people<00:01:45.570> will<00:01:45.689> make<00:01:45.990> great<00:01:46.350> maps<00:01:46.710> for

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
that people will make great maps for

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.710 
that people will make great maps for
both<00:01:47.130> consoles<00:01:47.549> I'm<00:01:48.030> sure<00:01:48.240> we'll<00:01:48.420> find<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.689> way

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
both consoles I'm sure we'll find a way

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.940 
both consoles I'm sure we'll find a way
to<00:01:48.840> like<00:01:49.110> make<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.320> where<00:01:49.530> they're<00:01:49.649> compatible

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
to like make it where they're compatible

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.340 
to like make it where they're compatible
