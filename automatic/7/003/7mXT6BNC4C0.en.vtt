you<00:04:36.160> like<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.520> video<00:04:36.760> because<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.150> last<00:04:37.330> one

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
you like the video because the last one

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.659 
you like the video because the last one
had<00:04:37.660> such<00:04:37.960> big<00:04:38.169> success<00:04:38.650> on<00:04:38.800> it<00:04:38.950> and<00:04:39.160> I<00:04:39.400> think

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
had such big success on it and I think

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.420 
had such big success on it and I think
this<00:04:39.760> one<00:04:40.000> is<00:04:40.150> just<00:04:41.110> matches<00:04:41.680> up<00:04:41.800> to<00:04:41.830> it<00:04:42.040> or<00:04:42.190> if

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
this one is just matches up to it or if

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.760 
this one is just matches up to it or if
not<00:04:42.610> better<00:04:42.850> so<00:04:43.600> if<00:04:43.990> you<00:04:44.229> can<00:04:44.380> just<00:04:44.410> give<00:04:44.680> this

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
not better so if you can just give this

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.730 
not better so if you can just give this
