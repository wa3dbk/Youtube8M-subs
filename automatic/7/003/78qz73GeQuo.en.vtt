on doing any body paint but I decided

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.040

that I was just going to the face the
kind<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.320> looking<00:01:07.530> weird<00:01:07.740> if<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.920> didn't<00:01:08.100> do<00:01:08.220> my

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
kind of looking weird if I didn't do my

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.610 
kind of looking weird if I didn't do my
shoulders<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.720> just<00:01:09.960> decided<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.350> do<00:01:10.500> that

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
shoulders so I just decided to do that

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.620 
shoulders so I just decided to do that
as<00:01:10.800> well

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
as well

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.370 
as well

these little lines on your face and the
shape<00:01:17.160> that<00:01:17.340> I'm<00:01:17.460> drawing<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.910> middle<00:01:18.090> of

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
shape that I'm drawing in the middle of

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.030 
shape that I'm drawing in the middle of
my<00:01:18.210> forehead<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.780> kind<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.350> like<00:01:19.500> an<00:01:19.619> upside

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
my forehead is kind of like an upside

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.680 
my forehead is kind of like an upside
down<00:01:20.070> screw<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.880> if<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.210> picture<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.630> in

down screw so if you can picture that in

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.210 
down screw so if you can picture that in
your<00:01:21.750> mind<00:01:21.840> then<00:01:22.470> that's<00:01:22.740> pretty<00:01:22.950> much<00:01:23.040> what

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
your mind then that's pretty much what

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.380 
your mind then that's pretty much what
you're<00:01:23.280> drawing<00:01:23.550> on<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.850> center<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.300> your

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
you're drawing on the center of your

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.219 
you're drawing on the center of your
forehead<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:25.080> then<00:01:26.300> really<00:01:27.300> I'm<00:01:27.630> just

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
forehead and then really I'm just

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.270 
forehead and then really I'm just
outlining<00:01:28.470> all<00:01:29.009> these<00:01:29.310> shapes<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:31.280> basic

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
outlining all these shapes so that basic

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.560 
outlining all these shapes so that basic
shape<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.700> we<00:01:32.789> started<00:01:33.149> with

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
shape that we started with

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.660 
shape that we started with
we're<00:01:34.140> just<00:01:34.289> outlining<00:01:34.740> all<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.280> shapes<00:01:35.520> that

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
we're just outlining all the shapes that

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.940 
we're just outlining all the shapes that
we<00:01:35.850> drew<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.390> then<00:01:36.750> shading<00:01:37.140> everything<00:01:37.440> to

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
we drew and then shading everything to

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.210 
we drew and then shading everything to
kind<00:01:38.190> of<00:01:38.250> make<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.550> look<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:39.030> guess<00:01:39.869> 3d<00:01:40.289> make<00:01:41.100> it

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
kind of make it look I guess 3d make it

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.920 
kind of make it look I guess 3d make it
look<00:01:41.340> more<00:01:41.430> like<00:01:41.580> a<00:01:41.640> mask<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.210> not<00:01:42.300> your<00:01:42.660> face

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
look more like a mask and not your face

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.719 
look more like a mask and not your face
so<00:01:43.619> that's<00:01:43.770> really<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.220> key<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.460> this<00:01:44.520> whole

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
so that's really the key to this whole

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.270 
so that's really the key to this whole
look<00:01:44.940> is<00:01:45.210> making<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.080> basic<00:01:46.289> outline<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.830> what

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
look is making a basic outline of what

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.520 
look is making a basic outline of what
you<00:01:47.399> want<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.910> then<00:01:48.210> shading<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.050> to<00:01:49.259> make<00:01:49.410> it

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
you want and then shading it to make it

00:01:49.530 --> 00:02:14.630 
you want and then shading it to make it
look<00:01:49.590> more<00:01:49.979> realistic

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.679 

nice<00:02:15.640> team<00:02:15.849> to<00:02:15.939> make<00:02:16.060> that<00:02:16.090> face<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:16.480> couple

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:16.689 
nice team to make that face a couple

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:18.929 
nice team to make that face a couple

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:20.490 
does because actually I kept looking at
the<00:02:19.060> camera<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.689> trying<00:02:20.019> to<00:02:20.110> see<00:02:20.260> everything

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
the camera and trying to see everything

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.470 
the camera and trying to see everything
with<00:02:20.829> symmetrical<00:02:21.400> but<00:02:21.909> like<00:02:22.060> this<00:02:22.120> is<00:02:22.269> a<00:02:22.299> good

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
with symmetrical but like this is a good

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.390 
with symmetrical but like this is a good
thing<00:02:22.689> but<00:02:23.019> it<00:02:23.140> kind<00:02:23.319> of<00:02:23.349> looked<00:02:23.560> awkward<00:02:23.709> and

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
thing but it kind of looked awkward and

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.770 
thing but it kind of looked awkward and
when<00:02:24.489> I<00:02:24.519> wash<00:02:24.760> back<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.090> footage<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.540> was<00:02:25.629> like

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
when I wash back the footage I was like

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.390 
when I wash back the footage I was like
what<00:02:26.049> am<00:02:26.290> i<00:02:26.500> doing

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
what am i doing

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.339 
what am i doing
but<00:02:27.970> anyway<00:02:28.269> right<00:02:28.510> now<00:02:28.659> you<00:02:28.720> see<00:02:28.989> me<00:02:29.140> doing

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
but anyway right now you see me doing

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.809 
but anyway right now you see me doing
the<00:02:29.590> eyes<00:02:29.739> and<00:02:30.069> it<00:02:30.159> was<00:02:30.250> kind<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.489> difficult

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
the eyes and it was kind of difficult

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:31.949 
the eyes and it was kind of difficult
because<00:02:30.879> I<00:02:31.060> had<00:02:31.209> to<00:02:31.269> close<00:02:31.420> my<00:02:31.599> eyes<00:02:31.750> when<00:02:31.900> I

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
because I had to close my eyes when I

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.539 
because I had to close my eyes when I
was<00:02:32.140> doing<00:02:32.379> it<00:02:32.500> but<00:02:33.069> you're<00:02:33.159> really<00:02:33.400> just

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
was doing it but you're really just

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.309 
was doing it but you're really just
drawing<00:02:33.879> about<00:02:34.120> tingles<00:02:34.510> over<00:02:34.659> your<00:02:34.810> eyes<00:02:34.959> and

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
drawing about tingles over your eyes and

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.930 
drawing about tingles over your eyes and
pointing<00:02:35.829> it<00:02:35.950> out<00:02:36.040> like<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.250> triangle<00:02:36.730> up<00:02:36.819> the

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
pointing it out like a triangle up the

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.660 
pointing it out like a triangle up the
corners<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:38.620> then<00:02:38.739> I<00:02:38.769> decided<00:02:39.129> to<00:02:39.250> fill<00:02:39.430> there

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
corners and then I decided to fill there

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.589 
corners and then I decided to fill there
with<00:02:39.940> a<00:02:40.090> blue<00:02:40.980> face<00:02:41.980> paint<00:02:42.400> makeup<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:43.090> then<00:02:43.569> I

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
with a blue face paint makeup and then I

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:44.849 
with a blue face paint makeup and then I
put<00:02:43.750> some<00:02:43.780> white<00:02:44.049> over<00:02:44.379> it<00:02:44.470> because<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.769> kind

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
put some white over it because it kind

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.319 
put some white over it because it kind
of<00:02:44.950> looked<00:02:45.099> more<00:02:45.310> like<00:02:45.370> his<00:02:45.609> eyes<00:02:45.730> when<00:02:46.060> I<00:02:46.120> put

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
of looked more like his eyes when I put

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.990
