00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.799
 greet you friends in the next 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.010
 the release of the myth league if you enjoy 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.080
 this episode don't forget to like it and 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.610
 immediately to the myth blade kane strike like 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.980
 will interact with each other 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.560
 skill under the w key in two warriors and 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.170
 left this myth from the discharge of those above 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.420
 you never thought of if you 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.220
 not aware of silver bolt skill and content 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.230
 creates silver rings over the target 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.240
 which is absorbed by the accumulation of three 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.820
 stacks and do extra damage 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.430
 but what will there be 2 pancakes will 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.680
 attack the same goal the result is surprising 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.290
 and in itself is pretty buggy 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.480
 as you can see both wayne alternately 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.550
 attack the target and visually they concluded 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.980
 then showing only two rings then not 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.440
 showing no as can be seen by 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.050
 video is a broken mechanic and how is it 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.030
 works really nobody knows but 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.100
 we continued the test and I noticed that 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.649
 most likely it's just a visual glitch 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.480
 no more look carefully and you 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.949
 see how alternating the first few 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.960
 god attacks present 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.940
 but as soon as I attacked twice in a row 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.030
 instead of alternating skill right away 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.010
 chased away and this is still not all more 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.869
 The following we turned out to be interesting 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.760
 continued to alternate attacks and 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.290
 slow motion video can be seen as bent 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.060
 silver bolt skill will inflict 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.580
 additional damage though visually on 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.470
 the goal was not a single ring more likely 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.659
 total game correctly calculates the ring 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.210
 on target but visual effect doesn't work 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.670
 correctly and now we will look at buy it 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.939
 skill dentin gloes here's a little 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.350
 demonstration of pro to her skill on purpose 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.540
 test conditions are the same as in the test 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.329
 swain but wai skill looks more 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.640
 working rather than the way you see skill 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.970
 we hit goals by turns but visual 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.650
 Effect 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.960
 get stuck on two lines when we 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.460
 changing and even when I am such a goal 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.380
 twice in a row then visual effect 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.299
 shows two stacks twice 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.240
 at least 100 cinema goals 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.720
 displayed in this should check them 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.119
 mechanics next myth sent jyp tu 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.950
 can scarner or zion use 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.590
 ult and to pass through the new gate 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.570
 on the map summoner a breakdown we will test 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.670
 this myth on the blue gate which 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.140
 belong to the turnover skarnier team 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.479
 serve as an obstacle to enemy 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.030
 champions and how do you see skarnir 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.920
 able to push the target through the gate but 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.959
 as the skarnier passes through them to me 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.269
 It seemed strange and I tried another 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.099
 time and as you see a little effort 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.590
 with corner u still manage to stretch 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.780
 the enemy through the gate now take a look at 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.420
 Zion and his Ultu begin with red 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.129
 Ziona on the blue base, he ultaet on target 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.590
 outside the gate but not him successfully 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:34.140
 stop now zion from the team 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.910
 blue players usually try 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.920
 colors corresponding to the gate may 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.140
 pass through them unimpeded but 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.000
 as we see everything he stops even 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.760
 despite belonging to the gate of his 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.650
 team, I decided to try again 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.299
 running ulta closer to the gate to 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.629
 make sure they don't stop me 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.010
 walls but it looks like they have nothing to do with it 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.230
 the next myth is from the steering wheel i 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.329
 if the target is in the center of the zone 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.200
 stunning vader dies then get 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.049
 either igor kill 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.030
 this myth is very interesting as you can see 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.099
 Vader use camp but also salon 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.739
 touches the edge and does not interact 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.510
 with aha skill as soon as i die myself 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.239
 from the tower in the games gets kill 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.760
 in fact he did not deal damage and not at all 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.940
 touched sour very strange 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.519
 mechanics and the last myth of the episode from 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.650
 sweater is very easy to get lich gots to 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.500
 cults if he means the passive form 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.209
 Zion's passive form is power forever 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.489
 wondrously interacted with 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.190
 other skills of champions until his 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.680
 remade and that cho'gat kills Zion 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.620
 eats up his passive form and gets 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.739
 your stack results of the myth are highly anticipated 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.919
 and that's all thanks for watching and 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.500
