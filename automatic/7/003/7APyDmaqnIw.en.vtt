00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.380
 has been 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.480
 where the likely as I said only 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.820
 there is now a short press for every press 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.519
 is there a title for you? 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.130

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.730

 now available and hardcore class 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.390
 stain and chaos moshpit was 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:44.300
 rausgehauen I believe and yes we come 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:47.219
 time to the zombie update there yes 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.620
 wonderful down and down 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.949
 Europe 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.390
 here you can see mobility for you 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.280
 player two player three games four 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.699
 players the leaderboards and all the way 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.640
 The End 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.829
 what have a nice christa block yes 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.729
 finally a painful mode again 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.010
 tale blog and unfortunately only a four 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.880
 leaderboard though he is, I believe 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:19.350
 also exactly the same or you want that on your 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:21.479
 songs letter or good and yes I am 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.030
 really looking forward to it like this 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.010
 Run the picture for you profession that 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.380
 they took it that way 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.780
 but can see better 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.900
 not so often 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.670
 and yes, I am extremely looking forward to that 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.780
 you finally have new freestyle 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.369
 here was and by the way were also became 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.550
 announced that for the ps3 and pc 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.780
 people yes the micro transactions packs 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.720
 available are therefore the micro 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.890
 transaction parcel and for the the 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.700
 do not know what it is 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.610
 so these are the ones that can be 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.990
 Personalization spec where a camouflage 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.630
 there is a title and three like her 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:10.519
 their for the or each one very for 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:16.700
 the holographic ag and many checks 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:19.010
 or so and so on and get paid 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.010
 there is one vision altogether 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.140
 Nine personalization spec to 1 dollar 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.970
 99 I guess they will be the 1 1 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.540
 Convert that into the psn store 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.810
 or xbox live store always like 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.980
 The takers are never really the right ones 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.130
 currency conversion I find with the 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.290
 money has to come from somewhere 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:43.430
 june so next you can also do the 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.650
 buy flat for the calling cards and 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:50.180
 costs I do not know it is david 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:53.090
 speck baukosten pennies I guess in 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.380
 a packet is a few bottles 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.049
 trainer maybe four pieces or so 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.570
 and it was the 19 post I think 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:03.440
 ridiculous that the flags title was 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.100
 the cost of mp3 mp2 was big 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.350
 conclusion with it 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.220
 well I buy the step similar to 90 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.820
 several 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.340
 classes editor packs buy for two 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.870
 so normally euro by default 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.020
 you have ten if you prestige 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.620
 authors 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:28.130
 the salary has been unlocked 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.350
 ten classes editor and through this 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.860
 Partly you get 90 because you have 100 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.510
 overall I think it is a good 100 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.860
 bit too much maybe 50 would 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.520
 still go and maybe could too 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.880
 make full 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.700
 with a class only schneider and me 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.660
 but not only the smi and me 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.400
 Next will be the club of lng here 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.480
 above all, they are getting full 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.459
 clear moore play 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.800
 We'll definitely get that thing on everyone 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.620
 case full for each map and the weapon 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.750
 So it makes sense for this 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.630
 Need to speak, of course, clearly where 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.100
 people or other very many 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.980
 making classes and coming next 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.770
 then the zombie walk transphobia becomes 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.209
 be available separately for everyone 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.200
 must not include these as appropriate 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:18.109
 because you can buy the wheel for 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.870
 five euros for the ps3 and pc people like 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.860
 said and he still casually for 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:28.310
 multiplayer gives free on the 25th 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.600
 I find all an insolence what 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.910
 you already a month ago so 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.090
 actually spoke there 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.030
 were promised use only for 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.610
 pre-order and what is he getting now 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.450
 pushed a butt 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:46.490
 well activision as just say you open 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:50.660
 the so goodbye and what 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:52.729
 has questions about this update to the video 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.390
 to the patch whatever shops in the 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.220
 Comments 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.820
 and you see yourself as always in some 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.820
 another video
