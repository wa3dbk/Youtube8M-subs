but<00:00:54.989> apparently<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.559> theme<00:00:55.890> has<00:00:56.039> also<00:00:56.250> been

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
but apparently the theme has also been

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.189 
but apparently the theme has also been
polished<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.030> little<00:00:57.059> bit<00:00:57.329> more<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:58.050> that's

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
polished a little bit more so that's

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.979 
polished a little bit more so that's
nice<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.590> see<00:00:58.800> um<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.309> personally<00:01:00.210> don't<00:01:00.390> use<00:01:00.480> my

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
nice to see um I personally don't use my

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.660 
nice to see um I personally don't use my
Atrix<00:01:01.410> as<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.620> daily<00:01:01.859> driver<00:01:02.160> anymore<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.640> I

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
Atrix as a daily driver anymore so I

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.369 
Atrix as a daily driver anymore so I
probably<00:01:03.030> won't<00:01:03.210> be<00:01:03.420> able<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.600> point<00:01:03.840> out<00:01:04.110> any

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
probably won't be able to point out any

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.890 
probably won't be able to point out any
of<00:01:04.500> those<00:01:04.880> changes<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.030> he<00:01:06.180> has<00:01:06.360> made

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
of those changes that he has made

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.080 
of those changes that he has made
however<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.560> he<00:01:07.860> does<00:01:08.040> actually<00:01:08.610> has<00:01:08.909> some

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
however the he does actually has some

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.850 
however the he does actually has some
new<00:01:09.210> status<00:01:09.689> bar<00:01:09.869> icons<00:01:10.229> apparently<00:01:10.740> so

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
new status bar icons apparently so

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.039 
new status bar icons apparently so
that's<00:01:11.010> nice<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.369> see<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.840> some<00:01:12.840> small

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
that's nice to see and some small

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.600 
that's nice to see and some small
changes<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.650> status<00:01:13.950> bar<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.220> he's<00:01:14.340> made

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
changes to the status bar that he's made

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.280 
changes to the status bar that he's made
some<00:01:14.880> subtle<00:01:15.180> changes<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.630> he's<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.229> he's

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
some subtle changes that he's that he's

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.929 
some subtle changes that he's that he's
mentioned<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:16.830> his<00:01:16.950> change<00:01:17.189> luck<00:01:17.490> none<00:01:17.909> of

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
mentioned in his change luck none of

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.899 
mentioned in his change luck none of
which<00:01:18.150> I've<00:01:18.360> been<00:01:18.390> able<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.750> see<00:01:18.990> myself<00:01:19.170> yet

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
which I've been able to see myself yet

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.130 
which I've been able to see myself yet
however<00:01:20.909> that's<00:01:21.360> definitely<00:01:21.840> something<00:01:22.049> for

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
however that's definitely something for

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.990 
however that's definitely something for

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
look a whole lot different to me mind

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.850 
look a whole lot different to me mind
you<00:01:33.360> it's<00:01:33.479> been<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> long<00:01:33.990> time<00:01:34.380> since<00:01:34.650> I've

been since since I've used neutrino roms

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.950 
been since since I've used neutrino roms
so<00:01:37.530> there<00:01:37.950> may<00:01:38.130> be<00:01:38.159> some<00:01:38.549> some<00:01:39.270> minor<00:01:39.479> changes

like in the Play Store searching for

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.449 
like in the Play Store searching for
something<00:03:13.260> or<00:03:13.470> anything<00:03:13.680> for<00:03:13.920> that<00:03:13.980> matter

so that's a nice little addition mind

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.970 
so that's a nice little addition mind
you<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:21.810> thought<00:03:22.019> that's<00:03:22.230> always<00:03:22.410> been<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.709> part

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
you I thought that's always been a part

you I thought that's always been a part
of<00:03:23.040> nutrient<00:03:23.430> or<00:03:23.519> um<00:03:23.669> but<00:03:23.910> again<00:03:23.940> I<00:03:24.180> could<00:03:24.389> be

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
of nutrient or um but again I could be

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.940 
of nutrient or um but again I could be
wrong<00:03:24.630> it's<00:03:24.870> been<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.019> while<00:03:25.200> since<00:03:25.380> I'd<00:03:25.590> use<00:03:25.769> it

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
wrong it's been a while since I'd use it

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.800 
wrong it's been a while since I'd use it
um<00:03:26.280> in<00:03:26.519> addition<00:03:26.609> to<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.150> it's<00:03:27.329> got<00:03:27.480> lis<00:03:27.599> some

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
um in addition to that it's got lis some

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.780 
um in addition to that it's got lis some
