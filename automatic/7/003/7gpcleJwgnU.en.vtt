video today i'm going to be doing a

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.820 
video today i'm going to be doing a
video<00:00:13.340> about<00:00:13.670> contouring<00:00:14.420> your<00:00:14.690> face<00:00:14.930> okay

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
now the idea behind contouring is that

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.569 
now the idea behind contouring is that
you<00:00:19.550> and<00:00:20.409> define<00:00:21.409> the<00:00:21.859> bit<00:00:22.009> so<00:00:22.159> you<00:00:22.279> want<00:00:22.429> to

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:22.579 
you and define the bit so you want to

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.450 
you and define the bit so you want to
define<00:00:22.970> and<00:00:23.300> contour<00:00:24.109> away<00:00:24.890> the<00:00:25.099> bits<00:00:25.279> you

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
define and contour away the bits you

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.349 
define and contour away the bits you
don't<00:00:25.669> want<00:00:25.909> to<00:00:26.029> see<00:00:26.319> so<00:00:27.319> how<00:00:28.279> it<00:00:28.429> works<00:00:28.460> is<00:00:29.089> the

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
don't want to see so how it works is the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.670 
don't want to see so how it works is the
shadows<00:00:29.839> and<00:00:30.050> light<00:00:30.409> and<00:00:30.829> so<00:00:31.579> be<00:00:31.789> looking<00:00:32.210> to
