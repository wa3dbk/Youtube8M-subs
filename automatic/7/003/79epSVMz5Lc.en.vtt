00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.239

 will stay here on the screen for you 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.219
 I decided to buy on the site because 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.530
 I identified myself with this model here. 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.330
 which to me is one of the coolest chat site is 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.490
 that he already comes with the stool with the 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.430
 frame and also already provides the handle 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.390
 depending on your choice of the 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.979
 pixar fair 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.830
 I know many of you are 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.869
 asking the site is trustworthy yes in 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.840
 My opinion I had no problems in 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.640
 question with the site is bad and everything ran 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.930
 superbem Islands answered all 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.770
 my friends have always been super 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.570
 attentive 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.340
 before making the purchase and even 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.189
 for them trying to take my doubt and the 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.270
 team in design always responded all 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.970
 The program I had was with my 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.850
 stool that was a mistake of my father 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.040
 also educating is on the bench but the staff 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.320
 always been super careful with me or not 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.140
 happened because while the guy was 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.939
 fetch the truck's seat 30 and 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.470
 paper that my father signed as he is 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.689
 Good thing we ask is in the house. 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.220
 You're supreme, you just have to leave the 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.149
 after you see the product on the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.890
 your front 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.810
 so when he was taking one that 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.549
 I'm fascinated, he's back on the stage. 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.350
 I just said I did the delivery 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.420
 wrong I took this stool in a 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.460
 neighborhood I'm going to get there and also 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.930
 I'll bring the guy late at night. 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.000
 arrived and at night even on the same day 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.170
 I sent my watch and told it all. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.480
 that the event was also my father's 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.720
 because this lot to see the other product 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.100
 day in the morning he came back brought to the dance 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.870
 I just want to see the pastor I 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.460
 Wanted I Wanted Not Being Floral 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.530
 because my room is super colorful I guess 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.570
 that you join the videos and she 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.890
 same leopard print and in the period of the 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:32.410
 afternoon of the 2nd second not the next day 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.030
 of the stool delivery error to the store 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.220
 look for design called us asking 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.080
 what had happened so easy than 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.330
 send an email to them asking if 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.709
 I wanted to change your bunker for sure. 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.660
 and then we stopped to think and 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.459
 it had already gone more than 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.020
 a month to order from pixar and mother who 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.520
 Then we try to stay with 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.530
 this bank even because I'm not so 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.390
 ugly and so he always lived all 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.270
 not even in this problem that does not 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.459
 It was the store's fault and the pedals in 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.870
 carrier then it is super recommend 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.790
 this site for you guys think that any 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.800
 doubt that you invented them 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.239
 also half is half of the site too 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.070
 I do not know that many of you 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.230
 asked why I chose to buy a 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.910
 site and not the carpenter's first because 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.010
 the model I had chosen had already 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.110
 on the site with all the details like here 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.790
 It has a relief there over the hard hand it 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.290
 try a super cute drawing that would 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.049
 make all the difference and no more 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.420
 money depending on how it would not 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.190
 do it the then still yet 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.690
 My father asked me to get me his drawing. 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.030
 that he did not feel safe and make the 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.680
 purchase of the first design and 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.480
 he took several cabinetmakers from here 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.250
 my city is now capital paulo 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.519
 everyone was busy or else they charged 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.790
 absurd values ​​people then the right 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.890
 was the only commission that did not 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.510
 was bought by site gave it all 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.100
 thank god 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.500
 another thing is also super cool of 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.000
 he does not send a video on the site. 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.160
 mirror we have to make a 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.780
 but it 's super simple and its 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.700
 frame we had differentiated cuts 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.070
 Economy is only you leads to a frame 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.980

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.720

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.000
 Comes with the dividers inside the drawer 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.840
 I'll take it to show you about it. 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.060
 ii 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.950
 but whoever did it has these measures and I 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.650
 drawing the partitions for him too 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.430
 he did in the first two drawers of the 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.560

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.120
 of the dressing table and tomorrow asked 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.680
 in what area had it been purchased 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.870
 The dressing table that already responds was in the 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.190
 music and dot com design and asked 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.290
 which the time value does not remember 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:44.169
 now but I remember it was about 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:46.900
 800 and bring it there and that is the site he 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.270
 also the flash charge was very real there 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.729
 had interest because we went through two 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.620
 sometimes it's not so cool but so 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.270
 at the time of purchase there he has more options 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.300
 how do you pay the bill for the pagseguro 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.340

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.810

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.880
 in another thing also delivery rate 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.680
 takes super friend took more than a 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.479
 month to get a stool and the dresser 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.760
 because they are separated from 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:12.270
 first they send her the dressing table 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.979
 already comes mounted well these two 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.020
 Let's not say such hangars. 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:18.729
 attacks of those already assembled from there 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.590
 know how to make the frame box on them is 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:23.110
 super simple they send up the 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.479
 screws to say so, right? 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.330
 first there is one of the cabinets and the frame 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:29.770
 and then they send the banquet hockey 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.720
 I think I answered all the doubts. 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.160
 It is very important for you if you are 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.770
 buy a dresser in this model 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.139

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.389
 white opaque success so take the 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.910

 doubts of you but you continue with 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.960
 a common doubt is that the more I go
