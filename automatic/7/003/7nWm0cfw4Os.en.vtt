should<00:02:03.810> be<00:02:03.960> firm<00:02:04.260> not<00:02:05.160> breaking<00:02:05.640> apart<00:02:05.759> that

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
should be firm not breaking apart that

should be firm not breaking apart that
one's<00:02:06.530> breaking<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.800> little<00:02:07.979> bit<00:02:08.100> but<00:02:09.030> you're

these<00:02:35.700> actually<00:02:35.940> call<00:02:36.360> for<00:02:37.170> planning<00:02:37.500> on<00:02:37.590> four

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
these actually call for planning on four

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.290 
these actually call for planning on four
inches<00:02:38.010> deep<00:02:38.250> this<00:02:38.519> is<00:02:38.640> about<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:38.910> four<00:02:39.269> inch

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
inches deep this is about a four inch

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.210 
inches deep this is about a four inch
cup<00:02:39.750> these<00:02:40.110> might<00:02:40.320> be<00:02:40.470> three<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:40.890> half<00:02:41.040> inch

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
cup these might be three and half inch

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.710 
cup these might be three and half inch
cups<00:02:41.459> either<00:02:42.209> way

soil<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.680> about<00:02:43.890> here<00:02:44.450> so<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:46.200> know<00:02:46.320> the

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
soil to about here so that you know the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.620 
soil to about here so that you know the
roots<00:02:46.620> can<00:02:46.800> form<00:02:47.070> around<00:02:47.190> there<00:02:47.580> even<00:02:48.420> about

roots can form around there even about

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.570 
roots can form around there even about
there<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.680> you're<00:02:49.860> gonna<00:02:49.980> cover<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.430> with

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
there and you're gonna cover it with

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.789 
there and you're gonna cover it with
maybe<00:02:51.060> two<00:02:51.299> inches<00:02:51.570> of<00:02:51.720> soil<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.290> doesn't<00:02:52.350> have

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
maybe two inches of soil it doesn't have

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.539 
maybe two inches of soil it doesn't have
to<00:02:52.920> be<00:02:53.010> four<00:02:53.310> inches<00:02:53.340> below<00:02:55.160> you're<00:02:56.160> planning

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
to be four inches below you're planning

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.370 
to be four inches below you're planning
them<00:02:56.640> indoors<00:02:56.910> sometimes<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.720> depth<00:02:58.019> that

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
them indoors sometimes the depth that

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.960 
them indoors sometimes the depth that
you<00:02:58.530> plant<00:02:58.769> them<00:02:58.890> outside<00:02:59.100> is<00:02:59.549> to<00:02:59.640> protect

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
you plant them outside is to protect

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.640 
you plant them outside is to protect
them<00:03:00.120> from<00:03:00.269> frost<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:00.870> cold<00:03:01.079> you<00:03:01.380> have<00:03:01.560> to

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
them from frost and cold you have to

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.190 
them from frost and cold you have to
worry<00:03:01.799> about<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:02.190> indoors<00:03:02.549> so<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.420> drop<00:03:03.989> in

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
worry about that indoors so you drop in

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.789 
worry about that indoors so you drop in
pre-moistened<00:03:04.709> starting<00:03:05.549> mix<00:03:06.380> and<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.590> do

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
pre-moistened starting mix and you do

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.259 
pre-moistened starting mix and you do
want<00:03:08.070> to<00:03:08.130> press<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.549> down<00:03:08.579> you<00:03:08.910> don't<00:03:08.940> want<00:03:09.180> it

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
want to press it down you don't want it

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.990 
want to press it down you don't want it
to<00:03:09.420> be<00:03:10.040> really<00:03:11.040> loose<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.370> want<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:11.610> press<00:03:11.820> it

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
to be really loose you want to press it

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.069 
to be really loose you want to press it
down<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.480> few<00:03:13.079> hours<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:17.780> pressing<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:18.900> down

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
down a few hours that pressing it down

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.910 
down a few hours that pressing it down
just<00:03:19.290> gives<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:20.360> more<00:03:21.360> density<00:03:21.840> better<00:03:22.650> for

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
just gives it more density better for

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.460 
just gives it more density better for
the<00:03:23.010> bulb<00:03:23.190> roots<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:24.510> that's<00:03:24.989> all<00:03:25.140> it<00:03:25.290> looks

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
the bulb roots and that's all it looks

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.100 
the bulb roots and that's all it looks
like<00:03:25.680> just<00:03:25.980> like<00:03:26.190> that<00:03:26.690> dropping<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.810> bulb

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.630 

make<00:03:31.110> sure<00:03:31.140> it<00:03:31.410> sits<00:03:31.620> in<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:31.890> center<00:03:32.100> press<00:03:32.489> it

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
make sure it sits in the center press it

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.850 
make sure it sits in the center press it
in<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.820> little<00:03:33.090> bit<00:03:33.209> and<00:03:33.900> then<00:03:34.170> just<00:03:34.200> cover<00:03:34.739> it

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
in a little bit and then just cover it

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.009 
in a little bit and then just cover it
with<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.459> soil<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:36.360> don't<00:03:36.540> have<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.750> press<00:03:36.989> it

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
with the soil you don't have to press it

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.380 
with the soil you don't have to press it
down<00:03:37.320> as<00:03:37.620> much<00:03:37.920> but<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.280> want<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.579> be<00:03:38.700> firm

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.310 

and<00:03:42.390> you<00:03:42.480> know<00:03:42.570> what<00:03:42.690> I<00:03:42.780> would<00:03:42.930> do<00:03:43.049> ten<00:03:43.290> of

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
and you know what I would do ten of
