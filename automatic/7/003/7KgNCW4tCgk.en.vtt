00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.100
 I 'm left caught today 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.240
 This time 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.970
 Follow 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:15.860
 I also tried to make a Gorori RC car 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:21.140
 The pre-made radio controlled car collides with the wall and collapses immediately 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:23.670
 Much less is of this time was made with decent technique Les 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.330
 Durability is strong 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.600
 Then I think that I want to do it immediately 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.550
 There is no channel this time 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.040
 Such controller 0 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.760
 Aja 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.030
 It's usually from before but I'm currying it due to video issues 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.030
 High 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.840
 Free to comb like this 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.180
 And with this handle 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:04.339
 I hope you can tilt it to the right 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:06.480
 Expect to lean to the left 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.320
 You go 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:15.490
 The previous one is 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.770
 It was difficult for me to turn straight and go straight as gear situation was not enough 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.560
 now 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.619
 No nerd 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.130

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.710
 And idle 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.710
 No I want to run a little 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.840
 Eh. 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.950
 difficult 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.600
 Back you want to return to 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.300
 I danced 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.330
 And 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.870
 The secret is not only this 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.870
 How 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.440

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.110
 Dark place is 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.110
