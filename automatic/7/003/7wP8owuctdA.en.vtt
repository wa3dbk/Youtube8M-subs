00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:39.620
 because we are really good 80 90 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:44.059
 maybe come get out of the water 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:50.789
 I need to get me out of the water 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:54.750
 Do you just stop here? 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.960
 someday my christian people this time 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.629
 in the cockpit is definitely ever 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.629
 a good one not worthwhile as new 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:02:12.190
 I think so really nice job 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.190
 relatively cheap 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.910
 We'll be back soon 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.890
 present 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.940
 there it is more beautiful 99 times from the day and 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.370
 night fire on 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.060
 so it can go on the tables are 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:35.590
 So on the way to the topic via hours 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.550
 versions of the sun go fish 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.550
 one can refuse yes 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.500
 Usually we only let go 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.500
 if we remember the alpha 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.610
 so far
