00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.030 
somebody was down they filled in and
picked<00:02:49.870> them<00:02:49.989> up<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.379> did<00:02:50.530> some<00:02:50.680> things<00:02:50.920> and

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
picked them up and did some things and

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.710 
picked them up and did some things and
looked<00:02:51.190> out<00:02:51.340> for<00:02:51.519> each<00:02:51.579> other<00:02:51.819> it<00:02:51.970> just<00:02:52.000> was<00:02:52.299> it

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
looked out for each other it just was it

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.300 
looked out for each other it just was it
was<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.870> special<00:02:53.110> time<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:53.650> we<00:02:53.739> bring<00:02:53.950> recruits

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
was a special time and we bring recruits

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.410 
was a special time and we bring recruits
in<00:02:54.489> and<00:02:54.670> they<00:02:54.730> would<00:02:54.879> just<00:02:55.030> feel<00:02:55.269> the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
in and they would just feel the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.449 
in and they would just feel the
chemistry<00:02:55.569> of<00:02:55.900> our<00:02:56.079> team<00:02:56.319> and<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:56.769> think<00:02:56.980> we

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
chemistry of our team and I think we

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.220 
chemistry of our team and I think we
sensed<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.120> that<00:02:58.269> that<00:02:58.420> was<00:02:58.569> a<00:02:58.599> model<00:02:58.870> that<00:02:59.049> we

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
sensed it that that was a model that we

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.509 
sensed it that that was a model that we
really<00:02:59.440> wanted<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.739> build<00:02:59.980> our<00:03:00.099> team<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.430> on
