00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
thought about it and hoped it and I

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.729

wasn't<00:02:11.099> happen<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.819> was<00:02:11.970> just<00:02:12.239> it<00:02:13.140> was<00:02:13.170> it

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
wasn't happen and it was just it was it

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.570
