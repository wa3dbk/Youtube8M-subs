all<00:02:23.840> these<00:02:23.930> packs<00:02:24.170> million<00:02:24.560> coins<00:02:25.190> had<00:02:25.310> a

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
all these packs million coins had a

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.460 
all these packs million coins had a
couple<00:02:25.610> gaps<00:02:25.850> we<00:02:26.150> got<00:02:26.300> Leno<00:02:26.990> in<00:02:27.140> that<00:02:27.260> pack

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470

couple gaps we got Leno in that pack
that's<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.710> really<00:02:28.100> good<00:02:28.190> goalkeeper<00:02:28.670> my

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
that's a really good goalkeeper my

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.150 
that's a really good goalkeeper my
opinion<00:02:29.090> he<00:02:29.270> sounds<00:02:29.540> like<00:02:29.660> 40k<00:02:30.050> maybe<00:02:30.920> less

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
opinion he sounds like 40k maybe less

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160 
opinion he sounds like 40k maybe less
than<00:02:31.190> that<00:02:31.400> but<00:02:31.820> he<00:02:31.910> looks<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:32.510> good<00:02:32.780> on<00:02:32.930> car

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
than that but he looks so good on car

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.350 
than that but he looks so good on car
looks<00:02:33.440> very<00:02:33.680> similar<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.130> Noah<00:02:34.400> I'm<00:02:35.180> probably
