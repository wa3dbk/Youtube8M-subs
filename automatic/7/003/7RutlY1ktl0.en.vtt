00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
gets on the internet at the same time

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.250 
gets on the internet at the same time
and<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.280> pay<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:56.730> ten<00:00:57.120> megabytes<00:00:57.510> per<00:00:57.750> second<00:00:58.109> I

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
and I pay for ten megabytes per second I

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.610 
and I pay for ten megabytes per second I
get<00:00:58.920> like<00:00:59.460> one<00:01:00.270> or<00:01:00.480> two<00:01:00.510> during<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.410> nighttime

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
get like one or two during the nighttime

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.359 
get like one or two during the nighttime
so<00:01:02.660> sometimes<00:01:03.660> really<00:01:04.049> hard<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.320> play<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.799> you

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
so sometimes really hard to play and you

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.039 
so sometimes really hard to play and you
know<00:01:05.489> like<00:01:05.640> I'll<00:01:06.030> get<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.390> spinning<00:01:06.840> wheel

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
know like I'll get that spinning wheel

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.469 
know like I'll get that spinning wheel
thing<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.590> then<00:01:07.710> they'll<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.220> goal<00:01:08.520> I'm

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
thing and then they'll have a goal I'm

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.020 
thing and then they'll have a goal I'm
just<00:01:09.600> like<00:01:09.810> what<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.320> hell<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.490> don't<00:01:11.820> I

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
just like what the hell and I don't I

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.679 
just like what the hell and I don't I
never<00:01:12.240> quit<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.869> don't<00:01:13.200> like<00:01:13.290> quitting<00:01:14.630> so<00:01:15.630> I

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
never quit I don't like quitting so I

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.960 
never quit I don't like quitting so I
just<00:01:15.990> take<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.380> loss<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:17.159> think<00:01:17.759> probably

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
just take the loss and I think probably

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.460 
just take the loss and I think probably
fifty<00:01:18.420> percent<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.840> those<00:01:18.900> losses<00:01:19.140> are

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
fifty percent of those losses are

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.380 
fifty percent of those losses are
reflected<00:01:19.950> by<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.310> or<00:01:20.549> by<00:01:20.820> me<00:01:21.030> screwing

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
reflected by that or by me screwing

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.200 
reflected by that or by me screwing
around<00:01:21.590> with<00:01:22.590> my<00:01:22.799> silver<00:01:23.070> squad<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:23.909> anyways

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
around with my silver squad but anyways

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.320 
around with my silver squad but anyways
here's<00:01:24.810> my<00:01:24.990> cereal<00:01:25.380> team<00:01:25.619> obviously<00:01:26.189> not<00:01:26.790> 100

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
Norwegian kind of hard to get chemistry

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.060
