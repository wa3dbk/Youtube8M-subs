as many as you can bro I'm probably

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.450 
as many as you can bro I'm probably
gonna<00:00:18.869> fit<00:00:19.199> what<00:00:19.800> do<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:19.920> think<00:00:19.980> I'm<00:00:20.279> probably

gonna fit what do you think I'm probably

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.920 
gonna fit what do you think I'm probably
to<00:00:20.699> do<00:00:20.789> three<00:00:21.000> or<00:00:21.090> four<00:00:21.330> that's<00:00:21.510> probably<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
to do three or four that's probably the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.689 
to do three or four that's probably the
max<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.260> can<00:00:22.439> fit<00:00:22.619> in<00:00:22.680> my<00:00:22.710> mouth<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.400> trick

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
max that can fit in my mouth the trick

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.370 
max that can fit in my mouth the trick
is<00:00:24.949> don't<00:00:25.949> let<00:00:26.160> them<00:00:26.310> sit<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.609> your<00:00:26.699> mouth<00:00:26.820> long

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
is don't let them sit in your mouth long

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.380 
is don't let them sit in your mouth long
so<00:00:28.380> they<00:00:28.500> don't<00:00:28.680> melt<00:00:28.890> when<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:29.880> start<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.240> get

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
so they don't melt when you start to get

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.530 
so they don't melt when you start to get
what<00:00:30.630> they<00:00:30.810> start<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.230> expand<00:00:31.759> really<00:00:32.759> i<00:00:32.969> just
