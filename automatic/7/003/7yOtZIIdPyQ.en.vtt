air dry for three hours before I started
styling<00:00:30.380> it<00:00:30.529> because<00:00:30.920> it<00:00:31.100> does<00:00:31.310> take<00:00:31.550> a<00:00:31.609> while

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
styling it because it does take a while

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.330

bit<00:00:34.460> more<00:00:34.670> time<00:00:34.970> I<00:00:35.000> probably<00:00:35.360> will<00:00:35.600> let<00:00:35.840> my

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
bit more time I probably will let my

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
another benefit to letting your hair

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.400 
another benefit to letting your hair
air-dry<00:03:10.430> for<00:03:11.000> a<00:03:11.030> longer<00:03:11.450> period<00:03:11.480> of<00:03:11.840> time<00:03:11.900> is

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
air-dry for a longer period of time is

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.460 
air-dry for a longer period of time is
that<00:03:12.620> when<00:03:13.069> you<00:03:13.250> do<00:03:13.549> style<00:03:14.299> it<00:03:14.569> it<00:03:14.780> tends<00:03:15.349> to

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
that when you do style it it tends to

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.130 
that when you do style it it tends to
stretch<00:03:15.920> further<00:03:16.280> then<00:03:17.090> if<00:03:17.239> you<00:03:17.420> just<00:03:17.780> style

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
stretch further then if you just style

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.680 
stretch further then if you just style
your<00:03:18.410> hair<00:03:18.590> on<00:03:18.799> wet<00:03:19.160> hair<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:20.180> my<00:03:20.329> hair<00:03:20.360> is

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
your hair on wet hair and my hair is

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.960 
your hair on wet hair and my hair is
pretty<00:03:20.930> damp<00:03:21.379> at<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.860> roots<00:03:22.160> so<00:03:22.340> if<00:03:22.579> I<00:03:22.730> had<00:03:22.940> a

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
pretty damp at the roots so if I had a

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.940 
pretty damp at the roots so if I had a
little<00:03:23.420> bit<00:03:23.540> more<00:03:23.720> time<00:03:23.989> I'd<00:03:24.230> probably<00:03:24.440> let<00:03:24.739> my

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
little bit more time I'd probably let my

00:03:24.950 --> 00:04:04.950 
little bit more time I'd probably let my
hair<00:03:25.370> dry<00:03:26.030> a<00:03:26.150> little<00:03:26.540> bit<00:03:26.690> longer

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.960 

so<00:04:05.960> this<00:04:06.170> is<00:04:06.350> the<00:04:06.470> finished<00:04:06.830> look<00:04:07.130> a<00:04:07.430> couple<00:04:07.880> of

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
so this is the finished look a couple of

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.510
