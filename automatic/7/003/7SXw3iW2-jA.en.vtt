 And 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.700
 This middle 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.020
 I This Is 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:27.159
 White balance 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.159
 It is said that the mode is switched according to the shooting situation 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.880
 On it, which makes the menu 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.850
 Here 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.710

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.970
 Built-in smartphone 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.180
 Basic photo session 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:59.100
 You can set along 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:59.100
 My infobar a 01 is the largest HDTV size 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:10.220
 Usually that vga Toka, which can be set up to 720 p Nde You can trace shooting 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.660
 It's per qvga 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:18.870
 Here to do the vja 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:20.130
 If you can change it to 720p or something like HDTV 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:31.670
 To the end 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:31.670
 Up to 30 minutes of movie shooting time can be set to shoot continuously 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.410
 That's why I said that 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:44.460
 Built-in video function 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:50.520
 Especially, the sound is broken when saying that the frame delay 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:55.360
 There are times when the picture breaks off and it is to this camera zoom 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:58.630
 In fx video shooting function 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.350
 There is no such thing, 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:08.700
 Well than a standard a micro camera 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:14.340
 I think camera zoom fx is easier to use 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:19.350
 Yes this time it is built in camera zoom fx 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:23.360

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.360
