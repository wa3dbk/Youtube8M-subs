00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.589
 Guys, why should I move on the ground 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.910
 Russian technology 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.799
 you need to try need to know in 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.830
 reality than our face 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.410
 Soviet tank crews then one hour work 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.609
 changes the day the song the same enemy yes he 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.039
 no harvest trophies 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.300
 even managed to make war on our side in 5 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.300
 Guards Tank Brigade 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.460
 panzerkampfwagen 4 or as it is called 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.100
 we have t4 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.350
 This is a German medium tank that has become the most 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.390
 a massive tank of nazi germany 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.250
 commercially available in several 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:46.250
 modifications from 1937 to 1945 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.129
 manufactured by cereals securities Nibelung 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.650
 Werke whole was made over 8 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.730
 thousand and a half tanks in our case 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:58.129
 Panzer 4 modifications g 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:09.080
 curls survived Fritz to every tankman 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:11.360
 in his wicket crew five people in 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.930
 tank turret gunner and charging and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.899
 gunner 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:26.130
 this 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:29.580
 dimensions length 6,620 millimeters width 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.950
 2840 millimeters height 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:36.820
 2680 millimeters weight 23 and a half 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.220
 tons the foursome was 60 percent 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.470
 Nazi Germany tanks designers 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.170
 laid a good modernization 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.900
 potential in the car and it came in handy to them 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.479
 having been repulsed by Soviet tankers and 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.880
 gunners the Germans began to strengthen 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.850
 armor and weapons t4 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.420
 this led to a significant weighting 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.800
 Tank by the way now I visually 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.310
 demonstrate that after weighting 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.539
 tank 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.420
 the front side sank see this rink he 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:11.580
 spinning it turns out that karma tank 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.580
 got up and he stands exactly 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.450
 the last and most powerful gun became 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.540
 seventy five millimeter kw forty 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.720
 forty-eight caliber also on the tank 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.500
 installed two machine gun caliber 792 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.810
 millimeter mg34 powerful gun and good 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.370
 optics distinguished German tanks 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.370
 from our but not only that 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.440
 product from the fighting compartment 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.380
 nothing prevents well they 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.990
 prepared to kill 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.930
 in motion the combat vehicle lead 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.430
 V-shaped 12-cylinder four-stroke 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.280
 carburetor engine fluid 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.520
 maybach cooling capacity 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.100
 300 horsepower located in the rear 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.380
 parts of the tank and the transmission visually 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.560
 divides the car into two parts leaving 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.560
 forward 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.689
 driver's seat in one word 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:23.720
 foreign car you sit high visibility very 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:23.720
 good let's get started 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.040
 the engine is not at all vigorous but high-torque 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:53.090
 on the first gears and here 5 very panzer 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.950
 confidently rushing its advantages is reliability and 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.050
 high-quality launch in any 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.920
 climatic conditions and any 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.060
 temperatures 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.010
 but voracious he is godless 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.799
 double tank suspension 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.540
 rubberized road wheels on a quarter 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.420
 elliptical leaf springs 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.239
 support rollers driving wheel and 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.489
 sloth is completely uncomfortable fighting 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.180
 car over terrain since suspension 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.669
 dependent 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.190
 and does not allow for big moves 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.729
 rinks and accordingly provide 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.729
 smooth running 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.490
 speed of 40 kilometers per hour on the highway 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.030
 country road 16 that's just not in Russian 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.030
 country road 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.100
 Russian yes they were the safest kept 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:46.910
 German tanks narrow tracks were taken to 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.389
 our life you weapons you know what 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.389
 our frosts 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.669
 but it does not detract from the dignity 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.460
 cars but still say booking 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:00.580
 It was weak them here frontal makes 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.850
 50 millimeters plus 30 millimeters bead 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:08.190
 and combat vehicle hull feed have 20 and 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.190
 30 millimeters forehead tower 50 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:17.190
 it's hot as everything is fine and you 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.500
 German technology a lot of German 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.990
 technology a lot of German technology we have 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.330
 dedicated to the whole pavilion people who 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.170
 come here must see with whom of 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.270
 what technique 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.860
 our Soviet tankers fought in the year 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.470
 great pure war even more so 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.180
 I will say that in our pavilion 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.880
 the presented technique is practically all 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:39.270
 from the beginning of the war to its end and 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.560
 Moreover I will say that we have in the museum 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.290
 single copies of these 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.280
 for example, few of which exist anywhere else 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.280
 in no 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:56.039
 and 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.570
 panzerkampfwagen 4 for its time by 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.980
 quite tolerable car is not better and not worse 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.200
 my classmates 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.130
 both on road performance and on 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.680
 firepower 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:20.230
 The success of the combat vehicle in the fields 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.390
 battles like snows of Russia and in 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:24.070
 sands of africa this is not a consequence 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.980
 technical component 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:29.290
 Wehrmacht crew training and skillful 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.250
 command capacity application 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.190
 combat vehicle 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.900
 but no matter what, even after the war 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.980
 the tank continued to serve 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:40.360
 having been repaired they were in service 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.560
 Czechoslovak Army right up to the beginning 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.260
 50s 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:47.080
 besides Czechoslovakia the postwar years 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:49.840
 Panzer 4 and exploited in the armies 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:53.340
 spain turkey france finland 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.340
 bulgaria and 7 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.780
 good tank reliable everyone does not 

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:18.620
 realize that first our grandfathers 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:20.930
 stood under their onslaught and then burned not 

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.800
 forget who sows the wind 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.800
 reap the whirlwind
