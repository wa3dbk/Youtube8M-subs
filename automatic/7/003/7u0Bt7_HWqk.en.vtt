00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.899
 now friends and titus we are strict 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.450
 we are going to present a tutorial of how 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.780
 root your samsung galaxy s3 in the 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.959
 Android version 4.2.2 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.250
 so so 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.289
 well before starting this tutorial 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.060
 to remind you again that we do not get 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.900
 responsible for the damages you can 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.490
 cause your phone if it goes wrong 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.680
 but good to say that it is totally 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.110
 sure and before you start that you do 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.380
 a backup in keys 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.120
 and what is installing the drivers of the 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.800
 phone by connecting it and synchronizing the 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.200
 conquest and good 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.020
 before I start telling you that you have to 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.270
 download the root file from this 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.030
 page and we will leave you the link of the 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.260
 description and that is also through 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.129
 you 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:55.250
 you will have to extract the file in the 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.470
 desk and use the ones we use 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.329
 for 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.070
 to update it to 4 point of 2.2 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.600
 Y 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.619
 and well we have to put it in pda 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:14.409
 and find the file here is a 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:17.890
 such file and we also have what 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:21.119
 start the download mode the mobile or 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.119
 that we will have to turn it off 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.499
 paying 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:34.180
 and like in the initial installation 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.710
 mode unloads all three buttons at once 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.510
 let's continue 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.630
 we plug in 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:45.189
 there 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.189
 and we give start 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.049
 as you see, it goes fast 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.540
 and I would be 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.540
 the movilh starts 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.090

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.090

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.739
 how it starts 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.100
