00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:10.349
 remove the joystick multimedia system 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.250
 lining easily removed it holds 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.290
 on latches 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.470
 here is the joystick itself there is a trick 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.610
 Again, we need two of the blade's need 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:27.690
 pick up a single latch 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:31.170
 Now when I take off I'll show everything and here 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:38.400
 he will easily jump out of us 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:40.890
 holding here one two three 4 that is by 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.920
 Essentially we just squeeze this one here 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.820
 latch and joystick we almost 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:53.040
 jumps out so remove the frame 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:58.800
 translate lever podkovyrivaem with this 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:03.920
 the sides then hook up these 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.920
 slits from all sides 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:25.729
 all like this we remove this decorative 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:31.880
 lining take it from the sides just 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:44.780
 pushing forward so we disassemble the central 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:50.240
 the console picks up the cover of this a bangs 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:52.700
 take this thing out and then 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.640
 we pull out here is a very tricky system 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:03.700
 need to do very carefully that's important 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:06.700
 don't break this tooth from this side 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.700
 similarly 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:33.220
 here it is attached here literally 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.070
 these snaps beyond frame so remove 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.990
 ashtray frame 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:44.110
 pawl from the bottom edge here 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:47.200
 quite tight latch and plus u can 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.330
 take out for convenience we hold 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:57.690
 frame from this edge and 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:03:02.140
 also we podkovyrivaem at once we remove 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.209
 disconnect the connector so remove the block 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.310
 lighting control from his bottom here 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.870
 here are two screws 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.870
 we need to unscrew them 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:33.760
 then just pull the ready panel 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:44.980
 devices head 7 turn off the screw 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:44.980
 from this side and here 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.750
 Meester gem this one anther well, until the end 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.799
 we will not remove 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.840
 make out a lot of things so you need to click 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:19.810
 here is this side trim it just on 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:20.859
 snaps on clips sits right here at 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.830
 we had a screw 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:26.550
 the film has already been turned off 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.550
 still this one 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.180
 when the screws are unscrewed 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:35.020
 I need this side cover a little bit 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:38.560
 forward and she pull herself and then here 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:42.039
 so here move down after that we 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:45.610
 access to the screws that secures 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:48.970
 dashboard all unscrewed the two screws 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:59.280
 bottom of the dashboard then its just 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:05:01.570
 take out and disconnect the connector everything is ready 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.669
 parse the center console here to us 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:11.110
 you need the answer to light all four screws 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:14.770
 this one here deliveries turned off 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.080
 screws you need to disconnect the display we 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.900
 already cordoned off his fine absolutely these 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:26.169
 here are two snaps 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:29.350
 on the mod is essentially not needed and we disable 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:32.940
 connector and now 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.860
 all and this one here is the center console 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:39.400
 [applause] 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:46.770
 again , do not forget about the plastic because 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:46.770
 that scratching it is very easy all
