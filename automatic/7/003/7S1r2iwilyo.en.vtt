00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
training yeah I think so the quickstep

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.900 
training yeah I think so the quickstep
takes<00:04:22.470> it<00:04:22.650> to<00:04:22.770> another<00:04:22.800> level<00:04:23.220> though<00:04:23.640> the

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
takes it to another level though the

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.940 
takes it to another level though the
different<00:04:24.450> counts<00:04:25.169> and<00:04:25.350> rhythms<00:04:25.680> it's

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
different counts and rhythms it's

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.070 
different counts and rhythms it's
intense<00:04:26.370> but<00:04:26.580> I'm<00:04:26.790> hoping<00:04:27.540> you<00:04:27.690> know<00:04:27.810> being<00:04:27.990> a

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080
