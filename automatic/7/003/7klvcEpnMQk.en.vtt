00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.039
 to prepare the natural nail first 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.680
 what we are going to do is wash our hands with 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:15.210
 water and soap and then use a 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.570
 nail disinfectant 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.779
 the nail sanitizers what they do is 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:24.390
 prevent fungi from forming below 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:27.090
 our nail the next step will be 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.920
 push cuticles let's take a 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.180
 orange stick or a pusher 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.480
 cuticles and we're going to apply it on the 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.130
 45 degree cuticle area 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.170
 we will push gently 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.910
 you do not have to do it abruptly there's 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.010
 that be very careful and take care of 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:49.510
 well the cuticle of our fingers 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.430
 you just have to remove you have to 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.980
 push a little bit the dead zone that has 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.160
 stayed there so that then the nails 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:02.550
 look cleaner and we can wear the 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.550
 better and not extreme acrylic or gel 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.580
 once pushed the cuticles we are going to 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.440
 eliminate dead cells 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.050
 for that we will take the pusher of 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.050
 cuticles that on the other hand have 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.340
 this tool to eliminate the 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.730
 Loyalists who have left must do it 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.880
 also very carefully 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.920
 I do not recommend personally to use 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.160
 tiny pliers to start the 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.160
 skins 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.560
 if we are going to apply glazes what are we going 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.750
 to do is optionally apply a 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.049
 calcium layer on the natural nail for 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.179
 can nourish the and very important a 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.100
 hardener base to hardener base a 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.740
 It protects our nail from 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.229
 enamel and prevents yellow and by 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.600
 last we will apply the enamel if by the 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.880
 otherwise we will use acrylic or 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.990
 gel the procedure to follow will be 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.759
 different 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.540
 first we will remove the fat from the nail 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:08.320
 gently filing the surface 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.960
 you have to file with a very fine grain file 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.400
 fine to avoid damaging the natural nail it 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.040
 only thing to do is remove the 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.870
 natural fat that has the nail for that 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.540
 we will gently encourage and when we see 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:24.040
 that the nail is whitish we will leave it 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.750
 so do not be gross and you see a lot because 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.940
 The only thing we will achieve is to damage the 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.060
 natural nail and then the adherence of 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.010
 acrylic head will be the same as well 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.280
 have to be very careful when it comes to 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.280
 file 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.769
 the next step will be to dehydrate the 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.799
 nails we are going to take a bring of 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:50.880
 cellulose and we're going to apply it either 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:53.340
 dehydrating nail or alcohol 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.180
 in this way the nail will be ready 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.830
 to apply acrylic or gel enamels and 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.170
 you know that depending on what we go 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.030
 to apply will treat the nails of a 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.010
 way or another 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.590
 I hope the video found you helped 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:12.800
 a little bit especially to those who are 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.800
 starting and I'll see you in another video
