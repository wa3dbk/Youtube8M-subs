00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:13.969
 possible defects 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:15.949

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.679
 then he was in a hurry to create a plane on 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:18.910

 Russian air force took off 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.850
 to head for samara 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.869
 almost ten years the car stood on 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:13.490
 earth 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.030
 and the military decided to send that 154 to 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.330
 repair plant 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.600
 almost immediately after takeoff for another small 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.560
 height liner begins to execute 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.740
 figures that contradicts everyone 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.140
 laws and rules of aeronautics 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.000
 shakes him from side to side 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.539
 plane nodding 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.170
 who takes him up 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.520
 an experienced pilot of rubles whose applications 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.660
 accidents planted that 154 coastal seeing these 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.320
 frames 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.170
 immediately identified the main cause of pe 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.070
 preliminary picture such that 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.870
 failures 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.090
 in system 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.960
 Abysov lead to automatic 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.840
 onboard control system 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.310
 plane which includes 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.040
 this system is included and the so-called delphi 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.470
 yaw 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.350
 on all channels I mean by course channel 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.580
 besides even 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.460
 for a few seconds the pilot succeeds 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.120
 stabilize the car but through 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.409
 instant she falls on Krylov again 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.399
 watching the earth seems to be this 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.149
 time the plane is out of control 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.479
 cause and dance in the world supposedly 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.060
 steel contradictions between the two systems 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.349
 rudders directions chatted side in 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:16.700
 side obvious signs 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.809
 and fighters and 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:19.200
 meaning brain liner 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.700
 with an interval of 6 seconds the car tries itself 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.710
 betrays himself 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.620
 Emergency and medical situation 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.710
 nothing else remains 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.560
 except to manually compensate 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.840
 inadequate action units 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.489
 aircraft 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.459
 they are already a year in a row 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:34.669
 professionalism 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:36.499
 that is, they started catching it 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:39.139
 movements and began unison working with 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.209
 by automatic 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.840
 Products indicates that the statute of the hour is automatic 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.289
 line c 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:46.499
 in the report helps and then the reverse 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.619
 it gives the command to some 

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:50.369
 the moment when the car disappears behind 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:52.429
 trees it seems that now above the forest 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:53.720
 flame is fought 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.200
 but if we consider only 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.190
 guess 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.920
 the house is located in the holiday village 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.579
 hijackers make real feat 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.009
 exception type aircraft but all 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.959
 passengers 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.899
 giving testimony to testify 

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:08.899
 come on 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:15.609
 all the details of the incident which 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.489
 miraculously did not turn into a tragedy 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.639
 find out the military prosecutor's office 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.540
 studied technical 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.749
 state of the aircraft action of those who 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:24.409
 prepared the flight machine 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:26.010
 in the ministry of defense from any 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.710
 comments refuses 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.460
 it is possible that after checking in 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.230
 respect of officials will 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.010
 excited 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.979
