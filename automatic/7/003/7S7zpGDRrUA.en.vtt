insights you know boons tweets or

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.070 
insights you know boons tweets or
acknowledged<00:03:04.670> I<00:03:04.940> think<00:03:05.480> those<00:03:05.660> three<00:03:05.930> are

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
acknowledged I think those three are

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.440 
acknowledged I think those three are
solid<00:03:06.500> DLC<00:03:06.890> characters<00:03:07.430> which<00:03:07.790> leaves<00:03:08.090> us<00:03:08.240> a

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
solid DLC characters which leaves us a

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.690 
solid DLC characters which leaves us a
fourth<00:03:08.870> if<00:03:09.170> there<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.740> combat<00:03:10.190> pack<00:03:10.400> to<00:03:10.610> you

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
fourth if there is a combat pack to you

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.030

in<00:03:10.910> personally<00:03:11.450> in<00:03:11.600> my<00:03:11.630> opinion<00:03:12.230> I<00:03:12.410> think<00:03:12.590> if

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
in personally in my opinion I think if

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.890 
in personally in my opinion I think if
we<00:03:13.160> had<00:03:13.280> another<00:03:13.489> guest<00:03:13.670> character<00:03:14.180> I<00:03:14.480> would

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
we had another guest character I would

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.420 
we had another guest character I would
not<00:03:15.019> be<00:03:15.170> Freddy<00:03:15.410> Krueger<00:03:15.739> know<00:03:15.890> we<00:03:16.130> had<00:03:16.280> that

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
not be Freddy Krueger know we had that

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.640 
not be Freddy Krueger know we had that
will<00:03:16.550> come<00:03:16.790> at<00:03:16.970> 9<00:03:17.150> I<00:03:17.450> would<00:03:17.840> be<00:03:17.959> spawned<00:03:18.320> yeah

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
will come at 9 I would be spawned yeah

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.199 
will come at 9 I would be spawned yeah
it<00:03:18.709> would<00:03:18.800> be<00:03:18.920> spawned<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:19.550> I<00:03:19.790> think<00:03:20.000> Ed's

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
it would be spawned and I think Ed's

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.509 
it would be spawned and I think Ed's
really<00:03:20.600> trying<00:03:20.870> to<00:03:20.959> shoot<00:03:21.200> down<00:03:21.410> any<00:03:21.769> idea<00:03:22.280> or

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
really trying to shoot down any idea or

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:23.979 
really trying to shoot down any idea or
speculation<00:03:23.030> of<00:03:23.239> there<00:03:23.360> being<00:03:23.480> spawn<00:03:23.840> for

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989

speculation of there being spawn for
some<00:03:24.140> reason<00:03:24.470> even<00:03:24.860> though<00:03:25.010> I<00:03:25.070> think

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
some reason even though I think

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.620 
some reason even though I think
everything's<00:03:25.700> indicating<00:03:26.239> that<00:03:26.269> it's<00:03:26.480> gonna

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
you I believe all the web series so his

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.130 
you I believe all the web series so his
legacy<00:03:57.980> and<00:03:58.250> they<00:03:58.790> even<00:03:59.030> threw<00:03:59.209> in<00:03:59.239> spawn<00:03:59.780> so

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
legacy and they even threw in spawn so

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.690 
legacy and they even threw in spawn so
he<00:04:00.230> had<00:04:00.350> three<00:04:00.590> Mortal<00:04:00.830> Kombat<00:04:01.190> films<00:04:01.519> and

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
he had three Mortal Kombat films and

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.550 
he had three Mortal Kombat films and
then<00:04:01.790> he<00:04:01.880> had<00:04:02.000> a<00:04:02.030> spawn<00:04:02.450> tying<00:04:02.810> and<00:04:03.140> so<00:04:03.500> I'd

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
then he had a spawn tying and so I'd

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.070 
then he had a spawn tying and so I'd
like<00:04:03.590> a<00:04:03.769> blu-ray<00:04:04.280> DVD<00:04:04.880> collectible<00:04:05.630> there<00:04:05.780> so
