 maybe a good ice cream released yesterday a 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.809
 Very sure man is it's super easy to 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.080
 do with all the uncertainties of the channel 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.029
 simple and fast is very good and I 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.609
 hope you like it 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.680
 Now let's go for the ingredients, the people. 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.800
 You'll need a can of milk. 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.309
 condensed a can of sour cream 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.130
 can there be such a box so much does a 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.780
 teaspoon of margarine this review 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.790
 use in the kitchen and bonbons 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.190
 the monde to your preference as you 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.750
 I want and you think it's better 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.510
 Now we're going to the training mode. 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.360
 I'm going to start doing white brigadeiro 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.039
 Very simple, I'll get the margarine. 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.199
 put in the expected pan and have a 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.239
 and then I'll put the 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.699
 connected milk and I will tinker until 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.739
 form until it is on point it ignores the 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.219
 My panela, who's kind of old. 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.270
 but that does not change anything in the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.739
 end result 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.960
 so I'll fiddle until I get this 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.570
 consistency of brigadeiro even I go 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.790
 turn off the heat is thus a 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.970
 I'm a normal brigadier and now I'm 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.369
 Sour cream the fire is already off. 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.080
 so I'm going to introduce I'm going to touch 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.060
 Then I thought I had stayed a bit 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.250
 soft in my opinion I wanted a 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.630
 thing goes a lot more creamy 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.799
 So I switched on the fire and moved 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.119
 Same same year, not even three minutes. 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.460
 simply and there begins the consistency 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.770
 to turn it off because then it goes 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.950
 become more consistent in the freezer 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.930
 now I'll put it now I'll get the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.270
 chocolates and voting you can cut 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.360
 So you want to have no secret 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.899
 so it's just cutting is getting a few pieces 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.490
 big other small and you do around the 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.829
 which way you prefer 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.350
 Now it's time to assemble. 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.270
 ride on a platter just like that 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.460
 to look good in the video for you guys 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.380
 see better I'll ride the cup that 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.090
 she is transparent she will not be so give 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.360
 To see better, I'll put a 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.520
 a little cream is ready and 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.290
 I left it a little bit and now I 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.250
 I'll put 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.659
 The cup and then after the crime I go 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.180
 put the candies 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.489
 then it will be a layer of cream of this 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.480
 feud crime just prepare 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.590
 bonbons 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.379
 You can put it the way you do. 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.340
 want and rodelinhas in farelly pieces 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.349
 small 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.900
 I put random has no order 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.859
 and then put another layer of 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.280
 cream 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:39.799
 the then the dunga in candy 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.389
 it will put a very thick layer I 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.849
 I prefer this way 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:47.599
 If you're going to use it on the tray, it's cool. 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.609
 You have pretty good things like that and that's me. 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.980
 I'll put the sour cream the 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.510
 milk not the cream again and I will 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.760
 put the paranistas on top of 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.209
 to adorn it, this is to put 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.739
 freezer for about two hours and so 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.859
 then it will give a good consistency 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.980
 then the final result is ready 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:09.019
 We look very good, very good. 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.459
 chaotic and if you want it to stay 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.620
 less sweet, just put a little 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.099
 over the preparation of sour cream 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.280
