but I mean if you think about the sims
if<00:00:44.289> you<00:00:44.379> think<00:00:44.530> about<00:00:44.589> the<00:00:44.799> original<00:00:45.159> sims<00:00:45.429> you

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
if you think about the original sims you

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.660 
if you think about the original sims you
know<00:00:46.210> we<00:00:46.329> sold<00:00:46.510> 100<00:00:46.870> million<00:00:47.199> copies<00:00:47.859> of<00:00:48.069> the

it<00:03:22.590> apart<00:03:22.680> is<00:03:23.280> this<00:03:23.820> deep<00:03:24.120> strategy<00:03:24.750> and

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
it apart is this deep strategy and

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.340 
it apart is this deep strategy and
strategic<00:03:26.160> kind<00:03:26.670> of<00:03:26.820> play<00:03:27.570> in<00:03:27.959> terms<00:03:28.230> of
