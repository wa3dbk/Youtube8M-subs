00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.779
 dentist 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.669
 Fear of the dentist is a symptom that 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.890
 he suffers 15 percent of the 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.109
 population is known by the name of 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.059
 odontophobia and there are many who give 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.719
 excuses to delay your visit to 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:35.219
 horror specialist gives me horror 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.900
 because we always think that it's going to 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.210
 do a lot of damage then we arrived and 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.620
 nobody passes to me anything because if you go to 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.420
 dentist because you have a problem and the 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.790
 truth is going to solve the truth 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.879
 is that I have not yet had to go to 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.190
 dentist after my 67 years those of 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.710
 silly phobic fear this noise or good 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.809
 the needles also to pierce and 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.359
 tooth extraction is usually by two 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.820
 reasons one for bad legends ie 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.289
 that have been transmitted eyes that you 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.089
 We will take to the dentist that you will suffer 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.550
 or bad experiences that could have 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.350
 have once the person comes in the 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.000
 that does not have any problem 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.979
 then he loses that fear and goes 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.840
 gaining confidence to come and for 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.909
 more fearful the queries seek 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.770
 help them overcome fear thanks to the 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.200
 help from elements like this 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.130
 this connects to a device a dvd 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.870
 and there he gets into a documentary one 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.230
 movie 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.150
 whatever fits in the head and 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.640
 then wear the headphones so 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.970
 that one is therefore immersed in what is 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.220
 seeing through the glasses ideas not 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.380
 the clinics are not adapted to the 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.770
 new technologies with relaxing music 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.210
 or good aromas all help just missing 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.210
 get eliminate this noise 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.470
 what is involved is to use 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.470
 headphones so that is the 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.750
 person listening to music or whatever and 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.790
 block that high frequency that they have 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.740
 the turbines so you know the 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.340
 excuses are no longer useful because now what 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.340
 they have easier
