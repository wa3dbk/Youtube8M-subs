I'm actually cutting the recipe in half
I'm<00:02:57.410> doing<00:02:57.650> half<00:02:57.860> a<00:02:57.980> cup<00:02:58.160> of<00:02:58.280> half<00:02:58.459> and<00:02:58.640> one<00:02:58.850> cup

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770

I cannot blend it up okay so this is the

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.160 
I cannot blend it up okay so this is the
consistency<00:03:11.480> of<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:12.380> hemp<00:03:12.620> seeds<00:03:12.980> it's<00:03:14.170> as

you can see all the chunks and stuff
went<00:03:17.330> to<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.510> bottom<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.110> it's<00:03:18.350> like<00:03:18.800> I<00:03:18.920> said

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
went to the bottom and it's like I said

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.910 
went to the bottom and it's like I said
it<00:03:19.250> has<00:03:19.370> this<00:03:19.519> milky<00:03:19.970> texture<00:03:20.300> to<00:03:20.510> it<00:03:20.769> you<00:03:21.769> can

it has this milky texture to it you can

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.770 
it has this milky texture to it you can
strain<00:03:22.250> out<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.519> bottom<00:03:23.000> if<00:03:23.209> you<00:03:23.360> want<00:03:23.510> to<00:03:23.630> you

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.449 
strain out the bottom if you want to you
don't<00:03:23.870> have<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.140> but<00:03:24.650> if<00:03:24.800> you'd<00:03:24.950> like<00:03:25.190> if<00:03:25.370> you

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
don't have to but if you'd like if you

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.580

don't want that kind of chunky or gritty
taste<00:03:28.519> I<00:03:28.790> don't<00:03:28.970> think<00:03:29.239> I'll<00:03:29.360> really<00:03:29.480> notice

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
taste I don't think I'll really notice

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.390 
taste I don't think I'll really notice
it<00:03:29.959> since<00:03:30.170> I'm<00:03:30.290> putting<00:03:30.440> like<00:03:30.709> raspberries

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
it since I'm putting like raspberries

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.759 
it since I'm putting like raspberries
and<00:03:31.489> banana<00:03:31.730> in<00:03:31.850> there<00:03:31.970> but<00:03:32.269> it's<00:03:33.260> up<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.650> you

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
and banana in there but it's up to you

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.259 
and banana in there but it's up to you
whether<00:03:33.950> you<00:03:34.070> want<00:03:34.190> to<00:03:34.340> strain<00:03:34.519> it<00:03:34.550> or<00:03:34.790> not<00:03:34.970> and

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
whether you want to strain it or not and

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.360 
whether you want to strain it or not and
then<00:03:35.930> what<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.500> first<00:03:36.800> step<00:03:36.860> you<00:03:37.190> should

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
then what the first step you should

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.220 
then what the first step you should
actually<00:03:37.519> do<00:03:37.850> instead<00:03:38.180> of<00:03:38.239> grinding<00:03:38.930> those<00:03:39.019> up

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
actually do instead of grinding those up

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.470 
actually do instead of grinding those up
since<00:03:39.500> these<00:03:39.680> need<00:03:39.950> to<00:03:40.220> expand<00:03:41.000> these<00:03:41.209> are<00:03:41.360> my

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
since these need to expand these are my

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.800 
since these need to expand these are my
chia<00:03:41.780> seeds<00:03:42.050> right<00:03:42.260> here<00:03:42.290> and<00:03:42.680> I'm<00:03:42.800> using<00:03:43.810> I

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
chia seeds right here and I'm using I

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.780 
chia seeds right here and I'm using I
didn't<00:03:45.530> really<00:03:45.739> measure<00:03:45.950> these<00:03:46.190> out<00:03:46.340> exactly

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
didn't really measure these out exactly

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.729 
didn't really measure these out exactly
but<00:03:47.000> this<00:03:47.060> is<00:03:47.120> a<00:03:47.209> third<00:03:47.480> cup<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:48.050> it's<00:03:48.170> about<00:03:48.410> a

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
but this is a third cup and it's about a

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.930 
but this is a third cup and it's about a
little<00:03:50.590> more<00:03:51.590> I<00:03:51.620> guess<00:03:52.010> that<00:03:52.220> half<00:03:52.400> full<00:03:52.730> or

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
little more I guess that half full or

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.520 
little more I guess that half full or
about<00:03:53.239> half<00:03:53.450> full<00:03:53.660> and<00:03:53.959> then<00:03:54.230> I'm<00:03:54.350> going<00:03:54.470> to

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
about half full and then I'm going to

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.860 
about half full and then I'm going to
add<00:03:54.709> these<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:55.640> one<00:03:55.940> cup<00:03:56.150> of<00:03:56.180> cool<00:03:57.110> water<00:03:57.500> and

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
add these to one cup of cool water and

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.850 
add these to one cup of cool water and
then<00:03:59.870> you're<00:04:00.019> going<00:04:00.140> to<00:04:00.200> want<00:04:00.320> to<00:04:00.440> take<00:04:00.650> a

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
then you're going to want to take a

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.650 
then you're going to want to take a
spoon<00:04:03.160> mixes<00:04:04.160> in<00:04:04.370> because<00:04:04.700> these<00:04:04.880> need<00:04:05.120> time

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
spoon mixes in because these need time

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.199 
spoon mixes in because these need time
to<00:04:05.989> expand<00:04:06.530> and<00:04:06.799> to<00:04:06.890> open<00:04:07.040> up<00:04:07.340> and<00:04:07.700> that's<00:04:08.000> what

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
to expand and to open up and that's what

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.370 
to expand and to open up and that's what
will<00:04:08.390> give<00:04:08.540> them<00:04:08.720> that<00:04:09.380> tapioca<00:04:10.250> pearl<00:04:11.380> kind

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
will give them that tapioca pearl kind

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.240 
will give them that tapioca pearl kind
of<00:04:12.500> jelly<00:04:12.910> texture<00:04:14.709> just<00:04:15.709> going<00:04:15.920> to<00:04:15.980> mix<00:04:16.130> those

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
of jelly texture just going to mix those

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.659 
of jelly texture just going to mix those
up<00:04:17.140> it's<00:04:18.140> amazing<00:04:18.530> how<00:04:18.650> these<00:04:18.799> things<00:04:19.100> expand

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
up it's amazing how these things expand

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.170 
up it's amazing how these things expand
just<00:04:19.880> within<00:04:20.239> minutes

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
just within minutes

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.140 
just within minutes
so<00:04:22.180> just<00:04:22.330> going<00:04:22.420> to<00:04:22.510> put<00:04:22.660> those<00:04:22.780> in<00:04:22.960> there<00:04:24.150> make

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
so just going to put those in there make

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.760 
so just going to put those in there make
sure<00:04:25.300> you<00:04:25.420> stir<00:04:25.660> them<00:04:25.840> up<00:04:25.930> and<00:04:26.500> then<00:04:26.680> you're

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
sure you stir them up and then you're

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.690 
sure you stir them up and then you're
going<00:04:26.860> to<00:04:26.920> stick<00:04:27.070> those<00:04:27.190> in<00:04:27.340> your<00:04:27.430> fridge

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
going to stick those in your fridge

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.580 
going to stick those in your fridge
while<00:04:28.030> you're<00:04:28.210> mixing<00:04:28.570> up<00:04:28.900> your<00:04:29.110> fruit<00:04:29.380> and

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
while you're mixing up your fruit and

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.770 
while you're mixing up your fruit and
that's<00:04:30.220> going<00:04:30.550> to<00:04:30.610> help<00:04:30.700> them<00:04:30.910> to<00:04:30.970> expand<00:04:31.510> so

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
that's going to help them to expand so

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.000 
that's going to help them to expand so
while<00:04:31.960> those<00:04:32.140> are<00:04:32.350> studying<00:04:32.590> on<00:04:32.680> my<00:04:32.770> fridge

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
while those are studying on my fridge

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.180 
while those are studying on my fridge
expanding<00:04:33.580> I<00:04:33.730> am<00:04:34.210> going<00:04:34.540> to<00:04:34.840> take<00:04:35.200> my<00:04:35.530> banana

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
expanding I am going to take my banana

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.160 
expanding I am going to take my banana
and<00:04:36.430> my<00:04:36.490> raspberries<00:04:37.030> and<00:04:37.630> just<00:04:37.930> kind<00:04:38.110> of

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
and my raspberries and just kind of

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.230 
and my raspberries and just kind of
guesstimate<00:04:38.680> how<00:04:39.010> much<00:04:39.490> I'm<00:04:39.790> going<00:04:40.000> to<00:04:40.060> need

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
guesstimate how much I'm going to need

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.590 
guesstimate how much I'm going to need
and<00:04:40.510> then<00:04:40.540> um<00:04:41.850> yeah<00:04:42.850> that<00:04:43.060> I'm<00:04:43.150> going<00:04:43.270> to<00:04:43.360> blend
