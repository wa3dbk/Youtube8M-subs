as<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:14.070> can<00:00:14.309> see<00:00:14.370> I<00:00:14.790> have<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.389> more<00:00:15.750> open

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
as you can see I have a more open

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.320 
as you can see I have a more open
version<00:00:16.440> over<00:00:16.680> here<00:00:16.890> you<00:00:17.730> have<00:00:17.940> basically

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
version over here you have basically

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.660 
version over here you have basically
some<00:00:18.690> seed<00:00:19.050> chickens<00:00:19.380> at<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.650> top<00:00:19.890> because

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
some seed chickens at the top because

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.279 
some seed chickens at the top because
they<00:00:20.970> just<00:00:21.150> stay<00:00:21.390> there<00:00:21.660> they<00:00:21.810> aren't<00:00:22.080> killed

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
they just stay there they aren't killed

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.769

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
cooked or anything and then what happens

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.700 
cooked or anything and then what happens
is<00:00:25.019> their<00:00:25.289> eggs<00:00:25.560> are<00:00:25.980> are<00:00:27.320> go<00:00:28.320> through<00:00:28.560> that

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
is their eggs are are go through that

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.859 
is their eggs are are go through that
hopper<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.310> then<00:00:29.550> are<00:00:29.910> placed<00:00:30.420> into<00:00:30.660> this

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
hopper and then are placed into this

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.900 
hopper and then are placed into this
dispenser<00:00:31.289> which<00:00:31.679> when<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.130> detects<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.700> eggs

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
dispenser which when it detects the eggs

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.299 
dispenser which when it detects the eggs
shoots<00:00:33.809> them<00:00:34.050> into<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.469> main<00:00:34.710> chamber<00:00:34.950> right

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
shoots them into this main chamber right

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:35.780 
shoots them into this main chamber right
here

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
here

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.970 
here
now<00:00:36.329> you'll<00:00:37.140> see<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.469> there's<00:00:37.649> some<00:00:37.800> baby

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
now you'll see that there's some baby

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.770 
now you'll see that there's some baby
chickens<00:00:38.370> here<00:00:38.550> spawned<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.270> top<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.690> that

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
chickens here spawned on top of that

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.810 
chickens here spawned on top of that
half<00:00:39.989> slab<00:00:40.290> well<00:00:40.920> that's<00:00:41.129> what<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> dispenser

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
half slab well that's what the dispenser

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.520 
half slab well that's what the dispenser
does<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.210> spawns<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.660> baby<00:00:42.840> chickens<00:00:43.290> but

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
does it spawns the baby chickens but

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.740 
does it spawns the baby chickens but
then<00:00:43.680> there's<00:00:44.100> some<00:00:44.340> lava<00:00:44.520> above<00:00:44.910> them<00:00:45.090> but

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
then there's some lava above them but

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.479 
then there's some lava above them but
the<00:00:45.870> baby<00:00:46.020> chickens<00:00:46.440> are<00:00:46.590> short<00:00:46.860> enough<00:00:47.129> that

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
the baby chickens are short enough that

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.060 
the baby chickens are short enough that
the<00:00:47.640> lava<00:00:47.820> doesn't<00:00:48.300> harm<00:00:48.510> them<00:00:48.719> however<00:00:49.710> when

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the lava doesn't harm them however when

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.560 
the lava doesn't harm them however when
they<00:00:50.219> grow<00:00:50.399> up<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.789> turn<00:00:50.940> into<00:00:51.149> adult

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
they grow up and turn into adult

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.479 
they grow up and turn into adult
chickens<00:00:51.989> they<00:00:52.350> touch<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.829> lava<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.340> are

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
chickens they touch the lava and are

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.330 
chickens they touch the lava and are
burnt<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.030> then<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.750> dispenser<00:00:55.410> picks<00:00:56.129> up

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
burnt and then the dispenser picks up

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.479 
burnt and then the dispenser picks up
the<00:00:56.610> cooked<00:00:56.820> chicken<00:00:57.649> all<00:00:58.649> right<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.070> very

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
the cooked chicken all right so very

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.580 
the cooked chicken all right so very
simple<00:00:59.910> design<00:01:00.210> all<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.109> do<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.320> walk

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
simple design all you have to do is walk

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.319 
simple design all you have to do is walk
up<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.890> grab<00:01:02.070> your<00:01:02.219> chicken<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.940> requires

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
up and grab your chicken and it requires

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.929 
up and grab your chicken and it requires
pretty<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.470> pretty<00:01:04.860> small<00:01:05.100> amount<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.460> redstone

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
pretty a pretty small amount of redstone

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.030 
pretty a pretty small amount of redstone
and<00:01:06.049> dispensers<00:01:07.049> on<00:01:07.200> hoppers<00:01:07.560> compared<00:01:07.920> to

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
and dispensers on hoppers compared to

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.340 
and dispensers on hoppers compared to
most<00:01:08.189> other<00:01:08.400> designs<00:01:08.850> I've<00:01:09.030> seen<00:01:09.270> alright

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
most other designs I've seen alright

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.920 
most other designs I've seen alright
so<00:01:10.530> let's<00:01:10.920> make<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.250> thing<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:12.600> what<00:01:12.810> you're

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
so let's make this thing so what you're

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.870 
so let's make this thing so what you're
gonna<00:01:13.049> do<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.380> just<00:01:13.590> choose<00:01:13.860> an<00:01:14.070> open<00:01:14.430> area<00:01:14.729> and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
gonna do is just choose an open area and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.539 
gonna do is just choose an open area and
this<00:01:15.479> block<00:01:15.869> only<00:01:16.229> has<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> footprint<00:01:17.220> which<00:01:17.520> is

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
this block only has a footprint which is

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.820 
this block only has a footprint which is
the<00:01:17.880> amount<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.180> space<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.600> takes<00:01:18.630> up<00:01:19.020> from<00:01:19.799> a

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
the amount of space that takes up from a

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.620 
the amount of space that takes up from a
vertical<00:01:20.159> point<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.670> view<00:01:20.820> only<00:01:21.299> has<00:01:21.600> a

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
vertical point of view only has a

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.440 
vertical point of view only has a
footprint<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.650> believe<00:01:22.890> 13<00:01:23.460> blocks<00:01:23.759> making

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
footprint of I believe 13 blocks making

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.080 
footprint of I believe 13 blocks making
it<00:01:24.540> that's<00:01:25.259> how<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.500> measured<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.310> how<00:01:26.640> large

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
it that's how I measured that how large

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.020 
it that's how I measured that how large
it<00:01:27.270> was<00:01:27.390> compared<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.869> other<00:01:28.049> dispensers<00:01:28.650> I

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
it was compared to other dispensers I

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.270 
it was compared to other dispensers I
mean<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.210> think<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.600> may<00:01:30.689> be<00:01:30.750> 15<00:01:31.320> but<00:01:31.560> anyways

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
mean I think it may be 15 but anyways

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.010 
mean I think it may be 15 but anyways
let's<00:01:32.909> just<00:01:33.030> get<00:01:33.119> into<00:01:33.299> building<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.750> so

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
let's just get into building this so

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.200 
let's just get into building this so
what<00:01:34.229> you're<00:01:34.350> gonna<00:01:34.439> start<00:01:34.799> with<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.100> HS<00:01:35.850> and

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
what you're gonna start with this HS and

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.390 
what you're gonna start with this HS and
let<00:01:36.840> me<00:01:37.020> turn<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.350> peaceful<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.310> we

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
let me turn it to peaceful so that we

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.620 
let me turn it to peaceful so that we
don't<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.820> deal<00:01:39.000> with<00:01:39.060> these<00:01:39.299> slimes

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
don't have to deal with these slimes

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.539 
don't have to deal with these slimes
roaming<00:01:40.049> everywhere<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:41.220> you're<00:01:41.340> just<00:01:41.400> going

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
roaming everywhere so you're just going

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.450 
roaming everywhere so you're just going
to<00:01:41.700> place<00:01:41.850> your<00:01:42.030> chest<00:01:42.299> down<00:01:42.540> like<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.710> and

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
to place your chest down like so and

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.850 
to place your chest down like so and
then<00:01:45.180> go<00:01:45.360> behind<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.840> chest<00:01:46.079> crouched<00:01:46.829> down

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
then go behind the chest crouched down

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.719 
then go behind the chest crouched down
and<00:01:47.420> place<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.630> hopper<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.890> it's<00:01:50.100> facing<00:01:50.340> into

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
and place a hopper so it's facing into

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.139 
and place a hopper so it's facing into
the<00:01:50.820> chest<00:01:51.090> now<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.200> top<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.430> then

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
the chest now on top of this and then

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.310 
the chest now on top of this and then
you're<00:01:54.270> going<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.450> need<00:01:54.540> some<00:01:54.689> half<00:01:54.840> slabs<00:01:55.140> as

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
you're going to need some half slabs as

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.530 
you're going to need some half slabs as
well<00:01:55.470> on<00:01:56.130> top<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.640> hopper<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.240> where<00:01:57.420> the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
well on top of this hopper is where the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.749 
well on top of this hopper is where the
chicken<00:01:57.840> will<00:01:57.990> be<00:01:58.020> cooked<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:59.340> once<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.579> have

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
chicken will be cooked so once you have

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.340 
chicken will be cooked so once you have
that<00:01:59.909> hopper<00:02:00.270> placed<00:02:00.540> you're<00:02:00.990> going<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.200> want

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
that hopper placed you're going to want

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.590 
that hopper placed you're going to want
to<00:02:01.439> place<00:02:01.649> solid<00:02:02.100> blocks<00:02:02.549> around<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.299> as<00:02:03.390> much

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
to place solid blocks around it as much

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.410 
to place solid blocks around it as much
as<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:04.100> except<00:02:05.100> on<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.759> side<00:02:06.060> because

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
as you can except on this side because

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.789 
as you can except on this side because
that<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.689> where<00:02:06.899> we<00:02:06.930> are<00:02:07.110> going<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.439> place<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
that is where we are going to place the

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.639 
that is where we are going to place the

blocks even though over here I have some

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.790 
blocks even though over here I have some
glasses<00:02:13.349> because

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
glasses because

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.010 
glasses because
sometimes<00:02:14.460> when<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.790> chicken<00:02:15.180> grows<00:02:15.540> up<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.870> it

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
sometimes when a chicken grows up and it

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.780 
sometimes when a chicken grows up and it
gets<00:02:16.170> cooked<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.740> can<00:02:16.890> actually<00:02:17.250> jump<00:02:17.430> through

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
gets cooked it can actually jump through

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.720 
gets cooked it can actually jump through
the<00:02:17.940> glass<00:02:18.210> but<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.110> haven't<00:02:19.680> seen<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.010> chicken

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
the glass but I haven't seen a chicken

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.280 
the glass but I haven't seen a chicken
when<00:02:21.210> it<00:02:21.330> gets<00:02:21.480> cooked<00:02:21.720> jumped<00:02:22.080> through<00:02:22.260> a

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
when it gets cooked jumped through a

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.920 
when it gets cooked jumped through a
solid<00:02:22.890> block<00:02:23.100> so<00:02:23.430> if<00:02:23.820> you<00:02:23.970> solid<00:02:24.450> blocks<00:02:24.720> like

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
solid block so if you solid blocks like

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.200 
solid block so if you solid blocks like
so<00:02:25.170> you're<00:02:25.500> essentially<00:02:25.980> guaranteed<00:02:26.550> not<00:02:27.150> to

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
so you're essentially guaranteed not to

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.640 
so you're essentially guaranteed not to
have<00:02:27.480> your<00:02:27.630> chicken<00:02:27.810> jumping<00:02:28.260> all<00:02:28.380> over<00:02:28.410> the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
have your chicken jumping all over the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.190 
have your chicken jumping all over the
place<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:30.330> then<00:02:30.570> of<00:02:30.690> course<00:02:30.750> you're<00:02:31.110> still

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
place and then of course you're still

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.290 
place and then of course you're still
going<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.560> need<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:32.070> glass<00:02:32.400> block<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:33.060> place

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
going to need a glass block to place

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.770 
going to need a glass block to place
above<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.460> or<00:02:35.460> are<00:02:35.670> just<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.970> non<00:02:36.150> opaque<00:02:36.300> block

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
above the or are just a non opaque block

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.830 
above the or are just a non opaque block
to<00:02:37.020> place<00:02:37.260> above<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:38.330> chassis<00:02:39.330> rile<00:02:39.630> so<00:02:39.750> it

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
to place above the chassis rile so it

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.310 
to place above the chassis rile so it
won't<00:02:39.990> open<00:02:40.220> like<00:02:41.220> so<00:02:41.840> all<00:02:42.840> right<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.110> then

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
won't open like so all right and then

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.040 
won't open like so all right and then
just<00:02:43.590> place<00:02:43.830> blocks<00:02:44.190> like<00:02:44.580> this<00:02:44.880> so<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:45.660> you

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
just place blocks like this so that you

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.330 
just place blocks like this so that you
can<00:02:46.230> dump<00:02:46.740> some<00:02:46.950> lava<00:02:47.160> in<00:02:47.460> there<00:02:48.980> see<00:02:49.980> we<00:02:50.190> can

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
can dump some lava in there see we can

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.110 
can dump some lava in there see we can
place<00:02:50.550> some<00:02:50.580> lava<00:02:51.150> like<00:02:51.570> so<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:52.730> there<00:02:53.730> we<00:02:53.910> go

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
place some lava like so and there we go

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.530 
place some lava like so and there we go
so<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.230> cooker<00:02:55.650> portion<00:02:56.190> now<00:02:57.060> the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
so that is the cooker portion now the

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.260 
so that is the cooker portion now the
next<00:02:57.810> thing<00:02:57.930> we're<00:02:58.080> going<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.230> set<00:02:58.500> up<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.860> the

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
next thing we're going to set up is the

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.700 
next thing we're going to set up is the
is<00:03:00.620> our<00:03:02.120> clock<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.390> turns<00:03:03.690> on<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.170> dispenses

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
is our clock that turns on and dispenses

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.890 
is our clock that turns on and dispenses
the<00:03:04.830> eggs<00:03:05.070> whenever<00:03:05.820> they're<00:03:06.090> placed<00:03:06.390> into

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
the eggs whenever they're placed into

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.710 
the eggs whenever they're placed into
the<00:03:07.020> hub<00:03:07.290> into<00:03:07.740> our<00:03:08.010> dispenser<00:03:08.520> here<00:03:08.670> so<00:03:08.910> place

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
the hub into our dispenser here so place

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.900 
the hub into our dispenser here so place
a<00:03:09.750> comparator<00:03:10.230> so<00:03:10.770> that<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.070> two<00:03:11.280> little<00:03:11.550> the

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
a comparator so that the two little the

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.590 
a comparator so that the two little the
double<00:03:12.240> prongs<00:03:12.540> are<00:03:12.900> facing<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:14.600> dispenser

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
double prongs are facing the dispenser

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.930 
double prongs are facing the dispenser
and<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.810> solo<00:03:16.800> prong<00:03:17.100> is<00:03:17.250> facing<00:03:17.580> outwards

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
and the solo prong is facing outwards

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.930 
and the solo prong is facing outwards
then<00:03:18.600> you're<00:03:18.720> going<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:18.930> place<00:03:19.110> a<00:03:19.320> repeater

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
then you're going to place a repeater

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.570 
then you're going to place a repeater
out<00:03:20.940> past<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.630> then<00:03:22.320> just<00:03:22.500> kind<00:03:22.739> of<00:03:22.890> place

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
out past it and then just kind of place

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.890 
out past it and then just kind of place
down<00:03:23.790> some<00:03:24.000> redstone<00:03:24.180> on<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.510> other<00:03:24.660> side<00:03:24.840> of

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
down some redstone on the other side of

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.110 
down some redstone on the other side of
the<00:03:24.989> repeater<00:03:25.320> and<00:03:25.430> you<00:03:26.430> have<00:03:26.550> to<00:03:26.700> make<00:03:26.850> sure

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
the repeater and you have to make sure

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.790 
the repeater and you have to make sure
that<00:03:27.360> this<00:03:27.510> redstone<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:28.290> comes<00:03:28.470> out<00:03:28.620> of<00:03:28.680> the

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
that this redstone that comes out of the

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.900 
that this redstone that comes out of the
repeater<00:03:29.130> links<00:03:29.910> back<00:03:30.120> into<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.760> into<00:03:32.760> our

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
repeater links back into the into our

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.390 
repeater links back into the into our
comparator<00:03:33.570> like<00:03:33.750> so<00:03:34.020> and<00:03:34.320> then<00:03:35.160> what<00:03:35.310> you're

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
comparator like so and then what you're

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.250 
comparator like so and then what you're
going<00:03:35.489> to<00:03:35.550> do<00:03:35.760> is<00:03:35.880> just<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.360> bring<00:03:37.050> the

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
going to do is just to bring the

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.470 
going to do is just to bring the
redstone<00:03:37.680> right<00:03:37.950> there<00:03:38.280> so<00:03:38.670> that<00:03:38.700> it<00:03:39.060> powers

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
redstone right there so that it powers

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
what you're going to do is break the

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.390 
what you're going to do is break the
block<00:04:08.730> that's<00:04:08.910> on<00:04:09.120> top<00:04:09.360> of<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.660> dispenser<00:04:10.170> and

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
block that's on top of the dispenser and

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.440 
block that's on top of the dispenser and
let<00:04:11.400> me<00:04:11.459> get<00:04:11.580> this<00:04:11.700> guy<00:04:11.880> out<00:04:12.000> of<00:04:12.030> here<00:04:12.120> so<00:04:12.390> he

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
let me get this guy out of here so he

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.330 
let me get this guy out of here so he
doesn't<00:04:12.750> screw<00:04:12.900> this<00:04:13.050> up<00:04:13.230> because<00:04:13.950> if<00:04:14.310> you

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
doesn't screw this up because if you

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.009 
doesn't screw this up because if you
mess<00:04:14.850> up<00:04:14.880> this<00:04:15.180> part<00:04:15.420> law<00:04:15.570> of<00:04:15.630> a<00:04:15.720> compiler

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
mess up this part law of a compiler

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.449 
mess up this part law of a compiler
everywhere<00:04:16.440> so<00:04:16.620> destroy<00:04:16.919> that<00:04:17.160> and<00:04:17.340> before

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
everywhere so destroy that and before

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.130 
everywhere so destroy that and before
the<00:04:17.730> lava<00:04:17.850> can<00:04:18.120> pour<00:04:18.330> out<00:04:18.480> or<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:18.810> chickens

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
the lava can pour out or the chickens

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.610 
the lava can pour out or the chickens
can<00:04:19.320> jump<00:04:19.530> just<00:04:20.100> place<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.280> hopper<00:04:20.700> right<00:04:20.730> there

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
can jump just place a hopper right there

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.540 
can jump just place a hopper right there
next<00:04:22.620> what<00:04:22.800> you're<00:04:22.919> going<00:04:23.039> to<00:04:23.070> do<00:04:23.190> is<00:04:23.310> place<00:04:23.520> a

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
next what you're going to do is place a

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.279 
next what you're going to do is place a
half<00:04:23.789> slab<00:04:24.030> on<00:04:24.240> top<00:04:24.450> of<00:04:24.630> it<00:04:24.750> like<00:04:24.930> we<00:04:25.080> did<00:04:25.229> for

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
half slab on top of it like we did for

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.440 
half slab on top of it like we did for
the<00:04:25.560> cooker<00:04:25.830> area<00:04:26.160> and<00:04:26.400> place<00:04:27.180> some

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
the cooker area and place some

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.440 
the cooker area and place some
walks<00:04:27.630> around<00:04:27.930> it<00:04:28.140> again<00:04:30.350> alright<00:04:31.350> and<00:04:31.800> then

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
walks around it again alright and then

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.000 
walks around it again alright and then
I'm<00:04:33.450> gonna<00:04:33.630> go<00:04:33.780> three<00:04:34.170> blocks<00:04:34.410> high<00:04:34.590> but<00:04:34.890> the

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
I'm gonna go three blocks high but the

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.350 
I'm gonna go three blocks high but the
final<00:04:35.370> is<00:04:35.490> just<00:04:35.700> going<00:04:35.820> to<00:04:35.880> be<00:04:35.970> two<00:04:36.150> blocks

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
final is just going to be two blocks

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.510 
final is just going to be two blocks
because<00:04:36.840> when<00:04:37.140> it's<00:04:37.350> only<00:04:37.470> a<00:04:37.650> two<00:04:38.040> block<00:04:38.250> side

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
because when it's only a two block side

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.830 
because when it's only a two block side
the<00:04:38.670> chickens<00:04:38.970> will<00:04:39.090> actually<00:04:39.390> try<00:04:39.540> to<00:04:39.570> jump

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
the chickens will actually try to jump

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.900 
the chickens will actually try to jump
out<00:04:39.990> so<00:04:40.890> you<00:04:40.980> can<00:04:41.190> place<00:04:41.370> however<00:04:41.550> many

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
out so you can place however many

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.900 
out so you can place however many
chickens<00:04:42.330> you<00:04:42.480> want<00:04:42.780> in<00:04:42.960> here<00:04:43.230> and<00:04:43.490> I<00:04:44.490> believe

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
chickens you want in here and I believe

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.100 
chickens you want in here and I believe
let<00:04:45.510> me<00:04:45.630> think

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
let me think

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.680 
let me think
well<00:04:47.040> I'll<00:04:47.490> go<00:04:47.670> over<00:04:47.730> this<00:04:47.940> with<00:04:48.120> you<00:04:48.180> guys<00:04:48.480> a

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
well I'll go over this with you guys a

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.690 
well I'll go over this with you guys a
chicken<00:04:48.930> lays<00:04:49.200> an<00:04:49.380> egg<00:04:49.410> about<00:04:49.800> every<00:04:50.370> seven

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
chicken lays an egg about every seven

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.420 
chicken lays an egg about every seven
and<00:04:50.850> a<00:04:50.910> half<00:04:50.940> minutes<00:04:51.510> each<00:04:52.440> egg<00:04:52.830> has<00:04:52.860> on

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
and a half minutes each egg has on

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.670 
and a half minutes each egg has on
average<00:04:54.090> a<00:04:54.450> one<00:04:54.600> in<00:04:54.750> four<00:04:54.960> chance<00:04:55.170> of<00:04:55.410> spawning

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
average a one in four chance of spawning

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.070 
average a one in four chance of spawning
a<00:04:55.890> chicken<00:04:56.220> it's<00:04:56.910> actually<00:04:57.300> one<00:04:57.510> in<00:04:57.630> eight<00:04:57.840> but

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
a chicken it's actually one in eight but

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.960 
a chicken it's actually one in eight but
then<00:04:58.200> there's<00:04:58.380> also<00:04:58.530> a<00:04:58.680> one<00:04:58.950> in<00:04:59.100> 64<00:04:59.490> chance

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
then there's also a one in 64 chance

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.270 
then there's also a one in 64 chance
that<00:05:00.240> it<00:05:00.330> will<00:05:00.450> spawn<00:05:00.810> four<00:05:01.560> chicken<00:05:01.920> so

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
that it will spawn four chicken so

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.930 
that it will spawn four chicken so
complex<00:05:02.940> there<00:05:03.210> but<00:05:04.070> all<00:05:05.070> that<00:05:05.400> means<00:05:05.670> is<00:05:05.880> that

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
complex there but all that means is that

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.290 
complex there but all that means is that
for<00:05:06.270> each<00:05:06.420> chicken<00:05:06.840> we<00:05:06.930> have<00:05:07.110> up<00:05:07.350> here<00:05:07.770> it<00:05:08.670> we

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
for each chicken we have up here it we

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.140 
for each chicken we have up here it we
will<00:05:09.450> get<00:05:09.600> one<00:05:09.960> cooked<00:05:10.290> meat<00:05:10.880> every<00:05:11.880> 30

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
will get one cooked meat every 30

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.320 
will get one cooked meat every 30
minutes<00:05:12.620> ok<00:05:13.620> so<00:05:13.680> just<00:05:13.860> see<00:05:14.760> how<00:05:14.880> many<00:05:14.940> chickens

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
minutes ok so just see how many chickens

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.830 
minutes ok so just see how many chickens
we<00:05:15.480> have<00:05:15.630> in<00:05:15.780> here<00:05:16.020> let<00:05:16.230> me<00:05:16.290> just<00:05:16.350> hit<00:05:16.500> F<00:05:17.840> 323

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
we have in here let me just hit F 323

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.050 
we have in here let me just hit F 323
chickens<00:05:19.200> so<00:05:19.560> that<00:05:19.680> means<00:05:19.920> we<00:05:20.310> will<00:05:20.400> get<00:05:20.520> 23

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
chickens so that means we will get 23

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.670 
chickens so that means we will get 23
