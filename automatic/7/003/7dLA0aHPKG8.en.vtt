like<00:01:03.869> I<00:01:03.989> did<00:01:04.170> before<00:01:04.580> but<00:01:05.580> right<00:01:05.970> now<00:01:06.150> for<00:01:06.659> a

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
like I did before but right now for a

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.960 
like I did before but right now for a
real<00:01:06.930> estate<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.560> my<00:01:08.010> desktop<00:01:08.490> I'm<00:01:08.790> going<00:01:08.909> to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
real estate of my desktop I'm going to

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.970 
real estate of my desktop I'm going to
leave<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.240> where<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.380> very<00:01:10.650> first

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:10.980 
leave it where it is the very first

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.630 
leave it where it is the very first
thing<00:01:11.220> I'm<00:01:11.370> going<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.670> do<00:01:11.940> is<00:01:12.240> go<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.810> file

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
thing I'm going to do is go to file

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.450 
thing I'm going to do is go to file
clone<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.570> reason<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.110> use<00:01:16.170> file<00:01:16.800> clone

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
clone and the reason I use file clone

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.690 
clone and the reason I use file clone
rather<00:01:18.090> than<00:01:18.390> quick<00:01:18.720> clone<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.410> because<00:01:20.220> I'm

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
rather than quick clone is because I'm

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.240 
rather than quick clone is because I'm
going<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.120> use<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.660> whole<00:01:21.870> image<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.860> want

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
going to use the whole image but I want

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.000 
going to use the whole image but I want
to<00:01:23.490> be<00:01:23.640> able<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.030> see<00:01:24.510> both<00:01:25.200> images<00:01:25.530> rather

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
to be able to see both images rather

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.710 
to be able to see both images rather
than<00:01:26.340> have<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.640> underneath<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.300> tracing

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
than have it underneath the tracing

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.760 
than have it underneath the tracing

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
because that'll move the pixels around

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.660

and I'm not going to dwell a long time
on<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.209> background<00:02:38.690> but<00:02:39.319> let's<00:02:39.560> move<00:02:39.860> on<00:02:39.920> the

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.199 
on the background but let's move on the
flower<00:02:41.269> itself<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.290> see<00:02:42.860> how<00:02:43.069> easily<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:44.000> how

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
flower itself and see how easily and how

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.330 
flower itself and see how easily and how
nicely<00:02:44.599> we<00:02:45.080> can<00:02:45.739> turn<00:02:46.010> this<00:02:46.250> into<00:02:46.580> a<00:02:46.849> painting

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
nicely we can turn this into a painting

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
brush strokes very quickly and I'm

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.920 
brush strokes very quickly and I'm
pushing<00:03:21.680> out<00:03:22.160> where<00:03:22.670> it's<00:03:22.819> where<00:03:23.299> it<00:03:23.450> becomes

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
pushing out where it's where it becomes

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.520 
pushing out where it's where it becomes
dark<00:03:24.290> I'm<00:03:24.560> pushing<00:03:25.370> out<00:03:25.609> with<00:03:26.000> my<00:03:26.359> brush<00:03:26.660> but<00:03:27.500> I

dark I'm pushing out with my brush but I
know<00:03:27.680> I<00:03:27.799> can't<00:03:28.190> get<00:03:28.400> in<00:03:28.519> too<00:03:28.760> much<00:03:28.940> trouble

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
know I can't get in too much trouble

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.080 
know I can't get in too much trouble
because<00:03:29.690> it's<00:03:29.870> going<00:03:30.139> to<00:03:30.319> use<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:31.489> color<00:03:31.760> that

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
because it's going to use the color that

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.750 
because it's going to use the color that
is<00:03:32.269> in<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:32.630> original<00:03:32.870> image<00:03:33.380> and<00:03:33.889> with<00:03:34.370> just<00:03:34.639> a

few<00:03:35.090> strokes<00:03:35.510> I<00:03:36.130> can<00:03:37.359> make<00:03:38.359> a<00:03:38.630> painting<00:03:39.250> very

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
few strokes I can make a painting very

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.640 
few strokes I can make a painting very
quickly<00:03:40.639> very<00:03:40.819> easily<00:03:41.359> I<00:03:41.599> want<00:03:41.930> to<00:03:42.019> keep<00:03:42.260> the

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
smaller now see make it smaller so that

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.960 
smaller now see make it smaller so that
I<00:03:50.870> can<00:03:51.079> do<00:03:51.230> these<00:03:51.470> edges<00:03:52.160> and<00:03:52.190> keep<00:03:52.639> those

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
I can do these edges and keep those

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.440

edges of those of those petals as much

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.080 
edges of those of those petals as much
or<00:03:56.780> as<00:03:56.840> little<00:03:57.260> as<00:03:57.799> I<00:03:58.310> desire<00:03:58.609> to<00:03:59.150> keep<00:03:59.359> them<00:03:59.660> I

or as little as I desire to keep them I
can<00:04:02.090> go<00:04:02.359> over<00:04:02.389> the<00:04:02.750> whole<00:04:02.930> thing<00:04:02.959> with<00:04:03.260> a<00:04:03.410> big

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
can go over the whole thing with a big

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.190 
can go over the whole thing with a big
brush<00:04:03.919> if<00:04:04.130> I<00:04:04.280> wanted<00:04:04.549> to<00:04:04.639> and<00:04:05.090> make<00:04:05.900> it<00:04:05.930> very

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
brush if I wanted to and make it very

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.710 
brush if I wanted to and make it very
very<00:04:06.319> photographic<00:04:07.220> again<00:04:07.519> but<00:04:07.760> for<00:04:08.510> this

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
very photographic again but for this

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.479 
very photographic again but for this
that<00:04:09.139> would<00:04:09.290> defeat<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.680> purpose<00:04:09.859> wouldn't

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
that would defeat the purpose wouldn't

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.589 
that would defeat the purpose wouldn't
it<00:04:10.700> so<00:04:11.630> I'm<00:04:11.780> going<00:04:12.079> to<00:04:12.230> just<00:04:12.440> quickly<00:04:12.799> paint

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
it so I'm going to just quickly paint

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.420 
it so I'm going to just quickly paint
until<00:04:14.599> I<00:04:14.660> have<00:04:14.989> a<00:04:15.019> pretty<00:04:15.470> little<00:04:15.650> painting<00:04:16.220> of

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
until I have a pretty little painting of
