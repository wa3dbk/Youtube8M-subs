so<00:00:32.419> one<00:00:32.899> of<00:00:33.020> the<00:00:33.219> hardest<00:00:34.219> sequences<00:00:34.969> in<00:00:35.090> this

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
so one of the hardest sequences in this

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.850

hammer 32

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.440 
hammer 32
but<00:00:57.280> i'm<00:00:57.670> going<00:00:57.850> to<00:00:57.910> show<00:00:58.090> you<00:00:58.120> the<00:00:58.300> way<00:00:58.420> that

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
but i'm going to show you the way that

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.870 
but i'm going to show you the way that
I've<00:00:58.780> gotten<00:00:59.200> through<00:00:59.350> this<00:00:59.440> part<00:00:59.740> it<00:01:00.580> may<00:01:00.760> not

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
I've gotten through this part it may not

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.030 
I've gotten through this part it may not
be<00:01:00.940> the<00:01:01.060> best<00:01:01.330> but<00:01:01.450> it<00:01:01.690> will<00:01:01.780> work<00:01:01.960> a<00:01:02.110> promise

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.070 

so<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.910> is<00:01:06.030> another<00:01:06.210> place<00:01:06.510> where<00:01:06.540> if<00:01:06.960> you

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
so this is another place where if you

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.630 
so this is another place where if you
die<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.350> will<00:01:07.470> reset<00:01:07.830> everyone<00:01:08.250> because<00:01:08.610> it's

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
die it will reset everyone because it's

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.490 
die it will reset everyone because it's
hard<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.390> sneak<00:01:09.450> past<00:01:09.780> them<00:01:09.990> all<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.260> get<00:01:10.350> into

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
hard to sneak past them all and get into

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
hard to sneak past them all and get into
position<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.880> feel<00:01:12.150> free<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.390> die<00:01:13.310> so<00:01:14.310> we<00:01:14.370> want

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
position so feel free to die so we want

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.030 
position so feel free to die so we want
to<00:01:14.610> do<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.910> come<00:01:15.660> back<00:01:15.810> here<00:01:16.080> now<00:01:16.290> if<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.590> have

the<00:01:17.910> rocket<00:01:18.240> launcher<00:01:18.270> already<00:01:18.690> don't<00:01:18.960> pick

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the rocket launcher already don't pick

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.290 
the rocket launcher already don't pick
up<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.740> ones<00:01:20.010> that<00:01:20.160> are<00:01:20.250> lying<00:01:20.490> down<00:01:20.790> until

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.440 

so<00:03:47.709> on<00:03:47.950> an<00:03:48.069> easier<00:03:48.340> difficulty<00:03:48.910> you<00:03:49.270> could

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
so on an easier difficulty you could

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.550 
so on an easier difficulty you could
just<00:03:49.480> come<00:03:49.750> down<00:03:49.930> here<00:03:50.080> with<00:03:50.290> a<00:03:50.319> rocket

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.750 
launcher and then pick up there gal
nineteen's<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:54.010> use<00:03:54.130> them<00:03:54.310> against<00:03:54.670> each

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760
