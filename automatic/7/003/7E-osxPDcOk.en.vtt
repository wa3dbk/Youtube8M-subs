00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
we have the number four piston and then

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.870 
we have the number four piston and then
we<00:00:32.399> have<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:33.120> number<00:00:33.390> two<00:00:33.600> piston<00:00:34.430> the<00:00:35.430> firing

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
we have the number two piston the firing

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.580 
we have the number two piston the firing
order<00:00:36.000> on<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> vh4<00:00:36.780> D<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.620> one<00:00:38.010> three<00:00:38.700> four<00:00:39.390> two

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.180 

to<00:00:43.590> explain<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:45.140> well<00:00:46.140> what<00:00:46.530> we'll<00:00:46.739> do<00:00:46.920> we'll

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
to explain it well what we'll do we'll

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.299 
to explain it well what we'll do we'll
start<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:48.140> piston<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:50.180> its<00:00:51.180> intake<00:00:51.600> stroke<00:00:52.309> so

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
start the piston on its intake stroke so

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.610 
start the piston on its intake stroke so
as<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.820> can<00:00:53.969> see<00:00:54.030> right<00:00:54.570> now<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:55.289> number<00:00:55.590> one

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
as you can see right now the number one

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.170 
as you can see right now the number one
piston<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.460> at<00:00:56.610> top<00:00:57.090> dead<00:00:57.360> center<00:00:57.870> as<00:00:58.940> it<00:00:59.940> moves

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
piston is at top dead center as it moves

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.179 
piston is at top dead center as it moves
downward<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:01.739> intake<00:01:02.250> valve<00:01:02.550> opens<00:01:03.359> as<00:01:04.189> it

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
downward the intake valve opens as it

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.330 
downward the intake valve opens as it
opens<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:06.689> draws<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.439> fuel<00:01:07.680> air<00:01:07.740> mixture

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
opens it draws in the fuel air mixture

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.140 
opens it draws in the fuel air mixture
into<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.760> intake<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:10.580> into<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.760> combustion

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
into the intake and into the combustion

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.719 
into the intake and into the combustion
chamber<00:01:12.360> as<00:01:14.000> it<00:01:15.000> continues<00:01:15.540> around<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
chamber as it continues around the

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.390 
chamber as it continues around the
intake<00:01:17.729> valve<00:01:18.000> closes<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.439> fuel<00:01:19.740> air<00:01:19.770> mixture

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
intake valve closes the fuel air mixture

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.520 
intake valve closes the fuel air mixture
that<00:01:20.640> has<00:01:20.880> accumulated<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.960> cylinder

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
that has accumulated in the cylinder

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.510 
that has accumulated in the cylinder
then<00:01:23.600> is<00:01:24.600> compressed<00:01:25.290> by<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.710> upward<00:01:26.310> motion

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
then is compressed by the upward motion

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.060 
then is compressed by the upward motion
of<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:26.970> piston<00:01:27.540> as<00:01:29.420> it<00:01:30.420> comes<00:01:31.079> top<00:01:31.770> dead

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
of the piston as it comes top dead

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.469 
of the piston as it comes top dead
center<00:01:32.549> 23<00:01:33.210> degrees<00:01:33.600> before<00:01:33.810> top<00:01:34.290> dead<00:01:34.350> center

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.760 
the ignition ignites the fuel air
mixture<00:01:40.700> which<00:01:41.700> an<00:01:42.409> explosion<00:01:43.409> takes<00:01:43.680> place

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
mixture which an explosion takes place

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.120 
mixture which an explosion takes place
inside<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.700> ik<00:01:44.790> solder<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:46.470> pushes<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
inside the ik solder and it pushes the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.210 
inside the ik solder and it pushes the
piston<00:01:47.369> back<00:01:47.759> down<00:01:47.820> as<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:49.409> pushes<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:50.009> piston

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220
