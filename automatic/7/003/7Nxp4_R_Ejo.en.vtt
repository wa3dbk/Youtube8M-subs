destroyed now the history of Ragnarok
and<00:01:01.170> it's<00:01:01.500> occurrences<00:01:02.100> are<00:01:02.399> very<00:01:02.670> muddy<00:01:02.969> at

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
and it's occurrences are very muddy at

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.729 
and it's occurrences are very muddy at
this<00:01:03.329> point<00:01:03.570> seeing<00:01:03.899> as<00:01:03.989> people<00:01:04.019> have<00:01:04.379> created

this point seeing as people have created

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.679 
this point seeing as people have created
false<00:01:04.920> ragnaroks<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.729> scare<00:01:06.000> one<00:01:06.150> another<00:01:06.420> and

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
false ragnaroks to scare one another and

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.820 
false ragnaroks to scare one another and
it's<00:01:06.810> inherently<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.320> cycle<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.770> repeats

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
it's inherently a cycle that repeats

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.500 
it's inherently a cycle that repeats
itself<00:01:08.130> we<00:01:08.610> also<00:01:08.729> just<00:01:08.939> plain<00:01:09.180> don't<00:01:09.390> know

everything<00:01:09.990> about<00:01:10.110> Asgard's<00:01:10.650> history<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.369> we

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
everything about Asgard's history so we

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.730 
everything about Asgard's history so we
can<00:01:11.880> never<00:01:12.090> be<00:01:12.299> 100%<00:01:12.689> sure<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.080> how<00:01:13.260> many<00:01:13.530> times

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740
