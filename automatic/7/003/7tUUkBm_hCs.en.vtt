drumsticks in the world but you already
know<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.189> all<00:00:29.519> right<00:00:29.699> let's<00:00:29.760> get<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.210> work

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
know that all right let's get to work

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.030 
know that all right let's get to work
everybody<00:00:30.660> today<00:00:31.470> we're<00:00:31.619> working<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:31.980> a

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
everybody today we're working on a

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.520 
everybody today we're working on a
really<00:00:32.610> really<00:00:32.880> cool<00:00:33.090> lick<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.989> me<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.290> kind<00:00:34.500> of

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
really really cool lick to me it kind of

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.139 
really really cool lick to me it kind of
has<00:00:34.680> like<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.890> Vinnie<00:00:35.219> Colaiuta<00:00:35.399> type<00:00:35.910> feel

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
has like a Vinnie Colaiuta type feel

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.150 
has like a Vinnie Colaiuta type feel
that's<00:00:36.329> never<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.660> bad<00:00:36.899> thing<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.860> it's<00:00:38.040> going

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
that's never a bad thing and it's going

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.280 
that's never a bad thing and it's going
to<00:00:38.219> really<00:00:38.340> stress<00:00:38.820> dynamics<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.719> groupings

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
to really stress dynamics and groupings

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.990 
to really stress dynamics and groupings
so<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.800> grouping<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.309> we've<00:00:41.430> got<00:00:41.610> going<00:00:41.760> on

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
so the grouping that we've got going on

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.569 
so the grouping that we've got going on
is<00:00:42.180> six<00:00:42.870> notes<00:00:43.200> long<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.860> dynamics<00:00:44.370> are<00:00:44.460> going

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
is six notes long the dynamics are going

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.770 
is six notes long the dynamics are going
to<00:00:44.670> come<00:00:44.789> into<00:00:44.910> play<00:00:45.090> once<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.390> explain<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
to come into play once I explain the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.020 
to come into play once I explain the
grouping<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.440> grouping<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.070> right

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
grouping so the grouping is this right

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.310 
grouping so the grouping is this right
left<00:00:48.840> right<00:00:49.140> left<00:00:49.940> left<00:00:50.940> kick<00:00:51.750> okay<00:00:52.110> that's

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
left right left left kick okay that's

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.680 
left right left left kick okay that's
the<00:00:52.500> repeated<00:00:53.160> six<00:00:53.730> no<00:00:53.969> grouping<00:00:54.420> we're<00:00:54.570> going

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
the repeated six no grouping we're going

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.450 
the repeated six no grouping we're going
to<00:00:54.750> repeat<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.050> over<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.469> over<00:00:55.590> again<00:00:55.770> but

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
to repeat that over and over again but

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.099 
to repeat that over and over again but
here's<00:00:56.699> where<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> dynamics<00:00:57.480> come<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
here's where the dynamics come in the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.470 
here's where the dynamics come in the
first<00:00:58.440> three<00:00:58.710> hits<00:00:58.920> right<00:00:59.460> left<00:00:59.940> right<00:01:00.180> you're

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
first three hits right left right you're

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.180 
first three hits right left right you're
going<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.660> nail<00:01:00.989> those<00:01:01.199> beat<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.590> crap<00:01:01.920> out<00:01:02.160> of

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
going to nail those beat the crap out of

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.880 
going to nail those beat the crap out of
it<00:01:02.309> then<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.270> next<00:01:03.510> two<00:01:03.780> hits<00:01:04.049> ghost<00:01:04.650> note

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
it then the next two hits ghost note

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.649 
it then the next two hits ghost note
bring<00:01:05.189> your<00:01:05.309> left<00:01:05.489> hand<00:01:05.640> way<00:01:06.119> down<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.570> you've

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
bring your left hand way down so you've

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.160 
bring your left hand way down so you've
got<00:01:06.810> got<00:01:07.200> got<00:01:08.240> boom<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.540> then<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.720> nail<00:01:09.990> that

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
got got got boom and then you nail that

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.840 
got got got boom and then you nail that
bass<00:01:10.380> drum<00:01:10.590> right<00:01:10.770> repeat<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.280> over<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.760> over

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
bass drum right repeat it over and over

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:42.730 
bass drum right repeat it over and over
again<00:01:12.000> let's<00:01:12.240> try<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.479> really<00:01:12.780> slow

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.900 

all<00:01:43.740> righty<00:01:43.890> guys<00:01:43.980> now<00:01:44.160> that<00:01:44.190> is<00:01:44.550> the<00:01:44.730> lick

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
all righty guys now that is the lick

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.250 
all righty guys now that is the lick
that's<00:01:45.150> it<00:01:45.330> right<00:01:45.480> there<00:01:45.510> now<00:01:45.870> we<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:46.140> have

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
that's it right there now we just have

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.540 
that's it right there now we just have
to<00:01:46.380> figure<00:01:46.530> out<00:01:46.710> what<00:01:46.890> are<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.040> gonna<00:01:47.130> do<00:01:47.400> with

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
to figure out what are we gonna do with

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.160 
to figure out what are we gonna do with
that<00:01:47.730> right<00:01:48.360> now<00:01:48.540> it's<00:01:48.750> just<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.900> bunch<00:01:49.050> of

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
that right now it's just a bunch of

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.450 
that right now it's just a bunch of
Hubba<00:01:49.350> Bubba<00:01:49.440> it's<00:01:49.740> just<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.920> bunch<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.190> notes

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
Hubba Bubba it's just a bunch of notes

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.680 
Hubba Bubba it's just a bunch of notes
but<00:01:50.610> we're<00:01:50.729> gonna<00:01:50.820> do<00:01:51.150> something<00:01:51.390> with<00:01:51.540> it

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
but we're gonna do something with it

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.900 
but we're gonna do something with it
right<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.740> me<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.190> way<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.310> would<00:01:53.640> figure<00:01:53.820> it

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
right so to me the way I would figure it

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.280 
right so to me the way I would figure it
out<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.120> go<00:01:54.240> all<00:01:54.330> right<00:01:54.420> what<00:01:54.600> kind<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.900> kind<00:01:55.260> of

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
out is go all right what kind of kind of

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.810 
out is go all right what kind of kind of
subdivision<00:01:55.830> in<00:01:55.920> my<00:01:55.979> dealing<00:01:56.250> with<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.460> let's

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
subdivision in my dealing with you let's

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.710 
subdivision in my dealing with you let's
say<00:01:56.940> I'm<00:01:57.030> let's<00:01:57.420> say<00:01:57.510> I'm<00:01:57.570> feeling

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
say I'm let's say I'm feeling

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.600 
say I'm let's say I'm feeling
thirty-second<00:01:58.440> notes<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.740> want<00:01:59.160> that<00:01:59.340> really

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
thirty-second notes I want that really

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.310 
thirty-second notes I want that really
kind<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.850> just<00:02:00.000> cool<00:02:00.420> chaos<00:02:00.900> lick<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.260> I'm

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
kind of just cool chaos lick so I'm

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.900 
kind of just cool chaos lick so I'm
gonna<00:02:01.410> go<00:02:01.530> thirty<00:02:01.800> second<00:02:02.160> notes<00:02:02.190> and<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.850> know

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
gonna go thirty second notes and I know

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.820 
gonna go thirty second notes and I know
that<00:02:03.240> my<00:02:03.360> lick<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.750> six<00:02:03.990> strokes<00:02:04.200> long<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.800> I

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
that my lick is six strokes long so I

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.740 
that my lick is six strokes long so I
can<00:02:05.130> figure<00:02:05.310> out<00:02:05.400> like<00:02:05.700> all<00:02:05.880> right<00:02:06.000> well<00:02:06.150> it's

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
can figure out like all right well it's

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.810 
can figure out like all right well it's
six<00:02:07.140> then<00:02:07.860> 12<00:02:08.340> then<00:02:09.119> 18<00:02:09.810> then<00:02:10.410> 24<00:02:11.130> we're<00:02:11.370> maxing

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
six then 12 then 18 then 24 we're maxing

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.000 
six then 12 then 18 then 24 we're maxing
out<00:02:11.910> my<00:02:11.970> math<00:02:12.330> capabilities<00:02:12.540> here<00:02:13.050> then<00:02:13.530> 30

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
out my math capabilities here then 30

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.790 
out my math capabilities here then 30
and<00:02:14.280> then<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:15.300> next<00:02:15.630> one<00:02:15.780> would<00:02:15.900> be<00:02:15.959> 36<00:02:16.590> well<00:02:16.770> I

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
and then the next one would be 36 well I

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.470 
and then the next one would be 36 well I
only<00:02:17.070> have<00:02:17.220> 32<00:02:17.610> notes<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.120> I'm<00:02:18.180> allowed<00:02:18.360> to

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
only have 32 notes that I'm allowed to

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.060 
only have 32 notes that I'm allowed to

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.540 
do this lick five times in a row and
then<00:02:27.989> just<00:02:28.200> add<00:02:28.380> in<00:02:28.590> two<00:02:28.860> thirty-second<00:02:29.430> notes

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
then just add in two thirty-second notes

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.160 
then just add in two thirty-second notes
at<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.700> end<00:02:29.790> following<00:02:30.360> my<00:02:30.510> last<00:02:30.750> bass<00:02:30.959> drum

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.130 
at the end following my last bass drum
and<00:02:31.500> that<00:02:31.680> gives<00:02:31.890> me<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.070> 1<00:02:32.550> bar<00:02:32.820> fill<00:02:33.209> in<00:02:33.600> this

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
and that gives me a 1 bar fill in this

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.840 
and that gives me a 1 bar fill in this
lick<00:02:34.410> based<00:02:34.830> out<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.040> thirty-second<00:02:35.640> notes<00:02:35.760> so

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
lick based out of thirty-second notes so

00:02:35.850 --> 00:03:18.099 
lick based out of thirty-second notes so
let's<00:02:35.970> give<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.239> try<00:02:36.360> nice<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.810> slow

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.569 

all<00:03:19.109> right<00:03:19.379> so<00:03:19.500> your<00:03:19.650> goal<00:03:19.829> with<00:03:20.010> that<00:03:20.040> is<00:03:20.220> two
