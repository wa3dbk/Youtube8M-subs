2<00:00:32.180> so<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.630> what<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.079> have<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.350> do<00:00:34.500> here<00:00:34.800> is

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
2 so the what you have to do here is

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.030 
2 so the what you have to do here is
it's<00:00:35.850> because<00:00:36.270> Windows<00:00:37.260> 8<00:00:37.469> does<00:00:37.680> not<00:00:37.860> have

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
it's because Windows 8 does not have

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.700 
it's because Windows 8 does not have
this<00:00:38.250> run<00:00:38.550> as<00:00:38.730> administrator'<00:00:39.329> button<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.840> I

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
this run as administrator' button and I

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.799 
this run as administrator' button and I
don't<00:00:40.770> really<00:00:41.070> know<00:00:41.340> why<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:41.579> Windows<00:00:42.510> 8<00:00:42.660> does

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
don't really know why but Windows 8 does

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.360 
don't really know why but Windows 8 does
not<00:00:42.930> have<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.500> can't<00:00:43.739> really<00:00:43.980> run<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
not have it so you can't really run the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.540 
not have it so you can't really run the
MSI<00:00:44.610> Palance<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.690> yeah<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.230> sucks<00:00:46.590> but<00:00:47.309> now

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
MSI Palance so yeah that sucks but now

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.100
