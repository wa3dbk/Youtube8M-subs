00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.539
 4 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:09.430
 very beautifull 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.009
 now that we know which chords are in sky blue 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.359
 we have to see which scales we can use 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:21.880
 At the moment we have only ever used the minor attack 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.480
 also known as the blues scale when we add 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.890
 with the fifth in the world of daw lov news 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.890
 however, they can also use May tectonics 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.640
 that gives us 2 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.640
 different types of sounds 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.020
 8% 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.670
 It is in the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.960
 verona 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.560
 not 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.670
 so now we are on the air with news milan 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.890
 we can very well use the pentatonic of the major 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.720
 so we have to go with the little finger also on the fifth rate of the 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.720
 same thing 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.460
 and the pentatonic sonar 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.900
 delta 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.040
 . 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.110
 for simplicity I am very natural 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.039
 even if to tell the truth amc 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.749
 what really characterizes red 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:18.169
 and the use of the minor pentatonic 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.889
 in this case, sport is called to scale 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.880
 but I think 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.199
 on 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:28.659
 browned limbus 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.049
 nikon 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.859
 I major harmonic lap, junior in general the rodeo 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:39.549
 ninth bad under the newspaper smaller scale is the pentatonic of the lesser 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.730
 so let's go with the first titles on the realized 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:45.629
 perrone 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.889
 100% 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:49.419
 so first 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.449
 we use to pentatonics number 5 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.179
 with the pinkie lace 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:58.979
 therefore it is practically the pentatonic of phages if it is minor 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:03.379
 the major 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.379
 pes instead we think of the minor's pentatonic 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.989
 you have a future 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.970
 levanto the major root and here no one has a nap 

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:18.229
 while with the minor and therefore on the index 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:19.949
 for this fingering 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.369
 indigo the pentatonic of the minor 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:25.029
 that is as C major 

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:28.269
 therefore isvap 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.269
 and so for a while that they are no longer ugly 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:37.119
 while this one is 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:40.039
 I don't say diapers 

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:41.919
 so it's a 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:47.270
 i really simple rules use both scales and thick times 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.959
 at the same time I don't know only 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.129
 maybe doing a little question and answer 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:54.749
 . 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:57.109
 lithium 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:58.420
 courses for example 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.329
 and then they go back up torrent 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.949
 ah fingerings is not strange 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:06.560
 see these things inside 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.689
 via nonsoloproust 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:12.239
 has a mixed one we find also that they play one 

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:15.489
 around harmonic queen English eighths

 dabangg hunk minority 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.330
 and this is a fairly common thing because on the stairs they give their own way 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.990
 different ben ten

 benetton 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.470
 and therefore may be fine inter change to bring 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.439
 variety now 

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:40.529
 it goes where you can do the same thing 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:42.939
 with me the pentatonic also 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:45.840
 youtube we have villa here 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.580
 photo said tax 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.499
 but that we can play lamp 

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:53.639
 pentatonic of fa sharp minor starts from here 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:59.569
 because let us now believe the root of this to the scale it fifth fees 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:02.650
 and the minor one 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.009
 and here nek or greater 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.349
 x1 little finger in the best doesn't tell us this at the scale 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:11.539
 I look forward to the majority 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.539
 come true 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.270
 or we are not angels of the band antony hegarty the younger 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.159
 let's change the dream index 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:28.159
 we are not honored 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.430
 you are not here the pentatonic would be lost 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:36.439
 of the minor 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:38.240
 with yours 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.279
 the weaver 

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:44.109
 no even here we can very well change tele2 fingering 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.820
 and this is for the moment 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.529
 I recommend a dispassionate advice where to buy 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:53.080

 you were trying to play together rai arci tvb 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.960
 cost per exercise very very useful that I do 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.219
 also currently 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:13.020
 then an important thing 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.229
 and ahm's take these 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:18.029
 fingerings that 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:22.389
 from the camajore meadow to that of the minor pentatonic and to try them 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:27.379
 at the same time to this mentioned excavations create new divx so that I become 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:30.379
 increasingly make a solo improvise
