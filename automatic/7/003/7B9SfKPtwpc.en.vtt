doing<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:04.020> quick<00:00:04.290> little<00:00:04.410> review<00:00:04.799> of<00:00:05.540> the

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
doing a quick little review of the

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.410 
doing a quick little review of the
Belkin<00:00:07.049> grip<00:00:07.620> candy<00:00:08.189> sheer<00:00:08.550> case<00:00:08.970> for<00:00:09.330> the

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
Belkin grip candy sheer case for the

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.340 
Belkin grip candy sheer case for the
iPhone<00:00:09.840> 5<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.380> 5s<00:00:11.030> so<00:00:12.259> this<00:00:13.259> isn't<00:00:13.440> entirely

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
iPhone 5 and 5s so this isn't entirely

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.200 
iPhone 5 and 5s so this isn't entirely
this<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.529> made<00:00:16.680> entirely<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.400> TPU<00:00:18.029> material

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
this is made entirely of TPU material

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.179 
this is made entirely of TPU material
which<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.930> my<00:00:19.080> favorite<00:00:19.470> case<00:00:19.650> material

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
which is my favorite case material

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.670 
which is my favorite case material
because<00:00:20.550> it's<00:00:21.300> soft<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.930> feels<00:00:21.960> nice<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
because it's soft it feels nice in the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.620 
because it's soft it feels nice in the
hand<00:00:22.710> it's<00:00:23.160> easy<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.580> take<00:00:23.730> off<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.150> phone<00:00:24.359> and

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
hand it's easy to take off the phone and

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.500 
hand it's easy to take off the phone and
the<00:00:24.990> buttons<00:00:25.260> still<00:00:25.529> are<00:00:25.800> pretty<00:00:26.070> tactile<00:00:26.609> so

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
the buttons still are pretty tactile so

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.300 
the buttons still are pretty tactile so
I'm<00:00:28.439> going<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.710> go<00:00:28.769> ahead<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.010> take<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.189> case

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
I'm going to go ahead and take the case

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.800 
I'm going to go ahead and take the case
off<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.699> we<00:00:29.789> can<00:00:29.939> take<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.119> look<00:00:30.330> at<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.660> in

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
off and we can take a look at it in

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.100 
off and we can take a look at it in
depth<00:00:31.579> so<00:00:32.579> one<00:00:33.329> thing<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.600> like<00:00:33.780> about<00:00:33.809> this

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
depth so one thing I like about this

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.930 
depth so one thing I like about this
case<00:00:34.380> already<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.370> pretty<00:00:35.640> easy

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
case already is that it is pretty easy

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.430 
case already is that it is pretty easy
to<00:00:36.120> remove<00:00:36.540> from<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.899> phone

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
to remove from the phone

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.090 
to remove from the phone
so<00:00:38.210> yeah<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.239> think<00:00:39.480> that's<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.899> big<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.379> big<00:00:40.800> plus

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
so yeah I think that's a big a big plus

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.580 
so yeah I think that's a big a big plus
for<00:00:41.129> me<00:00:41.610> just<00:00:42.480> because<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.750> liked<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.079> cases<00:00:43.350> on

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
for me just because I liked it cases on

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.580 
for me just because I liked it cases on
and<00:00:43.739> off<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:44.129> lot<00:00:44.670> but<00:00:45.360> as<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.570> can<00:00:45.660> see<00:00:45.719> this

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
and off a lot but as you can see this

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.029 
and off a lot but as you can see this
this<00:00:47.070> particular<00:00:47.760> one<00:00:47.940> it's<00:00:48.840> entirely<00:00:49.200> TPU<00:00:49.680> so

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
this particular one it's entirely TPU so

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.100 
this particular one it's entirely TPU so
it's<00:00:50.190> soft<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.149> flexible<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:53.690> exterior<00:00:54.690> is

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
it's soft and flexible the exterior is

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.040 
it's soft and flexible the exterior is
this<00:00:55.620> kind<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:56.039> light<00:00:56.460> blue<00:00:56.730> color<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
this kind of light blue color and the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.979 
this kind of light blue color and the
back<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.739> transparent<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.989> there's

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
back is transparent and there's

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.810 
back is transparent and there's
obviously<00:01:01.469> your<00:01:01.949> camera<00:01:02.280> cutout<00:01:02.460> with<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
obviously your camera cutout with the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.729 
obviously your camera cutout with the
black<00:01:03.030> ring<00:01:03.329> around<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.809> no<00:01:04.290> problems<00:01:04.680> with

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
black ring around it no problems with

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.070 
black ring around it no problems with
the<00:01:04.860> flash<00:01:05.070> there<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.640> then<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> buttons<00:01:06.659> are

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
the flash there and then the buttons are

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.440 
the flash there and then the buttons are
transparent<00:01:07.950> as<00:01:08.130> well<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.970> kind<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.240> makes

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
transparent as well so it kind of makes

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.550 
transparent as well so it kind of makes
for<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.689> cool<00:01:09.900> effect<00:01:10.610> it<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.670> kind<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.270> matte

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
for a cool effect it is kind of a matte

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.190 
for a cool effect it is kind of a matte
frosted<00:01:13.560> finish<00:01:13.770> around<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.430> whole<00:01:14.610> case<00:01:15.200> and

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
frosted finish around the whole case and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.929 
frosted finish around the whole case and
one<00:01:16.439> thing<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.770> didn't<00:01:17.070> like<00:01:17.100> about<00:01:17.460> my<00:01:17.790> other

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
one thing I didn't like about my other

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.499 
one thing I didn't like about my other
TPU<00:01:18.450> case<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.850> let<00:01:20.850> me<00:01:20.880> get<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.180> out<00:01:21.270> real

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
TPU case is that let me get it out real

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.850 
TPU case is that let me get it out real
quick<00:01:21.799> is<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.159> showed<00:01:24.619> dirt<00:01:25.619> and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
quick is that it showed dirt and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.460 
quick is that it showed dirt and
fingerprints<00:01:26.490> really<00:01:26.759> easily<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.570> as<00:01:28.320> you

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
fingerprints really easily and as you

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.410 
fingerprints really easily and as you
can<00:01:28.590> see<00:01:28.860> right<00:01:29.280> here<00:01:29.340> here's<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> old<00:01:30.150> case

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
can see right here here's the old case

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.719 
can see right here here's the old case
here's<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.720> one<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.900> was<00:01:31.079> using<00:01:31.110> before<00:01:31.729> you

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
here's the one I was using before you

here's the one I was using before you
can<00:01:32.880> see<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.150> one<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.750> showing<00:01:34.640> scratches

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350

can see this one is showing scratches
dirt<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.590> fingerprints<00:01:38.430> very<00:01:39.030> well<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.630> did

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
dirt and fingerprints very well I did

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.260 
dirt and fingerprints very well I did
not<00:01:39.990> like<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:41.400> one's<00:01:41.610> kind<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.030> gross

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
but anyway yeah and then this one also

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.300 
but anyway yeah and then this one also
started<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.270> fray<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.509> do<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.320> get<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.680> that's

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
started to fray so do I get that that's

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.499 
started to fray so do I get that that's
one<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.700> things<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:47.970> liked<00:01:48.180> about<00:01:48.299> this

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
one of the things I liked about this

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.270 
one of the things I liked about this
case<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.960> case<00:01:49.020> does<00:01:49.350> not<00:01:49.500> show<00:01:49.680> any<00:01:49.920> sort<00:01:50.159> of

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
case this case does not show any sort of

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.950 
case this case does not show any sort of
finger<00:01:50.579> printing<00:01:51.000> or<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.890> know<00:01:53.009> scratches<00:01:53.960> on

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
finger printing or you know scratches on

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.730 
finger printing or you know scratches on
it<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:56.060> it's<00:01:57.060> just<00:01:57.329> an<00:01:57.540> overall<00:01:57.630> really<00:01:58.530> nice

annoyance yeah it's good lay on the

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.900 
annoyance yeah it's good lay on the
table<00:04:01.290> design<00:04:01.500> a<00:04:01.770> scene<00:04:02.190> you<00:04:02.370> know<00:04:02.489> you<00:04:02.580> put<00:04:02.790> it

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
table design a scene you know you put it

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.070 
table design a scene you know you put it
on<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.060> table<00:04:03.360> and<00:04:03.450> not<00:04:03.570> have<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:03.750> worry<00:04:03.959> about

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
on the table and not have to worry about

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.960 
on the table and not have to worry about
it<00:04:04.940> and<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.209> case<00:04:06.450> is<00:04:06.890> pretty<00:04:07.890> cool<00:04:08.160> that's

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
it and the case is pretty cool that's

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.690 
it and the case is pretty cool that's
almost<00:04:09.270> like<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.870> sides<00:04:10.590> are<00:04:10.950> transparent

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
almost like the sides are transparent

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.130 
almost like the sides are transparent
around<00:04:11.910> here<00:04:12.300> because<00:04:12.570> there's<00:04:12.750> nothing<00:04:13.020> on

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
around here because there's nothing on

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.990 
around here because there's nothing on
this<00:04:13.290> side<00:04:13.560> so<00:04:14.220> it<00:04:14.280> makes<00:04:14.459> for<00:04:14.610> a<00:04:14.640> cool<00:04:14.850> effect

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
this side so it makes for a cool effect

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.030 
this side so it makes for a cool effect
it<00:04:15.989> almost<00:04:16.140> looks<00:04:16.380> like<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.650> phone<00:04:16.859> is

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
it almost looks like the phone is

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.340 
it almost looks like the phone is
floating<00:04:17.790> inside<00:04:17.910> of<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.299> case<00:04:18.510> I<00:04:18.810> just<00:04:19.140> I

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
floating inside of the case I just I

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.150 
floating inside of the case I just I
really<00:04:19.590> like<00:04:19.770> that<00:04:20.330> this<00:04:21.330> case<00:04:21.600> retails<00:04:22.049> for

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
really like that this case retails for

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.660 
really like that this case retails for
$24.99

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
$24.99

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.460 
$24.99
I<00:04:23.700> found<00:04:24.090> it<00:04:24.210> at<00:04:24.300> my<00:04:24.390> local<00:04:24.540> target<00:04:25.170> I<00:04:25.290> don't

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.930 
know if you can get it anywhere else but
