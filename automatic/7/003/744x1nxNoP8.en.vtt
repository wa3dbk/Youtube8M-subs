 brain that we could see in x-men 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.730
 first generation interpreting the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.739
 Dr. Moira Mactaggert back to the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.500
 mutant universe in the next movie 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.870
 in the interview that simon kinberg has

 she is a relevant character 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.400
 when I finish first generation charles 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.890
 he had erased portions of his memories 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.100
 relative to your experience with the x-men 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.050
 so essentially they are unknown 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.750
 for her when they meet again 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.150
 the repertoire of main characters 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.399

 first time when I was in school 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.979

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.149
 moment its light-generating powers 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.530
 they appeared for the first time all the 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.390
 world in the supposed school that was 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.149
 technology generated by effects 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.580
 special a common assumption between 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.619
 people before she revealed herself as 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.350
 a mutant later the name of 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.450
 dasler is artistic and used by alison 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.579

 the x-men in one of their shows 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.950
 when those members were attacked by 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.330
 the infernal fire club group 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.970
 angry about the riots in her 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.610

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.120
 the sound and the light before greater volume 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.519
 greater is the power of the light generated 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.790
 from simple dazzling flashes 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.379
 until real nuclear explosions 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.780
 duster can also generate images 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.760
 holographic with the light generated in the 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.730
 history we will also see acquaintances 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.220
 mutants among them cyclops storm and 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.409
 gingrey who will appear in his years 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.750
 young so they are interpreted 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:06.390
 by new actors know our 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.010

 sophie torner like gingrey itait 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.780
 sheridan as cycle wrote on twitter 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.269
 brian singer director of the tape seems 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.260
 that x-men apocalypse has been raised in 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.750
 certain way 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.610
 a trilogy close at least as far as 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.799
 referring to the plot arcs of 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.930
 some main characters 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:31.019
 this movie completes the first arc of 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.930
 charles eric raven and hank who are 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.000
 essentially our protagonists are 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.250
 younger actors incarnating 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.590
 young characters so there will be more 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.629
 stories to tell but as a first 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.579
 phase of their lives there will be a feeling 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.560
 of closing the stage at the end of 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.209
 movie still 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.890
 remember that there is still the possible link 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.170
 with the universe of the four 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.909

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.709
 video remember to leave your opinion in the 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.239

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.989
 social issues found in the
