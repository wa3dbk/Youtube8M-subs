reboot<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:33.989> full<00:00:34.530> 4/3<00:00:35.040> format<00:00:35.460> which

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
reboot of the full 4/3 format which

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.500 
reboot of the full 4/3 format which
debuted<00:00:36.390> around<00:00:36.660> 2006<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:38.180> it<00:00:39.180> was<00:00:39.329> pretty

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
debuted around 2006 and it was pretty

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.270 
debuted around 2006 and it was pretty
much<00:00:39.570> abandoned<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.350> few<00:00:40.379> years<00:00:40.739> ago<00:00:40.890> and

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
much abandoned a few years ago and

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.920 
much abandoned a few years ago and
because<00:00:41.760> micro<00:00:42.090> four-thirds<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> better

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
because micro four-thirds is a better

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.540 
because micro four-thirds is a better
system<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.559> there's<00:00:43.920> no<00:00:44.070> mirror<00:00:44.340> or<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
system it's there's no mirror or the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.240 
system it's there's no mirror or the
lenses<00:00:44.910> are<00:00:45.030> smaller<00:00:45.620> you<00:00:46.620> know<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.829> glass<00:00:47.039> is

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
lenses are smaller you know the glass is

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.090 
lenses are smaller you know the glass is
cheaper<00:00:47.640> but<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.750> yeah<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.320> have<00:00:49.530> these<00:00:49.800> full

it's actually going for a little bit
cheaper<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.450> can<00:02:03.479> get<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.750> 2.8<00:02:04.290> zoom<00:02:04.619> lens<00:02:04.890> for

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
cheaper you can get a 2.8 zoom lens for

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.869 
cheaper you can get a 2.8 zoom lens for
$98<00:02:06.240> now<00:02:06.840> granted<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.439> does<00:02:07.680> it's<00:02:08.340> not<00:02:08.610> a

$98 now granted it does it's not a

$98 now granted it does it's not a
constant<00:02:09.360> aperture

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
constant aperture

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.900 
constant aperture
it<00:02:10.180> goes<00:02:10.510> up<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:11.080> 3.5<00:02:11.710> but<00:02:12.130> that's<00:02:12.370> that's<00:02:12.730> very

it goes up to 3.5 but that's that's very
close<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.390> 2.8<00:02:13.900> it's<00:02:14.140> annoying<00:02:14.470> to<00:02:14.620> have

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
close to 2.8 it's annoying to have

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
just won one on ebay not too long ago

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.180 
just won one on ebay not too long ago
and<00:04:01.390> was<00:04:02.110> a<00:04:02.350> hundred<00:04:02.739> and<00:04:02.800> sixty-eight

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
and was a hundred and sixty-eight

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.940 
and was a hundred and sixty-eight
dollars<00:04:03.459> which<00:04:04.060> is<00:04:04.239> uh<00:04:04.270> pretty<00:04:05.020> much<00:04:05.440> a<00:04:05.560> steal

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
dollars which is uh pretty much a steal

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.370 
dollars which is uh pretty much a steal
and<00:04:06.370> I<00:04:06.459> tried<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.940> 25<00:04:07.420> millimeter<00:04:07.660> Panasonic

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
and I tried the 25 millimeter Panasonic

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.770 
and I tried the 25 millimeter Panasonic
1.4<00:04:08.950> it's<00:04:09.250> a<00:04:09.340> great<00:04:09.550> lens<00:04:09.790> but<00:04:10.150> it's<00:04:10.450> amazing

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
1.4 it's a great lens but it's amazing

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
1.4 it's a great lens but it's amazing
what<00:04:10.900> a<00:04:10.930> difference<00:04:10.989> the<00:04:11.410> extra<00:04:11.650> 5

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
what a difference the extra 5

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.370 
what a difference the extra 5
millimeters<00:04:12.250> make<00:04:12.459> because<00:04:12.910> this<00:04:13.150> is<00:04:13.390> the

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
millimeters make because this is the

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.890 
millimeters make because this is the
background<00:04:14.830> is<00:04:15.040> very<00:04:15.120> creamy<00:04:16.120> and<00:04:16.209> very<00:04:16.330> blur

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
background is very creamy and very blur

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.750 
background is very creamy and very blur
with<00:04:17.139> this<00:04:17.320> so<00:04:17.650> this<00:04:18.190> is<00:04:18.400> just<00:04:18.549> like<00:04:18.669> the

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
with this so this is just like the

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.370 
with this so this is just like the
perfect<00:04:18.940> focal<00:04:19.540> length<00:04:19.690> for<00:04:19.900> me<00:04:19.989> for

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
perfect focal length for me for

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.530 
perfect focal length for me for
especially<00:04:20.709> for<00:04:21.040> interviews<00:04:21.549> now<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.270> main

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
especially for interviews now the main

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.719 
especially for interviews now the main
issues<00:04:22.990> with<00:04:23.380> this<00:04:23.590> lens<00:04:23.860> which<00:04:24.160> I<00:04:24.310> really

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
issues with this lens which I really

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.040 
issues with this lens which I really
can't<00:04:24.940> complain<00:04:25.210> about<00:04:25.270> considering<00:04:25.870> how

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
can't complain about considering how

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.250 
can't complain about considering how
cheap<00:04:26.320> it<00:04:26.470> is<00:04:26.500> but<00:04:26.830> one<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.940> focus<00:04:28.150> ring<00:04:28.570> is<00:04:28.780> a

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
cheap it is but one the focus ring is a

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.350 
cheap it is but one the focus ring is a
tiny<00:04:29.740> bit<00:04:30.010> stiff<00:04:30.310> but<00:04:30.580> you<00:04:30.699> get<00:04:30.850> used<00:04:31.030> to<00:04:31.180> it

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
tiny bit stiff but you get used to it

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.540 
tiny bit stiff but you get used to it
another<00:04:31.900> nitpicking<00:04:32.650> thing<00:04:33.100> with<00:04:33.250> this<00:04:33.340> lens

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
another nitpicking thing with this lens

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.300 
another nitpicking thing with this lens
is<00:04:33.820> that<00:04:34.479> the<00:04:35.110> Panasonic<00:04:35.770> cameras<00:04:36.130> do<00:04:36.280> not

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
is that the Panasonic cameras do not

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.230 
is that the Panasonic cameras do not
recognize<00:04:38.220> you're<00:04:39.220> trying<00:04:39.669> to<00:04:39.760> adjust<00:04:40.000> focus

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
know and manual focus assist is if you

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:45.780 
know and manual focus assist is if you
have<00:04:44.350> a<00:04:44.380> lens<00:04:44.680> that<00:04:44.860> communicates<00:04:45.430> with<00:04:45.639> the

the focus ring if you had that feature
on<00:04:51.550> your<00:04:52.020> Panasonic<00:04:53.020> camera<00:04:53.320> turned<00:04:53.530> on
