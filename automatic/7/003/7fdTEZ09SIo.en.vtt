00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:19.040
 My name is Maria, I'm 16 years old and I like it 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.840
 a lot of drawing if a company gives us this 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:26.350
 opportunity we have to take advantage of it and 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.350
 enjoy 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.890
 all right 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.990
 to me this art comes from family 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.240
 because my father is a photographer since 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.790
 small I have always liked to draw or 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.710
 do creative things a father was 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.990
 sculptor I remember that when I was 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.180
 small I saw him make structures I started 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.729
 with the photograph when I was 13 or 14 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.650
 years you stand straight looking towards 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.510
 forward since then I have not stopped 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.220
 two years ago I bought a camera 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.710
 photos and suddenly I started taking photos 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.870
 I also saw that art is everything and in 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.570
 any medium could express me very 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.490
 well and from there I started to grow the art 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.220
 for me it is a way of being able to express 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.550
 what do you think a bit of escape 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.960
 a little of the state without art life 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.960
 it would be nothing would be super boring 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.439
 about this you can also mark letters 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.990
 larger than there in the 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.270
 lead are actually four days 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.430
 they are very intense intense days 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.020
 to live together will be together 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.670
 they will work together you just want that 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.289
 people have the color and the background 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.659
 let him stay white I consider myself already 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.149
 winner not because I can be here with 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.830
 giving material so many things all that 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.570
 do with graphite on top of this no no 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.330
 nothing happens they will work with a means 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.970
 has an institute is unlikely here in 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.959
 this side wants to put an iron 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.940
 we will find difficulties spoke of 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.940
 put here the pens 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.260
 You discovered a course for my sister 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.240
 because she also participated and with all 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.220
 experience everything I had done 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.690
 many friends and the camaraderie that 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.490
 I wanted here the experience with my 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.680
 comrades has been amazing because 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.570
 I had never been surrounded by so much 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.760
 people related to art we are 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.560
 very well all together we help each other 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.690
 When I need something right away, it comes 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.220
 someone you start like the plan 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.230
 competition that wants to win at all the 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.270
 world but then you finish 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.040
 relating and you want them to touch the 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.020
 contact with people that's more 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.780
 important that you have not won a prize 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.209
 or yes 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.830
 and he has managed to do the work that he wanted 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.660
 They are all very artists and that has 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.660
 incredibly enriched 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.430
 I think that the level of the works reaches 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.270
 where it comes because they have nothing of 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.270
 fear of being wrong 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.579
 I have learned to use machines we 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.260
 has brought a lot of knowledge in the 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.540
 art the most important thing that I take away from 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.720
 these days are wanting to work this 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:39.489
 summer are sponges that go straight to 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.489
 imbue yourself with everything that tells you 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.200
 do not 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.830
 I'm discovering a bit of all the 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.840
 styles to be able to mark my way 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.030
 was left with a sweet taste of 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.100
 experience will be part of a memory 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.280
 and also from a culture that has to 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.530
 see with art the level of the boys and 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.400
 the girls pretty good for there's no 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.660
 to forget how old he is 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.590
 logically you have to see it from a 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.660
 youth perspective the naive 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.580
 and the pure and authentic ones that are 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.950
 these ages when it comes to making art and 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.950
 to understand art 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.950
 Y 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:27.849
 Y 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.599
 no no 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.599
 to me 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.650
 yes 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.120
 yes
