00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:57.970 

shorter<00:04:50.360> strokes<00:04:55.090> shorter<00:04:56.350> yeah<00:04:57.350> just<00:04:57.770> get

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
shorter strokes shorter yeah just get

shorter strokes shorter yeah just get
the<00:04:58.100> power<00:04:58.310> out<00:04:58.490> in<00:04:58.730> front<00:04:59.000> and<00:04:59.270> then<00:04:59.540> get

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
the power out in front and then get

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.840 
the power out in front and then get
another<00:05:00.020> stroke<00:05:00.410> in<00:05:00.650> it's<00:05:01.280> better<00:05:01.580> to<00:05:01.730> get

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
another stroke in it's better to get

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.020 
another stroke in it's better to get
rapid-fire<00:05:02.750> strokes

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
rapid-fire strokes

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.400 
rapid-fire strokes
yeah<00:05:05.030> and<00:05:05.330> bounce<00:05:05.660> a<00:05:05.870> little<00:05:05.990> bit<00:05:06.230> get<00:05:06.380> a

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
yeah and bounce a little bit get a

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:14.080 
yeah and bounce a little bit get a
little<00:05:06.620> bit<00:05:06.740> of<00:05:06.830> bounce<00:05:07.010> in<00:05:07.250> there<00:05:12.640> hi<00:05:13.640> this<00:05:14.030> is

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
little bit of bounce in there hi this is

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.180 
little bit of bounce in there hi this is
Justin<00:05:14.450> again<00:05:14.600> I<00:05:14.960> want<00:05:15.260> to<00:05:15.350> give<00:05:15.530> you<00:05:15.740> another

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
Justin again I want to give you another

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.510 
Justin again I want to give you another
tip<00:05:16.670> that<00:05:16.730> Jeremy<00:05:17.330> gave<00:05:17.570> me<00:05:17.780> he's<00:05:18.440> the<00:05:18.740> analogy

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
tip that Jeremy gave me he's the analogy

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.690 
tip that Jeremy gave me he's the analogy
that<00:05:20.000> in<00:05:20.710> paddling<00:05:21.710> and<00:05:21.800> catching<00:05:22.220> the<00:05:22.310> bumps

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
that in paddling and catching the bumps

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.060 
that in paddling and catching the bumps
the<00:05:23.150> key<00:05:23.390> thing<00:05:23.750> is<00:05:23.990> keeping<00:05:24.920> up<00:05:25.040> your

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
the key thing is keeping up your

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.510 
the key thing is keeping up your
momentum<00:05:25.880> so<00:05:26.690> that<00:05:26.930> as<00:05:27.170> we<00:05:27.350> approach<00:05:27.710> as<00:05:28.250> we<00:05:28.370> go

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
momentum so that as we approach as we go

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.490 
momentum so that as we approach as we go
down<00:05:28.760> one<00:05:29.180> wave<00:05:29.420> and<00:05:29.720> then<00:05:29.810> we<00:05:29.900> come<00:05:30.110> up<00:05:30.140> to<00:05:30.380> the

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
down one wave and then we come up to the

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.620 
down one wave and then we come up to the
next<00:05:30.770> wave<00:05:30.950> the<00:05:31.640> key<00:05:31.820> thing<00:05:32.030> is<00:05:32.060> not<00:05:32.390> to

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
next wave the key thing is not to

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.900 
next wave the key thing is not to
actually<00:05:32.810> go<00:05:33.800> right<00:05:34.100> up<00:05:34.310> the<00:05:34.430> back<00:05:34.610> of<00:05:34.850> the

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
actually go right up the back of the

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.610 
actually go right up the back of the
wave<00:05:35.120> in<00:05:35.330> front<00:05:35.570> of<00:05:35.720> you<00:05:35.870> because<00:05:36.080> when<00:05:36.410> that

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
wave in front of you because when that

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.220 
wave in front of you because when that
happens<00:05:37.100> you<00:05:37.310> end<00:05:37.340> up<00:05:37.580> slowing<00:05:37.790> down<00:05:38.120> so<00:05:39.080> we

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
happens you end up slowing down so we

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.570 
happens you end up slowing down so we
want<00:05:39.440> to<00:05:39.560> do<00:05:39.710> is<00:05:39.830> you<00:05:39.950> want<00:05:40.100> to<00:05:40.190> keep<00:05:40.340> adjusting

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
want to do is you want to keep adjusting

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.940 
want to do is you want to keep adjusting
the<00:05:41.090> board<00:05:41.390> and<00:05:41.630> looking<00:05:41.960> for<00:05:42.230> a<00:05:42.260> place<00:05:42.620> where

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
the board and looking for a place where

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.040 
the board and looking for a place where
we<00:05:43.100> can<00:05:43.250> keep<00:05:43.460> the<00:05:43.640> momentum<00:05:43.760> going<00:05:44.060> I've

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
we can keep the momentum going I've

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.630 
we can keep the momentum going I've
heard<00:05:45.260> also<00:05:45.560> the<00:05:45.680> analogy<00:05:46.160> it's<00:05:46.280> a<00:05:46.340> little<00:05:46.520> bit

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
heard also the analogy it's a little bit

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.370 
heard also the analogy it's a little bit
like<00:05:46.760> spinning<00:05:47.180> a<00:05:47.270> basketball<00:05:47.450> is<00:05:48.140> that<00:05:48.170> you

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
like spinning a basketball is that you

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.230 
like spinning a basketball is that you
just<00:05:48.530> want<00:05:48.740> to<00:05:48.830> keep<00:05:49.040> you<00:05:49.580> have<00:05:49.670> to<00:05:49.760> keep<00:05:50.030> it

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
just want to keep you have to keep it

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.410 
just want to keep you have to keep it
turning<00:05:50.620> so<00:05:51.620> as<00:05:51.740> we<00:05:51.860> go<00:05:52.010> through<00:05:52.040> and<00:05:52.820> we<00:05:53.210> catch

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.420 
turning so as we go through and we catch

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.940 
turning so as we go through and we catch
one<00:05:53.690> way<00:05:53.900> if<00:05:54.140> we're<00:05:54.260> gonna<00:05:54.380> go<00:05:54.650> and<00:05:54.770> we're

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
one way if we're gonna go and we're

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.100 
one way if we're gonna go and we're
gonna<00:05:55.010> look<00:05:55.280> for<00:05:55.340> a<00:05:55.910> place<00:05:56.630> where<00:05:56.870> we<00:05:56.930> can

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
gonna look for a place where we can

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.950 
gonna look for a place where we can
guide<00:05:57.350> the<00:05:57.530> board<00:05:57.740> right<00:05:58.220> into<00:05:58.700> a<00:05:59.240> place<00:05:59.810> where

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
guide the board right into a place where

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.510 
guide the board right into a place where
it's<00:06:00.110> gonna<00:06:00.200> catch<00:06:00.500> the<00:06:00.680> next<00:06:00.860> bump<00:06:01.190> and<00:06:01.430> that

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
it's gonna catch the next bump and that

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.890 
it's gonna catch the next bump and that
might<00:06:01.700> mean<00:06:01.910> turning<00:06:02.360> a<00:06:02.390> little<00:06:02.570> bit<00:06:02.660> to<00:06:02.780> the

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
might mean turning a little bit to the

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.480 
might mean turning a little bit to the
left<00:06:03.170> turning<00:06:03.500> a<00:06:03.620> little<00:06:03.860> bit<00:06:03.950> to<00:06:04.100> the<00:06:04.220> right

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
left turning a little bit to the right

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.250 
left turning a little bit to the right
taking<00:06:05.300> a<00:06:05.360> stroke<00:06:05.630> in<00:06:05.780> the<00:06:05.870> right<00:06:06.050> direction

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
taking a stroke in the right direction

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.740 
taking a stroke in the right direction
the<00:06:07.220> key<00:06:07.430> thing<00:06:07.670> is<00:06:07.700> just<00:06:08.000> keeping<00:06:08.420> up<00:06:08.600> the

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
the key thing is just keeping up the

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.350 
the key thing is just keeping up the
momentum<00:06:09.050> and<00:06:09.620> also<00:06:10.400> it<00:06:10.520> means<00:06:10.700> is<00:06:11.150> that

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
momentum and also it means is that

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.750 
momentum and also it means is that
sometimes<00:06:12.140> when<00:06:12.350> we're<00:06:12.560> not<00:06:12.800> in<00:06:13.100> a<00:06:13.190> bump<00:06:13.430> and

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
sometimes when we're not in a bump and

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.360 
sometimes when we're not in a bump and
we're<00:06:14.270> waiting<00:06:14.450> for<00:06:14.660> the<00:06:14.930> water<00:06:15.140> to<00:06:15.290> get<00:06:16.100> into

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
we're waiting for the water to get into

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.820 
we're waiting for the water to get into
the<00:06:16.460> right<00:06:16.670> sort<00:06:17.150> of<00:06:17.210> a<00:06:17.330> bump<00:06:17.570> is<00:06:17.810> that<00:06:18.590> we<00:06:18.680> got

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
the right sort of a bump is that we got

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.620 
the right sort of a bump is that we got
actually<00:06:19.040> paddle<00:06:19.430> then<00:06:19.820> to<00:06:20.060> to<00:06:20.210> get<00:06:20.390> a<00:06:20.420> little

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
actually paddle then to to get a little

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.150 
actually paddle then to to get a little
board<00:06:20.930> speed<00:06:21.200> so<00:06:21.380> that<00:06:21.530> when<00:06:21.620> the<00:06:21.710> bump<00:06:21.890> comes

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 
board speed so that when the bump comes

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:29.269 
board speed so that when the bump comes
from<00:06:22.340> behind<00:06:22.490> we're<00:06:23.120> already<00:06:23.300> going<00:06:23.750> a<00:06:23.870> bit

00:06:29.269 --> 00:06:29.279 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:32.159 

hey<00:06:30.279> I<00:06:30.310> want<00:06:30.520> to<00:06:30.610> point<00:06:30.849> out<00:06:31.060> that<00:06:31.389> this<00:06:31.870> day

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:32.169 
hey I want to point out that this day

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:34.140 
hey I want to point out that this day
that<00:06:32.469> we<00:06:32.560> did<00:06:32.740> the<00:06:32.889> paddling<00:06:33.400> is<00:06:33.639> actually<00:06:34.120> a

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
that we did the paddling is actually a

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.300 
that we did the paddling is actually a
very<00:06:34.509> light<00:06:34.810> wind<00:06:35.080> day<00:06:35.319> for<00:06:35.710> the<00:06:35.830> summertime

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
very light wind day for the summertime

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.580 
very light wind day for the summertime
in<00:06:36.460> the<00:06:36.520> Maui<00:06:36.699> the<00:06:37.060> waves<00:06:37.659> are<00:06:37.900> actually<00:06:38.050> quite

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
in the Maui the waves are actually quite

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.409 
in the Maui the waves are actually quite
a<00:06:38.620> bit<00:06:38.800> smaller<00:06:39.159> than<00:06:39.430> the<00:06:39.550> average<00:06:39.939> day<00:06:40.180> when

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:40.419 
a bit smaller than the average day when

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:42.089 
a bit smaller than the average day when
the<00:06:40.539> winds<00:06:40.779> blowing<00:06:40.990> more<00:06:41.650> easterly

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:42.099 
the winds blowing more easterly

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:44.760 
the winds blowing more easterly
nevertheless<00:06:42.849> it<00:06:43.330> was<00:06:43.419> still<00:06:43.749> plenty<00:06:44.020> of<00:06:44.169> fun

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.770 
nevertheless it was still plenty of fun

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.950 
nevertheless it was still plenty of fun
I<00:06:44.800> want<00:06:45.249> to<00:06:45.370> thank<00:06:45.520> Jeremy<00:06:46.060> for<00:06:46.449> the<00:06:46.659> training
