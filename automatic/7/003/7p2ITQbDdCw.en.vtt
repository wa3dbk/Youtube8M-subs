 welcome in this video tutorial 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.539
 today we will create this 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.840
 simplest pencil drawing using 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.970
 Photoshop program I would like to draw 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.470
 attention immediately to the point that we 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.929
 will not use with you 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.790
 adjustment layers i.e. we do 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.079
 it's all just enough here with the help 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.320
 literally four layers 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.420
 and then there is a layer with a layer of leaf 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.370
 the girl is still a layer the girl is still a layer 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.050
 with a girl, that is, a principle 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.090
 the work will be quite simple 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.700
 so actually let 's 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.320
