00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 on television 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.919
 cia sauce grandfather and take a 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.269
 possibly two hours in doing them here 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.550
 for television reasons I'm going to 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.400
 simplify a bit I already have these 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.699
 tomatoes with my son with my onion 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.820
 roasted for 45 minutes one hour 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:22.380
 inside the oven ok now let's do 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.369
 the same as a principle about the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.030
 Tomato is pretty olive oil 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.020
 garlic 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.020
 and onion 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.809
 let's put so much salt that I have 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.809
 here in front of me 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.539
 salt little salt 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.600
 let's pick this up 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.010
 and with my hands I want to know how 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.870
 everything is running, I think you're the one 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.210
 Tomato is perfectly fine 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.280
 impregnated with oil that the onion 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.650
 feel that he got the oil milestone between 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.530
 layer and layer that garlic is the setting 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.230
 moistened that's what I like the 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.180
 450 temperature the hay in the oven 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.670
 which are approximately 200 210 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.740
 centigrade I have a tray I do not want 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.100
 Altadis also wash many 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.840
 removing the aluminum and let's put 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.900
 our car mix I got two 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.790
 of buoys nothing more two and I'm going to roast 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.520
 for approximately 45 minutes at a 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.010
 when they are perfectly smooth 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.780
 so that another who can press you 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.060
 leave all the sauce after that 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.300
 process I'll leave until here during 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.520
 45 minutes again to have this sauce 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.260
 that I have here on my right I'm going to 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.270
 take my hands and minds that 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.630
 you wash because we are not going to see a capsule 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:46.439
 let me 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.439
 let's see a capsule or nap 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.310
 how are you pulling to seal my 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:00.210
 short meatballs I'm going to start doing 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.210
 but I'm going to liquefy my tomato sauce 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.370
 I do not know for 45 minutes 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.940

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.160
 italian 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.930
 the cooking time is what gives you that 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.530
 is liquefying perfect the low one of 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.530
 how many minutes 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.370
 we have earrings for the whole kitchen 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.170
 as always as a pedophile 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.170
 falsely though they look like two of these 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.170
 let's open our sauce 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.750
 While nothing but delight salsa I have 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.300

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.690

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.040
