00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:05.210 

okay<00:00:03.929> now<00:00:04.140> that<00:00:04.319> we've<00:00:04.470> been<00:00:04.589> working<00:00:04.799> with

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
okay now that we've been working with

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.150 
okay now that we've been working with
subtracting<00:00:06.180> with<00:00:06.540> mixed<00:00:06.990> numbers<00:00:07.350> there's

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
subtracting with mixed numbers there's

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.100 
subtracting with mixed numbers there's
one<00:00:08.400> more<00:00:08.550> thing<00:00:08.880> I<00:00:09.179> need<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.389> show<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:09.750> that

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
one more thing I need to show you that

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.799 
one more thing I need to show you that
can<00:00:10.590> be<00:00:10.769> an<00:00:10.860> area<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:11.280> complication<00:00:12.090> let's

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
can be an area of complication let's

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.450 
can be an area of complication let's
take<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.049> look<00:00:13.200> at<00:00:13.320> our<00:00:13.410> example<00:00:13.889> we<00:00:14.040> have<00:00:14.070> two

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
take a look at our example we have two

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.790 
take a look at our example we have two
and<00:00:14.639> one-third<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.420> we're<00:00:15.870> subtracting<00:00:16.049> one

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
and one-third and we're subtracting one

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.519 
and one-third and we're subtracting one
in<00:00:16.920> two-thirds<00:00:17.430> from<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:18.000> as<00:00:18.840> usual<00:00:19.470> I'm

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
in two-thirds from that as usual I'm

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.349 
in two-thirds from that as usual I'm
gonna<00:00:19.680> stack<00:00:19.949> my<00:00:20.189> mixed<00:00:20.460> numbers<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.060> that

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
gonna stack my mixed numbers so that

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.689 
gonna stack my mixed numbers so that
they're<00:00:21.689> all<00:00:21.840> lined<00:00:22.109> up<00:00:22.350> now<00:00:23.100> when<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.310> stack<00:00:23.670> my

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
they're all lined up now when I stack my

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.370 
they're all lined up now when I stack my
mixed<00:00:24.150> numbers<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.660> have<00:00:24.810> two<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.199> one-third

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
mixed numbers I have two and one-third

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.439 
mixed numbers I have two and one-third
minus<00:00:25.890> one<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.490> two-thirds<00:00:27.029> now<00:00:27.240> there's

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
minus one in two-thirds now there's

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.570 
minus one in two-thirds now there's
something<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.109> stands<00:00:28.859> out<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.099> me<00:00:29.279> that

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
something that stands out to me that

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.690 
something that stands out to me that
should<00:00:29.789> stand<00:00:30.000> out<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.599> as<00:00:30.779> well<00:00:31.460> when<00:00:32.460> I

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
should stand out to you as well when I

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.180 
should stand out to you as well when I
try<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.180> start<00:00:33.540> my<00:00:33.719> problem<00:00:34.230> my<00:00:34.469> denominators

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
try to start my problem my denominators

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.110 
try to start my problem my denominators
are<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.370> same<00:00:35.510> but<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.750> can't<00:00:37.200> take<00:00:37.670> 2/3<00:00:38.670> away

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
are the same but I can't take 2/3 away

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.069 
are the same but I can't take 2/3 away
from<00:00:39.390> 1/3<00:00:40.129> all<00:00:41.129> right<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.579> fraction<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.719> much

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
from 1/3 all right this fraction is much

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.490 
from 1/3 all right this fraction is much
is<00:00:43.320> smaller<00:00:44.160> than<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.149> fraction<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.289> there's

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
is smaller than this fraction so there's

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.220 
is smaller than this fraction so there's
something<00:00:46.680> we<00:00:46.950> need<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.280> do<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.760> order<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.600> help

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
something we need to do in order to help

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.110 
something we need to do in order to help
us<00:00:49.410> out<00:00:49.530> with<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.860> problem<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.550> want<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.030> to

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
us out with this problem I want you to

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.209 
us out with this problem I want you to
think<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.780> regular<00:00:52.199> subtraction<00:00:52.440> problem

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
think of a regular subtraction problem

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:00.770 
think of a regular subtraction problem
let's<00:00:53.940> say<00:00:54.180> we<00:00:54.360> had<00:00:54.600> 72<00:00:55.789> minus<00:00:56.789> 48<00:00:59.300> okay<00:01:00.300> as<00:01:00.480> you

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
let's say we had 72 minus 48 okay as you

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.660 
let's say we had 72 minus 48 okay as you
look<00:01:00.989> at<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.559> should<00:01:01.800> notice<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.399> you

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
look at this you should notice that you

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.820 
look at this you should notice that you
can't<00:01:02.910> take<00:01:03.090> away<00:01:03.149> 8<00:01:03.570> from<00:01:03.809> 2<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.530> what<00:01:04.739> would

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
can't take away 8 from 2 so what would

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.070 
can't take away 8 from 2 so what would
we<00:01:04.979> normally<00:01:05.159> do<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:06.090> would<00:01:06.299> borrow<00:01:06.600> from<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
we normally do we would borrow from the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.600 
we normally do we would borrow from the
7<00:01:08.810> now<00:01:09.810> that's<00:01:10.590> basically<00:01:10.860> what<00:01:11.400> we're<00:01:11.549> gonna

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
7 now that's basically what we're gonna

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.600 
7 now that's basically what we're gonna
be<00:01:11.850> doing<00:01:12.210> with<00:01:12.600> these<00:01:12.990> mixed<00:01:13.680> numbers<00:01:14.130> all

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
be doing with these mixed numbers all

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.399 
be doing with these mixed numbers all
right<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.880> don't<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.330> enough<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.930> my<00:01:16.110> fraction

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
right I don't have enough of my fraction

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.490 
right I don't have enough of my fraction
here<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.430> take<00:01:17.640> away<00:01:18.000> take<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.600> away<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.140> I'm

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
here to take away take this away so I'm

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.080 
here to take away take this away so I'm
gonna<00:01:19.619> borrow<00:01:20.009> from<00:01:20.340> my<00:01:20.580> whole<00:01:20.790> number<00:01:21.240> so

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
gonna borrow from my whole number so

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.300 
gonna borrow from my whole number so
basically<00:01:24.090> I'm<00:01:24.360> borrowing<00:01:24.689> one<00:01:25.170> whole<00:01:25.530> from

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
basically I'm borrowing one whole from

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.020 
basically I'm borrowing one whole from
this<00:01:26.520> 2<00:01:27.049> now<00:01:28.049> we're<00:01:28.710> gonna<00:01:28.860> rename<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.970> one

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
this 2 now we're gonna rename this one

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.280 
this 2 now we're gonna rename this one
whole<00:01:30.630> as<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.640> fraction<00:01:32.640> okay<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.780> couple<00:01:34.049> of

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
whole as a fraction okay so a couple of

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.510 
whole as a fraction okay so a couple of
ways<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:35.150> rename<00:01:36.150> one<00:01:36.509> whole<00:01:37.320> as<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.890> fraction

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
ways to rename one whole as a fraction

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:48.480 
ways to rename one whole as a fraction
would<00:01:38.700> be<00:01:39.950> two<00:01:40.950> halves<00:01:43.909> three<00:01:44.909> thirds

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.850 

5/5<00:01:49.490> okay<00:01:49.910> all<00:01:50.000> of<00:01:50.300> those<00:01:50.480> are<00:01:50.840> equal<00:01:51.350> to<00:01:51.620> one

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
5/5 okay all of those are equal to one

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.250 
5/5 okay all of those are equal to one
in<00:01:52.130> fraction<00:01:52.970> form<00:01:53.560> so<00:01:54.560> I'm<00:01:54.920> gonna<00:01:55.280> pick<00:01:55.580> a

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
in fraction form so I'm gonna pick a

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.290 
in fraction form so I'm gonna pick a
fraction<00:01:57.260> that<00:01:57.650> is<00:01:57.860> equal<00:01:58.250> to<00:01:58.430> one<00:01:58.670> that<00:01:59.240> is

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
fraction that is equal to one that is

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.360 
fraction that is equal to one that is
compatible<00:01:59.960> with<00:02:00.320> three<00:02:00.800> which<00:02:00.980> means<00:02:01.220> it

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
compatible with three which means it

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.790 
compatible with three which means it
works<00:02:01.580> with<00:02:01.820> it<00:02:01.970> easily<00:02:02.240> all<00:02:02.930> right<00:02:03.080> so<00:02:03.620> we

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
works with it easily all right so we

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.500 
works with it easily all right so we
probably<00:02:04.100> want<00:02:04.610> three<00:02:05.000> is<00:02:05.120> our<00:02:05.270> denominator

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
probably want three is our denominator

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.480 
probably want three is our denominator
so<00:02:06.170> I'm<00:02:06.380> gonna<00:02:06.650> choose<00:02:07.090> three<00:02:08.090> thirds<00:02:09.460> so<00:02:10.460> I

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
so I'm gonna choose three thirds so I

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.530 
so I'm gonna choose three thirds so I
changed<00:02:11.060> my<00:02:11.210> one<00:02:11.540> whole<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:12.620> three<00:02:12.950> thirds<00:02:13.540> now

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
changed my one whole to three thirds now

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.230 
changed my one whole to three thirds now
I'm<00:02:14.780> gonna<00:02:14.960> add<00:02:15.320> that<00:02:15.710> three<00:02:16.040> thirds<00:02:16.370> to<00:02:17.000> what

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
I'm gonna add that three thirds to what

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.060 
I'm gonna add that three thirds to what
we<00:02:17.360> already<00:02:17.570> have<00:02:17.900> what<00:02:18.560> do<00:02:18.620> we<00:02:18.740> already<00:02:18.890> have

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
we already have what do we already have

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.000 
we already have what do we already have
in<00:02:19.550> this<00:02:20.180> mixed<00:02:20.540> number<00:02:20.570> we<00:02:21.380> already<00:02:21.800> have

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
in this mixed number we already have

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.330 
in this mixed number we already have
one-third<00:02:22.970> so<00:02:23.870> I<00:02:24.200> am<00:02:24.380> going<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.830> add<00:02:25.360> one-third

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
one-third so I am going to add one-third

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.220 
one-third so I am going to add one-third
what<00:02:28.340> we<00:02:28.459> already<00:02:28.640> have<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.209> then<00:02:29.900> I'm<00:02:30.050> going

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
what we already have and then I'm going

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.670 
what we already have and then I'm going
to<00:02:30.320> add<00:02:30.530> this<00:02:31.010> three<00:02:31.400> thirds<00:02:31.810> or<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:33.320> one

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
to add this three thirds or that one

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.930 
to add this three thirds or that one
whole<00:02:34.420> we<00:02:35.420> borrowed<00:02:35.930> from<00:02:36.140> over<00:02:36.920> here<00:02:37.250> when<00:02:37.910> I

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
whole we borrowed from over here when I

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.660 
whole we borrowed from over here when I
add<00:02:38.180> those<00:02:38.450> together<00:02:38.750> I<00:02:39.260> get<00:02:39.940> four<00:02:41.080> thirds<00:02:42.670> so

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
add those together I get four thirds so

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.280 
add those together I get four thirds so
basically<00:02:44.120> what<00:02:44.390> I've<00:02:44.510> done<00:02:44.720> is<00:02:44.990> I've

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
basically what I've done is I've

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.220 
basically what I've done is I've
converted<00:02:45.740> two<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.490> one-third<00:02:47.050> into<00:02:48.050> the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
converted two and one-third into the

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.580 
converted two and one-third into the
mixed<00:02:48.890> number<00:02:49.250> one<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:50.110> four<00:02:51.110> thirds<00:02:51.530> and

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
mixed number one and four thirds and

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.750 
mixed number one and four thirds and
what<00:02:54.590> that<00:02:54.739> allows<00:02:55.040> me<00:02:55.070> to<00:02:55.400> do<00:02:55.550> is<00:02:55.580> it<00:02:55.970> makes<00:02:56.000> my

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
what that allows me to do is it makes my

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.280 
what that allows me to do is it makes my
fraction<00:02:58.760> on<00:02:58.880> this<00:02:59.030> side<00:02:59.269> large<00:02:59.720> enough<00:03:00.050> so

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
fraction on this side large enough so

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.190 
fraction on this side large enough so
that<00:03:00.320> I<00:03:00.680> can<00:03:00.920> subtract<00:03:01.400> 2/3<00:03:02.060> from<00:03:02.420> it<00:03:02.570> now<00:03:03.170> I

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
that I can subtract 2/3 from it now I

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.949 
that I can subtract 2/3 from it now I
can<00:03:03.680> subtract<00:03:04.370> as<00:03:04.670> normal<00:03:05.320> 4/3<00:03:06.320> minus<00:03:06.860> 2/3<00:03:07.610> is

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
can subtract as normal 4/3 minus 2/3 is

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.780 
can subtract as normal 4/3 minus 2/3 is
2/3<00:03:10.420> one<00:03:11.420> minus<00:03:11.810> one<00:03:11.989> is<00:03:12.050> zero<00:03:12.430> 2/3<00:03:13.430> is<00:03:13.640> in

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
2/3 one minus one is zero 2/3 is in

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:21.990 
2/3 one minus one is zero 2/3 is in
simplest<00:03:14.239> form<00:03:14.360> so<00:03:15.290> that<00:03:15.590> is<00:03:15.890> my<00:03:16.610> answer<00:03:16.640> now

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.370 

there's<00:03:23.000> one<00:03:23.180> more<00:03:23.209> thing<00:03:23.690> I<00:03:23.900> want<00:03:24.110> to<00:03:24.200> show

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
there's one more thing I want to show

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.170 
there's one more thing I want to show
you<00:03:24.440> as<00:03:24.830> far<00:03:25.220> as<00:03:25.450> renaming<00:03:27.550> let's<00:03:28.550> say<00:03:28.760> we<00:03:28.970> have

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
you as far as renaming let's say we have

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.960 
you as far as renaming let's say we have
the<00:03:29.450> whole<00:03:29.630> number<00:03:30.080> 7<00:03:30.980> and<00:03:31.160> we're<00:03:31.760> subtracting

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
the whole number 7 and we're subtracting

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.210 
the whole number 7 and we're subtracting
a<00:03:32.480> mixed<00:03:32.780> number<00:03:32.930> from<00:03:33.290> that<00:03:33.530> let's<00:03:33.830> say<00:03:34.130> 2<00:03:35.090> and

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
a mixed number from that let's say 2 and

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.220 
a mixed number from that let's say 2 and
2/3

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.220 

now<00:03:41.860> if<00:03:42.310> I<00:03:42.550> was<00:03:42.760> to<00:03:42.910> stack<00:03:43.180> these<00:03:43.420> as<00:03:43.690> I<00:03:43.720> should

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
now if I was to stack these as I should

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.540 
now if I was to stack these as I should
I<00:03:44.470> should<00:03:44.620> have<00:03:45.129> seven<00:03:45.730> minus<00:03:47.220> two<00:03:48.220> and

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
I should have seven minus two and

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:55.080 
I should have seven minus two and
two-thirds<00:03:52.950> what<00:03:53.950> you<00:03:54.099> should<00:03:54.370> be<00:03:54.550> noticing

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
two-thirds what you should be noticing

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.800 
two-thirds what you should be noticing
at<00:03:55.269> this<00:03:55.569> point<00:03:55.900> is<00:03:56.170> that<00:03:56.680> I<00:03:57.330> don't<00:03:58.330> have<00:03:58.690> a

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
at this point is that I don't have a

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.199 
at this point is that I don't have a
fraction<00:03:59.349> part<00:03:59.650> for<00:03:59.950> my<00:04:00.099> whole<00:04:00.280> number<00:04:00.670> time

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
fraction part for my whole number time

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.960 
fraction part for my whole number time
for<00:04:01.810> this<00:04:01.959> seven<00:04:02.380> so<00:04:03.010> what<00:04:03.190> I<00:04:03.220> need<00:04:03.310> to<00:04:03.459> do<00:04:03.700> is<00:04:03.880> I

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
for this seven so what I need to do is I

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.030 
for this seven so what I need to do is I
need<00:04:04.030> to<00:04:04.150> create<00:04:04.569> a<00:04:04.720> fraction<00:04:05.110> part<00:04:05.620> which

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
need to create a fraction part which

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.550 
need to create a fraction part which
will<00:04:06.250> allow<00:04:06.519> me<00:04:06.550> to<00:04:06.760> subtract<00:04:07.420> 2/3<00:04:08.140> from<00:04:08.349> it

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
will allow me to subtract 2/3 from it

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.100 
will allow me to subtract 2/3 from it
basically<00:04:09.370> we<00:04:09.580> have<00:04:09.730> no<00:04:09.910> fraction<00:04:10.540> so<00:04:10.840> we<00:04:10.959> need

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
basically we have no fraction so we need

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.320 
basically we have no fraction so we need
to<00:04:11.260> create<00:04:11.470> a<00:04:11.709> fraction<00:04:12.040> so<00:04:12.910> what<00:04:13.090> I'm<00:04:13.180> gonna

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
to create a fraction so what I'm gonna

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.890 
to create a fraction so what I'm gonna
do<00:04:13.599> is<00:04:13.870> borrow<00:04:14.530> from<00:04:14.920> my<00:04:15.400> 7<00:04:15.849> once<00:04:16.540> again<00:04:16.780> I'm

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
do is borrow from my 7 once again I'm

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.080 
do is borrow from my 7 once again I'm
gonna<00:04:17.079> borrow<00:04:17.380> one<00:04:17.680> whole<00:04:17.979> so<00:04:18.729> that's<00:04:18.910> gonna

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
gonna borrow one whole so that's gonna

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.980 
gonna borrow one whole so that's gonna
leave<00:04:19.359> me<00:04:19.570> with<00:04:19.769> 6<00:04:20.970> so<00:04:21.970> I<00:04:22.000> borrow<00:04:22.419> one<00:04:22.720> whole

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
leave me with 6 so I borrow one whole

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.129 
leave me with 6 so I borrow one whole
and<00:04:23.229> I<00:04:23.590> want<00:04:23.800> to<00:04:23.889> think<00:04:24.100> of<00:04:24.280> a<00:04:24.700> whole<00:04:25.090> that<00:04:25.479> is

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
and I want to think of a whole that is

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.230 
and I want to think of a whole that is
equal<00:04:28.020> to<00:04:29.020> one<00:04:29.680> whole<00:04:29.919> that<00:04:30.580> is<00:04:30.760> compatible

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
equal to one whole that is compatible

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.260 
equal to one whole that is compatible
with<00:04:32.040> two-thirds<00:04:33.040> that<00:04:33.310> works<00:04:33.580> well<00:04:33.910> with<00:04:33.940> it

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
with two-thirds that works well with it

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.360 
with two-thirds that works well with it
the<00:04:34.930> one<00:04:35.110> I<00:04:35.139> can<00:04:35.410> think<00:04:35.440> of<00:04:35.770> that<00:04:36.190> would

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
the one I can think of that would

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.150 
the one I can think of that would
probably<00:04:36.580> work<00:04:36.910> best<00:04:37.389> is<00:04:37.690> 3/3<00:04:38.620> because<00:04:39.010> the

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
probably work best is 3/3 because the

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.260 
probably work best is 3/3 because the
denominators<00:04:39.790> are<00:04:39.820> the<00:04:39.940> same

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
denominators are the same

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.570 
denominators are the same
and<00:04:40.510> when<00:04:41.139> denominators<00:04:41.830> are<00:04:41.979> the<00:04:42.010> same<00:04:42.100> we

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
and when denominators are the same we

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.390 
and when denominators are the same we
know<00:04:43.380> that<00:04:44.380> things<00:04:44.680> are<00:04:44.800> a<00:04:44.830> little<00:04:44.979> bit<00:04:45.190> easier

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
know that things are a little bit easier

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:54.920 
know that things are a little bit easier
so<00:04:46.210> I'm<00:04:46.419> gonna<00:04:46.690> change<00:04:47.050> this<00:04:49.020> 7<00:04:50.020> to<00:04:50.440> 6<00:04:50.889> and<00:04:51.690> 3/3

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.370 

okay<00:04:55.960> 3/3<00:04:56.680> give<00:04:56.950> me<00:04:57.190> one<00:04:57.460> I<00:04:57.729> add<00:04:58.090> 1<00:04:58.450> plus<00:04:58.750> 6<00:04:59.080> and

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
okay 3/3 give me one I add 1 plus 6 and

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.200 
okay 3/3 give me one I add 1 plus 6 and
I<00:04:59.740> get<00:04:59.979> 7<00:05:00.430> so<00:05:00.820> basically<00:05:01.270> it<00:05:01.750> has<00:05:02.020> a<00:05:02.050> value<00:05:02.440> of<00:05:02.650> 7

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
I get 7 so basically it has a value of 7

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.840 
I get 7 so basically it has a value of 7
it's<00:05:04.210> just<00:05:04.479> written<00:05:04.660> in<00:05:04.840> a<00:05:04.930> different<00:05:05.080> way<00:05:05.380> and

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
it's just written in a different way and

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.560 
it's just written in a different way and
then<00:05:06.850> I'm<00:05:07.150> going<00:05:07.570> to<00:05:07.750> subtract<00:05:08.430> 2<00:05:09.430> and<00:05:09.789> 2/3

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
then I'm going to subtract 2 and 2/3

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.060 
then I'm going to subtract 2 and 2/3
from<00:05:10.900> that<00:05:11.169> and<00:05:11.500> now<00:05:12.400> my<00:05:12.840> fraction<00:05:13.840> for<00:05:14.650> my<00:05:14.800> top

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
from that and now my fraction for my top

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.950 
from that and now my fraction for my top
number<00:05:15.100> is<00:05:15.639> large<00:05:15.940> enough<00:05:16.240> so<00:05:16.450> that<00:05:16.479> I<00:05:16.660> can

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
number is large enough so that I can

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.290 
number is large enough so that I can
subtract<00:05:17.470> so<00:05:18.160> once<00:05:18.370> again<00:05:18.520> I<00:05:18.700> think<00:05:18.880> of<00:05:19.090> it<00:05:19.210> as

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
subtract so once again I think of it as

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.750 
subtract so once again I think of it as
two<00:05:19.510> separate<00:05:19.870> problems<00:05:20.110> I<00:05:20.560> have<00:05:21.130> 3<00:05:21.430> thirds

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
two separate problems I have 3 thirds

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.850 
two separate problems I have 3 thirds
minus<00:05:22.210> 2/3<00:05:22.750> which<00:05:23.260> gives<00:05:23.530> me<00:05:24.240> 1/3<00:05:25.240> I<00:05:25.530> have<00:05:26.530> 6

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
minus 2/3 which gives me 1/3 I have 6

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.240 
minus 2/3 which gives me 1/3 I have 6
minus<00:05:27.190> 2<00:05:27.490> which<00:05:28.180> is<00:05:28.419> for<00:05:28.780> the<00:05:29.530> fraction<00:05:30.039> part

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
minus 2 which is for the fraction part

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.710 
minus 2 which is for the fraction part
of<00:05:30.310> my<00:05:30.400> mixed<00:05:30.669> number<00:05:30.940> is<00:05:31.060> in<00:05:31.210> simplest<00:05:31.599> form

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
of my mixed number is in simplest form

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.590 
of my mixed number is in simplest form
so<00:05:32.530> this<00:05:32.740> is<00:05:32.889> my<00:05:33.070> answer<00:05:33.490> in<00:05:34.410> simplest<00:05:35.410> form
