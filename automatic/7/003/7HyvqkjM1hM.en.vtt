00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.240 
us do and it's just a question of doing
a<00:01:33.840> deal<00:01:33.990> with<00:01:34.170> one<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.409> those<00:01:34.500> companies<00:01:34.920> and

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
a deal with one of those companies and

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.899 
a deal with one of those companies and
let's<00:01:35.880> not<00:01:35.970> forget<00:01:36.090> America<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.290> biggest

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
let's not forget America is the biggest

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.609 
let's not forget America is the biggest
market<00:01:38.909> for<00:01:39.150> virtually<00:01:39.570> every<00:01:39.720> car<00:01:40.259> company

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
market for virtually every car company

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.560 
market for virtually every car company
in<00:01:40.770> Formula<00:01:41.189> One<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:42.090> know<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.240> think

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
in Formula One so you know I think

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.060 
in Formula One so you know I think
there's<00:01:42.750> gonna<00:01:42.840> be<00:01:43.020> some<00:01:43.170> interest<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.770> u.s.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
there's gonna be some interest in u.s.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.639 
there's gonna be some interest in u.s.

quantum shocks yeah but yeah we we often

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.590 
quantum shocks yeah but yeah we we often
talked<00:02:12.030> about<00:02:12.239> doing<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.629> team<00:02:12.840> right

would like to do it which basically
means<00:02:19.690> scunt<00:02:20.620> works<00:02:20.860> you<00:02:21.610> know<00:02:21.730> that<00:02:21.970> that<00:02:22.300> you

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
means scunt works you know that that you

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.930 
means scunt works you know that that you
remember<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.170> old<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.950> top<00:02:24.340> secret<00:02:24.730> lucky

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
division sure yeah but that ran very

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.510 
division sure yeah but that ran very
very<00:02:28.330> minimum<00:02:29.320> number<00:02:29.680> of<00:02:29.710> the<00:02:29.980> best<00:02:30.250> people

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
very minimum number of the best people

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.370 
very minimum number of the best people
you<00:02:30.670> could<00:02:30.910> get<00:02:31.210> and<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:32.050> just<00:02:32.200> kept

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
you could get and and just kept

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.720 
you could get and and just kept
everything<00:02:32.560> lean<00:02:32.830> and<00:02:33.010> mean<00:02:33.160> well<00:02:33.460> that<00:02:33.580> was

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
everything lean and mean well that was

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.190 
everything lean and mean well that was
always<00:02:33.910> our<00:02:34.120> concept<00:02:34.600> for<00:02:34.690> doing<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:34.900> Formula

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
always our concept for doing a Formula

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.560 
always our concept for doing a Formula
One<00:02:35.320> team<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.790> whilst<00:02:36.790> we<00:02:37.120> were<00:02:37.240> in<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.390> boom

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
One team and whilst we were in a boom

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.300 
One team and whilst we were in a boom
period<00:02:38.020> and<00:02:38.200> was<00:02:38.440> money<00:02:38.680> falling<00:02:38.920> out<00:02:39.130> of<00:02:39.160> the

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
period and was money falling out of the

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.490 
period and was money falling out of the
sky<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.970> hundreds<00:02:40.960> of<00:02:41.050> millions<00:02:41.350> of<00:02:41.440> dollars

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
sky and hundreds of millions of dollars

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.260 
sky and hundreds of millions of dollars
being<00:02:41.890> spent<00:02:41.950> in<00:02:42.160> Formula<00:02:42.490> One<00:02:42.610> we<00:02:43.120> were

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
being spent in Formula One we were

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.310 
being spent in Formula One we were
always<00:02:43.390> going<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.660> get<00:02:43.750> laughed<00:02:43.990> out<00:02:44.140> of<00:02:44.200> court

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
always going to get laughed out of court

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.140 
always going to get laughed out of court
probably<00:02:44.770> we'd<00:02:45.340> stood<00:02:45.550> up<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:45.760> said<00:02:45.880> look<00:02:46.030> we

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
probably we'd stood up and said look we

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.240 
probably we'd stood up and said look we
can<00:02:46.300> do<00:02:46.390> a<00:02:46.420> team<00:02:46.690> very<00:02:46.870> differently<00:02:47.350> but<00:02:48.070> now

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
can do a team very differently but now

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.250 
can do a team very differently but now
guess<00:02:48.520> what<00:02:48.730> you<00:02:49.060> know<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.360> recession<00:02:49.900> kind

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
guess what you know the recession kind

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.740 
guess what you know the recession kind
of<00:02:50.410> makes<00:02:50.620> us<00:02:50.860> look<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.400> little<00:02:51.880> bit<00:02:52.150> more

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
of makes us look a little bit more

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.270 
of makes us look a little bit more
acceptable<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:53.500> I<00:02:53.560> think<00:02:53.770> Formula<00:02:54.160> One

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
acceptable and I think Formula One

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.730 
acceptable and I think Formula One
people<00:02:54.580> now<00:02:54.760> actually<00:02:55.540> think<00:02:55.840> wow<00:02:56.110> these<00:02:56.410> you

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
people now actually think wow these you

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.900 
people now actually think wow these you
know<00:02:56.860> this<00:02:57.010> is<00:02:57.130> an<00:02:57.250> interesting<00:02:57.430> program<00:02:57.700> I

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
know this is an interesting program I

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.040 
know this is an interesting program I
had<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.060> phone<00:02:58.270> call<00:02:58.390> today<00:02:58.540> from<00:02:58.630> one<00:02:58.900> of<00:02:58.930> the

had a phone call today from one of the

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.350 
had a phone call today from one of the

Daytona that had been created in 30 days
out<00:03:13.090> of<00:03:13.180> whole<00:03:13.330> cloth<00:03:13.360> a<00:03:13.720> million<00:03:13.960> bucks<00:03:14.970> there

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
out of whole cloth a million bucks there

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.000 
out of whole cloth a million bucks there
is<00:03:16.060> this<00:03:16.180> window<00:03:16.450> of<00:03:16.570> opportunity<00:03:17.200> created<00:03:17.560> by

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010

the economic downturn yeah always

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.450 
the economic downturn yeah always
remembering<00:03:20.500> that<00:03:20.650> formula<00:03:21.070> one<00:03:21.220> is<00:03:21.400> a

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
remembering that formula one is a

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.610 
remembering that formula one is a
technical<00:03:22.060> sport<00:03:22.480> by<00:03:22.630> definition<00:03:23.050> because<00:03:23.470> in

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
technical sport by definition because in

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.530 
technical sport by definition because in
order<00:03:23.740> to<00:03:24.040> race<00:03:24.400> you've<00:03:24.760> got<00:03:24.970> a<00:03:25.000> design<00:03:25.360> and

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
order to race you've got a design and

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.850 
order to race you've got a design and
build<00:03:25.690> your<00:03:25.750> own<00:03:25.840> car<00:03:26.140> you<00:03:26.320> can't<00:03:26.500> just<00:03:26.620> buy<00:03:26.830> a

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
build your own car you can't just buy a

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.110 
build your own car you can't just buy a
car<00:03:27.160> off<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.400> shelf<00:03:27.610> that's<00:03:27.790> what<00:03:27.940> it<00:03:28.030> was

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
car off the shelf that's what it was

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.030 
car off the shelf that's what it was
what<00:03:28.450> makes<00:03:28.720> Formula<00:03:29.110> One<00:03:29.200> so<00:03:29.410> difficult<00:03:29.860> for

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
what makes Formula One so difficult for

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.070 
what makes Formula One so difficult for
new<00:03:30.340> teams<00:03:30.640> and<00:03:30.850> new<00:03:30.910> people<00:03:31.090> as<00:03:31.420> I<00:03:31.480> say<00:03:31.630> can
