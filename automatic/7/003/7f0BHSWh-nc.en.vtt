00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.930 
Turtles before the series went off to
Ubisoft<00:02:11.170> now<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.260> one<00:02:12.530> thing<00:02:12.830> we<00:02:13.459> have<00:02:13.790> to

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
Ubisoft now the one thing we have to

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.309 
Ubisoft now the one thing we have to
really<00:02:14.180> get<00:02:14.270> into<00:02:14.540> is<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.780> plot<00:02:15.020> of<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.290> game

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
really get into is the plot of the game

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.979 
really get into is the plot of the game
now<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.250> plot<00:02:16.670> is<00:02:16.940> kind<00:02:17.450> of<00:02:17.690> hard<00:02:17.870> to

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
now the plot is kind of hard to

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.670 
now the plot is kind of hard to
understand<00:02:18.739> but<00:02:19.540> battle<00:02:20.540> Nexus<00:02:20.989> was<00:02:21.379> based

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
understand but battle Nexus was based

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.460 
understand but battle Nexus was based
off<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.069> season<00:02:22.310> 2<00:02:22.610> of<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.879> show<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.470> mutant

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
off the season 2 of the show and mutant

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.010 
off the season 2 of the show and mutant
nightmare<00:02:24.860> was<00:02:25.010> based<00:02:25.190> off<00:02:25.430> of<00:02:25.510> season<00:02:26.510> 3<00:02:26.780> and

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
nightmare was based off of season 3 and

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.070 
nightmare was based off of season 3 and
um<00:02:27.800> there<00:02:28.760> was<00:02:28.940> another<00:02:29.300> game<00:02:29.630> we're<00:02:29.930> not

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
um there was another game we're not

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.780 
um there was another game we're not
reviewing<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:30.680> we<00:02:30.860> don't<00:02:31.040> have<00:02:31.310> that<00:02:31.340> it's

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
reviewing it we don't have that it's

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.980 
reviewing it we don't have that it's
based<00:02:32.090> off<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:32.450> season

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
based off the season

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.050 
based off the season
one<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.860> graphics<00:02:34.220> are<00:02:34.340> similar<00:02:34.760> in<00:02:34.940> all

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
one and the graphics are similar in all

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.330 
one and the graphics are similar in all
the<00:02:35.210> games<00:02:35.450> but<00:02:36.050> in<00:02:36.260> battle<00:02:36.590> Nexus<00:02:37.010> we<00:02:37.160> did

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
the games but in battle Nexus we did

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.950 
the games but in battle Nexus we did
notice<00:02:37.580> a<00:02:37.970> slight<00:02:38.240> improvement<00:02:38.840> in<00:02:38.900> the

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
notice a slight improvement in the

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.380 
notice a slight improvement in the
graphics<00:02:39.440> because<00:02:39.590> we<00:02:40.430> played<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.670> demo<00:02:40.880> of<00:02:41.060> it

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
graphics because we played a demo of it

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.630 
graphics because we played a demo of it
but<00:02:42.080> in<00:02:42.320> the<00:02:42.860> third<00:02:43.100> one<00:02:43.280> there's<00:02:43.460> no

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
but in the third one there's no

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.590 
but in the third one there's no
improvement<00:02:43.820> at<00:02:44.180> all<00:02:44.360> now<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:46.370> plot<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:47.000> kind

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
improvement at all now the plot is kind

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.180 
improvement at all now the plot is kind
of<00:02:47.780> hard<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.110> understand<00:02:48.620> as<00:02:48.740> i<00:02:48.830> said<00:02:49.040> before

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
of hard to understand as i said before

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.180 
of hard to understand as i said before
but<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.570> plot<00:02:50.780> is<00:02:50.960> basically<00:02:51.530> you're<00:02:51.890> trying

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
but the plot is basically you're trying

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.390 
but the plot is basically you're trying
to<00:02:52.280> save<00:02:52.460> the<00:02:52.790> earth<00:02:53.090> that's<00:02:53.810> it<00:02:54.130> it's<00:02:55.130> that

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
to save the earth that's it it's that

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.180 
to save the earth that's it it's that
it's<00:02:55.850> kind<00:02:56.210> of<00:02:56.420> hard<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:57.290> understand<00:02:57.830> as<00:02:58.070> i

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
it's kind of hard to understand as i

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.310 
it's kind of hard to understand as i
said<00:02:58.430> before<00:02:58.550> too<00:02:58.940> but<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.840> plot<00:03:00.050> just

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
said before too but the plot just

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.900 
said before too but the plot just
underwhelming<00:03:01.100> it<00:03:01.250> just<00:03:01.490> really<00:03:01.790> doesn't

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
underwhelming it just really doesn't

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.350 
underwhelming it just really doesn't
suit<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:02.600> game<00:03:02.780> that<00:03:03.050> well<00:03:03.290> and<00:03:03.530> I<00:03:04.340> when<00:03:05.330> we

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
suit the game that well and I when we

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.970 
suit the game that well and I when we
played<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:05.720> game<00:03:06.020> for<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.320> first<00:03:06.590> time<00:03:06.800> the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
played the game for the first time the

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.620 
played the game for the first time the
first<00:03:07.010> mission<00:03:07.520> is<00:03:07.850> you<00:03:08.210> have<00:03:08.300> to<00:03:08.420> save

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
first mission is you have to save

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.990 
first mission is you have to save
grandma<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:09.350> that<00:03:09.860> is<00:03:10.100> tied<00:03:10.430> into<00:03:10.580> a<00:03:10.700> plot

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
grandma and that is tied into a plot

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.820 
grandma and that is tied into a plot
where<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:11.210> have<00:03:11.360> to<00:03:11.480> save<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.960> earth<00:03:11.990> I<00:03:12.410> mean

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
where you have to save the earth I mean

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.740 
where you have to save the earth I mean
it<00:03:12.920> just<00:03:13.040> doesn't<00:03:13.370> make<00:03:13.430> sense<00:03:13.490> yeah<00:03:14.390> and<00:03:14.570> you

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.930 
it just doesn't make sense yeah and you
never<00:03:15.110> knew<00:03:15.500> who<00:03:15.680> grandma<00:03:16.040> was<00:03:16.250> like<00:03:16.640> who<00:03:16.820> they

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 
hard to do because like everybody's
