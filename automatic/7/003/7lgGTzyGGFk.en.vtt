00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.690 

so<00:00:00.690> as<00:00:00.780> we<00:00:00.900> all<00:00:00.930> know<00:00:01.230> biking<00:00:02.159> is<00:00:02.280> all<00:00:02.429> about

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
so as we all know biking is all about

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.880 
so as we all know biking is all about
movement<00:00:03.240> and<00:00:03.360> this<00:00:04.170> means<00:00:04.410> we<00:00:04.620> tend<00:00:04.830> to

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
movement and this means we tend to

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.000 
movement and this means we tend to
travel<00:00:05.279> pretty<00:00:05.520> lightweight<00:00:06.649> sometimes<00:00:07.649> we

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
travel pretty lightweight sometimes we

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.339 
travel pretty lightweight sometimes we
might<00:00:08.160> travel<00:00:08.429> too<00:00:08.760> lightweight<00:00:09.080> so<00:00:10.080> this<00:00:10.200> is

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
might travel too lightweight so this is

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.049 
might travel too lightweight so this is
just<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.650> quick<00:00:10.860> video<00:00:11.219> showing<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.910> what<00:00:12.030> I

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
just a quick video showing you what I

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.180 
just a quick video showing you what I
think<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.719> essential<00:00:13.080> kit<00:00:13.500> for<00:00:13.769> us<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:14.009> take

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
think is essential kit for us to take

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.400 
think is essential kit for us to take
when<00:00:14.429> we<00:00:14.460> go<00:00:14.670> biking<00:00:14.960> no<00:00:15.960> matter<00:00:16.170> where<00:00:16.379> that

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
when we go biking no matter where that

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.500 
when we go biking no matter where that
might<00:00:16.830> be

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
might be

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.630 
might be
so<00:00:18.510> for<00:00:18.690> going<00:00:18.900> cycling<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.500> would<00:00:19.859> recommend<00:00:20.400> a
