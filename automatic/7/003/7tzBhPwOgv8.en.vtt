00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.330
 hello i'm alexander ultin from web studio 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.940
 hangar site.ru today we will talk about 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.500
 testing often business beginners 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.230
 sell your product online 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.910
 faced with what tools 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.100
 far from perfect 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.529
 tell on the trainings the price of traffic 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.570
 It turns out high conversion low in 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.630
 the result is the cost of attracting a client 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.859
 goes beyond the clouds as they usually do 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.109
 in this case 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.239
 Well, of course, consult with friends 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.160
 listen to individual customers watching 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.950
 random webmaster visit 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.190
 and the worst thing to do from this conclusion 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.440
 and this is completely wrong no 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.260
 visitor customer director and designer 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.140
 can't exactly know which one 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.969
 change will improve to 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.980
 get reliable data what 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.110
 changes needed on the site 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.000
 use abe tests 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.359
 It is a powerful tool to increase 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.820
 conversion what is its essence the whole flow 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.159
 visitors are usually divided into two equal 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.290
 groups each of which are shown 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.320
 different options for pages or individual 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.110
 elements then we consider conversions 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.760
 different goals after finding out which of 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.790
 better options we put it like 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.710
 the main rest I throw out then 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.170
 repeat all these steps until the final 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.229
 the result will not satisfy us at all 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.580
 You can change the text on the site headers 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.820
 and color images and layout 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.189
 special effects elements and even pages 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.979
 wholly what is the most expensive but 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.020
 often very effective of 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.060
 existing abe testing services 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.790
 often emit optima if u see 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.460
 website optimizer as well as constructors 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.159
 landings of type l baked razer and lp 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.020
 cloud, we prefer when everything 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.030
 analytical tools are in 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.189
 one place so we use 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.380
 manually written java script code and 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.899
 Yandex metric for analyzing results 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.439
 testing let's look at 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.439
 practice 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.150
 this come down nehru dot py we made for 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.409
 company producing exclusive 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.110
 accessories 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.209
 wallets of expensive wood they 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.610
 compact and beautiful exquisite and 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.480
 functional immediately go and buy 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.480
 imagine 1 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.570
 Our customers have suggested that purchases on 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.180
 The site will increase if it is brighter 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.680
 video on the first screen 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.110
 therefore, they did not take my word for it 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.090
 did abe test option yes you already 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.090
 Seen and here option after 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.330
 how is technically implemented 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.069
 mechanism of both testing with probability 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.010
 50 percent to the user is shown 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.780
 one or another version of the page and data about 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.030
 volume which version he was shown 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.849
 are transferred to Yandex metric so that we 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.530
 could see the result as usual i 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.970
 wrote a script for you which is yours 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.459
 the programmer can use to 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.970
 introductions both test link under 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.209
 video 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.140
 let's look at our results 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.200
 go in the content 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.769
 parameters of visits and click on the name 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.690
 We are interested in quantity in our test. 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.690
 person in testing groups 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:48.019
 memorize them push targets 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:51.590
 video 1 and remember their respective 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.750
 number of video views and most 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.180
 the main thing we do the same with the amount 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.970
 applications how to set up goals I told 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.379
 In the video about Yandex metric, we are 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.030
 must use 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.099
 confidence calculator about and 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.410
 testing otherwise you can cheat 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.389
 we are insufficient data 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.060
 specially created such a calculator for 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:13.010
 you so like Russian 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.489
 services there is no link to the calculator under 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.070
 video 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.380
 enter the data we remember and 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.690
 we see that the new version gave 54 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.150
 percent more views and wins 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.340
 with certainty one hundred percent of the case with 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.070
 applications new version gave on 29 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.160
 percent more bids but authenticity 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:34.190
 gaining only 75 percent which is lower 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.200
 95 percent threshold so far too early 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.450
 conclusions need to pour more 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.970
 traffic to reach this threshold 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.280
 I specifically chose this example to 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.789
 show at what point you can bring 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.860
 the results of abe testing for today 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:51.470
 I hope this video was useful to you 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.419
 like and subscribe to the channel 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.470
 just do not forget to share this video 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.870

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.700
 it might be useful for you 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.550
 there will always be not only that 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.790
 reached try test 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:07.060
 strive to stay hungry for everyone 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.060
 until 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.960
 but 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.060
 and in winter
