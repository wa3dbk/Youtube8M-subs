don't have BPA in our product what about
the<00:03:55.150> five<00:03:55.330> gallon<00:03:55.510> jugs<00:03:56.280> I'm<00:03:57.280> not<00:03:57.610> sure<00:03:57.850> about

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
the five gallon jugs I'm not sure about

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.600 
the five gallon jugs I'm not sure about
those<00:03:58.210> this<00:03:58.720> family<00:03:59.170> is<00:03:59.860> an<00:04:00.340> industrial

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
those this family is an industrial

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.520 
those this family is an industrial
chemical<00:04:01.030> that's<00:04:01.390> in<00:04:01.600> big<00:04:02.260> 5-gallon<00:04:03.100> jugs

chemical that's in big 5-gallon jugs

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.930 
chemical that's in big 5-gallon jugs
my<00:04:05.530> concern<00:04:05.920> is<00:04:06.040> that<00:04:06.070> the<00:04:06.250> FDA<00:04:06.520> doesn't<00:04:06.730> want

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
my concern is that the FDA doesn't want

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.490 
my concern is that the FDA doesn't want
us<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.150> ask<00:04:07.300> about<00:04:07.450> BPA<00:04:07.900> because<00:04:08.260> of<00:04:08.380> the

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
us to ask about BPA because of the

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.380 
us to ask about BPA because of the
current<00:04:08.770> investigation<00:04:09.460> can<00:04:10.030> you<00:04:10.150> talk<00:04:10.360> about

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
current investigation can you talk about

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.930 
current investigation can you talk about
it<00:04:10.690> now<00:04:10.840> yeah<00:04:11.230> if<00:04:11.980> I'd<00:04:12.190> known<00:04:12.490> you<00:04:12.670> were<00:04:12.700> gonna

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
it now yeah if I'd known you were gonna

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.880 
it now yeah if I'd known you were gonna
talk<00:04:13.210> about<00:04:13.270> that<00:04:13.780> probably<00:04:14.620> when<00:04:14.740> they've

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
talk about that probably when they've

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:21.509 
talk about that probably when they've
given<00:04:15.100> you<00:04:15.160> the<00:04:15.310> interview<00:04:20.070> what's<00:04:21.070> happening
