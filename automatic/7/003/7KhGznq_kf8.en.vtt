this<00:00:07.470> whole<00:00:07.680> thing<00:00:07.919> is<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:08.160> typical<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:08.880> think<00:00:09.120> we

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
this whole thing is a typical I think we

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.209 
this whole thing is a typical I think we
have<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.480> much<00:00:09.900> better<00:00:10.110> feel<00:00:10.469> for<00:00:10.920> what's<00:00:11.130> going

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
have a much better feel for what's going

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.610 
have a much better feel for what's going
on<00:00:11.550> now<00:00:11.820> then<00:00:12.120> certainly<00:00:12.690> we<00:00:12.780> did<00:00:13.019> on<00:00:13.139> februari

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
on now then certainly we did on februari

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.970 
on now then certainly we did on februari
20th<00:00:14.009> this<00:00:14.460> will<00:00:14.639> give<00:00:14.790> me<00:00:14.820> real<00:00:15.210> time

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
20th this will give me real time

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.840 
20th this will give me real time
coordinates<00:00:16.980> for<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.279> point<00:00:17.580> right<00:00:17.789> here

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
coordinates for this point right here

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.800 
coordinates for this point right here
we're<00:00:18.510> mapping<00:00:19.609> we're<00:00:20.609> drilling<00:00:20.939> we're<00:00:21.570> doing

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
we're mapping we're drilling we're doing

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.560 
we're mapping we're drilling we're doing
test<00:00:22.050> pits<00:00:22.320> we're<00:00:23.220> just<00:00:23.430> basically<00:00:23.670> creating

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
test pits we're just basically creating

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.679 
test pits we're just basically creating
an<00:00:24.750> underground<00:00:25.490> map<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.970> what's<00:00:27.240> happening

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
an underground map of what's happening

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.690 
an underground map of what's happening
right<00:00:27.869> now<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.260> have<00:00:28.470> about<00:00:28.769> 500<00:00:29.189> feet<00:00:29.550> of

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
right now we have about 500 feet of

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.479 
right now we have about 500 feet of
affected<00:00:32.700> roadway<00:00:33.739> but<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.829> active<00:00:35.190> part<00:00:35.430> of

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
affected roadway but the active part of

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.790 
affected roadway but the active part of
the<00:00:35.579> slide<00:00:35.880> at<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.270> base<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.780> 1,200<00:00:37.739> feet<00:00:37.860> wide

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
the slide at the base is 1,200 feet wide

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.470 
the slide at the base is 1,200 feet wide
so<00:00:40.800> if<00:00:41.160> you're<00:00:41.280> moving<00:00:41.610> 1,200<00:00:42.149> feet<00:00:42.300> of

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
so if you're moving 1,200 feet of

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.150 
so if you're moving 1,200 feet of
something<00:00:42.750> at<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.899> bottom<00:00:43.320> eventually<00:00:44.010> you

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
something at the bottom eventually you

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.920 
something at the bottom eventually you
could<00:00:44.280> get<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.760> or<00:00:44.940> maybe<00:00:45.120> more<00:00:45.420> at<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.660> top

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
could get that or maybe more at the top

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.600 
could get that or maybe more at the top
now<00:00:46.289> we<00:00:46.350> don't<00:00:46.590> know<00:00:46.710> what<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:46.950> risk<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.489> it

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
now we don't know what that risk is it

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.270 
now we don't know what that risk is it
could<00:00:47.789> be<00:00:47.879> very<00:00:47.910> low<00:00:48.510> or<00:00:49.140> could<00:00:49.500> be<00:00:49.530> moderate

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
could be very low or could be moderate

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.369 
could be very low or could be moderate
but<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:50.910> do<00:00:51.090> know<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.809> active<00:00:52.140> area

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
but we do know that in the active area

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.840 
but we do know that in the active area
we<00:00:52.530> do<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> high<00:00:53.010> potential<00:00:53.370> first<00:00:53.670> at

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
we do have a high potential first at

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.670 
we do have a high potential first at
least<00:00:53.910> some<00:00:54.120> additional<00:00:54.690> road<00:00:55.199> damage

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
least some additional road damage

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.889 
least some additional road damage
because<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.699> very<00:00:56.730> deep<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.629> shears

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
because this is very deep the shears

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.240 
because this is very deep the shears
here<00:00:58.260> are<00:00:58.469> at<00:00:58.739> depths<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.609> about<00:01:00.170> 105<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.410> 125

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
here are at depths of about 105 to 125

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.520 
here are at depths of about 105 to 125
feet<00:01:02.489> most<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.270> shears<00:01:03.539> are<00:01:03.899> expanding

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
feet most of the shears are expanding

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.810 
feet most of the shears are expanding
through<00:01:04.799> what<00:01:05.070> we<00:01:05.159> call<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.489> Chinle

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
through what we call the Chinle

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.840 
through what we call the Chinle
formation<00:01:06.420> it's<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:07.590> varies<00:01:08.070> but<00:01:08.369> part<00:01:08.790> of

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
formation it's it varies but part of

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.480 
formation it's it varies but part of
that<00:01:08.909> chinle<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> very<00:01:10.170> kind<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.189> plastic

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
that chinle is a very kind of plastic

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.359 
that chinle is a very kind of plastic
clay<00:01:12.450> that's<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.290> bad<00:01:13.439> actor<00:01:13.830> here<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.280> have

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
clay that's the bad actor here you have

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.520 
clay that's the bad actor here you have
bedrock<00:01:14.850> that's<00:01:15.299> being<00:01:15.780> dragged<00:01:16.290> down<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
bedrock that's being dragged down the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.370 
bedrock that's being dragged down the
hill<00:01:16.890> but<00:01:17.159> it's<00:01:17.340> riding<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:17.820> these<00:01:17.939> thin<00:01:18.380> gooey

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
hill but it's riding on these thin gooey

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.520 
hill but it's riding on these thin gooey
fat<00:01:20.130> clays<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:21.420> biggest<00:01:21.780> thing<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.229> to

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
fat clays the biggest thing is to

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.030 
fat clays the biggest thing is to
determine<00:01:23.070> if<00:01:23.549> we<00:01:23.670> can<00:01:24.479> keep<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.290> road<00:01:25.470> here

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
determine if we can keep the road here

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.399 
determine if we can keep the road here
if<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.400> can<00:01:26.549> fix<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.000> here<00:01:27.420> or<00:01:27.540> what<00:01:27.930> we<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.229> do

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
if we can fix it here or what we can do

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.920 
if we can fix it here or what we can do
if<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.159> shears<00:01:29.490> are<00:01:29.700> too<00:01:29.880> deep<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.390> tells<00:01:30.600> us

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
if the shears are too deep it tells us

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.960 
if the shears are too deep it tells us
that<00:01:31.259> we<00:01:31.560> have<00:01:31.710> certain<00:01:32.009> options<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.579> terms<00:01:32.610> of

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
that we have certain options in terms of

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.680 
that we have certain options in terms of
trying<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.360> fix<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.720> slope

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
trying to fix the slope

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.110 
trying to fix the slope
we've<00:01:36.690> drilled<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.350> total<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.860> 17<00:01:38.400> holes<00:01:38.670> we

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
we've drilled a total of 17 holes we

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.060 
we've drilled a total of 17 holes we
started<00:01:39.480> off<00:01:39.630> by<00:01:39.930> drilling<00:01:40.470> 10<00:01:40.830> holes

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
started off by drilling 10 holes

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.730 
started off by drilling 10 holes
actually<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> road<00:01:41.790> with<00:01:42.090> ardor<00:01:42.390> rig

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
actually in the road with ardor rig

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.350 
actually in the road with ardor rig
installed<00:01:43.740> inclinometers<00:01:44.580> in<00:01:45.000> all<00:01:45.150> of<00:01:45.270> those

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
installed inclinometers in all of those

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.960 
installed inclinometers in all of those
holes<00:01:45.660> then<00:01:46.410> the<00:01:46.590> next<00:01:46.740> stage<00:01:47.040> we<00:01:47.550> started

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
holes then the next stage we started

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.720 
holes then the next stage we started
drilling<00:01:48.270> holes<00:01:48.630> down<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.710> slide<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.340> up

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
drilling holes down in the slide and up

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.390 
drilling holes down in the slide and up
above<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.420> road<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:51.930> we've<00:01:52.470> got<00:01:52.680> now<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.950> crux

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
above the road so we've got now the crux

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.180 
above the road so we've got now the crux
drills<00:01:53.730> which<00:01:53.970> are<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:54.270> track<00:01:54.540> drills<00:01:55.190> we've

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
drills which are the track drills we've

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.650 
drills which are the track drills we've
got<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.340> helicopter<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.880> we're<00:01:57.120> using<00:01:57.330> to

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
got a helicopter that we're using to

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.200 
got a helicopter that we're using to
move<00:01:58.020> them<00:01:58.200> around<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.950> they<00:01:59.610> can<00:01:59.820> put<00:02:00.030> that

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
move them around and they can put that

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.970

do<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.390> then<00:02:09.540> the<00:02:09.810> great<00:02:09.990> thing<00:02:10.170> about<00:02:10.200> them

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
do and then the great thing about them

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.960 
do and then the great thing about them
is<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.830> they<00:02:11.100> get<00:02:11.310> pretty<00:02:11.520> much<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.760> hundred

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
is that they get pretty much a hundred

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.120 
is that they get pretty much a hundred

and<00:03:00.930> what<00:03:01.860> what<00:03:02.310> comes<00:03:02.550> back<00:03:02.790> up<00:03:03.060> tells<00:03:03.450> us

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
and what what comes back up tells us

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.620 
and what what comes back up tells us
basically<00:03:04.560> if<00:03:04.890> there's<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.190> shear<00:03:05.520> along<00:03:06.180> that

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
basically if there's a shear along that

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.650 
basically if there's a shear along that
cable<00:03:07.020> at<00:03:07.110> some<00:03:07.350> depth<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.890> so<00:03:08.820> we're<00:03:09.510> using

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
cable at some depth and so we're using

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.479 
cable at some depth and so we're using
all<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:10.200> information<00:03:10.350> to<00:03:10.950> kind<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.250> map

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
all of that information to kind of map

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.720 
all of that information to kind of map

what's going on underneath
we're<00:03:15.360> coming<00:03:15.780> up<00:03:15.870> with<00:03:15.989> alternatives

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
we're coming up with alternatives

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.550 
we're coming up with alternatives
basically<00:03:17.220> right<00:03:17.400> now<00:03:17.550> we<00:03:18.090> would<00:03:18.239> like<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.840> try

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
basically right now we would like to try

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.949 
basically right now we would like to try
to<00:03:19.620> keep<00:03:19.769> this<00:03:19.920> alignment<00:03:20.340> in<00:03:21.090> its<00:03:21.360> current

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
to keep this alignment in its current

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.890 
to keep this alignment in its current
configuration<00:03:22.440> as<00:03:23.099> much<00:03:23.280> as<00:03:23.430> possible<00:03:23.610> but<00:03:24.420> we

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
configuration as much as possible but we

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.570 
configuration as much as possible but we
do<00:03:25.260> need<00:03:25.500> to<00:03:25.530> have<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:26.069> entire<00:03:26.159> picture

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
do need to have the entire picture
