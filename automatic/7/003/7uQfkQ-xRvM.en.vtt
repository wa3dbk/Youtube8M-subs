00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
to make sure that they're not bent so on

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.390 
to make sure that they're not bent so on
the<00:00:19.230> main<00:00:19.380> shaft<00:00:19.560> here<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:19.980> can<00:00:20.099> see<00:00:20.220> I'm<00:00:20.340> just

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
the main shaft here you can see I'm just

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.220 
the main shaft here you can see I'm just
rolling<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.060> back<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.419> forth<00:00:21.599> on<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> glass

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230

surface something that's smooth and flat
and<00:00:26.009> you're<00:00:26.099> looking<00:00:26.369> for<00:00:26.579> wobble<00:00:27.000> or

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:27.239 
and you're looking for wobble or

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:29.510 
and you're looking for wobble or
vibration<00:00:27.899> as<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.290> roll<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.099> as<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.430> can

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
vibration as you roll it and as you can

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.249 
vibration as you roll it and as you can
see<00:00:29.579> here<00:00:29.849> I'm<00:00:29.939> just<00:00:30.149> using<00:00:30.329> a<00:00:30.629> kitchen<00:00:31.020> scale

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
see here I'm just using a kitchen scale

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.220 
see here I'm just using a kitchen scale
that<00:00:32.189> has<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.369> nice<00:00:32.610> flat<00:00:32.969> glass<00:00:33.570> surface

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
that has a nice flat glass surface

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.569 
that has a nice flat glass surface
I<00:00:34.260> also<00:00:34.860> liked<00:00:35.129> to<00:00:35.850> slip<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.239> inside<00:00:36.629> the

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
I also liked to slip it inside the

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.250 
I also liked to slip it inside the
bearing<00:00:38.579> blocks<00:00:38.820> again<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.450> then<00:00:39.719> spin<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.140> by

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
bearing blocks again and then spin it by

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.349 
bearing blocks again and then spin it by
hand<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:41.309> make<00:00:41.550> sure<00:00:41.699> that<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.969> don't<00:00:42.179> see

00:00:42.349 --> 00:00:42.359 
hand and just make sure that I don't see

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:45.410 
hand and just make sure that I don't see
any<00:00:42.510> wobble<00:00:43.019> in<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.949> in<00:00:44.429> the<00:00:44.699> shaft<00:00:45.059> at<00:00:45.300> all

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
any wobble in the in the shaft at all

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.290 
any wobble in the in the shaft at all
and<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:47.010> also<00:00:47.249> is<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.519> good<00:00:47.670> way<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.850> check<00:00:48.179> the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
and this also is a good way to check the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.700 
and this also is a good way to check the
bearings<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.809> make<00:00:48.960> sure<00:00:49.109> that<00:00:49.230> they're<00:00:49.440> still

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
bearings to make sure that they're still

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.880 
bearings to make sure that they're still
in<00:00:49.890> good<00:00:50.039> shape<00:00:50.100> still<00:00:50.670> smooth<00:00:50.969> no<00:00:51.210> grinding

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
in good shape still smooth no grinding

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.619 
in good shape still smooth no grinding
after<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.980> crash<00:00:53.249> so<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.089> can<00:00:54.300> take<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.479> you

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
after the crash so you can take it you

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.509 
after the crash so you can take it you
can<00:00:54.719> flip<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.079> over<00:00:55.319> make<00:00:56.010> sure<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.309> check

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
can flip it over make sure you check

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.209 
can flip it over make sure you check
both<00:00:56.729> sides<00:00:57.199> and<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.409> just<00:00:58.769> give<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.100> good

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
both sides and just just give it a good

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.559 
both sides and just just give it a good
check<00:00:59.429> and<00:00:59.640> make<00:00:59.760> sure<00:00:59.789> but<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.179> feel<00:01:00.420> pretty

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:00.569 
check and make sure but I feel pretty

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:02.899 
check and make sure but I feel pretty
confident<00:01:01.139> that<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.440> main<00:01:01.679> shaft<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:02.339> still

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
confident that this main shaft is still

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.440 
confident that this main shaft is still
in<00:01:03.089> good<00:01:03.239> shape<00:01:04.610> so<00:01:05.610> as<00:01:05.940> far<00:01:06.150> as<00:01:06.210> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
in good shape so as far as the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.750 
in good shape so as far as the
feathering<00:01:06.780> shaft<00:01:07.170> goes<00:01:07.500> one<00:01:08.159> easy<00:01:08.460> way<00:01:08.700> to

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
feathering shaft goes one easy way to

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.690 
feathering shaft goes one easy way to
tell<00:01:09.030> if<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.600> bent<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.580> before<00:01:11.580> you

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
tell if it is bent is before you

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.950 
tell if it is bent is before you
disassemble<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.390> head<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.720> take<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
disassemble the head and take the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.680 
disassemble the head and take the
feather<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.350> shaft<00:01:13.590> out<00:01:13.860> just<00:01:14.730> stick<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.210> hex

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
feather and shaft out just stick a hex

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.180 
feather and shaft out just stick a hex
driver<00:01:15.990> onto<00:01:16.500> one<00:01:16.710> end<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.360> while<00:01:18.360> holding<00:01:18.690> it

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
driver onto one end and while holding it

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.130 
driver onto one end and while holding it
turn<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.430> hex<00:01:20.670> driver<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.300> basically<00:01:21.840> you'll

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
turn the hex driver and basically you'll

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.360 
turn the hex driver and basically you'll
see<00:01:22.440> how<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:25.200> two<00:01:25.410> blade<00:01:25.740> grip<00:01:26.010> ball

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
see how the the two blade grip ball

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.730 
see how the the two blade grip ball
links<00:01:26.880> will<00:01:27.150> move<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:28.110> relation<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.560> one

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
links will move in relation to one

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.280 
links will move in relation to one
another<00:01:29.010> if<00:01:29.280> they're<00:01:29.760> moving<00:01:30.180> like<00:01:30.330> that<00:01:30.570> that

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
another if they're moving like that that

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.060 
another if they're moving like that that
means<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.800> the<00:01:32.130> feathering<00:01:32.460> shaft<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:33.120> bent

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
means that the feathering shaft is bent

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.100 
means that the feathering shaft is bent

the<00:01:37.980> forum's<00:01:38.340> there<00:01:38.520> early<00:01:38.910> I<00:01:38.940> think<00:01:39.300> was

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
the forum's there early I think was

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.050 
the forum's there early I think was
posting<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:41.000> crash<00:01:43.400> thread<00:01:44.400> on<00:01:44.670> what<00:01:44.940> to<00:01:45.030> look

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
posting a crash thread on what to look

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.870 
posting a crash thread on what to look
for<00:01:45.390> after<00:01:45.690> crash<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.230> he<00:01:46.290> shared<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.430> I

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
for after crash and he shared this and I

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.950 
for after crash and he shared this and I
thought<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.120> was<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.270> really<00:01:48.480> cool<00:01:48.750> way<00:01:48.930> to

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
thought it was a really cool way to

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.620 
thought it was a really cool way to
check<00:01:49.440> it<00:01:49.590> out<00:01:49.730> made<00:01:50.730> perfect<00:01:51.120> sense<00:01:51.150> and<00:01:51.510> as

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
check it out made perfect sense and as

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.170 
check it out made perfect sense and as
you<00:01:51.750> can<00:01:51.840> see<00:01:52.220> really<00:01:53.220> does<00:01:53.400> indicate<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.120> I

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
you can see really does indicate that I

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.500 
you can see really does indicate that I
have<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.390> bent<00:01:54.660> feathering<00:01:55.140> shaft<00:01:56.270> of<00:01:57.270> course

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
have a bent feathering shaft of course

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.970 
have a bent feathering shaft of course
just<00:01:57.690> like<00:01:57.840> we<00:01:57.990> do<00:01:58.110> with<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.260> main<00:01:58.470> shaft<00:01:58.710> we

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
just like we do with the main shaft we

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.550 
just like we do with the main shaft we
can<00:01:59.130> also<00:01:59.280> put<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.790> feathering<00:02:00.330> shaft<00:02:00.690> onto

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
can also put the feathering shaft onto

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.320 
can also put the feathering shaft onto
that<00:02:01.680> flat<00:02:02.040> glass<00:02:02.370> surface<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.150> can

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
that flat glass surface and you can

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.649 
that flat glass surface and you can
really<00:02:03.570> see<00:02:03.930> how<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.320> thing<00:02:04.530> wobbles<00:02:05.659> pretty

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
really see how that thing wobbles pretty

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.399 
really see how that thing wobbles pretty
easy<00:02:06.870> to<00:02:07.110> tell<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.890> bent<00:02:08.869> so<00:02:09.869> if<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:10.409 
easy to tell that that is bent so if the

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:12.649 
easy to tell that that is bent so if the
if<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.340> first<00:02:11.580> trick<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.909> showed<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.300> doesn't

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:12.659 
if the first trick I showed you doesn't

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:16.280 
if the first trick I showed you doesn't
make<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:12.870> obvious<00:02:13.400> then<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.580> solution<00:02:15.269> is<00:02:15.450> to

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
make it obvious then the solution is to

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.320 
make it obvious then the solution is to
also<00:02:17.540> use<00:02:18.540> this<00:02:19.040> this<00:02:20.040> flat

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
also use this this flat

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.840 
also use this this flat
rolling<00:02:22.230> on<00:02:22.350> glass<00:02:22.680> method<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:25.850> definitely

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
rolling on glass method so definitely

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.160 
rolling on glass method so definitely
will<00:02:27.030> be<00:02:27.120> getting<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.420> new<00:02:27.540> feathering<00:02:27.870> shaft

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
will be getting a new feathering shaft

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.000 
will be getting a new feathering shaft
for<00:02:28.440> this<00:02:28.560> helicopter<00:02:29.930> no<00:02:30.930> way<00:02:31.080> around

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
for this helicopter no way around

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.060 
for this helicopter no way around
