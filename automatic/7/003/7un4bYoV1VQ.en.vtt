coming from these trees of course we

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.839 
coming from these trees of course we
started<00:00:19.900> out<00:00:20.020> with<00:00:20.110> just<00:00:20.169> a<00:00:20.410> hand<00:00:20.680> picking<00:00:20.980> we

them up that way rollers everything we
could<00:00:27.039> think<00:00:27.220> of<00:00:27.460> we<00:00:27.970> couldn't<00:00:28.210> afford<00:00:28.300> the

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
could think of we couldn't afford the

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.210 
could think of we couldn't afford the
big<00:00:28.810> heavy<00:00:29.019> industrial<00:00:29.650> equipment<00:00:30.039> that<00:00:30.189> a

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
big heavy industrial equipment that a

big heavy industrial equipment that a
lot<00:00:30.519> of<00:00:30.609> the<00:00:30.670> Pickers<00:00:30.939> were<00:00:31.060> using<00:00:31.330> but<00:00:31.449> we

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
lot of the Pickers were using but we

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.360 
lot of the Pickers were using but we
wanted<00:00:31.869> to<00:00:31.929> collect<00:00:32.349> the<00:00:32.559> pecans<00:00:32.860> ourselves

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
low cost we finally found a bag of nut

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.390 
low cost we finally found a bag of nut
which<00:00:41.470> I<00:00:41.620> have<00:00:41.769> right<00:00:41.949> here<00:00:42.010> I'm<00:00:42.220> going<00:00:42.339> to

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
show you that my bag of that now is

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.950 
show you that my bag of that now is
about<00:00:44.019> I<00:00:44.920> guess<00:00:45.309> about<00:00:45.489> 10<00:00:45.699> years<00:00:45.850> old<00:00:46.150> what<00:00:46.839> it

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
about I guess about 10 years old what it

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.869 
about I guess about 10 years old what it
basically<00:00:47.110> does<00:00:47.559> is<00:00:47.860> really<00:00:48.159> neat<00:00:48.309> effect<00:00:48.640> it

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
basically does is really neat effect it

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.600 
basically does is really neat effect it
rolls<00:00:49.330> over<00:00:49.540> the<00:00:49.659> pecans<00:00:50.080> the<00:00:50.470> pecans<00:00:51.250> go<00:00:51.460> in

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
rolls over the pecans the pecans go in

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.460 
rolls over the pecans the pecans go in
between<00:00:51.820> the<00:00:52.000> fingers<00:00:52.390> right<00:00:52.510> here<00:00:52.570> and<00:00:53.049> then

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
between the fingers right here and then

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.780 
between the fingers right here and then
they<00:00:53.589> come<00:00:53.739> across<00:00:53.920> in<00:00:54.190> their<00:00:54.339> role<00:00:54.519> in<00:00:54.640> these

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
they come across in their role in these

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.670 
they come across in their role in these
baskets<00:00:55.000> and<00:00:55.449> that's<00:00:55.989> the<00:00:56.140> sense<00:00:56.350> of<00:00:56.439> what<00:00:56.589> the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
baskets and that's the sense of what the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.840 
baskets and that's the sense of what the
back<00:00:56.830> of<00:00:56.979> that<00:00:57.010> does<00:00:57.250> so<00:00:57.339> you<00:00:57.430> have<00:00:57.549> to<00:00:57.640> stop

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
back of that does so you have to stop

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.509 
back of that does so you have to stop
periodically<00:00:58.239> to<00:00:58.960> get<00:00:59.379> the<00:00:59.589> pecans<00:01:00.309> out<00:01:00.460> of

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
periodically to get the pecans out of

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.460 
periodically to get the pecans out of
the<00:01:00.610> basket<00:01:00.790> now<00:01:01.360> one<00:01:01.540> of<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.689> disadvantages

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
the basket now one of the disadvantages

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.560 
the basket now one of the disadvantages
for<00:01:02.650> the<00:01:02.739> maginot<00:01:03.189> that<00:01:03.430> I<00:01:03.460> found<00:01:03.850> is<00:01:04.239> he<00:01:04.420> gets

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
for the maginot that I found is he gets

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.750 
for the maginot that I found is he gets
a<00:01:04.659> lot<00:01:04.780> of<00:01:04.839> leaves<00:01:05.110> and<00:01:05.439> trash<00:01:05.710> that<00:01:06.310> also<00:01:06.460> get

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
a lot of leaves and trash that also get

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.820 
a lot of leaves and trash that also get
caught<00:01:06.909> up<00:01:07.060> with<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.240> pecans<00:01:07.600> so<00:01:07.869> the<00:01:08.560> cleaner

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
caught up with the pecans so the cleaner

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.069 
caught up with the pecans so the cleaner
the<00:01:09.039> ground<00:01:09.310> is<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:10.000> better<00:01:10.539> the<00:01:10.719> pick<00:01:10.899> will

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:11.079 
the ground is the better the pick will

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:12.510 
the ground is the better the pick will
be<00:01:11.109> but<00:01:11.409> of<00:01:11.500> course<00:01:11.740> as<00:01:11.890> you<00:01:11.920> see<00:01:12.159> here<00:01:12.310> we<00:01:12.399> have

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
be but of course as you see here we have

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.240 
be but of course as you see here we have
a<00:01:12.549> lot<00:01:12.700> of<00:01:12.729> cream<00:01:13.090> ground<00:01:13.390> the<00:01:14.229> grasses<00:01:15.070> well

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
a lot of cream ground the grasses well

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.130 
a lot of cream ground the grasses well
mowed<00:01:15.490> not<00:01:16.000> all<00:01:16.179> of<00:01:16.299> our<00:01:16.450> area<00:01:16.780> out<00:01:16.869> here<00:01:17.079> is

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
mowed not all of our area out here is

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.840 
mowed not all of our area out here is
like<00:01:17.320> that<00:01:17.530> but<00:01:18.100> I'm<00:01:18.399> going<00:01:18.490> to<00:01:18.579> show<00:01:18.640> you<00:01:18.670> how

this works on the clean grass this bag

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.489 
this works on the clean grass this bag
anut<00:01:22.060> is<00:01:22.270> just<00:01:22.479> connected<00:01:22.929> to<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.049> back<00:01:23.259> of<00:01:23.439> my

anut is just connected to the back of my
riding<00:01:23.890> mower<00:01:24.070> and<00:01:24.340> that's<00:01:25.149> what<00:01:25.299> I<00:01:25.329> use<00:01:25.630> to

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
riding mower and that's what I use to

00:01:25.659 --> 00:02:21.010 
riding mower and that's what I use to
harvest<00:01:26.049> my<00:01:26.350> pecans<00:01:26.679> so<00:01:26.799> here<00:01:27.070> is<00:01:27.219> the<00:01:27.310> demo

you<00:02:21.560> can<00:02:21.650> tell<00:02:21.830> it<00:02:21.980> takes<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.280> few<00:02:22.460> times<00:02:22.700> around

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
you can tell it takes a few times around

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.150 
you can tell it takes a few times around
to<00:02:23.390> get<00:02:23.930> all<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.200> pecans<00:02:24.560> up<00:02:24.800> and<00:02:24.980> there<00:02:25.070> will

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
to get all the pecans up and there will

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.700 
to get all the pecans up and there will
be<00:02:25.190> a<00:02:25.250> few<00:02:25.490> left<00:02:25.640> on<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:25.910> ground<00:02:26.120> it's<00:02:26.330> not

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
be a few left on the ground it's not

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.840 
be a few left on the ground it's not
100%<00:02:27.710> but<00:02:27.860> I<00:02:27.920> would<00:02:28.220> say<00:02:28.370> gets<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.700> majority

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
100% but I would say gets the majority

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.270 
100% but I would say gets the majority
of<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.300> pecans<00:02:29.630> up<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:30.650> I<00:02:30.680> just<00:02:31.130> basically

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
driving a circles around all my trees I

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.820 
driving a circles around all my trees I
do<00:02:34.550> run<00:02:34.880> with<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.120> blade<00:02:35.330> on<00:02:35.570> this<00:02:36.410> is<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:36.680> blow

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
do run with the blade on this is to blow

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.440 
do run with the blade on this is to blow
any<00:02:37.100> of<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.310> leaves<00:02:37.520> and<00:02:37.700> trash<00:02:37.940> so<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.240> helps
