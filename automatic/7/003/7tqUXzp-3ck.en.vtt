00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.630
 hello welcome to the section 

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:06.250
 mechanical tips hobby vote today 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.769
 let's play a song a little bit more 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.240
 technical because good everyone is 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.300
 worry about the tires more or less 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.460
 wide because we have some people 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.609
 Well, ask, we can not ride 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.890
 wider tires is what improves 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.450
 has in the mountain the wide tire you 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.560
 you know what 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:30.670
 any motorcycle or a cbr 600 simonton 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:34.000
 180 the same bike that runs moto2 rides 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:37.360
 a 200 because that increase 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.300
 it's simple there are several reasons 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.780
 but you know that one is clear that is the 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.920
 work surface a wide tire 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.720
 It has a large work surface 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.540
 then a wide tire that gives me 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.020
 grip romea much grip and this flu 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.770
 allows to open before 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.750
 it's fantastic fantastic 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:02.750
 well something else that is the case well there 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.750
 an explanation a motorcycle that has to 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.810
 going very fast through a curve makes it 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.870
 missing a low center of gravity for 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.900
 that is stable because it will be high provokes 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.760
 an instability on the step bike 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.680
 it's very nice to take a curve very 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.380
 fast and that the bike starts to move 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.140
 do not find the stability point of 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.200
 the center of gravity lying under 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.340
 Well yes that allows you in this case that 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.990
 control the angle of the 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.690
 tilt not the bike is controlled very 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.930
 ok problem that the bikes with something of 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.180
 and a bass take more tend to knock 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.220
 much more to seek balance almost 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.190
 He knocked down more and I need a tire 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.979
 wider at the end you do not look for the 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.259
 wider tire because yes but 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.420
 because the evolution of the motorcycle and 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.210
 chassis has allowed one more bend step 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.160
 fast that has forced to lower the 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.290
 hundreds of gravity a little and that has 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.149
 forced to ride a wider tire 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.880
 because otherwise you can not make the step of 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.460
 fast curve 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.979
 a ball 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.560
 but once arrived at khedira it is good 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.240
 up to here quite right there is a 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.840
 factor plus that is the factor that you 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.730
 I want to talk about motorcycles by default 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.760
 they are like cars rear-wheel drive 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.000
 because while they are surviving you adore 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.340
 they get inside the curve always always 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.129
 a motorbike when there are always graves 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.680
 effect we do not have a lying angle and 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:32.230
 we have a centrifugal force that 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.810
 wants to draw from the centripetal force 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.920
 made by the dough that wants to put me 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.560
 that centripetal force depends on a 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.629
 factor x that is how I move the center 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.470
 of gravity in this case I do know that being 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:50.140
 this tire 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.710
 that we have here when I tumble 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.330
 OK 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.630
 I have displaced the center of gravity 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.090
 some distance from what good in 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.430
 actually the original calculations is 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.800
 over the center of the bike but you do not 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.640
 you must calculate with respect to the point of 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.250
 tire support 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.290
 which is smaller in this case this 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.140
 displacement at some time this 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.350
 tire or this this motorcycle get 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.810
 to balance a certain angle of 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.850
 lying down we will reach a balance between 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.880
 Centrifugal and centripetal force 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.040
 some force to help us if not what 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.840
 we call it the push thrust thrust 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.590
 of rope that occurs in all 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.690
 tires but that is higher in the 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.690
 rear tire because it 's a lot 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.610
 wider the rear tire in 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.880
 reality when it supports with the ground it 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.640
 deforms and generates a flat support a 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.580
 Flat support band is worth passing 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.350
 this support, well, if I give you a 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.840
 tire supported here and we look at it 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:55.260
 regarding a center what I have is a 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:59.010
 cone is a cone with the support makes 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.130
 of cone is worth making a cone when I 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.110
 the shot turns on itself and that's the 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.330
 effect that produces one more tire 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.830
 width 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:12.770
 a greater pivot effect against more 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.440
 width plus piloting effect is to say 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.230
 that the ass of the motorcycle actually 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.170
 I wanted to get inside the curve 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:25.340
 this is not bad is not a force that is 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:27.890
 adds to the centripetal force and that we 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.160
 it helps that the centrifugal force does not 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:33.620
 take out or let's say it allows us to make a 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.440
 small step of faster curve in this 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:40.260
 case is worth before we are expelled 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.750
 another good feature is like this is a 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.150
 cone and you all know what you can have 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.640
 already tried to throw a wheel and see 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.569
 how it gets to spin on itself is 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.639
 a cone will go on itself 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:54.279
 what happens is that the outside of the 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:56.770
 cone not as has a support a base of 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:59.319
 support or flat is greater than the part 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.139
 interior that makes skid again 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:04.330
 there is a continuous skid because a 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.520
 part of the crisis wheel faster and the 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.909
 another does not let this skid itself 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.770
 it's bad because it causes temperature and that 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:14.229
 the tire is warm and grip 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.619
 improves the grip let's say a 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:20.080
 10% of that skid is good and beyond 

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:22.599
 of this then it would not be so good 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.729
 well when we go back to the beginning it's good 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:27.939
 ride a wider tire men and 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:30.159
 the rim allows you to ride it I do not 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:32.740
 I would say no that you could not ride is 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:35.529
 Of course you're going to improve traction 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.950
 You have more support on the floor you can 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:40.720
 open before and the effect 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.080
 the bump thrust is going to be a bit 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.569
 bigger if it's going to get better 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.250
 this is fantastic but be careful that you 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:50.580
 change the way you drive the bike 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:53.380
 change at that moment and you to what is 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.880
 used to go 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.200
 it might not be what you 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.090
 find after mounting the 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.000
 tire hence always come out to 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.290
 certain changes of that type is better 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.540
 take a contact with the motorcycle 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.070
 do not go out fast to try to make curves 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.380
 fast if you do not take a 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.510
 initial contact the vehicle is tested 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.760
 does not look is how the way of 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:15.670
 to knock down the widest tire is possible 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:18.400
 knock the bike a little bit more because you 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:21.160
 demands a little more angle and lying down 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.560
 to reach equilibrium it is worth but one 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.140
 once lying down so you'll see what's allowed 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.450
 go faster with the bump thrust 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.610
 be careful that when you go with tires a 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.710
 slightly lower pressure also happens 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.540
 this is only that the tire a 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.610
 little lower pressure you to the 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.290
 feeling that the grip is better and is 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:41.020
 for this because when going lower than 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:43.720
 The footprint is greater and you have more 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.820
 cone effect the cone is larger with 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:49.270
 that the force that wants to get you inside 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:51.280
 of the curve is also greater is a great 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.140
 advantage of motorcycles because 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.910
 always the natural tendency once in 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.460
 once inside the curve because a 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:59.440
 motorcycle when it goes straight wants straight what 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.610
 it costs to center it but when it enters its 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.129
 natural tendency is 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.689
 inside do not leave in this case 

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:07.539
 we can associate the front tire 

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:08.650
 simple as it is very narrow would be better 

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:10.330
 talk about other effects the tire 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.520
 forward like those drift angles 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.349
 that some other day we'll talk about 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.230
 them up here the program today and 

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:18.420
 until next week 

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:20.340
