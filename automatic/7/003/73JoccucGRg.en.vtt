00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:11.129 
levels of the solution rooms that the

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:13.700 
levels of the solution rooms that the
ugly<00:05:11.520> Ethel<00:05:11.819> is<00:05:11.939> called<00:05:12.240> and<00:05:12.509> if<00:05:13.289> you<00:05:13.469> go<00:05:13.650> to

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:17.069 
circle the rocks the cups of times

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:19.070 
circle the rocks the cups of times
you'll<00:05:17.310> probably<00:05:17.460> find<00:05:17.849> about<00:05:18.180> five<00:05:18.509> or<00:05:18.840> six

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
you'll probably find about five or six

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.309 
you'll probably find about five or six
different<00:05:19.259> names<00:05:19.770> in<00:05:20.639> the<00:05:20.759> same<00:05:20.969> spot<00:05:21.389> so<00:05:21.990> it'd

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 
different names in the same spot so it'd

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.140 
different names in the same spot so it'd
be<00:05:22.349> easier<00:05:22.830> to<00:05:22.860> do<00:05:23.129> that<00:05:23.370> instead<00:05:23.669> of<00:05:23.759> going<00:05:23.969> to

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
be easier to do that instead of going to

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.760 
be easier to do that instead of going to
throughout<00:05:24.449> the<00:05:24.509> whole<00:05:24.750> place<00:05:24.990> that's<00:05:25.560> what<00:05:25.680> I

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
throughout the whole place that's what I

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.040 
throughout the whole place that's what I
did<00:05:26.039> and<00:05:26.939> then<00:05:27.120> you<00:05:27.330> can<00:05:27.479> just<00:05:27.629> catch<00:05:27.870> the

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
did and then you can just catch the

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.189 
did and then you can just catch the
unknowns<00:05:28.650> and<00:05:28.830> stuff<00:05:29.069> and<00:05:29.969> let<00:05:30.719> you<00:05:30.810> go<00:05:30.930> tie

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
unknowns and stuff and let you go tie

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.399 
unknowns and stuff and let you go tie
sticks<00:05:31.560> to<00:05:31.860> an<00:05:32.009> ox<00:05:32.250> that<00:05:32.629> Duke<00:05:33.629> a<00:05:33.839> part<00:05:34.169> to<00:05:34.259> get

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:34.409 
sticks to an ox that Duke a part to get

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:37.939
