because<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.069> might<00:01:23.220> be<00:01:23.250> actually<00:01:23.759> not

because you might be actually not
feeling<00:01:24.810> great<00:01:24.929> physically<00:01:25.530> or<00:01:25.649> mentally<00:01:25.830> you

feeling great physically or mentally you

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.789 
feeling great physically or mentally you
drained<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:27.179> the<00:01:27.330> confidence<00:01:27.690> somehow<00:01:28.350> gets

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
drained but the confidence somehow gets

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.289 
drained but the confidence somehow gets
you<00:01:28.979> through<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.759> when<00:01:29.940> you<00:01:30.030> don't<00:01:30.179> have

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
you through and when you don't have

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.580 
you through and when you don't have
confidence<00:01:30.720> that's<00:01:31.500> then<00:01:31.740> when<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.950> have<00:01:32.130> to

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
confidence that's then when you have to

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.109 
confidence that's then when you have to
sort<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.679> trust<00:01:35.069> all<00:01:35.399> the<00:01:35.520> hard<00:01:35.729> work<00:01:35.909> you've

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
sort of trust all the hard work you've

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.370 
sort of trust all the hard work you've
done<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.569> you<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.840> keep<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.229> working

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
done and you have to keep on working

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.429 
done and you have to keep on working
hard<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.100> success<00:01:38.820> comes<00:01:39.060> back<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:40.020> that's

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
hard so success comes back so that's

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.899 
hard so success comes back so that's
that's<00:01:40.770> when<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.100> becomes<00:01:41.280> tricky<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.789> think

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
that's when it becomes tricky I think

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.969 
that's when it becomes tricky I think
when<00:01:42.240> confidence<00:01:42.750> sort<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.020> totally<00:01:43.740> leaves

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
when confidence sort of totally leaves

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.219 
when confidence sort of totally leaves
you<00:01:44.219> or<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.880> doubt<00:01:45.149> your<00:01:45.509> confidence<00:01:46.049> you

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
pushed through and that was a very

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.040 
pushed through and that was a very
strong<00:02:47.210> generation<00:02:47.900> with<00:02:48.080> Rafa<00:02:48.610> Murray<00:02:49.610> and

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
strong generation with Rafa Murray and

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.080 
strong generation with Rafa Murray and
Djokovic<00:02:51.050> and<00:02:51.340> so<00:02:52.340> playing<00:02:52.580> against<00:02:52.790> them<00:02:52.940> in

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
Djokovic and so playing against them in

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.850 
Djokovic and so playing against them in
the<00:02:53.180> beginning<00:02:53.510> is<00:02:53.630> honestly<00:02:54.200> quite<00:02:54.410> strange

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
the beginning is honestly quite strange

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.530 
the beginning is honestly quite strange
because<00:02:55.220> now<00:02:55.520> here<00:02:55.790> you<00:02:55.940> are<00:02:56.060> sort<00:02:56.360> of<00:02:56.390> the

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
because now here you are sort of the

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.750 
because now here you are sort of the
older<00:02:56.900> guy<00:02:57.050> they<00:02:57.890> kind<00:02:58.100> of<00:02:58.130> look<00:02:58.310> up<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.640> you

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
older guy they kind of look up to you

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.700 
older guy they kind of look up to you
but<00:02:58.940> not<00:02:59.030> quite<00:02:59.360> they<00:02:59.870> but<00:03:00.110> and<00:03:00.380> they<00:03:00.470> want<00:03:00.680> to

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
but not quite they but and they want to

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.620 
but not quite they but and they want to
beat<00:03:00.920> you<00:03:01.130> because<00:03:01.460> I'm<00:03:01.580> not<00:03:01.670> ten<00:03:02.270> years<00:03:02.480> apart

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
beat you because I'm not ten years apart

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.350 
beat you because I'm not ten years apart
with<00:03:03.080> their<00:03:03.260> but<00:03:03.440> sort<00:03:03.620> of<00:03:03.680> only<00:03:03.800> five<00:03:04.100> or<00:03:04.250> six

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
with their but sort of only five or six

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.180 
with their but sort of only five or six
but<00:03:05.360> it<00:03:05.450> is<00:03:05.600> like<00:03:05.810> a<00:03:05.840> new<00:03:06.020> generation<00:03:06.530> and

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
but it is like a new generation and

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.740 
but it is like a new generation and
that's<00:03:07.310> mentally<00:03:08.120> for<00:03:08.270> me<00:03:08.360> was<00:03:08.510> quite<00:03:08.720> a

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
that's mentally for me was quite a

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.390 
that's mentally for me was quite a
challenge<00:03:09.230> just<00:03:09.260> getting<00:03:09.740> over<00:03:09.890> that<00:03:10.130> hurdle

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
challenge just getting over that hurdle

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.240 
challenge just getting over that hurdle
and<00:03:10.850> I<00:03:11.630> think<00:03:11.990> Rafa<00:03:12.380> for<00:03:12.710> that<00:03:12.830> matter<00:03:13.010> because

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
and I think Rafa for that matter because

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.450 
and I think Rafa for that matter because
of<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.550> way<00:03:13.760> he<00:03:13.940> plays<00:03:14.180> with<00:03:14.360> his<00:03:14.420> left-handed

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
of the way he plays with his left-handed

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.160 
of the way he plays with his left-handed
topspin<00:03:16.460> and<00:03:16.640> so<00:03:16.730> forth<00:03:17.000> he<00:03:17.120> is<00:03:17.270> really<00:03:17.600> maybe

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
topspin and so forth he is really maybe

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.010 
topspin and so forth he is really maybe
you<00:03:18.710> know<00:03:18.830> think<00:03:19.580> through<00:03:20.300> my<00:03:20.330> game<00:03:20.660> again

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
you know think through my game again

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.610 
you know think through my game again
what<00:03:21.590> do<00:03:21.740> I<00:03:21.800> need<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.100> change<00:03:22.340> to<00:03:22.700> actually

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
what do I need to change to actually

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.350 
what do I need to change to actually
compete<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:24.860> beat<00:03:25.040> him<00:03:25.280> and<00:03:25.490> he's<00:03:26.090> been<00:03:26.270> the

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
compete and beat him and he's been the

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.620 
compete and beat him and he's been the
most<00:03:26.510> challenging<00:03:27.020> for<00:03:27.050> me<00:03:27.290> probably<00:03:27.680> overall

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
most challenging for me probably overall

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.490 
most challenging for me probably overall
combined<00:03:29.630> was<00:03:29.780> Lleyton<00:03:30.110> Hewitt<00:03:30.290> in<00:03:30.440> the

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
combined was Lleyton Hewitt in the

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.320 
combined was Lleyton Hewitt in the
beginning<00:03:30.830> of<00:03:30.890> my<00:03:31.040> career<00:03:31.370> to<00:03:31.610> play<00:03:31.790> against<00:03:32.120> I

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
beginning of my career to play against I

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.910 
beginning of my career to play against I
read<00:03:32.630> this<00:03:32.750> really<00:03:32.990> interesting<00:03:33.140> article<00:03:33.650> I

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
read this really interesting article I

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.380 
read this really interesting article I
think<00:03:34.130> it<00:03:34.310> was<00:03:34.460> called<00:03:34.640> Federer<00:03:35.120> as<00:03:35.360> a

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
think it was called Federer as a

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.050 
think it was called Federer as a
religious<00:03:35.990> experience<00:03:36.580> it<00:03:37.580> was<00:03:37.700> written<00:03:37.850> by

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
religious experience it was written by

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.330 
religious experience it was written by
the<00:03:38.120> novelist<00:03:38.870> David<00:03:39.110> Foster<00:03:39.650> Wallace<00:03:40.070> and

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
the novelist David Foster Wallace and

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.140 
the novelist David Foster Wallace and
for<00:03:40.670> me

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
for me

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.890 
for me
I<00:03:41.180> think<00:03:41.500> I<00:03:42.500> actually<00:03:43.040> felt<00:03:43.700> that<00:03:44.000> when<00:03:44.390> it<00:03:44.750> was

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
I think I actually felt that when it was

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.220 
I think I actually felt that when it was
a<00:03:44.930> 2007<00:03:45.740> Wimbledon<00:03:45.860> final<00:03:46.430> between<00:03:47.270> you<00:03:47.480> and<00:03:47.750> a

a 2007 Wimbledon final between you and a

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.060 
a 2007 Wimbledon final between you and a
doll<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:49.070> that<00:03:49.430> game<00:03:49.760> was<00:03:50.570> you<00:03:51.410> could<00:03:51.590> see<00:03:51.830> the

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
doll and that game was you could see the

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.750 
doll and that game was you could see the
two<00:03:52.400> very<00:03:53.270> different<00:03:53.540> styles<00:03:53.960> of<00:03:54.350> tennis<00:03:54.860> you

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
two very different styles of tennis you

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.700 
two very different styles of tennis you
know<00:03:55.820> battling<00:03:56.390> it<00:03:56.540> out<00:03:56.630> against<00:03:57.320> each<00:03:57.470> other

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
think I think it was actually the 2008

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.750 
think I think it was actually the 2008
finals<00:04:26.720> in<00:04:26.990> seven<00:04:27.530> we<00:04:27.680> played<00:04:27.920> the<00:04:28.040> best<00:04:28.190> five

finals in seven we played the best five
setter<00:04:29.060> as<00:04:29.210> well<00:04:29.390> and<00:04:29.540> in<00:04:29.690> 2008<00:04:30.260> I<00:04:30.290> lost<00:04:30.620> that

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
setter as well and in 2008 I lost that

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.540 
setter as well and in 2008 I lost that
epic<00:04:31.330> 97<00:04:32.330> I<00:04:32.420> think<00:04:32.630> in<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:32.960> fifth<00:04:33.200> and<00:04:33.470> I<00:04:34.220> think

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
epic 97 I think in the fifth and I think

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.160 
epic 97 I think in the fifth and I think
that's<00:04:34.700> the<00:04:34.880> matter<00:04:35.060> that<00:04:35.330> everybody<00:04:35.900> sort<00:04:36.110> of

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
that's the matter that everybody sort of

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.290 
that's the matter that everybody sort of
still<00:04:36.500> talks<00:04:36.740> about<00:04:36.890> as<00:04:37.580> being<00:04:37.850> that<00:04:38.000> one<00:04:38.210> of

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
still talks about as being that one of

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.880 
still talks about as being that one of
the<00:04:38.390> greatest<00:04:38.600> matches<00:04:38.900> of<00:04:39.170> all<00:04:39.290> time<00:04:39.620> and

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
the greatest matches of all time and

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.100 
the greatest matches of all time and
it's<00:04:40.580> just<00:04:40.820> special<00:04:41.150> being<00:04:41.570> part<00:04:41.840> of<00:04:41.930> that<00:04:41.990> and

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
it's just special being part of that and

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.080 
it's just special being part of that and
you<00:04:42.320> start<00:04:42.680> to<00:04:42.830> feel<00:04:42.860> that<00:04:43.310> once<00:04:43.520> you<00:04:43.700> enter

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
you start to feel that once you enter

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.930 
you start to feel that once you enter
like<00:04:44.120> an<00:04:44.540> epic<00:04:44.840> fourth<00:04:45.260> or<00:04:45.500> fifth<00:04:45.710> set<00:04:46.040> and<00:04:46.310> you

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
like an epic fourth or fifth set and you

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.930 
like an epic fourth or fifth set and you
realize<00:04:47.360> that<00:04:47.390> sort<00:04:48.350> of<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.770> world<00:04:49.010> has<00:04:49.340> you

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
realize that sort of the world has you

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.820 
realize that sort of the world has you
know<00:04:50.060> standing<00:04:50.660> still<00:04:50.840> around<00:04:51.080> you<00:04:51.350> and

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
know standing still around you and

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.380 
know standing still around you and
everybody's<00:04:52.310> now<00:04:52.430> just<00:04:52.700> maybe<00:04:52.820> glued<00:04:53.120> to<00:04:53.270> the

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
everybody's now just maybe glued to the

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.790 
everybody's now just maybe glued to the
TV<00:04:53.540> even<00:04:53.930> though<00:04:54.020> people<00:04:54.260> are<00:04:54.380> doing<00:04:54.650> their

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
TV even though people are doing their

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.360 
TV even though people are doing their
own<00:04:54.830> thing

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
own thing

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.650 
own thing
on<00:04:55.550> the<00:04:55.669> other<00:04:55.760> side<00:04:55.850> of<00:04:56.060> the<00:04:56.120> planet<00:04:56.270> or

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
on the other side of the planet or

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.710 
on the other side of the planet or
elsewhere

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
elsewhere

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.410 
elsewhere
but<00:04:58.020> it<00:04:58.200> felt<00:04:58.530> like<00:04:58.770> that<00:04:58.950> and<00:04:59.310> maybe<00:05:00.180> the

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
but it felt like that and maybe the

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.280 
but it felt like that and maybe the
match<00:05:00.570> should<00:05:00.780> have<00:05:00.900> been<00:05:01.020> in<00:05:01.140> like

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
match should have been in like

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.690 
match should have been in like
interrupted<00:05:01.920> at<00:05:02.010> the<00:05:02.130> end<00:05:02.280> of<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:02.520> match

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
interrupted at the end of the match

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.730 
interrupted at the end of the match
because<00:05:03.000> of<00:05:03.120> darkness<00:05:03.540> but<00:05:03.750> you<00:05:04.470> cannot

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
because of darkness but you cannot

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.320 
because of darkness but you cannot
interrupt<00:05:05.220> that<00:05:05.280> kind<00:05:05.550> of<00:05:05.640> match<00:05:05.760> right<00:05:06.060> then

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
interrupt that kind of match right then

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.630 
interrupt that kind of match right then
because<00:05:06.870> people<00:05:07.530> want<00:05:07.710> to<00:05:07.770> see<00:05:07.950> this<00:05:08.130> epic

finish<00:05:09.000> and<00:05:09.240> that's<00:05:10.200> what<00:05:10.350> happened<00:05:10.710> you<00:05:10.770> know

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
finish and that's what happened you know

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.100 
finish and that's what happened you know
Rafa<00:05:11.640> the<00:05:11.760> way<00:05:11.850> he<00:05:12.030> wanted<00:05:12.300> was<00:05:12.450> unbelievable

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
Rafa the way he wanted was unbelievable

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.070 
Rafa the way he wanted was unbelievable
but<00:05:13.320> for<00:05:14.010> me<00:05:14.100> it<00:05:14.160> was<00:05:14.220> cool<00:05:15.030> really<00:05:15.390> to<00:05:15.480> be<00:05:15.570> part

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
but for me it was cool really to be part

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.600 
but for me it was cool really to be part
of<00:05:16.140> it<00:05:16.260> and<00:05:16.380> I<00:05:16.440> don't<00:05:16.620> look<00:05:16.710> back<00:05:16.950> at<00:05:17.130> that<00:05:17.310> and

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
of it and I don't look back at that and

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.400 
of it and I don't look back at that and
think<00:05:18.180> this<00:05:18.330> was<00:05:18.480> much<00:05:18.630> most<00:05:18.900> most<00:05:19.170> crushing

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
think this was much most most crushing

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.410 
think this was much most most crushing
loss<00:05:19.800> in<00:05:19.980> my<00:05:20.100> life<00:05:20.310> I<00:05:20.550> don't<00:05:20.970> see<00:05:21.150> it<00:05:21.240> that<00:05:21.270> way

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
loss in my life I don't see it that way

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.090 
loss in my life I don't see it that way
I<00:05:21.600> see<00:05:21.930> it<00:05:21.960> as<00:05:22.410> something<00:05:22.650> more<00:05:22.800> positive

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
I see it as something more positive

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.940 
I see it as something more positive
actually<00:05:23.670> because<00:05:23.850> I<00:05:23.940> already<00:05:24.210> had<00:05:24.360> won<00:05:24.950> five

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
actually because I already had won five

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.980 
actually because I already had won five
or<00:05:26.010> six<00:05:26.640> now<00:05:26.820> I<00:05:26.850> remember<00:05:27.180> where<00:05:27.720> Mullins

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
or six now I remember where Mullins

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.070 
or six now I remember where Mullins
before<00:05:28.350> that<00:05:28.530> so<00:05:29.130> I<00:05:29.460> was<00:05:29.940> naturally<00:05:30.630> super

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
before that so I was naturally super

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.290 
before that so I was naturally super
disappointed<00:05:31.650> in<00:05:31.830> that<00:05:31.860> but<00:05:32.210> thankfully<00:05:33.210> I've

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
disappointed in that but thankfully I've

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.120 
disappointed in that but thankfully I've
had<00:05:33.480> some<00:05:33.720> of<00:05:33.840> those<00:05:33.990> incredible<00:05:34.500> matches<00:05:34.920> not

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
had some of those incredible matches not

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.770 
had some of those incredible matches not
only<00:05:35.370> gets<00:05:35.490> rougher<00:05:35.820> but<00:05:35.970> other<00:05:36.120> players<00:05:36.420> too

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
only gets rougher but other players too

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.220 
only gets rougher but other players too
which<00:05:37.440> sort<00:05:37.710> of<00:05:37.740> connect<00:05:38.190> you<00:05:38.340> forever<00:05:38.760> with

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
which sort of connect you forever with

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.560 
which sort of connect you forever with
that<00:05:40.230> player<00:05:40.530> or<00:05:40.890> with<00:05:41.670> the<00:05:41.850> venue<00:05:42.210> with<00:05:42.450> the

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
that player or with the venue with the

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.930 
that player or with the venue with the
center<00:05:42.870> cord<00:05:43.140> with<00:05:43.350> the<00:05:43.470> fans<00:05:43.740> and<00:05:44.100> that's

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
center cord with the fans and that's

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.910 
center cord with the fans and that's
what<00:05:45.210> so<00:05:45.420> I<00:05:45.720> think<00:05:45.990> so<00:05:46.230> beautiful<00:05:46.830> about

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920 
what so I think so beautiful about

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.590 
what so I think so beautiful about
sports<00:05:47.400> and<00:05:47.580> generally<00:05:47.910> just<00:05:48.030> don't<00:05:48.300> know<00:05:48.450> the

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
sports and generally just don't know the

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.710 
sports and generally just don't know the
outcome<00:05:48.720> and<00:05:49.260> you<00:05:49.740> see<00:05:49.980> that<00:05:50.340> you<00:05:50.730> know<00:05:50.850> the

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
outcome and you see that you know the

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.390 
outcome and you see that you know the
different<00:05:52.050> styles<00:05:52.380> against<00:05:52.710> each<00:05:52.800> other<00:05:52.980> the

different styles against each other the

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.580
