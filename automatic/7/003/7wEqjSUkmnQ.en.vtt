ace jack-off at a position and I didn't

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.780 
ace jack-off at a position and I didn't
really<00:00:55.800> think<00:00:56.010> there<00:00:56.190> was<00:00:56.280> any<00:00:56.400> particularly

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
really think there was any particularly

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.160 
really think there was any particularly
good<00:00:56.909> reason<00:00:57.269> to<00:00:57.360> make<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.510> bluff<00:00:57.780> at<00:00:57.900> the<00:00:57.989> pot

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
good reason to make a bluff at the pot

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.799 
good reason to make a bluff at the pot
there<00:00:58.409> so<00:00:58.940> just<00:00:59.940> tuck<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.210> down<00:01:00.360> and<00:01:00.659> hopefully

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
there so just tuck it down and hopefully

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.930 
there so just tuck it down and hopefully
he<00:01:01.680> was<00:01:01.830> giving<00:01:02.129> up<00:01:02.220> on<00:01:02.400> the<00:01:02.519> pot<00:01:02.699> with<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
he was giving up on the pot with the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.280 
he was giving up on the pot with the
worst<00:01:03.120> hand<00:01:03.390> or<00:01:03.600> trying<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.960> show<00:01:04.080> down<00:01:04.260> a

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290

worse ace or something I tend to flat a
little<00:01:11.970> bit<00:01:12.119> more<00:01:12.270> than<00:01:12.479> some<00:01:12.869> people

probably not gonna have a choice but

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.770 
probably not gonna have a choice but
they<00:02:27.720> do<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:27.959> a<00:02:27.989> bit<00:02:28.049> more<00:02:28.319> often<00:02:28.680> but<00:02:29.780> you

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
they do that a bit more often but you

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.210 
they do that a bit more often but you
know<00:02:30.870> in<00:02:30.989> these<00:02:31.080> softer<00:02:31.500> feel<00:02:31.620> tournaments

know in these softer feel tournaments

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.309 
know in these softer feel tournaments
it's<00:02:33.090> probably<00:02:33.480> something<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.840> can<00:02:34.019> afford

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
it's probably something you can afford

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.309 
it's probably something you can afford
to<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:35.610> avoid<00:02:35.879> a<00:02:36.239> little<00:02:36.660> bit<00:02:36.780> anyways<00:02:37.140> you

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
to to avoid a little bit anyways you

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.110 
to to avoid a little bit anyways you
don't<00:02:37.470> want<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.739> make<00:02:38.519> your<00:02:38.640> three<00:02:38.910> batting

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
don't want to make your three batting

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.759 
don't want to make your three batting
ranges<00:02:39.480> too<00:02:39.750> predictable<00:02:40.290> in<00:02:40.379> those<00:02:40.530> spots

but at the same time reducing variance

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.650 
but at the same time reducing variance
is<00:02:44.010> important<00:02:44.910> if<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.090> think<00:02:45.269> you<00:02:45.329> have<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.480> big

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
is important if you think you have a big
