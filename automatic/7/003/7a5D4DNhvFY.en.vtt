Locker<00:04:51.670> boxes<00:04:52.240> of<00:04:52.900> course<00:04:53.200> very<00:04:53.440> Japanese

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
Locker boxes of course very Japanese

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.310 
Locker boxes of course very Japanese
except<00:04:54.970> that<00:04:55.060> one<00:04:55.390> I<00:04:55.420> think<00:04:55.690> maybe<00:04:55.900> was<00:04:56.170> made

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
except that one I think maybe was made

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.140 
except that one I think maybe was made
in<00:04:56.440> China<00:04:56.680> well<00:04:57.190> there's<00:04:57.340> this<00:04:57.460> planet<00:04:57.940> which

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
in China well there's this planet which

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.570 
in China well there's this planet which
is<00:04:58.180> like<00:04:58.540> I<00:04:58.780> haven't<00:04:59.260> seen<00:04:59.740> that<00:04:59.890> plant<00:05:00.130> before

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
is like I haven't seen that plant before

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.170 
is like I haven't seen that plant before
I<00:05:00.820> think<00:05:01.000> but<00:05:01.450> I<00:05:01.480> think<00:05:01.720> I<00:05:01.810> had<00:05:01.960> a<00:05:02.970> dentist<00:05:03.970> who

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
I think but I think I had a dentist who

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.310 
I think but I think I had a dentist who
has<00:05:04.360> a<00:05:04.390> plant<00:05:04.690> like<00:05:04.870> that

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
has a plant like that

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.170 
has a plant like that
so<00:05:05.710> I<00:05:05.770> don't<00:05:05.860> know<00:05:06.040> if<00:05:06.190> it's<00:05:06.400> a<00:05:06.490> Japanese<00:05:06.910> thing

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
so I don't know if it's a Japanese thing

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.320 
so I don't know if it's a Japanese thing
or<00:05:07.690> maybe<00:05:07.990> just<00:05:08.260> a<00:05:08.460> Japanese<00:05:09.460> and<00:05:09.790> dentists

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
or maybe just a Japanese and dentists

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.180 
or maybe just a Japanese and dentists
thing<00:05:10.680> you<00:05:11.680> know<00:05:11.910> the<00:05:12.910> other<00:05:13.270> roommates

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
thing you know the other roommates

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.930 
thing you know the other roommates
haven't<00:05:15.190> really<00:05:15.400> seemed<00:05:15.610> to<00:05:15.670> notice<00:05:15.820> me<00:05:16.120> yet<00:05:16.330> I

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
haven't really seemed to notice me yet I

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.280 
haven't really seemed to notice me yet I
have<00:05:18.940> been<00:05:19.090> keeping<00:05:19.390> a<00:05:19.450> low<00:05:19.570> profile

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
have been keeping a low profile

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.620 
have been keeping a low profile
trying<00:05:21.250> to<00:05:21.490> you<00:05:21.670> know<00:05:21.730> steer<00:05:22.120> clear<00:05:22.270> of<00:05:22.390> any

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
trying to you know steer clear of any

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.360 
trying to you know steer clear of any
fights<00:05:22.900> in<00:05:23.050> fact<00:05:23.260> I<00:05:23.470> don't<00:05:23.530> think<00:05:23.890> they<00:05:24.340> even

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
fights in fact I don't think they even

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.030 
fights in fact I don't think they even
know<00:05:24.790> I'm<00:05:24.910> in<00:05:25.000> the<00:05:25.150> house<00:05:25.360> I<00:05:25.680> get<00:05:26.680> the<00:05:26.770> feeling

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
know I'm in the house I get the feeling

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.340 
know I'm in the house I get the feeling
sometimes<00:05:27.570> that<00:05:28.570> they<00:05:28.720> don't<00:05:28.900> even<00:05:29.020> know<00:05:29.320> that

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
sometimes that they don't even know that

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.190 
sometimes that they don't even know that
I'm<00:05:29.620> there<00:05:29.860> I<00:05:30.190> feel<00:05:31.120> kind<00:05:31.390> of<00:05:32.250> you<00:05:33.250> know

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
I'm there I feel kind of you know

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.480 
I'm there I feel kind of you know
neglected<00:05:35.200> but<00:05:35.800> I<00:05:35.860> mean<00:05:36.040> that's<00:05:36.160> my<00:05:36.280> strategy

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
neglected but I mean that's my strategy

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.460 
neglected but I mean that's my strategy
my<00:05:36.790> strategy<00:05:37.090> is<00:05:37.180> to<00:05:37.210> stay<00:05:37.540> below<00:05:38.290> the<00:05:38.320> radar

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
my strategy is to stay below the radar

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.930 
my strategy is to stay below the radar
so<00:05:39.100> far<00:05:39.460> below<00:05:39.610> the<00:05:39.850> radar<00:05:40.000> that<00:05:40.390> people<00:05:41.050> don't

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
so far below the radar that people don't

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.870 
so far below the radar that people don't
actually<00:05:42.940> even<00:05:43.390> know<00:05:43.600> I'm<00:05:43.870> in<00:05:43.900> the<00:05:44.080> house<00:05:44.880> and

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
actually even know I'm in the house and

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.410 
actually even know I'm in the house and
so<00:05:46.120> far<00:05:46.710> you<00:05:47.710> know<00:05:47.860> that<00:05:47.890> that's<00:05:48.370> worked

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
so far you know that that's worked

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.990 
so far you know that that's worked
in<00:05:50.900> fact<00:05:51.230> I<00:05:51.410> think<00:05:51.470> they<00:05:51.860> leave<00:05:52.520> that<00:05:52.790> house

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
in fact I think they leave that house

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.020 
in fact I think they leave that house
without<00:05:53.300> me<00:05:53.600> sometimes<00:05:54.020> and<00:05:54.860> go<00:05:55.730> to<00:05:55.790> the

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
without me sometimes and go to the

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.110 
without me sometimes and go to the
challenges<00:05:56.540> so<00:05:57.400> actually<00:05:58.400> you<00:05:58.520> know<00:05:58.640> the

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
challenges so actually you know the

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.490 
challenges so actually you know the
other<00:05:59.330> contestants<00:05:59.690> they<00:06:00.020> all<00:06:00.110> seem<00:06:00.290> great

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
other contestants they all seem great

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.030 
other contestants they all seem great
they've<00:06:00.710> all<00:06:00.860> been<00:06:01.460> very<00:06:01.760> well

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040 
they've all been very well

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.950 
they've all been very well
demographically<00:06:04.040> selected<00:06:04.550> of<00:06:05.540> course

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
demographically selected of course

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.650 
demographically selected of course
there's<00:06:06.260> the<00:06:06.470> the<00:06:06.770> cute<00:06:07.160> girl<00:06:08.060> and<00:06:08.420> there's

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 
there's the the cute girl and there's

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.260 
there's the the cute girl and there's
the<00:06:08.900> angry<00:06:09.290> dude<00:06:09.620> and<00:06:10.100> I<00:06:10.310> guess<00:06:10.880> I<00:06:11.150> would

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
the angry dude and I guess I would

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:17.550 
the angry dude and I guess I would
represent<00:06:12.260> the<00:06:13.930> dorky<00:06:14.930> nerd<00:06:15.460> demographic<00:06:16.460> and

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
represent the dorky nerd demographic and

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.140 
represent the dorky nerd demographic and
we<00:06:18.560> usually<00:06:18.800> get<00:06:19.070> voted<00:06:19.370> out<00:06:19.490> pretty<00:06:19.730> early<00:06:19.820> on

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
we usually get voted out pretty early on

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.420 
we usually get voted out pretty early on
but<00:06:21.080> there's<00:06:21.320> a<00:06:21.380> chance<00:06:21.620> they<00:06:21.860> might<00:06:21.890> see<00:06:22.280> me

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
but there's a chance they might see me

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.950 
but there's a chance they might see me
as<00:06:22.610> being<00:06:22.970> non-threatening<00:06:23.390> and<00:06:23.630> keep<00:06:23.780> me<00:06:23.900> in

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
the game till the end so that they can

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.630
