times better than three place accuracy

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.400 
times better than three place accuracy
this<00:03:51.950> is<00:03:52.130> clearly<00:03:52.489> the<00:03:53.060> accuracy<00:03:53.660> all<00:03:53.870> races

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
this is clearly the accuracy all races

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.170 
this is clearly the accuracy all races
and<00:03:54.440> sanctioning<00:03:55.070> bodies<00:03:55.459> should<00:03:55.790> strive<00:03:56.150> to

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
and sanctioning bodies should strive to

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.710 
and sanctioning bodies should strive to
achieve

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
achieve

the<00:03:59.500> infrared<00:03:59.950> sensors<00:04:00.400> are<00:04:00.610> also<00:04:00.880> a<00:04:01.120> major

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
the infrared sensors are also a major

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.570 
the infrared sensors are also a major
concern<00:04:01.990> but<00:04:02.560> that<00:04:02.710> is<00:04:02.830> another<00:04:03.100> topic<00:04:03.430> for
