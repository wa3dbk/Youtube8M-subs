models of laptops is a bad idea
the<00:00:10.950> facial<00:00:11.280> recognition<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.820> really<00:00:12.120> easy<00:00:12.300> to

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
the facial recognition is really easy to

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.120 
the facial recognition is really easy to
break<00:00:12.630> into<00:00:12.870> I'm<00:00:13.230> gonna<00:00:13.530> demonstrate<00:00:13.740> that

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
break into I'm gonna demonstrate that

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.440 
break into I'm gonna demonstrate that
today<00:00:14.250> using<00:00:14.670> nothing<00:00:14.790> more<00:00:14.940> than<00:00:15.120> my<00:00:15.299> laptop

to do with the enrollment process or how

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.930 
to do with the enrollment process or how
easy<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.070> break<00:00:38.219> into<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.610> software

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
easy it is to break into the software

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.549 
easy it is to break into the software
that<00:00:39.510> has<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.809> do<00:00:39.899> with<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.110> quality<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
that has to do with the quality of the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.049 
that has to do with the quality of the
image<00:00:40.710> taken<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.280> also<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.610> software<00:00:41.969> is

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
image taken and also the software is

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.630 
image taken and also the software is
being<00:00:42.239> used<00:00:42.510> which<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.899> case<00:00:43.110> is

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
being used which in this case is

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.459

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
so we're gonna start at the bottom here

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.819 
so we're gonna start at the bottom here
I'm<00:00:48.390> gonna<00:00:48.480> click<00:00:48.660> on<00:00:48.750> update<00:00:49.230> face<00:00:49.500> image

I'm gonna click on update face image

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.810 
I'm gonna click on update face image
this<00:00:50.190> may<00:00:50.430> vary<00:00:51.120> based<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.730> software<00:00:53.730> that

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
this may vary based on the software that

this may vary based on the software that
you're<00:00:53.969> using<00:00:54.000> I'm<00:00:54.629> gonna<00:00:54.809> go<00:00:54.930> ahead<00:00:55.020> and

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
you're using I'm gonna go ahead and

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.560 
you're using I'm gonna go ahead and
punch<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.860> my<00:00:55.980> software<00:00:56.370> now<00:00:56.969> I'm<00:00:57.090> gonna<00:00:57.270> tell

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
punch in my software now I'm gonna tell

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.049 
punch in my software now I'm gonna tell
you<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:58.680> software<00:00:59.190> like<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.609> what<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.850> does

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
you that software like this what it does

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.110 
you that software like this what it does
it<00:01:01.020> actually<00:01:01.079> stores<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.980> password<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:03.000> if

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
it actually stores the password so if

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.850 
it actually stores the password so if
you<00:01:03.239> go<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.480> use<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.290> facial<00:01:04.589> recognition

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
you go to use a facial recognition

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.010 
you go to use a facial recognition
software<00:01:05.280> or<00:01:05.760> say<00:01:06.000> you're<00:01:06.240> using<00:01:06.450> a

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
software or say you're using a

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.359 
software or say you're using a
fingerprint<00:01:07.830> reader<00:01:07.979> or<00:01:08.070> something<00:01:08.280> like

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
fingerprint reader or something like

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.800 
fingerprint reader or something like
that<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.670> actually<00:01:08.790> storing<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.360> software

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
that it's actually storing the software

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.050 
that it's actually storing the software
or<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.110> password<00:01:10.350> somewhere<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.880> it's

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
or that password somewhere and it's

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.240 
or that password somewhere and it's
entering<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.840> password<00:01:13.170> every<00:01:13.799> time<00:01:14.070> that

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
entering that password every time that

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.270 
entering that password every time that
you<00:01:14.689> log<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.930> at<00:01:16.110> least<00:01:16.259> that's<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.979> way<00:01:17.100> it's

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
you log in at least that's the way it's

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.070 
you log in at least that's the way it's
worked<00:01:17.490> for<00:01:17.670> other<00:01:17.880> software<00:01:18.360> product<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
worked for other software product in the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.109 
worked for other software product in the
past<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.530> can't<00:01:19.740> say<00:01:19.950> for<00:01:20.009> certain<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.610> exactly

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
past I can't say for certain is exactly

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.359 
past I can't say for certain is exactly
the<00:01:21.299> same<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:21.659> it's<00:01:22.590> likely<00:01:22.890> using<00:01:23.159> something

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
the same but it's likely using something

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.370 
the same but it's likely using something
somewhere<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.689> I'm<00:01:24.810> gonna<00:01:24.900> go<00:01:25.049> ahead<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.229> do

two<00:04:28.800> of<00:04:28.830> my<00:04:28.950> fingers<00:04:29.010> holding<00:04:29.760> the<00:04:29.880> screen<00:04:30.150> up

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
two of my fingers holding the screen up

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.360 
two of my fingers holding the screen up
so<00:04:30.690> you<00:04:30.810> can<00:04:31.050> see<00:04:31.260> that<00:04:31.380> obviously<00:04:31.830> this<00:04:31.950> login

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
so you can see that obviously this login

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.050 
so you can see that obviously this login
was<00:04:32.490> faked

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
was faked

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.860 
was faked
it<00:04:33.540> was<00:04:33.660> done<00:04:33.900> by<00:04:33.990> a<00:04:34.020> cellphone<00:04:34.530> and<00:04:34.770> not<00:04:35.550> by<00:04:35.910> my

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
it was done by a cellphone and not by my

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.490 
it was done by a cellphone and not by my
actual<00:04:37.290> face<00:04:37.560> um<00:04:38.300> so<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.900> benefit<00:04:40.230> of<00:04:40.350> this<00:04:40.440> is

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
actual face um so the benefit of this is

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.260 
actual face um so the benefit of this is
you<00:04:40.770> can<00:04:40.950> look<00:04:41.190> and<00:04:41.430> see<00:04:41.580> if<00:04:41.700> your<00:04:41.850> friend<00:04:42.090> or
