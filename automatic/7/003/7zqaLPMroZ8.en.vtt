00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.530
 before starting the installation of fencing out 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.600
 welded mesh need to hold a number 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.849
 preparatory work such as 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.400
 clearing the line of the planned fence and 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:24.040
 unloading materials at standard 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.800
 mounting option we use pillars from 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.800
 profile pipe section 50 to 50 and 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.869
 a wall thickness of 2 mm column has 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.000
 powder painted and plugged 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.610
 metal cap the length of such 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.079
 the pillar is three meters section 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.510
 made of galvanized wire 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.610
 4 mm diameter also with 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.430
 powder coated green 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.280
 standard section height is 2 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.200
 meters and a width of two and a half meters all 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.540
 metal components of the fence 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.450
 delivered to the object already in painted 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.110
 form that makes installation more convenient and 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.970
 fast 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.760
 when all the preparatory work 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.040
 performed proceed to the breakdown of the site 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.790
 first we define the corner points 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.470
 and locations of gates and gates 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.720
 we stretch the thread to mark the borders 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.899
 and mark up the step between the pillars 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.729
 standard two and a half meters after 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.369
 completion of surveying 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.249
 proceed to drill holes for 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.189
 fences with a small sail 

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:26.590
 drilling is done to a depth of half a meter 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.139
 the rest of the post is clogged so 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.630
 the way the stock is buried in the ground on 

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:32.710
 one meter while the top half meter 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.289
 concreted 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.539
 for drilling we use benzobur 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.939
 screw diameter 200 millimeters what 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.639
 allows you to do not loosening 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.150
 hole in the ground mounting gates and gates 

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:47.490
 produced in the exact place 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.560
 to install sliding gates to us 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.230
 it is necessary to make two foundations for 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.720
 installation of the gate itself and the response frame 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.180
 foundation under the gate has a length of 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.520
 half the width of the opening after 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.010
 dredged under the foundation 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.500
 and put the formwork and make installation 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.350
 frame made of reinforcement with installation 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.390
 embedded parts and channel form further 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.090
 proceed to the preparation of concrete 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.880
 solution and its further pouring before 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.170
 montage of the gate foundation is not defended 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.270
 less than four days 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.370
 Now you can start concreting 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.770
 fence posts 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.540
 however, each pillar is set at 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.060
 level in two planes 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.250
 and the upper thread is stretched in the horizon 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.680
 with the help of the level allows us 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.910
 maintain the desired height of the pillars throughout 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.280
 the length of the fence 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.170
 when all the supports are exposed you can 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.260
 start mounting the section with 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.840
 U-shaped clamps 4 pieces on the table 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.650
 we use welded mesh checked 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.020
 manufacturers 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.000
 beware of fakes that may already 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.040
 after a year lose the presentation and 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.739
 bend over from snow loads 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.110
 after the foundation settled 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.850
 we start the installation of sliding gates 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.430
 for this you need to produce 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.830
 welding works for mounting mating 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.560
 frame and base with load-bearing rollers on 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.489
 which will move the gate 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.250
 install the top guides 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.200
 rollers and plugs on the tire further 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.480
 we mount 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.480
 HCS to respond earlier and receiving 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.730
 video we use exclusively 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.040
 branded components and fittings that 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:24.220
 allow the gate to serve for you long and 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.220
 properly your fence is ready
