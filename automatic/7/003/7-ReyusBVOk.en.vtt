I'm<00:00:09.120> going<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.269> show<00:00:09.510> you<00:00:09.570> how<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.019> replace<00:00:10.260> the

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
I'm going to show you how to replace the

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.650 
I'm going to show you how to replace the
pump<00:00:10.710> seal<00:00:10.950> in<00:00:11.219> your<00:00:11.400> hot<00:00:11.519> tub<00:00:11.550> first<00:00:12.509> thing

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
pump seal in your hot tub first thing

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.660 
pump seal in your hot tub first thing
you<00:00:12.780> want<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:12.990> do<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.380> shut<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.920> power<00:00:14.070> off<00:00:14.250> to

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
you want to do is shut the power off to

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.090 
you want to do is shut the power off to
the<00:00:14.969> tab<00:00:15.470> then<00:00:16.470> you're<00:00:16.650> going<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.830> want<00:00:17.010> to

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
the tab then you're going to want to

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.330 
the tab then you're going to want to
drain<00:00:17.400> your<00:00:17.640> tub<00:00:18.680> because<00:00:19.680> usually<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.160> pump

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
drain your tub because usually the pump

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.500 
drain your tub because usually the pump
is<00:00:20.460> at<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.640> bottom<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:20.970> once<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.270> take<00:00:21.300> the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
is at the bottom and once you take the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.990 
is at the bottom and once you take the
pump<00:00:21.689> out<00:00:21.869> it'll<00:00:22.560> all<00:00:22.650> drain<00:00:22.769> out<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.310> then

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
pump out it'll all drain out and then

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.500 
pump out it'll all drain out and then
locate<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.189> access<00:00:26.189> panel<00:00:26.550> for<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.510> pump

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
locate the access panel for the pump

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.450 
locate the access panel for the pump
determine<00:00:30.510> how<00:00:30.660> it's<00:00:30.990> plumbed<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.619> remove<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
determine how it's plumbed in remove the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.850 
determine how it's plumbed in remove the
pump<00:00:32.700> completely<00:00:33.420> from<00:00:34.020> underneath<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.649> tub

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
pump completely from underneath the tub

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.549 
pump completely from underneath the tub
and<00:00:35.100> put<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.149> on<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> work<00:00:36.510> table<00:00:36.719> where<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.380> can

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
and put it on a work table where you can

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.680 
and put it on a work table where you can
change<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.950> seal<00:00:38.129> okay<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.270> pump<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.660> a

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
change the seal okay so this pump is a

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.389 
change the seal okay so this pump is a
little<00:00:39.989> bit<00:00:40.079> different<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.860> hot<00:00:41.010> tub<00:00:41.040> pump

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
little bit different in the hot tub pump

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.030 
little bit different in the hot tub pump
but<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:42.350> essentially<00:00:43.350> shows<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.860> this

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
but it essentially shows you that this

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.799 
but it essentially shows you that this
is<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.250> pump<00:00:44.520> part<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.059> then<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.660> is

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
is the pump part of it and then this is

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.139 
is the pump part of it and then this is
the<00:00:45.899> motor<00:00:46.079> part<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> pump<00:00:47.309> seal<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.910> what

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
the motor part so the pump seal is what

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.020 
the motor part so the pump seal is what
actually<00:00:48.329> keeps<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.079> water<00:00:49.289> from<00:00:49.760> the<00:00:50.760> wet

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
actually keeps the water from the wet

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.510 
actually keeps the water from the wet
side<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.809> pump<00:00:52.050> from<00:00:52.620> getting<00:00:52.920> into<00:00:53.129> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
side of the pump from getting into the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.549 
side of the pump from getting into the
motor<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.510> want<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.809> take<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.140> wrench<00:00:55.379> and

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
motor so you want to take a wrench and

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.020 
motor so you want to take a wrench and
whatever<00:00:55.770> bolts<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.489> have<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:56.789> there

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
whatever bolts that you have on there

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.539 
whatever bolts that you have on there
let's<00:00:57.750> go<00:00:57.960> ahead<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.350> remove<00:00:59.309> those<00:00:59.699> bolts

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.700 

and<00:01:05.600> then<00:01:06.600> pull<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.020> motor<00:01:07.229> off<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> pump

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
and then pull the motor off of the pump

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.870 
and then pull the motor off of the pump
so<00:01:10.710> you're<00:01:10.830> going<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.010> want<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.189> remove<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
so you're going to want to remove the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:19.300 
so you're going to want to remove the
volute<00:01:14.630> then<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.780> would<00:01:15.900> remove<00:01:16.229> impeller

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.679 

then<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.460> remove<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.790> diffuser<00:01:21.509> or

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
then you remove the diffuser or

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.310 
then you remove the diffuser or
backplate<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:23.670> pump<00:01:23.909> seal<00:01:24.119> should<00:01:25.110> come

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
backplate and the pump seal should come

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.469 
backplate and the pump seal should come
out<00:01:25.380> like<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.770> okay<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:28.290> brand<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.860> motor

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
out like this okay the brand of motor

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.140 
out like this okay the brand of motor
has<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> very<00:01:30.900> specific<00:01:31.200> seal<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:33.030> would

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
has a very specific seal that you would

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.480 
has a very specific seal that you would
replace<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.450> with<00:01:33.689> now<00:01:34.680> when<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.950> open<00:01:34.979> this

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
replace it with now when you open this

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.140 
replace it with now when you open this
you<00:01:36.479> want<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.780> make<00:01:36.900> sure<00:01:37.700> that<00:01:38.700> you're<00:01:38.970> not
