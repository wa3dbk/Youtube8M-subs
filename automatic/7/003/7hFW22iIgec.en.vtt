00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.949 

so<00:00:01.050> I<00:00:01.110> wanted<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.439> make<00:00:01.620> a<00:00:01.650> video<00:00:01.909> that<00:00:02.959> shows

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
so I wanted to make a video that shows

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.120 
so I wanted to make a video that shows
you<00:00:04.250> my<00:00:05.250> way<00:00:05.549> of<00:00:05.879> fixing<00:00:06.319> the<00:00:07.319> grinding<00:00:07.919> noise

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
you my way of fixing the grinding noise

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.340 
you my way of fixing the grinding noise
with<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.670> Xbox<00:00:10.340> here<00:00:11.630> my<00:00:12.630> problem<00:00:13.219> was<00:00:14.219> that

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
with the Xbox here my problem was that

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.099 
with the Xbox here my problem was that
the<00:00:16.350> magnet<00:00:16.710> came<00:00:16.890> off<00:00:17.210> and<00:00:18.210> we<00:00:18.690> fixed<00:00:18.990> the

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
the magnet came off and we fixed the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.920 
the magnet came off and we fixed the
magnet<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:20.130> magnet<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.029> right<00:00:21.060> there<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.869> we

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
magnet the magnet is right there and we

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.349 
magnet the magnet is right there and we
fix<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.830> magnet<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.400> then<00:00:23.519> after<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.000> magnet

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
fix the magnet and then after the magnet

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.230 
fix the magnet and then after the magnet
was<00:00:24.480> fixed<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:25.019> started<00:00:25.439> grinding<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:26.220> we<00:00:26.880> have

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
was fixed it started grinding so we have

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.660 
was fixed it started grinding so we have
tried<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.140> rubber<00:00:28.289> band<00:00:28.619> method<00:00:29.099> as<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.550> can

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
tried the rubber band method as you can

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.410 
tried the rubber band method as you can
see<00:00:29.880> we<00:00:30.510> tried<00:00:30.750> cleaning<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.520> it<00:00:32.520> played

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
see we tried cleaning it it played

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.200 
see we tried cleaning it it played
movies<00:00:34.260> as<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> Superman<00:00:35.579> movie<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.940> played<00:00:36.090> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
movies as a Superman movie it played the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.450 
movies as a Superman movie it played the
movie<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.350> wouldn't<00:00:37.649> play<00:00:37.920> any<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.340> our

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
movie but it wouldn't play any of our

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.700 
movie but it wouldn't play any of our
Xbox<00:00:38.910> games<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:42.230> didn't<00:00:43.230> really<00:00:43.469> want<00:00:43.649> to

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
Xbox games so I didn't really want to

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.709 
Xbox games so I didn't really want to
mess<00:00:43.920> with<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.190> lazer<00:00:44.399> too<00:00:44.789> much<00:00:45.030> but<00:00:45.360> like<00:00:45.570> I

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
mess with the lazer too much but like I

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.029 
mess with the lazer too much but like I
said<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:46.020> tried<00:00:46.200> different<00:00:46.379> methods<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.950> we

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
said we tried different methods that we

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.779 
said we tried different methods that we
saw<00:00:47.219> on<00:00:47.340> YouTube<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.920> the<00:00:49.920> best<00:00:50.160> method<00:00:50.370> that

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
saw on YouTube and the best method that

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.200 
saw on YouTube and the best method that
we<00:00:50.910> could<00:00:51.090> come<00:00:51.239> up<00:00:51.270> with<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:52.250> I<00:00:53.250> thought<00:00:53.910> maybe

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
we could come up with is I thought maybe

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.049 
we could come up with is I thought maybe
when<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.690> glued<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.500> magnet<00:00:55.860> back<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.430> just

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
when I glued the magnet back in it just

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.189 
when I glued the magnet back in it just
didn't<00:00:58.789> it<00:00:59.789> didn't<00:01:00.090> set<00:01:00.329> right<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:01.079> know

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
didn't it didn't set right you know

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.630 
didn't it didn't set right you know
maybe<00:01:01.379> there<00:01:01.620> was<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:02.120> difference<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
maybe there was a difference in the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.330 
maybe there was a difference in the
space<00:01:05.640> between<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.390> laser<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.439> disc<00:01:07.680> so

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
space between the laser and the disc so

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.890 
space between the laser and the disc so
what<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.520> did<00:01:08.610> was<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.000> made<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.479> little<00:01:09.750> piece

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
what I did was I made this little piece

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.050 
what I did was I made this little piece
of<00:01:10.080> paper<00:01:10.500> here<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.490> paper<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.909> just

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
of paper here and the paper is just

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.700 
of paper here and the paper is just
poster<00:01:12.540> board<00:01:12.810> or<00:01:13.049> cardstock

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
poster board or cardstock

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.620 
poster board or cardstock
you<00:01:14.700> know<00:01:14.790> me<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.119> make<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.240> out<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.450> a

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
you know me can make it out of a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.969 
you know me can make it out of a
Christmas<00:01:16.170> card<00:01:16.350> whatever<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.710> was<00:01:16.799> just

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
Christmas card whatever it was just

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
posted board but anyway here's how I

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.570 
posted board but anyway here's how I
made<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.390> I<00:01:21.390> took<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.930> quarter<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.619> as<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.430> can

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
made it I took a quarter and as you can

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.320 
made it I took a quarter and as you can
see<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.560> space<00:01:25.830> underneath<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.729> just

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
see the the space underneath it is just

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.630 
see the the space underneath it is just
slightly<00:01:27.570> bigger<00:01:27.960> than<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.350> quarter<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.579> took

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
slightly bigger than a quarter so I took

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.120 
slightly bigger than a quarter so I took
a<00:01:29.790> quarter<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:31.079> drew<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.380> line<00:01:31.619> around<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
a quarter and I drew a line around the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.580 
a quarter and I drew a line around the
quarter<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.720> where<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.869> black<00:01:34.079> line<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.560> I

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
quarter and where the black line is I

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.410 
quarter and where the black line is I
cut<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.040> outside<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.729> black<00:01:35.939> line<00:01:36.210> so

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
cut on the outside of the black line so

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.490 
cut on the outside of the black line so
that<00:01:36.450> gave<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:36.990> extra<00:01:37.049> space<00:01:37.670> now<00:01:38.670> the

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
that gave it that extra space now the

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.760 
that gave it that extra space now the
space<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.100> center<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:42.720> like<00:01:43.439> an<00:01:43.560> ink

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
space in the center is just like an ink

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.120 
space in the center is just like an ink
cap<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.280> mine<00:01:44.479> mine<00:01:45.479> was<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> little<00:01:46.130> little

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
cap and mine mine was a little little

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.429 
cap and mine mine was a little little
sharpie<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:48.119> know<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.540> fine<00:01:48.780> print<00:01:49.049> sharpie

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
sharpie you know the fine print sharpie

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.770 
sharpie you know the fine print sharpie
but<00:01:50.100> um<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.960> took<00:01:52.189> took<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.640> just<00:01:54.180> drew

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
but um I took took that and just drew

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.240 
but um I took took that and just drew
the<00:01:54.899> line<00:01:55.049> around<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.380> but<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.860> doesn't<00:01:56.100> matter

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
the line around it but it doesn't matter

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.740 
the line around it but it doesn't matter
if<00:01:56.549> it's<00:01:56.670> perfect<00:01:57.000> or<00:01:57.090> not<00:01:57.210> as<00:01:57.329> long<00:01:57.390> as<00:01:57.630> it's

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
if it's perfect or not as long as it's

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.499 
if it's perfect or not as long as it's
close<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.110> Center<00:01:58.409> after<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.399> do<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.610> what

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
close to Center after you do that what

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.670 
close to Center after you do that what
you're<00:02:00.630> going<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.780> do<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.170> start<00:02:01.439> hole

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
you're going to do is start hole

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.580 
you're going to do is start hole
punching<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.810> when<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.930> hole<00:02:04.140> punch<00:02:04.409> this

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
punching and when you hole punch this

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.109 
punching and when you hole punch this
it's<00:02:04.829> going<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.040> be<00:02:05.219> too<00:02:05.520> small<00:02:06.680> to<00:02:07.680> fit<00:02:08.119> over

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
it's going to be too small to fit over

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.750 
it's going to be too small to fit over
the<00:02:09.629> magnet<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.619> black<00:02:11.069> part<00:02:11.310> underneath

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
the magnet and the black part underneath

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.930 
the magnet and the black part underneath
the<00:02:11.940> magnet<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:12.870> you're<00:02:13.140> just<00:02:13.260> going<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.530> keep

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
the magnet so you're just going to keep

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.010 
the magnet so you're just going to keep
punching<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:15.880> until<00:02:16.880> it<00:02:16.970> fits<00:02:17.210> a<00:02:17.450> nice<00:02:17.660> snug

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
punching and until it fits a nice snug

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.260 
punching and until it fits a nice snug
fit<00:02:18.080> as<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.680> can<00:02:18.830> see<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.040> hold<00:02:19.820> punched<00:02:20.210> a

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
fit as you can see I hold punched a

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.790 
fit as you can see I hold punched a
little<00:02:20.510> bit<00:02:20.630> too<00:02:20.930> much<00:02:21.080> right<00:02:21.290> there<00:02:21.320> but<00:02:21.680> it's

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
little bit too much right there but it's

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.340 
little bit too much right there but it's
fine<00:02:22.040> because<00:02:22.280> it<00:02:22.610> it<00:02:23.120> created<00:02:23.660> a<00:02:23.990> couple

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
fine because it it created a couple

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.980 
fine because it it created a couple
edges<00:02:24.830> for<00:02:25.040> them<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:25.400> to<00:02:25.790> get<00:02:26.000> stuck

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
edges for them to to get stuck

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.720 
edges for them to to get stuck
underneath<00:02:27.290> this<00:02:27.560> little<00:02:27.770> black<00:02:28.040> part<00:02:28.340> so<00:02:28.640> the

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
underneath this little black part so the

it scratched up too much and you'll see
just<00:04:10.299> that<00:04:10.870> little<00:04:11.290> bit<00:04:11.470> it<00:04:11.650> plays<00:04:11.890> a<00:04:12.040> movie

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
just that little bit it plays a movie

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.170 
just that little bit it plays a movie
don't<00:04:13.000> play<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:14.290> game<00:04:14.470> so<00:04:15.190> I<00:04:15.549> got<00:04:15.730> to<00:04:15.850> thinking

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
don't play the game so I got to thinking

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.449 
don't play the game so I got to thinking
that<00:04:16.209> when<00:04:16.450> I<00:04:16.479> put<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:16.840> magnet<00:04:17.229> in<00:04:17.380> there<00:04:18.190> was

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
that when I put the magnet in there was

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.460 
that when I put the magnet in there was
a<00:04:18.489> difference<00:04:19.299> in<00:04:19.419> the<00:04:19.540> space<00:04:19.810> and<00:04:20.139> that's

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
a difference in the space and that's

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.370 
a difference in the space and that's
what<00:04:20.709> caused<00:04:20.919> it<00:04:21.250> so<00:04:21.990> it's<00:04:22.990> going<00:04:23.139> to<00:04:23.200> eat

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
what caused it so it's going to eat

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.600 
what caused it so it's going to eat
check<00:04:23.590> that<00:04:23.830> real<00:04:24.040> quick<00:04:26.220> and<00:04:27.220> we're<00:04:27.460> going<00:04:27.580> to

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
check that real quick and we're going to

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.510 
check that real quick and we're going to
put<00:04:27.790> our<00:04:27.880> little<00:04:28.030> piece<00:04:28.270> of<00:04:28.389> paper<00:04:29.310> back<00:04:30.310> in

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
put our little piece of paper back in

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.150
