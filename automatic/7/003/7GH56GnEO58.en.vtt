00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 knows those games that are saviors of 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.580
 row in the bank queue of the 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.420
 lottery of the supermarket also because it is 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.420
 This is what I'm going to show you. 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.430
 and this is it to have clear pants gianna and this 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.439
 is the channel android idea 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.769
 Today I'm going to show you a selection. 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.590
 with five simple android games 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:33.000
 simple but addictive and this video was 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.710
 an indirect suggestion to pedro lucas 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.340
 because indirectly he said the following 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.610
 I'd like you in one of these videos 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:44.040
 show the game by coming very edson 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.079
 good the people will like hugs 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.660
 A hug is an assembly. 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.370
 Why did you make a direct suggestion? 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.329
 because I will not show exactly the 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.180
 boss of gum 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.329
 You gave me an idea to continue with 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.239
 the videos that I stopped about eight-nine ago 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.460
 months behind the selection with a young 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.640
 this time in the top five games for 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.950
 simple android and we are on the 15th 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.710
 April which means that there have already been 15 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.760
 days which means that it was already a video 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.820
 per day that is equal to 15 videos that is 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.790
 from day 1 to day 30 a video for each 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.509
 day means already gone 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.790
 half the way traveled for those who 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.240
 accepted the challenge and is in the 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.409
 as I am every day 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.560
 Share on Facebook 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.430
 missing only half of the way office 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.500
 Sweaty, sucks, gives a job. 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.899
 imagine you have no idea but if I 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.030
 I did not like you, did not I did not? 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.770
 I'd be talking about this fight then 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.500
 Let's go to the games that's what matters 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.110
 then let's play the first game o 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.939
 skywalk you need to get to the sky though 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.790
 for you to get there you will be 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.070
 challenged with their perception of where 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.259
 It will be your next step here you will not 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.340
 you can hesitate or think fast because 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.319
 if not 5k in the abyss 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.869
 I think in the course of the game you will 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.150
 unlock new paths that they 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.879
 call patterns of the game I'm going 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.970
 telling you to put the phone to play this 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:21.879
 game and two do and has a soundtrack 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.890
 hypnotizing along with his plot that 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:27.849
 slowly showing a few phrases 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.549
 which indicates that at the end of the 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.650
 game has a good story to tell 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.049
 you control two circles that are 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.840
 always spinning and through two touches 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:40.150
 you dodge obstacles that game already 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.510
 it made me miss many hours in good is that 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.780
 You 'll get the hang of how to do it. 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.640
 betray turning without touching the balloon is not 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.129
 You have to run away, you have to be well. 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.220
 at the beginning of the game until it is a 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:57.670
 basis is great that the more you 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.069
 I'm going up but it's hard and 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.500
 more accuracy you need to have the 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.750
 ball does not fall and so you do not lose 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.849
 A game your goal is to raise a maximum 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.239
 that you can beat your own 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.859
 record and zig zag will even challenge 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.530
 was the reflection because you have to 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.900
 stay all the time like the game world 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.620
 zigzags from the right to the 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.319
 left 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.930
 at first it's very simple, not just rights 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.489
 what right what right then is the 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.099
 right that rights are entitled to 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:31.510
 describe and next 11 is about 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:32.799
 You control a chicken a chicken and 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.459
 You have to help this chicken. 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:40.989
 cross the street because otherwise 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:43.989
 She dies if you will not help you. 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.690
 touch the screen and each touch is a 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.489
 jump and to divert you just drag 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.280
 finger to the right or left 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:58.450
 and that you found it simple more 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:04:02.109
 interesting but then it 's hi kiss 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.150
 if you have a video suggestion let 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.340
 here in the comments and also if you 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.230
 Did you like something special, talk there? 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.989
 Did you like what you remember? 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.239
 remembering that if you want to participate in the 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.099
 draw a ball can and is not this 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.320
 But can not what I'm going back to 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:20.320
 You are more interesting than this. 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.419
 because it's a control that comes here 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.360
 This one control is separate, it's just 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:27.930
 you share the video any video 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.090
 challenge 30 in 30 with the hashtag 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.650
 challenge 30 out of 30 you'll already be 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.910
 participating in the draw 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:39.070
 the result comes out on March 1st if 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.310
