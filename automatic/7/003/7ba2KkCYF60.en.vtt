ethereal<00:01:17.740> tone<00:01:19.410> working<00:01:20.410> with<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:20.590> gamelan<00:01:21.009> I

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
ethereal tone working with the gamelan I

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:22.919 
ethereal tone working with the gamelan I
started<00:01:21.490> thinking<00:01:21.789> that<00:01:21.910> it'd<00:01:22.090> be<00:01:22.360> fun<00:01:22.569> to<00:01:22.750> use

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:22.929 
started thinking that it'd be fun to use

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:24.960 
started thinking that it'd be fun to use
it<00:01:23.080> in<00:01:23.200> ways<00:01:23.440> that<00:01:24.130> we<00:01:24.250> don't<00:01:24.369> normally<00:01:24.759> hear

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
it in ways that we don't normally hear

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.389 
it in ways that we don't normally hear
it<00:01:25.090> it's<00:01:25.270> not<00:01:25.440> necessarily<00:01:26.440> peaceful<00:01:27.250> and

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
it it's not necessarily peaceful and

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.460 
it it's not necessarily peaceful and
serene<00:01:27.610> it<00:01:28.270> can<00:01:28.420> be<00:01:28.539> violent<00:01:28.899> and<00:01:29.349> aggressive

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
serene it can be violent and aggressive

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.010 
serene it can be violent and aggressive
and<00:01:30.099> we<00:01:30.220> can<00:01:30.369> use<00:01:30.550> it<00:01:30.700> in<00:01:30.759> action<00:01:31.539> cues<00:01:31.869> and

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
and we can use it in action cues and

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.710 
and we can use it in action cues and
horror<00:01:32.289> cues<00:01:32.679> and<00:01:33.069> use<00:01:33.310> it<00:01:33.459> to<00:01:34.000> communicate<00:01:34.179> an

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
horror cues and use it to communicate an

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.650 
horror cues and use it to communicate an
urgency<00:01:35.140> and<00:01:35.590> tension<00:01:36.300> that<00:01:37.300> you're<00:01:37.479> not

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
urgency and tension that you're not

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.260 
urgency and tension that you're not

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
them in a room you just don't appreciate

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.289 
them in a room you just don't appreciate
how<00:01:56.229> bizarre<00:01:56.500> it<00:01:56.890> is

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.590 

the<00:02:00.289> actual<00:02:00.829> notes<00:02:01.130> that<00:02:01.579> the<00:02:01.700> gamelan<00:02:02.210> plays

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
the actual notes that the gamelan plays

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.990 
the actual notes that the gamelan plays
are<00:02:03.049> not<00:02:03.380> notes<00:02:03.979> that<00:02:04.340> an<00:02:04.549> orchestra

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
are not notes that an orchestra

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.849 
are not notes that an orchestra
complaint<00:02:05.420> some<00:02:05.990> of<00:02:06.109> them<00:02:06.200> are<00:02:06.289> the<00:02:06.380> same<00:02:06.590> and

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:06.859 
complaint some of them are the same and

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:08.650 
complaint some of them are the same and
some<00:02:07.100> of<00:02:07.219> them<00:02:07.310> are<00:02:07.399> different<00:02:07.549> so<00:02:08.269> I<00:02:08.300> found

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
some of them are different so I found

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.600 
some of them are different so I found
that<00:02:08.840> trying<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.319> get<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.709> orchestra<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.369> the

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
that trying to get the orchestra and the

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.059 
that trying to get the orchestra and the
gamelan<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.330> fit<00:02:11.510> together<00:02:11.950> sometimes<00:02:12.950> was<00:02:13.040> a

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
gamelan to fit together sometimes was a

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.490 
gamelan to fit together sometimes was a
real<00:02:13.280> challenge<00:02:13.610> that<00:02:14.030> combination<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:15.080> me<00:02:15.230> is

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
real challenge that combination to me is

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.789 
real challenge that combination to me is
the<00:02:16.430> soul<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:17.150> what<00:02:17.569> so<00:02:17.870> come<00:02:18.080> forth<00:02:18.440> is<00:02:18.650> that

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
the soul of what so come forth is that

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.920 
the soul of what so come forth is that
is<00:02:19.069> the<00:02:19.190> identity<00:02:19.670> of<00:02:19.700> so<00:02:19.940> confluent<00:02:20.629> it's<00:02:20.750> not

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
is the identity of so confluent it's not

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.080 
is the identity of so confluent it's not
