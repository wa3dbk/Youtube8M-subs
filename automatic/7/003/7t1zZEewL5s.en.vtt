 well quickly in videos and it's a 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.890
 pretty simple question or do not think 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.330
 that another user needs for the 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.340
 behavior directly by text but it's 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.350
 a relevant question that can 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.330

 buying another mobile and tells us that he 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.590
 has what alumina the 500 environment 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.030
 and in that operating system catch me in 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.040
 principle if you want to stay with windows 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.920
 ok and says yes in windows phone 10 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.300
 210 mobile if they are going to be the times 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.250
 apps that android that you 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.440
 answer the stick the applications 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.850
 reid channel does not write do not tell to see 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.410
 what is on android a wind sensations 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.120
 by had put for windows those are 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.410
 the developers are the ones that have 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.180
 to say good I have vibration to 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.860
 Android by the exported for windows 10 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.379
 what happens that how can you carry 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.689
 Practically 80% of 90% of the code 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.880
 Well, the safest thing is that a great 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.890
 number of applications 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.750
 go to windows 10 true things 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.280
 what you will have is that to be compatible with 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.350
 all windows operating systems 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.030
 10 means that you see in the word 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.430
 excell any application or any 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.470
 thing that you have in your computer the 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.479
 relationships that you use on your pc to 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.070
 also be exportable to your mobile 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.720
 but it does not mean that all 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.520
 applications that are in android go 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.979
 to be in windows phones for example 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.259
 the application that Pepito Perez did is 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.090
 a person that is an application 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.649
 developer and has 100 downloads not 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.929
 is an application or will it contribute to 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.459
 increase of 10 if he does not want 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.349
 the relevant operations if they are in 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:43.270
 windows phones is that is that it has as 

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:44.740
 some mistake there are more than 400,000 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.970
 applications on windows phones 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.360
 there are people who say yes but this one 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.880
 it is not but 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.740
 is specific when it is but there is another 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.270
 that does the same thing that does 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.220
 always applications and it would be 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.110
 directly on the phone together 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.310
 platform works that you like but not 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.740
 I 'm going to tell you if they go to the 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.380
