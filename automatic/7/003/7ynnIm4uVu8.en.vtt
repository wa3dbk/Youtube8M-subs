 high quality standard in the console

 simultaneous on playstation 3 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.840
 ips avoid taking a look I should say 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.500
 that as a master of robbery I only rob 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.260
 thieves so it took a bit but for 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.240
 order and what I was looking for 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.190
 sly cooper was already retired he lived 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.440
 quiet with his girlfriend and the robberies 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.730
 they had been left behind 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.470
 unfortunately I sold realizes 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.839
 that the master book of the thieves of 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.390
 the cooper family is losing all its 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.189
 information and the band the sly decide 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.360
 get together again to travel in the 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.400
 time with him 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.070
 to find their ancestors and 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.410
 solve this mess and if you open 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.810
 the cage so we can live from a 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.810
 death sure gravity come 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.120
 is the company will visit in feudal japan 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.370
 the medieval england or the far west 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.050
 among many other locations in the 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:36.560
 that they will always find a second 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:39.110
 raccoon family cooper greetings 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.170
 greetings it also seems that you have punctured 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.830
 but good to twitpic good I like it 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.750
 what's your name 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:52.030
 It's the one and sly cooper said it would suit you 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.220
 know that I do not take well that they take my 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.260
 last name joke in each location 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.820
 You will have a series of missions for each 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.800
 character that will develop the 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.720
 story but also the map is 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.850
 full of secrets that you can try 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.530
 find not always that you leave 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.160
 your thief's lair has to be 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.160
 for a mission 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:18.380
 I will find this artist and 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.240
 I'll break my fingers or whatever I can think of 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.340
 the missions change a lot in 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.650
 feature of the character that you lead sly is 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.320
 the most complete must always move with 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.940
 stealth steals objects to enemies and it 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.390
 disguise to get skills 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.380
 special 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.690
 open the door 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.860
 and then you're a little short to be 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.600
 commander but his ancestors were 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.540
 behave very similar but 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.980
 always with some special movement 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.810
 I sold the turtle in a wheelchair 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.150
 obviously can not move around the 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.310
 rooftops as sly has some mission of 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.460
 recognition and many mini-games of 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.470
 really fun hacking and murray the 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.480
 hippo hippopotamus is the muscle of the 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.510
 The team just has to hit and 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.640
 load things nothing more in proportion 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.870
 playing is much more with the raccoons than 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.000
 with the other two team members 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.980
 but very nice to be there their 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.980
 missions are very refreshing 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.430
 at the end of each broadcast and days to the 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.260
 lair where you can spend all the 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.970
 money that you have raised in new 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.680
 skills for the characters and in 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.240
 any time you can travel from 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.950
 voluntarily to the times already 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.790
 visited in order to collect what 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.790
 that you have left 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.370
 you see that at a graphic level this game 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.140
 it is a joy it is quite noticeable that 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.640
 Playstation 3 is not working 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.680
 maximum but the fault lies with the 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.799
 simultaneous launch of the game in play 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.319
 3 in fact avoids the good news is that 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.069
 if you buy the game in play 3 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.900
 you can automatically download it 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.819
 also in your life 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.500
 That said, we will also say that the design 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.239
 of characters and scenarios makes 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.430
 they do not import the details 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.139
 technical the game is incredibly 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.150
 attractive just as is the air 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.099
 cartoon of designs and color and 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.680
 lighting environments function 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:08.730
 wonder comes out a good look 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.379
 I want you to remember well who crushed 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.450
 of the audio we will simply say that it meets 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.519
 the soundtrack is fine is what 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.500
 it has to be the dub is simply 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.299
 correct but for my taste too 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.669
 child and sometimes and according to 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.560
 characters not quite well interpreted 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:28.560
 too forced maybe I am the oldest 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.560
 mangante 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:38.700
 is that you question him son I was already 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.470
 guard when you were still a piglet 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.900
 wait for him to inform the general 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.970
 sly cooper thieves in full time 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.560
 a gap that playstation3 has only known 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.360
 cover with reissues of the pass 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.670
 generation this type of games 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.560
 children with affordable mechanics for 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.210
 everyone but still stimulating 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.760
 for any age range has been 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.740
 almost forgotten this generation beyond 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.560
 of ratchet and clank I miss more 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.870
 games like this like mario 64 like 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.090
 Banjo-Kazooie even as the first 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.710
 crash bandicoot to see if between so much 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.290
 modern warfare and both assault rifle 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.480
 it also serves this audience the 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.120
 very cool 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.430
 recommended to me I loved it 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:22.360
 first time in my entire career I would have 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:24.660
 that letting me catch was going to be a whole 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.660
 challenge
