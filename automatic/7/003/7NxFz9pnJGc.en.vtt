when<00:00:23.940> you<00:00:24.030> started<00:00:24.360> these<00:00:24.450> companies<00:00:24.960> you

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 
when you started these companies you

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.100 
when you started these companies you
know<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.190> guess<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.820> mean<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.330> appreciate<00:00:27.570> that

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.110 
know I guess I mean I appreciate that

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.150 
know I guess I mean I appreciate that
comment<00:00:28.350> but<00:00:29.280> I<00:00:29.310> think<00:00:29.640> we<00:00:29.730> just<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.510> whole

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
comment but I think we just the whole

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.590 
comment but I think we just the whole
crew<00:00:32.160> as<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.340> whole<00:00:32.610> just<00:00:32.640> kind<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.149> did<00:00:33.329> its<00:00:33.480> own

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
crew as a whole just kind of did its own

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.040 
crew as a whole just kind of did its own
thing<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.110> guess<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:35.480> turned<00:00:36.480> out<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.719> way

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
thing and I guess it turned out that way

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.900 
thing and I guess it turned out that way
and<00:00:37.260> then<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.559> natural<00:00:38.010> progression<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.670> like

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
and then the natural progression of like

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.810 
and then the natural progression of like
growing<00:00:39.780> up<00:00:39.980> you<00:00:40.980> know<00:00:41.010> kind<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.489> like<00:00:41.550> getting

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
growing up you know kind of like getting

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.520 
growing up you know kind of like getting
a<00:00:41.879> little<00:00:41.969> older<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.449> start<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.809> company<00:00:43.140> or<00:00:43.440> it

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
a little older you start a company or it

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.689 
a little older you start a company or it
was<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:43.769> we<00:00:43.890> were<00:00:43.920> younger<00:00:44.160> we<00:00:44.370> started

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
was like we were younger we started

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.389 
was like we were younger we started
Baker<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.210> then<00:00:45.749> started<00:00:46.499> death<00:00:46.679> wish<00:00:46.920> you

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
Baker and then started death wish you

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.009 
Baker and then started death wish you
know<00:00:47.489> took<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.820> couple<00:00:47.999> of<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.210> guys<00:00:48.329> team<00:00:48.870> was

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
know took a couple of the guys team was

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:50.599 
know took a couple of the guys team was
getting<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.409> big<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.859> I<00:00:50.010> think<00:00:50.460> it's<00:00:50.579> just

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
getting so big and I think it's just

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:53.029 
getting so big and I think it's just
that<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.149> timing<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.749> the<00:00:51.839> whole<00:00:52.559> crew<00:00:52.589> that

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
that the timing and the whole crew that

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.389 
that the timing and the whole crew that
was<00:00:53.100> around<00:00:53.480> just<00:00:54.480> kind<00:00:54.659> of<00:00:55.129> doing<00:00:56.129> whatever

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
was around just kind of doing whatever

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.579 
was around just kind of doing whatever
we<00:00:56.640> wanted<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.120> guess<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.480> naturally<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.379> did

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
we wanted I guess it naturally just did

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.380 
we wanted I guess it naturally just did
that<00:00:58.769> I<00:00:58.890> mean<00:00:59.069> I<00:00:59.159> still<00:00:59.429> go<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.579> like<00:00:59.819> other

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
because like I was kind of on the verge

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.580 
because like I was kind of on the verge
of<00:02:16.280> at<00:02:16.730> first<00:02:17.060> when<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.810> when<00:02:18.140> we<00:02:18.230> started

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
of at first when the when we started

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.070 
of at first when the when we started
filming<00:02:18.770> being<00:02:19.430> kicked<00:02:19.730> off<00:02:19.910> zero<00:02:20.300> so<00:02:20.900> I<00:02:20.930> was

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
filming being kicked off zero so I was

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.960 
filming being kicked off zero so I was
on<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.260> verge<00:02:21.350> of<00:02:21.470> being<00:02:21.620> kicked<00:02:21.920> off<00:02:22.100> because

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
on the verge of being kicked off because

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.850 
on the verge of being kicked off because
I<00:02:23.000> wasn't<00:02:23.240> really<00:02:23.420> doing<00:02:23.660> anything<00:02:23.990> and<00:02:24.350> then

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
I wasn't really doing anything and then

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.920 
I wasn't really doing anything and then
the<00:02:25.160> timing<00:02:25.670> of<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:25.940> was<00:02:26.240> like<00:02:26.360> I<00:02:26.480> was<00:02:26.510> a<00:02:26.630> mature

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.780 
so sometimes the deadline can be the
same<00:03:37.989> it<00:03:38.200> can<00:03:38.319> be<00:03:38.470> rewarding<00:03:39.010> when<00:03:39.489> you<00:03:39.549> get

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
same it can be rewarding when you get

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.339 
same it can be rewarding when you get
something<00:03:40.150> done<00:03:40.269> in<00:03:40.450> time<00:03:40.599> and<00:03:40.870> you're<00:03:41.170> like

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
something done in time and you're like

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:42.839 
something done in time and you're like
you<00:03:41.890> know<00:03:41.920> you<00:03:42.069> put<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.489> pressure<00:03:42.700> on

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
you know you put the pressure on

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.729 
you know you put the pressure on
yourself<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:43.420> you've<00:03:43.540> made<00:03:43.810> that<00:03:43.840> happen<00:03:44.170> but

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
yourself and you've made that happen but

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.710 
yourself and you've made that happen but

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
then on the flip side of that it can get

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.390 
then on the flip side of that it can get
you<00:03:46.900> really<00:03:47.080> down<00:03:47.349> when<00:03:47.680> you<00:03:47.769> don't<00:03:48.010> make<00:03:48.190> that

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400
