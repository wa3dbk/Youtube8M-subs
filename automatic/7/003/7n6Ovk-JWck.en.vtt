00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
the kind of wallpaper redesign on the

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.630 
the kind of wallpaper redesign on the
inside<00:02:14.760> as<00:02:15.060> well<00:02:15.120> as<00:02:15.840> this<00:02:16.140> title<00:02:16.620> page<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:17.189> just

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
inside as well as this title page I just

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.089 
inside as well as this title page I just
really<00:02:18.120> love<00:02:18.299> stuff<00:02:18.840> like<00:02:18.959> this<00:02:19.079> so<00:02:19.980> the

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
really love stuff like this so the

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.759 
really love stuff like this so the
second<00:02:20.579> question<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.329> about<00:02:21.629> keeping<00:02:21.959> series

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
second question is about keeping series

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.550 
second question is about keeping series
covers<00:02:23.340> together<00:02:23.970> so<00:02:24.659> often<00:02:25.140> they<00:02:25.319> will

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
covers together so often they will

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.670 
covers together so often they will
redesign<00:02:26.310> covers<00:02:27.120> before<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.110> series<00:02:28.440> has

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
redesign covers before the series has

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.089 
redesign covers before the series has
even<00:02:28.980> complete<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:30.239> I<00:02:30.690> personally<00:02:31.680> like<00:02:32.069> to

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
even complete so I personally like to

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.280 
even complete so I personally like to
have<00:02:32.489> my<00:02:32.760> covers<00:02:33.120> match<00:02:33.329> as<00:02:33.599> well<00:02:33.750> as<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:34.019> can

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
have my covers match as well as I can
