that I just did on a gear change I am
implementing<00:00:17.970> on<00:00:18.240> my<00:00:18.390> Ducati<00:00:18.779> 848<00:00:20.359> 2009<00:00:21.359> model

implementing on my Ducati 848 2009 model

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.609 
implementing on my Ducati 848 2009 model
you<00:00:23.189> can<00:00:23.340> see<00:00:23.550> here<00:00:24.199> the<00:00:25.199> reason<00:00:25.529> I'm

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
you can see here the reason I'm

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.550 
you can see here the reason I'm
including<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.640> swingarm<00:00:27.029> topic<00:00:27.599> when<00:00:28.529> I

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
including the swingarm topic when I

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.279 
including the swingarm topic when I
first<00:00:28.980> loosened<00:00:29.970> up<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.119> eccentric<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:31.140> can

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
first loosened up the eccentric you can

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.889 
first loosened up the eccentric you can
see<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.470> had<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> little<00:00:32.009> bit<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.189> water<00:00:32.899> coming

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
see I had a little bit of water coming

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.979 
see I had a little bit of water coming
out<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.559> hub<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.510> actually<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.630> wasn't<00:00:36.809> a

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
out of the hub and actually it wasn't a

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.030 
out of the hub and actually it wasn't a
little<00:00:37.079> bit<00:00:37.230> look<00:00:37.500> at<00:00:37.590> this

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
little bit look at this

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.760 
little bit look at this
I<00:00:38.070> had<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> stream<00:00:39.149> coming<00:00:39.510> out<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.930> there<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.290> was

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
I had a stream coming out of there I was

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.160 
I had a stream coming out of there I was
really<00:00:41.129> surprised<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.969> see<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.809> I'm

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
really surprised to see this and I'm

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.380 
really surprised to see this and I'm
guessing<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.800> came<00:00:44.010> from<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.640> very

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
guessing that it came from a very

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.330 
guessing that it came from a very
thorough<00:00:45.719> wash<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.500> did<00:00:46.710> about<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.039> week

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
thorough wash that I did about a week

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.110 
thorough wash that I did about a week
before<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:48.289> purchased<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.469> new<00:00:49.829> chain<00:00:50.730> cleaner

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
before I purchased a new chain cleaner

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.869 
before I purchased a new chain cleaner
that<00:00:51.840> mentioned<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.100> should<00:00:53.280> wash<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
that mentioned that you should wash the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.099 
that mentioned that you should wash the
chain<00:00:54.239> after<00:00:55.430> letting<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.670> cleaner<00:00:57.180> sit<00:00:57.809> for

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
chain after letting the cleaner sit for

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.959 
chain after letting the cleaner sit for
a<00:00:58.140> little<00:00:58.379> while<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:59.340> can<00:00:59.489> see<00:00:59.640> I've<00:00:59.730> got<00:00:59.850> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
a little while you can see I've got the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.869 
a little while you can see I've got the
bike<00:01:00.120> up<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.570> air<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.260> 102<00:01:02.190> link

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
bike up in the air this is a 102 link

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.719 
bike up in the air this is a 102 link
chain<00:01:03.570> which<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.680> suspected<00:01:05.250> was<00:01:05.430> going<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.640> be

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
chain which I suspected was going to be

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.240 
chain which I suspected was going to be
two<00:01:05.970> links<00:01:06.299> long<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.290> from<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
two links long and it is and from the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.740 
two links long and it is and from the
point<00:01:08.460> I'm<00:01:08.670> measuring<00:01:09.150> up<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.540> front

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
point I'm measuring up in the front

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.260

as you can see here back about fifteen

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.609 
as you can see here back about fifteen
to<00:01:49.860> sixteen<00:01:50.070> millimeters<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:52.079> should<00:01:52.409> be

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
to sixteen millimeters and I should be

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.560 
to sixteen millimeters and I should be
able<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.979> lengthen<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.700> wheelbase<00:01:54.119> if<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.509> do

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
able to lengthen the wheelbase if I do

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.010 
able to lengthen the wheelbase if I do
that<00:01:55.070> so<00:01:56.070> that's<00:01:56.490> what<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:56.939> exercise<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.600> all

that so I want to take the pin out and
see<00:02:22.950> how<00:02:23.760> much<00:02:23.939> more<00:02:24.299> distance<00:02:24.780> I'll<00:02:24.959> actually

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
see how much more distance I'll actually

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.520 
see how much more distance I'll actually
have<00:02:25.469> and<00:02:26.400> really<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.700> want<00:02:26.879> to<00:02:26.909> see<00:02:27.120> if<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.530> 102

have and really I want to see if the 102

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.280 
have and really I want to see if the 102
length<00:02:28.889> chain<00:02:29.370> will<00:02:29.670> work<00:02:29.909> if<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.750> remove<00:02:31.109> the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
length chain will work if I remove the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.149 
length chain will work if I remove the
pin<00:02:33.079> per<00:02:34.079> the<00:02:34.200> manual<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.650> need<00:02:34.829> to<00:02:34.920> remove

Ducati plant went ahead and added a

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.089 
Ducati plant went ahead and added a
starter<00:03:03.510> hope<00:03:03.689> this<00:03:03.959> is<00:03:04.139> the<00:03:04.169> hardest<00:03:04.560> part<00:03:04.919> of

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
starter hope this is the hardest part of

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.280 
starter hope this is the hardest part of
the<00:03:05.219> project<00:03:05.489> getting<00:03:06.090> this<00:03:06.359> snap<00:03:06.719> ring<00:03:07.049> off

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:11.669 
and using video I'm going to make it

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:15.619 
and using video I'm going to make it
look<00:03:11.879> fairly<00:03:12.870> easy<00:03:13.400> it<00:03:14.400> actually<00:03:14.729> took<00:03:14.909> a<00:03:15.209> lot

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
look fairly easy it actually took a lot

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:21.409 
look fairly easy it actually took a lot
longer<00:03:15.689> than<00:03:16.169> this<00:03:16.319> though<00:03:19.970> when<00:03:20.970> that's<00:03:21.150> done

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
longer than this though when that's done

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.289 
longer than this though when that's done
you<00:03:21.780> can<00:03:22.019> go<00:03:22.319> ahead<00:03:22.349> and<00:03:22.949> take<00:03:23.220> this<00:03:23.549> washer

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
you can go ahead and take this washer

side it's flat that flat side goes in

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:36.559 
side it's flat that flat side goes in
toward<00:03:33.689> the<00:03:34.019> swingarm<00:03:35.209> let's<00:03:36.209> see<00:03:36.329> if<00:03:36.389> we<00:03:36.479> can

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
toward the swingarm let's see if we can

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.469 
toward the swingarm let's see if we can
get<00:03:36.689> this<00:03:36.810> caliper<00:03:37.579> bracket<00:03:38.579> off<00:03:38.729> and<00:03:39.060> we

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:39.479 
get this caliper bracket off and we

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:42.949 
get this caliper bracket off and we
cannot<00:03:40.079> because<00:03:41.150> we<00:03:42.150> need<00:03:42.329> to<00:03:42.509> loosen<00:03:42.659> up<00:03:42.900> the

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
cannot because we need to loosen up the

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.729 
cannot because we need to loosen up the
eccentric<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.799> little<00:03:43.949> bit<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:45.439> as<00:03:46.439> soon<00:03:46.620> as

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
eccentric a little bit and as soon as

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.280 
eccentric a little bit and as soon as
that's<00:03:46.889> done<00:03:47.099> it<00:03:47.879> slips<00:03:48.239> right<00:03:48.359> off<00:03:48.509> take<00:03:49.079> note

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
that's done it slips right off take note

and look at that beautiful little
starter<00:04:01.439> hoe<00:04:02.180> I'm<00:04:03.180> going<00:04:03.359> to<00:04:03.419> take<00:04:03.599> a

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 
starter hoe I'm going to take a

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.929 
starter hoe I'm going to take a
measurement<00:04:03.900> of<00:04:04.259> that<00:04:04.439> as<00:04:04.919> soon<00:04:05.250> as<00:04:05.400> I<00:04:05.489> get<00:04:05.549> the

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:05.939 
measurement of that as soon as I get the

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:10.699 
measurement of that as soon as I get the
stock<00:04:06.599> pin<00:04:07.560> out<00:04:07.829> of<00:04:07.859> the<00:04:07.979> way<00:04:08.870> that<00:04:09.870> by<00:04:10.379> the<00:04:10.439> way

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
stock pin out of the way that by the way

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.580 
stock pin out of the way that by the way
is<00:04:11.069> 12<00:04:11.819> millimeters<00:04:12.780> by<00:04:13.699> 1.25<00:04:14.699> and<00:04:15.349> it's<00:04:16.349> in

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
is 12 millimeters by 1.25 and it's in

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.009 
is 12 millimeters by 1.25 and it's in
there<00:04:16.829> nice<00:04:17.549> and<00:04:17.609> tight<00:04:17.849> so<00:04:18.419> you<00:04:18.690> might<00:04:18.840> have

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
there nice and tight so you might have

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.229 
there nice and tight so you might have
to<00:04:19.079> whack<00:04:19.469> it<00:04:19.500> a<00:04:19.919> couple<00:04:20.459> of<00:04:20.549> times<00:04:20.820> to<00:04:21.060> break

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
to whack it a couple of times to break

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.790 
to whack it a couple of times to break
it<00:04:21.419> loose

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
it loose

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.290 
it loose

you can see that's what I did here and
when<00:04:27.300> I<00:04:27.330> do<00:04:27.449> put<00:04:27.780> it<00:04:27.870> back<00:04:28.020> in<00:04:28.289> I<00:04:28.470> will<00:04:28.710> use

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:29.159 
when I do put it back in I will use

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:34.399 
when I do put it back in I will use
Loctite<00:04:29.909> and<00:04:30.620> torque<00:04:31.620> it<00:04:31.680> down<00:04:31.919> to<00:04:32.250> spec<00:04:33.409> okay

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:34.409 
Loctite and torque it down to spec okay

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:36.279 
Loctite and torque it down to spec okay
here<00:04:34.620> we<00:04:34.710> go<00:04:34.740> let's<00:04:34.860> get<00:04:35.220> a<00:04:35.250> measurement<00:04:35.490> and

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
here we go let's get a measurement and

wheelbase measurement is the same four
hundred<00:04:44.849> and<00:04:44.940> twenty<00:04:45.000> millimeters<00:04:45.750> look<00:04:45.930> at

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
hundred and twenty millimeters look at

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.110 
hundred and twenty millimeters look at
this<00:04:46.199> let's<00:04:46.770> go<00:04:46.889> all<00:04:47.069> the<00:04:47.099> way<00:04:47.220> for<00:04:47.639> we<00:04:47.819> can<00:04:47.940> see

three hundred and ninety five

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.980 
three hundred and ninety five
millimeters<00:04:53.250> again<00:04:54.240> you<00:04:54.389> need<00:04:54.509> to<00:04:54.569> add<00:04:54.750> eighty

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
millimeters again you need to add eighty

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.670 
millimeters again you need to add eighty
five<00:04:55.229> to<00:04:55.409> that<00:04:55.530> to<00:04:55.740> get<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:56.039> real<00:04:56.759> measurement

that's<00:05:09.000> inside<00:05:09.690> the<00:05:09.960> swingarm<00:05:11.690> mud<00:05:12.690> dirt

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
that's inside the swingarm mud dirt

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.320 
that's inside the swingarm mud dirt
little<00:05:13.710> pieces<00:05:13.919> of<00:05:14.099> rock<00:05:16.250> had<00:05:17.250> no<00:05:17.490> clue<00:05:17.909> I<00:05:18.120> had

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
little pieces of rock had no clue I had

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.740 
little pieces of rock had no clue I had
a<00:05:18.360> little<00:05:18.659> cavity<00:05:18.990> like<00:05:19.319> that<00:05:19.560> in<00:05:19.710> there<00:05:19.919> and

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
a little cavity like that in there and

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.330 
a little cavity like that in there and
you<00:05:21.750> know<00:05:21.870> without<00:05:22.110> the<00:05:22.349> water<00:05:22.560> and<00:05:22.979> without

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
you know without the water and without

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.499 
you know without the water and without
all<00:05:23.580> this<00:05:23.759> muck<00:05:24.270> I'm<00:05:25.199> probably<00:05:25.590> going<00:05:25.949> to

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:26.509 
all this muck I'm probably going to

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:29.390 
all this muck I'm probably going to
speed<00:05:27.509> up<00:05:27.539> my<00:05:27.779> lap<00:05:27.960> times<00:05:28.289> by<00:05:28.560> a<00:05:28.590> few<00:05:28.889> seconds

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
speed up my lap times by a few seconds

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.550 
speed up my lap times by a few seconds
you<00:05:29.909> know<00:05:30.029> probably<00:05:30.479> took<00:05:30.750> a<00:05:30.779> pound<00:05:31.199> of

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
you know probably took a pound of

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.450 
you know probably took a pound of
material<00:05:32.370> out<00:05:32.580> of<00:05:32.669> there<00:05:34.159> with<00:05:35.159> the<00:05:35.279> water

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
material out of there with the water

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.529 
material out of there with the water
that<00:05:35.550> is<00:05:36.889> so<00:05:37.889> obviously<00:05:38.490> I'm<00:05:38.969> going<00:05:39.150> to<00:05:39.210> clean

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
that is so obviously I'm going to clean

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:46.529 
the winter I was going to try to get

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:47.990 
the winter I was going to try to get
this<00:05:46.650> thing<00:05:46.889> into<00:05:47.099> my<00:05:47.340> basement<00:05:47.610> and<00:05:47.940> just

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
this thing into my basement and just

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.980 
this thing into my basement and just
break<00:05:48.330> it<00:05:48.479> completely<00:05:49.259> down<00:05:49.500> I<00:05:50.990> probably

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
break it completely down I probably

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.369 
break it completely down I probably
still<00:05:52.680> will<00:05:53.159> do<00:05:53.310> that<00:05:53.520> but<00:05:53.849> I<00:05:54.080> wanted<00:05:55.080> to<00:05:55.169> take

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
clean it up get everything lubed up

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.149

again<00:05:59.699> you<00:06:00.690> can<00:06:00.810> see<00:06:01.020> here<00:06:01.319> the<00:06:01.529> hub<00:06:01.919> is<00:06:02.129> going

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:02.159 
again you can see here the hub is going

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:08.360 
again you can see here the hub is going
back<00:06:02.699> into<00:06:02.969> the<00:06:03.949> swingarm<00:06:06.830> this<00:06:07.830> is<00:06:07.979> the<00:06:08.129> best

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
back into the swingarm this is the best

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.800 
back into the swingarm this is the best
way<00:06:08.610> I<00:06:08.639> found<00:06:08.849> to<00:06:09.330> do<00:06:09.509> it<00:06:09.629> if<00:06:09.719> this<00:06:09.900> is<00:06:09.960> wrong

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
way I found to do it if this is wrong

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.450 
way I found to do it if this is wrong
somebody<00:06:12.810> let<00:06:13.020> me<00:06:13.050> know<00:06:13.169> it<00:06:14.069> seemed<00:06:14.279> to<00:06:14.400> work

part<00:06:34.920> of<00:06:35.040> the<00:06:35.100> job<00:06:35.570> I'm<00:06:36.570> going<00:06:36.780> to<00:06:36.870> make<00:06:36.990> it

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110

look<00:06:37.230> easy<00:06:37.910> there<00:06:38.910> we<00:06:39.090> go

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550 
look easy there we go

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.380 
look easy there we go
actually<00:06:41.550> took<00:06:41.670> a<00:06:41.790> lot<00:06:42.000> longer<00:06:42.180> than<00:06:42.360> that<00:06:42.540> but

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:44.390 
actually took a lot longer than that but

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.430 
actually took a lot longer than that but
hopefully<00:06:45.390> the<00:06:45.480> next<00:06:45.690> time<00:06:45.870> I<00:06:45.900> do<00:06:46.050> it<00:06:46.230> it<00:06:46.260> would

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
hopefully the next time I do it it would

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.180 
hopefully the next time I do it it would
be<00:06:46.530> a<00:06:46.560> lot<00:06:46.800> faster<00:06:47.790> and<00:06:47.970> easier<00:06:48.980> since<00:06:49.980> I've

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.190 
be a lot faster and easier since I've

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.600

this<00:06:57.630> was<00:06:58.670> probably<00:06:59.670> needed<00:07:00.180> a<00:07:00.390> few<00:07:01.080> thousand
