00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
finishing they had all that together so

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.120 
finishing they had all that together so
it<00:01:42.930> was<00:01:43.049> great<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.470> was<00:01:43.500> terrific<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.979> watch

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
it was great that was terrific to watch

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.670 
it was great that was terrific to watch
argentina<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.930> ones<00:01:46.110> i<00:01:46.259> took<00:01:46.290> for<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
argentina and the ones i took for the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.219 
argentina and the ones i took for the
world<00:01:46.860> cup<00:01:46.950> before<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.970> started<00:01:48.450> my<00:01:49.049> only

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
world cup before it started my only

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.880 
world cup before it started my only
reservation<00:01:49.439> was<00:01:50.630> diego<00:01:51.630> maradona<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
reservation was diego maradona and the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.530 
reservation was diego maradona and the
reason<00:01:53.070> for<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.670> because<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
reason for that is because in the

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.990 
reason for that is because in the
qualifying<00:01:55.020> matches<00:01:55.799> he<00:01:56.100> made<00:01:56.280> five<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.790> six

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
qualifying matches he made five and six

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.179 
qualifying matches he made five and six
changes<00:01:57.270> after<00:01:57.570> every<00:01:57.899> defeat<00:01:58.200> now<00:01:58.979> if<00:01:59.100> you

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
changes after every defeat now if you

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.100 
changes after every defeat now if you
did<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.640> world<00:01:59.820> cup<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.840> know<00:02:00.960> that

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
did that in the world cup you know that

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.139 
did that in the world cup you know that
the<00:02:01.170> players<00:02:01.380> are<00:02:01.500> gonna<00:02:01.590> lose<00:02:01.799> heart<00:02:02.149> what

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
the players are gonna lose heart what

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.700 
the players are gonna lose heart what
happened<00:02:03.479> or<00:02:03.630> was<00:02:03.780> there<00:02:03.990> won<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.259> first<00:02:04.439> game

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
happened or was there won the first game

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.590 
happened or was there won the first game
so<00:02:05.250> when<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.520> when<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:05.729> first<00:02:05.969> game<00:02:06.270> like<00:02:06.479> he

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
so when you when you first game like he

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.150 
so when you when you first game like he
did<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:07.740> only<00:02:07.860> make<00:02:08.069> one

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
did you only make one

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.310 
did you only make one
to<00:02:09.370> what<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.670> most<00:02:09.880> changes<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:10.630> let<00:02:11.200> you

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
to what the most changes and let you

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.440 
to what the most changes and let you
only<00:02:11.440> do<00:02:11.590> them<00:02:11.800> because<00:02:11.920> of<00:02:12.190> injury<00:02:12.460> so<00:02:13.060> diego

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
only do them because of injury so diego

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.300 
only do them because of injury so diego
maradona<00:02:13.660> at<00:02:13.960> this<00:02:14.050> moment<00:02:14.200> in<00:02:14.380> time<00:02:14.410> is

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
maradona at this moment in time is

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.920 
maradona at this moment in time is
probably<00:02:15.820> managing<00:02:16.330> better<00:02:16.630> than<00:02:16.810> he's<00:02:16.900> ever

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
probably managing better than he's ever

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.230 
probably managing better than he's ever
managed<00:02:17.470> in<00:02:17.980> his<00:02:18.190> managerial<00:02:18.580> career<00:02:18.880> so<00:02:19.210> far

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
managed in his managerial career so far

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.180 
managed in his managerial career so far
so<00:02:19.600> that<00:02:19.720> gives<00:02:19.900> them<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.170> real<00:02:20.320> chance<00:02:20.620> you

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
so that gives them a real chance you

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.450 
so that gives them a real chance you
know<00:02:21.220> unless<00:02:21.520> they<00:02:21.700> come<00:02:21.850> up<00:02:22.000> with<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.150> hiding

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
know unless they come up with a hiding

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.400 
know unless they come up with a hiding
by<00:02:24.460> in<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.820> third<00:02:24.850> third<00:02:25.570> game<00:02:25.900> but<00:02:26.140> then<00:02:26.290> he

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
by in the third third game but then he

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.480 
by in the third third game but then he
probably<00:02:26.770> thinks<00:02:26.980> all<00:02:27.160> we've<00:02:27.310> already

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
probably thinks all we've already

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.950 
probably thinks all we've already
qualified<00:02:28.030> we've<00:02:28.210> got<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.420> six<00:02:28.600> points<00:02:28.930> in

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
qualified we've got the six points in

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.990 
qualified we've got the six points in
the<00:02:29.050> bag<00:02:29.200> now<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:30.010> maybe<00:02:30.310> I'm<00:02:30.490> just<00:02:30.580> gonna<00:02:30.760> try

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
the bag now and maybe I'm just gonna try

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.880 
the bag now and maybe I'm just gonna try
one<00:02:31.030> or<00:02:31.300> two<00:02:31.390> players<00:02:31.660> out<00:02:31.900> but<00:02:32.200> oh<00:02:32.230> but<00:02:32.680> now
