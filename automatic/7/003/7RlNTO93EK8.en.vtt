00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
consume as opposed to having put

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.940 
consume as opposed to having put

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.090 
pretty good and it applies very well
like<00:01:48.509> other<00:01:48.659> around<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.320> balm<00:01:49.500> products<00:01:49.920> I

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
like other around the balm products I

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.230 
like other around the balm products I
wouldn't<00:01:50.640> say<00:01:50.790> that

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
wouldn't say that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.120 
wouldn't say that
green<00:01:51.570> tea<00:01:51.810> lip<00:01:52.049> balm<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.590> going<00:01:52.950> to

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
products but I do think that this is a

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.010 
products but I do think that this is a
winner<00:02:00.880> if<00:02:01.120> you<00:02:01.210> are<00:02:01.360> someone<00:02:01.630> who<00:02:01.659> likes
