00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.200
 hello to all friends of the san bassiano 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.150
 when they are supreme but I had changes 15 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.309
 point better than samsung galaxy ace 6 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.500
 apple iphone 6 for a very good 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.670
 tight comparison dimensional comparison 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.890
 of aesthetics and we want to do 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.169
 feature of the features 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.399
 we have for the samsung galaxy 6 11 from 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:30.739
 5.1 inches then 577 pisa per inch 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:34.430
 with display little more than hd for the iphone 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:36.470
 6 4.7 inches from the pixars sharply 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.360
 lower than that of the galaxy s 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.190
 6 both in white color 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.500
 as you can see they both have the frames 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.810
 in aluminum they are slightly different 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.840
 as from the holes they are more rounded I hope 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:50.150
 that you have seen them while that of 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.280
 samsung the new species of let's say 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.650
 inner edge that goes with a drop between 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.470
 quotes that can only be seen from 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.840
 I live in photos is a difficult video to make you 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.040
 to show it low part is to say that 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.860
 really looks a lot like 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.470
 surely the grid is double here 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.299
 his daughter, like on the iPhone, however, is 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.470
 undeniable to say that in short, from this 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.100
 point of view surely resumed 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.670
 something 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.920
 the central key then physical brand 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.909
 ambiguous we also have multitasking button 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.030
 and back on the back 8 camera 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.190
 megapixel with autofocus and flash LED e 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.380
 with from a 16 megapixel and you were with 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.680
 optical stabilizer with autofocus 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.360
 flash LED and also there of the sensor of how 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.490
 always scale your heart rate for 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.470
 the era i galaxy s 6 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.600
 the back of the s6 is in gorilla glass 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.000
 glass 4 as well as frontal abbot while 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.080
 for the iPhone 6 the income is in aluminum 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.119
 as you see personally in the version 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.890
 white I prefer the s6 because you don't 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.420
 they also see many fingerprints, however, six 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.010
 in other colors between tenderly 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.080
 lots of nannies and they show up and giving 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.570
 However much trouble making the 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.390
 dimensions as they are despite the 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.950
 both display and 4.7 inch then 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.960
 definitely smaller in size not 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.189
 they are so different they have yes and no two 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:10.429
 millimeters high and about 3 mm in 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.200
 ie width but maybe 43 mm from then 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.170
 very few be the difference too 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.870
 weight is not so different from a dozen 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.159
 grams therefore little thing 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.920
 obviously I'll make a comparison more 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.410
 detailed 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.120
 the tournament in italy when i have them go 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.760
 both good bad in hand for 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.650
 review however features 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.580
 let's finish the features speech 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:35.580
 processor here is an 8 core exynos from 1.8 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.430
 ghz 64 bit bride you had to shoot 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.140
 sorry I don't have 2.1 gb 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.750
 here now we have more precise ones 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.989
 quad core 1.5gb 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.459
 when 5 3 gigabytes of ram 32 are 400 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.930
 gigabytes while for the iPhone we have 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.670
 money makes us 8 of samsung dual core e 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.650
 sana look bit and with a gigabyte of ram 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:00.780
 and 16 64 128 GB of internal memory for i 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.640

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.110
