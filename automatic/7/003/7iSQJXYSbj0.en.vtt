amp<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.149> reviewed<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.230> few<00:00:40.469> years<00:00:40.649> back<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.219> it

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
amp I reviewed a few years back and it

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.369 
amp I reviewed a few years back and it
was<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.430> cool<00:00:41.670> device<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.840> very<00:00:43.110> similar

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
was a cool device this is very similar

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.209 
was a cool device this is very similar
but<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:44.520> improved<00:00:44.910> quite<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.719> bit<00:00:45.950> quite<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> few

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
but it improved quite a bit quite a few

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.850 
but it improved quite a bit quite a few
things<00:00:47.399> have<00:00:47.670> been<00:00:47.760> approved<00:00:48.410> notably<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
things have been approved notably the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.220 
things have been approved notably the
balance<00:00:50.340> between<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.760> different<00:00:51.059> amps<00:00:51.390> when

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
balance between the different amps when

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.160 
balance between the different amps when
I<00:00:52.260> tried<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:53.670> very<00:00:54.000> first<00:00:54.300> pocket<00:00:54.840> amp<00:00:55.020> I

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
I tried the very first pocket amp I

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.240 
I tried the very first pocket amp I
thought<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.710> there<00:00:56.039> was<00:00:56.219> some<00:00:57.030> kind<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.300> a

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
thought that there was some kind of a

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.849 
thought that there was some kind of a
discrepancy<00:00:59.250> between<00:00:59.370> the<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.780> clean<00:01:01.260> amps

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
discrepancy between the the clean amps

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.520 
discrepancy between the the clean amps
and<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.550> heavy<00:01:02.879> amps<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.690> voicings<00:01:04.199> were<00:01:04.350> not

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
and the heavy amps the voicings were not

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.980 
and the heavy amps the voicings were not
quite<00:01:04.890> balanced<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:06.270> clean<00:01:06.479> apps<00:01:06.689> are<00:01:06.840> really

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
quite balanced the clean apps are really

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.050 
quite balanced the clean apps are really
really<00:01:07.350> low<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.740> volume<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.490> always<00:01:08.790> had<00:01:08.970> to

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
really low in volume and I always had to

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.600 
really low in volume and I always had to
adjust<00:01:09.330> things<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:10.140> fix<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.619> every<00:01:11.070> amp<00:01:11.340> is

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
adjust things to fix that every amp is

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.929 
adjust things to fix that every amp is
now<00:01:12.270> really<00:01:12.869> well<00:01:13.080> balanced<00:01:13.650> it's<00:01:14.460> super

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
now really well balanced it's super

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.060 
now really well balanced it's super
simple<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.420> use<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:16.020> basically<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.619> for

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
simple to use and basically this is for

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.840 
simple to use and basically this is for
those<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.060> who<00:01:18.630> want<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.409> record<00:01:19.860> quality

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
those of you who want to record quality

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.780 
those of you who want to record quality

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
guitars and that are on a budget which

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.260 
guitars and that are on a budget which
is<00:01:23.970> basically<00:01:24.360> every<00:01:25.259> guitar<00:01:25.530> player<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.830> know

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
is basically every guitar player I know

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.270 
is basically every guitar player I know
it<00:01:27.270> doesn't<00:01:27.540> have<00:01:27.810> tons<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.170> options<00:01:28.560> which<00:01:29.130> is

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
it doesn't have tons of options which is

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.880 
it doesn't have tons of options which is
why<00:01:29.460> it's<00:01:29.670> affordable<00:01:30.150> but<00:01:30.869> what<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.380> does<00:01:31.560> it

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
why it's affordable but what it does it

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.469 
why it's affordable but what it does it
does<00:01:31.950> really<00:01:32.490> well<00:01:32.759> there<00:01:33.119> are<00:01:33.210> three

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
does really well there are three

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.420 
does really well there are three
different<00:01:33.810> amp<00:01:33.990> models<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.770> there's<00:01:35.310> a

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430
