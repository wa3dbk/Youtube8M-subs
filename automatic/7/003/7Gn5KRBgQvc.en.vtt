00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.619
 450 grams of flour from which milk 200 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.740
 milliliters yeast sugar 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.699
 raisin salt vanilla doubles 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:27.589
 50 grams of margarine or butter 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:30.839
 250 grams of cottage cheese and vegetable oil 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:32.329
 knead the dough for this bowl pour 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:35.930
 milk 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:40.530
 milk temperature is 36 37 degrees 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:43.039
 add a tablespoon of yeast and 2 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.949
 tablespoons of sugar 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:48.300
 mix everything well and wait for now 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:53.519
 hints will appear 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:56.120
 cap and dump when the yeast is good 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:01:03.059
 stammer keep kneading dough 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:05.839
 add a little of you to the tea 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.839
 a spoonful of salt 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:16.810
 melted margarine or cream 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:16.810
 butter a tablespoon of vegetable oil 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.710
 now we divide eggs into yolks and squirrels 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.520
 one protein is added immediately to the dough 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:46.840
 two. and leave the protein until 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:47.619
 separately all mix well and 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.340
 add 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:55.679
 add flour doll gradually 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.679
 knead soft and plastic dough 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.610
 flour is different so we mix dough 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.380
 until she stops 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.000
 to stick to my hands but nonetheless 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:20.050
 it will remain soft to overload the dough 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.050
 not worth the flour 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.290
 u so softly elastic should 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.840
 turn out the dough ready dough set 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.890
 a towel and wait until it is good 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.200
 Approach time is closely dependent on 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.340
 yeast quality and temperature in which 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.250
 Do you have a dough ? 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.230
 prepare the filling for cheesecakes for 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:03:00.150
 this in the cottage cheese add a little salt 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:00.150
 2 tablespoons of sugar yolks 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:12.299
 a little vanilla and a couple of handfuls 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.299
 raisins mix well 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:24.720
 all the stuffing is ready wait for now 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.250
 suitable if the dough is rather dry cottage cheese 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.090
 you can add a couple of canteens to the filling 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.950
 spoons 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:34.670
 sour cream when the dough is well suited 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.010
 you can start cutting cheesecakes 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:41.180
 hands and table surface grease 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.180
 grow oil on 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.739
 the dough now needs to be divided by 16 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.849
 pieces of this amount is obtained 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.849
 16 cheesecakes 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.830
 now every piece of dough rolls 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.830
 ball 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.740
 balls stacked at a distance from each 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:41.150
 friend on an oiled baking sheet and 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.150
 give them a little approach 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:55.770
 when the balls fit we press them and 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:58.680
 we make from them lozenges the center of lozenges 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:06.210
 I press and a lot of glass smeared in 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:09.230
 oil and deepening impose stuffing 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.230
 from cottage cheese 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:40.470
 cheesecakes butchered put set to warm up 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.720
 oven up to 180 degrees is 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.410
 warm up the oven in our carcass well 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.480
 will fit 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.480
 and we can now egg white 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.590
 the surface of the cheesecakes grease the egg for 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.580
 the fact that something was ruddy on them 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.580
 beautiful crust 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:09.300
 the oven warmed up the cheesecakes came up 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:11.640
 put them on baking baked cheesecakes not 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.720
 so long don't run anywhere so that 

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.270
 they are not burnt 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:19.010
 Oven will you groomsman to the readiness 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.010
 there is a golden brown crust 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:26.689
