00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.860
 the balance that we already make in 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.980
 the last few months the showcase has been very 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.110
 positive beginning because we have new 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.940

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.109
 came with new changes to the program to 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.119

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.349

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.440
 exalt what those Venezuelans are 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.880
 palante thrown that have had some 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.850
 difficulty in life that they have had 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.440
 some accident or some problem that the 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.230
 has left with some disability and that 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.550
 there was no limit to move forward and 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.840

 we have new sections there is one that is 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.140
 call wall here that I love 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.820
 very much because it exalts everything that 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.650
 we Venezuelans have many 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.210
 Sometimes we do not notice those sites 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.580
 that we can visit for example an end 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.170

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.330
 or outside caracas but that we have so 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.250
 near us and we do not go out to 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.170

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.320
 to be able to enjoy all that I think 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.670
 showcase watching because you can feel that 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.250
 you are watching a magazine that you are going through 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.170
 the pages and you talk about a little bit 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.660
 we can touch current issues to 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.460

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.500
 section called abu tape where 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.370
