00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 Nine people welcome to the second part 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.029
 together if you do not know 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.519
 that we make here then look at you 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.099
 first part 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.929
 we are doing the following and indeed already 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.590
 us the mainboard lie 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:20.460
 and then comes the cpu of the cpu 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.609
 cooler and the working memory that build 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.230
 we do not enter the housing directly 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.840
 comes when it is on the mainboard 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.560
 so into the housing and so we facilitate 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.940
 We'll catch some work 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.260
 All work should be done with magic 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.040
 and fat-free hands 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.200
 become 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.480
 furthermore, a grounding is touched by 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.059
 a vacancy of the heating or the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.770
 ps of a socket very important first 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.870
 you leave the cpu bracket over the 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.430
 Side bars in this of the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.469
 sockets pushed away and then completely 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.030
 The plastic lid is folded over 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.399
 Thief in the socket from damage 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.539
 now has to protect from the cpu bracket 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.190
 be pushed out 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.899
 The pins of the socket should be at all 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.270
 work should not be touched if possible 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.620
 on the cpu is clearly a golden one 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.600
 triangle in one of the four corners 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.640
 imprinted this mark and the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.710
 mark on the mainboard indicates in 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.570
 which direction the cdu is used 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.430
 most of the time there is the mark 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.260
 of the mainboard right next to the socket 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.159
 or on the previously removed 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.080
 plastic lid 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.909
 here is the mark right next to the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.100
 to find socket on the pcb 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.990
 in the cpu is to be noted that one 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.759
 These best always only on the sides 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.530
 and never at the contacts on the 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.049
 Back touch after careful 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.909
 Inserting the cpu is easy 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.939
 and come back to check if the cpu 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.159
 properly sits the cpu bracket must now 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.650
 gently lowered to the cpu 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.180
 the two teeth of the cdu bracket need 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.189
 to be under the screw 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.810
 After that, the strap can be careful again 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.070
 put down and arrest them 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.140
 be used 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.420
 Usually you need something more for that 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.070
 power and the resulting relative 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.079
 but brutal-sounding noises are 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.909
 completely normal 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.920
 depending on which cpu cooler you look at 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.570
 the installation can be very high 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.159
 be different it is worthwhile in 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.960
 but in each case a look in the 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.530
 enclosed installation instructions too 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.060
 take risk 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.829
 there you also learn which 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.610
 accessories for the respective socket 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.780
 are important 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.030
 the cpu cooler mostly for several 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.890
 should be developed first 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.290
 you get all the necessary accessories 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.280
 lay out 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.290
 then the backlight becomes the 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.430
 cpu-cooler the necessary stop with the 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.900
 associated screws and 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.880
 spacers on the back 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.319
 install the right holes 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.000
 in the mountains are so that the 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.860
 Backplate just on the back of the 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.550
 sitting on mainboards one experiences in one 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.550
 installation Guide 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.670
 The mainboard must now be careful 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.629
 be turned around without the screws 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.730
 to fall out of the holes 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.129
 Now the nuts have to be screwed on 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.819
 be careful first then carefully 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.819
 with a screwdriver 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.500
 the nuts are sitting on the top of the 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.450
 mainboards securely and firmly in need 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.470
 macho 120 another plate 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.450
 be screwed on 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.160
 This one is for the right fit and 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.160
 hold the cpu cooler responsible 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.720
 but before the cpu cooler on the cpu 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.190
 this can still be set 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.560
 thermal paste be provided 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.299
 here the motto is less is more 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.519
 the thermal grease is just for this purpose 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:27.250
 serve the bumps and called up 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.330
 the leader of the cdu as well as the cpu-cooler 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.220
 compensate 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.500
 the thermal paste is first through 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.659
 few points applied to the cpu 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.829
 is not a small spatula at the cpu 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.360
 cooler included 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.220
 so can a piece of cardboard for 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.959
 example from the packaging of the cpu 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.760
 the thermal grease is misused 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.890
 is now carefully passed 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.750
 the pressure of the cpu cooler distributes the 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.700
 thermal paste later evenly 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.049
 that's why it's not bad if not 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.870
 every single millimeter with 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.849
 Thermal grease is covered now must 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.209
 the protective film pulled from the cpu cooler 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.879
 become 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.319
 the macho 120 is installed that way 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.540
 the narrow side to the main memory 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.140
 shows and so for this sufficient 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.140
 place is 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.610
 with a long screwdriver with 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.650
 magnetic head like the one at Mud 120 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.540
 Supplied must now the screws 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.489
 be screwed in by readjusting 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.570
 the cpu-cooler should be as centered as possible 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.570
 sitting on the cpu 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.340
 now after the cpu-cooler solid and 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.960
 safely screwed to the mainboard 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.940
 is ensured by a scrutinizing look 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.470
 if made by too tight 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.360
 screwed the mainboard has bent 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.400
 this is the case, the screws have to be screwed 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.080
 be loosened a bit 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.790
 during the installation of the 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.360
 there is not much to memory 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.310
 note 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.229
 This only fits in one direction in the 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.880
 the provided ram benches on the 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.650
 Bottom of each memory 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.389
 Riege is a little notch too 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.340
 see the wrong plug 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.539
 prevents the locks must 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.400
 be solved first 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.199
 the main memory will now be 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.690
 put in and by gentle pressure 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.460
 india memory banks locked which 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.900
 memory banks must be occupied 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.900
 in the manual of the mainboard 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.240
 seat of the main memory in its place 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.380
 all you have to do is ventilate the cpu cooler 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.420
 be attached 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.400
 It should be noted that on this 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.560
 to find a case is the 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.390
 Direction of the air flow indicates this 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.820
 arrow should point to the cooler 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.530
 through the enclosed gummiplatz we 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.180
 not as stated in the instructions 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.890
 the cooler but the fan 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:43.500
 hoped to have glued thermaltake 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:45.090
 a lesser noise the hangers 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.220
 which hold the fan in place 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.840
 need to be at macho 120 before the 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.120
 Installation of the fan attached 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.700
 The cable of the fan can be like 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.560
 be guided here so that no big 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.420
 bend is created and later during installation 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.510
 of the entire structure hanging nowhere 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.250
 last remains only now 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.170
 the tri poli cable in the for 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.690
 be put in the intended connection 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.760
 this is usually in cpu near and beside 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.100
 he has an imprint than as 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.840
 cpu fan mark that was it with the 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.670
 second part of our very third 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.830
 build part like the mainboard including cpu 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.480
 RAM and cpu cooler in the 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.520
 housing and become everyone else 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.990
 you have installed this component
