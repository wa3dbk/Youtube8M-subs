00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
back to Home Depot these brackets we've

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.359 
back to Home Depot these brackets we've
been<00:00:28.500> using<00:00:28.619> which<00:00:28.830> are<00:00:28.949> actually<00:00:29.189> deck

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
been using which are actually deck

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.769 
been using which are actually deck
brackets<00:00:29.789> which<00:00:29.910> are<00:00:30.060> I've<00:00:30.449> dealt<00:00:30.720> with

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
brackets which are I've dealt with

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.310 
brackets which are I've dealt with
before<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.230> they're<00:00:31.439> really<00:00:31.650> simple

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
before and they're really simple

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.569 
before and they're really simple
they're<00:00:34.320> great<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.649> use<00:00:34.829> but<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.130> got<00:00:35.250> shorter

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
they're great to use but we got shorter

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.520 
they're great to use but we got shorter
one<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.820> them<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.120> we're<00:00:36.270> going<00:00:36.360> back<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.660> come

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
one of them so we're going back to come

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.740 
one of them so we're going back to come
back<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.800> store<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.040> get<00:00:38.160> another<00:00:38.309> one<00:00:38.750> and

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
back to the store to get another one and

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.180 
back to the store to get another one and
wouldn't<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.140> know<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.290> there<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.800> sitting

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
wouldn't you know it there it is sitting

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.200 
wouldn't you know it there it is sitting
in<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.370> garbage<00:00:41.640> can

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
in the garbage can

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.910 
in the garbage can
must<00:00:42.420> have<00:00:42.540> fallen<00:00:42.660> out<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.020> card<00:00:43.230> right

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
must have fallen out of the card right

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.440 
must have fallen out of the card right
now<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:44.129> actually<00:00:44.430> had<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.820> bit<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.149> saloon

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
now we actually had a bit of a saloon

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.360 
now we actually had a bit of a saloon
not<00:00:45.600> just<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.960> vent<00:00:46.140> bracket<00:00:46.559> but<00:00:46.739> also<00:00:47.010> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
not just the vent bracket but also the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.600 
not just the vent bracket but also the
fact<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:49.320> tape<00:00:49.500> was<00:00:49.530> too<00:00:49.800> high<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
fact that the tape was too high so the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.369 
fact that the tape was too high so the
fact<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.879> it's<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.149> three<00:00:51.329> foot<00:00:51.510> deep<00:00:51.870> table

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
fact that it's a three foot deep table

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.729 
fact that it's a three foot deep table
was<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.559> bit<00:00:53.570> with<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.719> height<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.050> 42<00:00:55.440> inches

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
was a bit with the height of 42 inches

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.010 
was a bit with the height of 42 inches
and<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.760> Adige<00:00:57.059> inch<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.539> top<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
and and the Adige inch on the top of the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.680 
and and the Adige inch on the top of the
top<00:00:58.230> plus<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.280> depth<00:00:59.850> of<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> entire<00:01:00.449> table

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
top plus the depth of the entire table

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.860 
top plus the depth of the entire table
it<00:01:01.079> ended<00:01:01.530> up<00:01:01.590> being<00:01:01.800> pretty<00:01:02.210> pretty<00:01:03.210> huge<00:01:03.480> so

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
it ended up being pretty pretty huge so

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.870 
it ended up being pretty pretty huge so
we<00:01:04.140> just<00:01:04.350> cut<00:01:04.559> off<00:01:04.680> three<00:01:04.799> inches<00:01:05.129> still<00:01:05.640> fits

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
we just cut off three inches still fits

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.179 
we just cut off three inches still fits
above<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.330> pipe<00:01:06.540> there<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.990> we<00:01:07.890> should<00:01:07.920> be

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
above that pipe there and we should be

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.070 
above that pipe there and we should be
ready<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.580> go<00:01:08.670> here<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.060> little<00:01:09.150> bit<00:01:09.299> so

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
ready to go here in a little bit so

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.510 
ready to go here in a little bit so
right<00:01:10.229> now<00:01:10.380> we're<00:01:10.530> measuring<00:01:10.890> up<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.340> last

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
right now we're measuring up the last

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.859 
right now we're measuring up the last
bit

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
bit

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.200 
bit
the<00:01:13.200> final<00:01:13.530> cross<00:01:13.710> piece<00:01:13.979> house<00:01:14.760> measuring

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the final cross piece house measuring

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.060 
the final cross piece house measuring
there<00:01:15.590> we've<00:01:16.590> got<00:01:16.619> all<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.920> brackets

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
there we've got all the brackets

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.070 
there we've got all the brackets
together<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.700> everything<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.210> get<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> couple

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
together and everything and get a couple

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.910 
together and everything and get a couple
more<00:01:19.170> cuts<00:01:19.350> then<00:01:19.590> we<00:01:19.680> should<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> big<00:01:20.970> L

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
more cuts then we should have a big L

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:32.870 
more cuts then we should have a big L
the<00:01:22.920> way<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.130> works<00:01:31.189> long<00:01:32.189> cross<00:01:32.549> brace

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
the way this works long cross brace

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:45.770 
the way this works long cross brace
across<00:01:33.270> here<00:01:38.450> so<00:01:41.509> Kyle<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.750> testing<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:44.780> brace

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
across here so Kyle is testing the brace

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.080 
across here so Kyle is testing the brace
there<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.350> middle<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.610> seems<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.000> be

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
there in the middle so it seems to be

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.639 
there in the middle so it seems to be
holding<00:01:48.210> up<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.689> don't<00:01:48.810> know<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.259> brackets

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
holding up I don't know the brackets

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.560 
holding up I don't know the brackets
work<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.130> we<00:01:50.909> actually<00:01:51.149> ended<00:01:51.270> up<00:01:51.390> only

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
work and we actually ended up only

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.520 
work and we actually ended up only
putting<00:01:51.899> two<00:01:52.350> two<00:01:53.130> screws<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.700> end<00:01:53.850> here

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
putting two two screws in the end here

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.389 
putting two two screws in the end here

we<00:02:02.759> never<00:02:03.090> we<00:02:03.390> never<00:02:03.420> would<00:02:03.750> tell<00:02:03.990> what<00:02:04.350> that

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
we never we never would tell what that

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.070 
we never we never would tell what that
is

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.270 

we're<00:02:10.229> going<00:02:10.350> to<00:02:10.410> use<00:02:10.530> it's<00:02:10.800> actually<00:02:10.950> there's

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
we're going to use it's actually there's

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.030 
we're going to use it's actually there's
more<00:02:11.310> over<00:02:11.550> there<00:02:11.640> but<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.860> particle<00:02:13.860> were<00:02:13.950> to

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
more over there but the particle were to

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.070 
more over there but the particle were to
think<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.610> so<00:02:15.360> we're<00:02:15.510> going<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:15.720> put<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.870> piece

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
think and so we're going to put a piece

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.810 
think and so we're going to put a piece
of<00:02:16.110> plywood<00:02:16.470> here<00:02:16.830> which<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.400> same<00:02:17.580> size

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
of plywood here which is the same size

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.640 
of plywood here which is the same size
this<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.030> 8<00:02:18.270> foot<00:02:18.480> long<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:19.110> they<00:02:19.260> have<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.470> cut

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
this is 8 foot long and they have to cut

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.390 
this is 8 foot long and they have to cut
a<00:02:19.860> 6-foot<00:02:20.310> section<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:20.990> fit<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.260> then<00:02:22.890> put

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
a 6-foot section to fit and then put

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.200 
a 6-foot section to fit and then put
cardboard<00:02:23.640> on<00:02:23.910> it

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
cardboard on it

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.450 
cardboard on it
start<00:02:24.720> building<00:02:25.080> shelves<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.530> should<00:02:26.370> be

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
start building shelves and should be

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.980 
start building shelves and should be
good<00:02:26.810> all<00:02:27.810> right

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
good all right

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
and so I just got the cross bracing gun

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.720 
and so I just got the cross bracing gun
and<00:02:30.630> it's<00:02:31.590> actually<00:02:31.980> really<00:02:32.220> sturdy<00:02:32.640> and

gonna<00:04:00.740> be<00:04:00.860> installing<00:04:01.070> a<00:04:01.340> switch<00:04:01.520> right<00:04:01.730> there

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
gonna be installing a switch right there

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.820 
gonna be installing a switch right there
next<00:04:02.060> to<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.240> window<00:04:02.540> and<00:04:02.720> you<00:04:03.470> can<00:04:03.560> see<00:04:03.680> some

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
of the lights are in here and next up

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.310 
of the lights are in here and next up
I'll<00:04:05.330> show<00:04:05.360> a<00:04:05.600> test<00:04:05.900> of<00:04:06.230> them<00:04:06.470> working<00:04:08.320> it's

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
I'll show a test of them working it's

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.660 
I'll show a test of them working it's
kind<00:04:09.500> of<00:04:09.530> amazing<00:04:09.740> the<00:04:10.070> things<00:04:10.100> that<00:04:10.460> can<00:04:10.520> make

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
kind of amazing the things that can make

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
so when you have a sense of the contrast

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.780 
so when you have a sense of the contrast
of<00:04:22.290> how<00:04:23.290> filthy<00:04:23.680> disgusting<00:04:23.950> these<00:04:24.400> walls<00:04:24.610> are

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
of how filthy disgusting these walls are

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.420 
of how filthy disgusting these walls are
you<00:04:24.880> can<00:04:25.000> see<00:04:25.120> up<00:04:25.210> there<00:04:26.160> that's<00:04:27.160> right<00:04:27.310> where

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
you can see up there that's right where

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.880 
you can see up there that's right where
the<00:04:27.460> line<00:04:27.640> is<00:04:27.820> hard<00:04:28.540> to<00:04:28.630> see<00:04:28.810> this<00:04:29.560> lighting

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
the line is hard to see this lighting

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.450 
the line is hard to see this lighting
over<00:04:30.850> here<00:04:31.290> so<00:04:32.290> yeah<00:04:32.470> I<00:04:32.620> decided<00:04:32.920> to<00:04:33.070> paint<00:04:33.250> I

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
over here so yeah I decided to paint I

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.520 
over here so yeah I decided to paint I
think<00:04:33.790> a<00:04:33.820> couple<00:04:33.970> snapshots<00:04:34.270> but<00:04:34.780> that<00:04:35.500> I

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
think a couple snapshots but that I

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.850 
think a couple snapshots but that I
should<00:04:35.740> show<00:04:35.890> it<00:04:36.010> on<00:04:36.100> video<00:04:36.250> too<00:04:36.640> so<00:04:37.470> I<00:04:38.470> kind<00:04:38.830> of

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
should show it on video too so I kind of

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.320 
should show it on video too so I kind of
skipped<00:04:39.070> some<00:04:39.220> time<00:04:39.400> here<00:04:39.670> but<00:04:39.910> I've<00:04:40.090> already

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
skipped some time here but I've already

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.300 
skipped some time here but I've already
installed<00:04:40.720> some<00:04:41.440> of<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.590> conduit<00:04:41.920> there<00:04:42.130> for

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
installed some of the conduit there for

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.310 
installed some of the conduit there for
the<00:04:42.370> power<00:04:42.550> and<00:04:42.880> you<00:04:43.780> can<00:04:43.900> see<00:04:44.050> I've<00:04:44.170> also

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
the power and you can see I've also

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.520 
the power and you can see I've also
actually<00:04:44.710> installed<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.400> shelf<00:04:46.530> supports

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
actually installed the shelf supports

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.140 
actually installed the shelf supports
going<00:04:47.770> straight<00:04:48.100> up<00:04:48.190> the<00:04:48.220> wall<00:04:48.310> there<00:04:48.640> so

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
going straight up the wall there so

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.760 
going straight up the wall there so
wanted<00:04:49.630> to<00:04:49.690> show<00:04:49.810> that<00:04:49.840> off<00:04:50.200> and<00:04:50.440> show<00:04:50.650> off

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
wanted to show that off and show off

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.790 
wanted to show that off and show off
that<00:04:51.310> the<00:04:51.520> once<00:04:51.850> the<00:04:52.150> power<00:04:52.990> is<00:04:53.110> installed<00:04:53.560> I

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
that the once the power is installed I

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.230 
that the once the power is installed I
actually<00:04:54.130> won't<00:04:54.460> be<00:04:54.580> able<00:04:54.730> to<00:04:54.790> move<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.090> bench

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
actually won't be able to move the bench

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.790 
actually won't be able to move the bench
again<00:04:55.540> so<00:04:55.960> I<00:04:55.990> thought<00:04:56.110> that<00:04:56.260> was<00:04:56.320> important<00:04:56.710> to

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
again so I thought that was important to

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.890 
again so I thought that was important to
point<00:04:57.190> out<00:04:58.140> and<00:04:59.140> here<00:04:59.380> is<00:04:59.530> the<00:04:59.770> final<00:05:00.900> mixer

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
point out and here is the final mixer

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.800 
point out and here is the final mixer
board<00:05:02.230> holder<00:05:02.650> thingy<00:05:03.000> so<00:05:04.000> maybe<00:05:04.390> I<00:05:04.570> owe<00:05:04.660> you

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
board holder thingy so maybe I owe you

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.760 
board holder thingy so maybe I owe you
at<00:05:04.870> the<00:05:04.930> mixing<00:05:05.170> board<00:05:05.290> there<00:05:05.470> I<00:05:05.500> wanted<00:05:05.710> to

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
at the mixing board there I wanted to

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.490 
at the mixing board there I wanted to
see<00:05:05.860> what<00:05:05.950> that<00:05:06.070> looked<00:05:06.220> like<00:05:06.900> cord<00:05:07.900> cords

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
see what that looked like cord cords

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.520 
see what that looked like cord cords
will<00:05:08.620> go<00:05:08.710> over<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:08.890> top<00:05:09.070> here<00:05:09.340> so<00:05:09.490> there's<00:05:10.530> six

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
will go over the top here so there's six

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.400 
will go over the top here so there's six
XLR<00:05:12.340> inputs<00:05:12.700> that's<00:05:12.910> why<00:05:13.060> that's<00:05:13.270> there<00:05:13.480> and

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
XLR inputs that's why that's there and

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.710 
XLR inputs that's why that's there and
I'll<00:05:14.530> just<00:05:14.590> write<00:05:14.980> the<00:05:15.160> lines<00:05:15.940> back<00:05:16.390> through

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
I'll just write the lines back through

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.850 
I'll just write the lines back through
and<00:05:16.870> then<00:05:16.960> the<00:05:17.050> power<00:05:17.260> goes<00:05:17.320> down<00:05:17.620> the<00:05:17.710> middle

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
and then the power goes down the middle

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:35.040 
and then the power goes down the middle
to<00:05:18.070> try<00:05:18.100> and<00:05:32.220> alright<00:05:33.220> so<00:05:33.400> I<00:05:33.430> actually<00:05:34.050> figured

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
to try and alright so I actually figured

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.190 
to try and alright so I actually figured
out<00:05:35.080> what<00:05:35.230> to<00:05:35.320> do<00:05:35.410> with<00:05:35.560> that<00:05:35.590> space<00:05:36.280> there<00:05:37.200> cuz

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
out what to do with that space there cuz

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.740 
out what to do with that space there cuz
this<00:05:38.380> was<00:05:39.340> such<00:05:39.460> a<00:05:39.490> short<00:05:39.790> board<00:05:40.000> anyways<00:05:40.390> and

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
this was such a short board anyways and

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.520 
this was such a short board anyways and
I<00:05:40.950> realized<00:05:41.950> that<00:05:42.100> one<00:05:42.220> of<00:05:42.310> our<00:05:42.400> sponsors<00:05:43.530> and
