basket of the same exam so what do you

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.160 
basket of the same exam so what do you
what<00:01:11.700> do<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.820> feel<00:01:12.000> about<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.420> see<00:01:12.869> for<00:01:13.020> me<00:01:13.080> I

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
think that's a good thing the fact that

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.260 
think that's a good thing the fact that
they<00:01:14.700> didn't<00:01:14.909> try<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.960> know<00:01:15.990> regurgitated

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
are regurgitating in the sense that

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.690 
are regurgitating in the sense that
they're<00:01:19.740> bringing<00:01:20.040> back<00:01:20.070> something<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.460> we

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
they're bringing back something that we

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.679 
they're bringing back something that we
are<00:01:20.820> familiar<00:01:20.850> with<00:01:21.299> but<00:01:21.450> they're<00:01:21.600> not

are familiar with but they're not

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.390 
are familiar with but they're not
picking<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.259> like<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.740> know<00:01:22.830> changing<00:01:23.310> it

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
picking it in like you know changing it

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.740

exactly I think that's that's a huge

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.320 
exactly I think that's that's a huge
part<00:02:10.710> of<00:02:10.770> any<00:02:10.979> successful<00:02:11.460> games<00:02:11.730> act<00:02:11.940> being

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
part of any successful games act being

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.700 
part of any successful games act being
able<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.600> bring<00:02:12.900> in<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.140> audience<00:02:13.530> that

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
able to bring in the audience that

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.650 
able to bring in the audience that
doesn't<00:02:14.130> typically<00:02:14.550> play<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:14.970> game<00:02:15.150> if<00:02:15.540> you

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
doesn't typically play that game if you

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.180 
doesn't typically play that game if you
can<00:02:15.840> successfully<00:02:16.170> do<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:16.470> you've<00:02:16.920> got<00:02:17.070> it

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
can successfully do that you've got it

there's<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.040> gap<00:02:23.220> like<00:02:23.520> a<00:02:23.850> decade<00:02:24.240> gap<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:24.690> I

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
there's a gap like a decade gap and I

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.910 
there's a gap like a decade gap and I
wasn't<00:02:24.930> playing<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.290> again<00:02:25.350> it's<00:02:25.710> like<00:02:25.800> the

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.870 
realize what it is then it's just the
bells<00:05:32.810> and<00:05:32.960> whistles<00:05:33.199> around<00:05:33.500> that<00:05:33.770> yeah<00:05:34.039> and

an<00:06:47.100> uphill<00:06:47.340> battle<00:06:47.400> because<00:06:47.820> I<00:06:47.850> did<00:06:48.030> they

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.210 
an uphill battle because I did they

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.850 
an uphill battle because I did they
brought<00:06:48.419> back<00:06:48.570> exactly<00:06:49.110> what<00:06:49.229> we<00:06:49.320> wanted<00:06:49.650> and

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 
brought back exactly what we wanted and

now that we have what we wanted what are
they<00:06:51.900> do<00:06:51.960> next<00:06:52.440> well<00:06:52.979> I<00:06:53.010> think<00:06:53.039> right<00:06:53.370> now

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
they do next well I think right now

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.860 
they do next well I think right now
they're<00:06:53.880> probably<00:06:54.090> gonna<00:06:54.330> wait<00:06:54.570> and<00:06:54.690> see<00:06:54.840> I

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:54.870 
they're probably gonna wait and see I

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:55.670 
they're probably gonna wait and see I
don't<00:06:54.990> you<00:06:55.229> know<00:06:55.289> they<00:06:55.440> don't<00:06:55.470> really

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
don't you know they don't really

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.200 
don't you know they don't really
publicly<00:06:56.190> state<00:06:56.490> you<00:06:56.610> know<00:06:56.699> how<00:06:56.820> much<00:06:57.000> they've

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.210

so maybe for them if they see that as
success<00:07:01.560> maybe<00:07:01.979> it'll<00:07:02.130> just<00:07:02.220> leave<00:07:02.400> it<00:07:02.490> as<00:07:02.580> is

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:02.789 
success maybe it'll just leave it as is
