00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.840
 things that lacked grand theft auto 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:08.120
 5 These are some things that I believe 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.840
 that they would have done a better game to the gta 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.889
 5 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.710
 boxing they imagine trevor michael or 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.230
 frank learning to box that would have 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.540
 been epic or also learning karate 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.760
 a pity that they did not include it in this 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:29.190
 recent delivery the gym imagine 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.980
 trevor Maikel francs that could go to 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.440
 gym and improve your physical condition 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.360
 apart from entertaining it would be interesting 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.020
 control the weights and see our 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.170
 characters develop their musculature 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.080
 the restaurants who does not remember the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.210
 famous bourgeois shot would be great that in 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.340
 Gta 5 could be entered into the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.620
 restaurants and buy menus and fill yourself 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.560
 so much to vomit as did the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.750
 great follow it's sad that you can hardly 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.240
 buy food in a sad store 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.750
 in the saints in this gta 5 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.550
 the casinos the casino games are 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.140
 a series of mini- games of chance that 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.780
 they serve to keep going and win or lose 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.030
 money depending on the level of 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.490
 bettor you have and jay will be 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.400
 available ones or others also 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.710
 will influence the luck that karl possesses although 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.800
 the city of happiness is not in gta 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:28.430
 5 would have been great this too 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.980
 brides although in gta 5 you can 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.330
 together with friends and prostitutes would have 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.720
 It was great to have a girlfriend 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:41.930
 the clubs would have been great to be able to 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:45.650
 dance like in the old gta san andreas 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.240
 the atmosphere of the gangs in gta 5 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.300
 the environment of the 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.040
 gangs only when you're serious 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.470
 sad one another rival comes out 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.170
 walking and if you shoot one all 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.390
 the bullets are thrown on you is no longer 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.040
 that great environment where you could 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.550
 recruit gang members and attack 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.610
 territories 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.369
 the famous jetpack would be great to be able 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.280
 use it even as a trick to fly 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.740
 with the three characters 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.000
