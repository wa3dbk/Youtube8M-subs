00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:09.230
 mansard ceiling consisting of 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:11.849
 flat ceiling and tilted 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.000
 how to make a breakdown so as not to 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.650
 turned out to skew on the inclined part with 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.949
 exactly and everything is clear you just 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:26.070
 lasers vision and all and with inclined 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:30.779
 part of us will help a little knowledge 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:35.579
 geometry to start you need along one 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:39.950
 from the slopes under the slope which hold 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:43.340
 lines with five centimeters from it then 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:49.460
 from the entry point into the wall do 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.460
 horizontal line by entering the walls 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:01:00.100
 from the entry point to the ceiling let's say 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:05.370
 our 0 which is dropping blue orbits 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:07.960
 vertical and horizontal line at 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.660
 we got to the wall distance 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:15.490
 ninety five and a half centimeters 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:17.560
 with a height of 50 70 half now such 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.229
 same triangle need to be drawn with 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.520
 the other side, that is, we take 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:28.540
 horizontal ninety five and a half 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:32.050
 centimeters and from the intersection point 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.229
 raise vertically fifty seven 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.229
 and a half 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.979
 got us. 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:52.330
 this is where the line goes through this point 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:56.500
 from corner to ceiling now we have 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:59.500
 the perimeter for the inclined part if by him 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.690
 tighten the profile of what happens 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.310
 the surface is equally inclined and on all 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.310
 over without skewing
