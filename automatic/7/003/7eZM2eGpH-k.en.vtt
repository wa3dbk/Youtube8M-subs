00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 games on highscreen and from 2 well and the first 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.350
 I will start the game gta san andreas now 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.620
 let's see how it works on this 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.540
 the smartphone well here we are in the game that is the game 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.580
 no brakes do not know about the cell, I 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.460
 I do not notice that on braked so that 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:23.160
 uncomfortable playing now take myself 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:28.680
 normal car and ride the passenger 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:31.470
 was someone kiss hamas or another 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.940
 knocked down, that is, it works without any problems 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.450
 gta san andreas 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.200
 yes here the principle is iron that 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.110
 doubt how they will work 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.210
 games, I do not see the point then it will be worth it 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.570
 work ok ok at 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.649
 least not on maximum chart by me 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.030
 slow down they will not be shorter somewhere 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.360
 works fine so turn to 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.550
 next game and now we will see 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:03.359
 how does the game itself work right now 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:05.760
 stop laying pretty awkward 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:13.920
 play through look through this what 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:16.710
 so look through the camera screen in 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.509
 Hail slices principle is normal level 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.420
 almost at maximum 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:26.640
 I would say the graphics level graphics on 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:29.189
 so everything is fine though no 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.220
 if you look closely and already be strongly 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.009
 picky then some cutters such 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.390
 light brakes can be seen but 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.720
 basically the game is going great 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.850
 go to the next real racing 3 in 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.820
 principle also works let's decent 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.460
 the graphics here are at the level on which the truth is not 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.979
 I know but it looks very much like all good 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.110
 how everything is included I do not know how to write 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.880
 always score each game and 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.869
 this time tell me how you think 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.750
 what level 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.630
 in each game there is a schedule that is 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.820
 on maximum on average in general on 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.850
 what else is there on the floor average on average 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:10.750
 that is, the maximum and the brake is not 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.700
 I can see a lot about already 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.940
 almost yes nothing gave it 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.230
 I got it too, just like in the battle 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.180
 champions if much is already of course 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.580
 to find fault you can see light 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.380
 small cutter you see them at all here 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.820
 if you see cutters also describe what 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.870
 have seen 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.880
 so they won't be long 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.810
 go to the next well and last 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.020
 game tanks 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.700
 porridge I have no idea why she ran 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.860
 because it basically goes on 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.540
 calculator but decided to run a little 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.520
 Someone will have a question: how are they going? 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.570
 highscreen tanks 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.160
 and from 2 yes look great 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.470
 great because tanks and on 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.930
 the calculator go great though 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.090
 all of a sudden if you think wrong write in 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.660
 comments suddenly something is wrong with 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.590
 by tanks 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.350
 I will play feelings quickly, in principle, I love 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:11.350
 play fast 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:12.520
 won someone and not he all were games on 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.910
 highscreen 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.100
 And from 2 to the end of the review and here it is 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.750
 the rear window has already warmed up a little 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.489
 but what do you know she is in no 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.920
 place somewhere here right here on the dirt 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:27.070
 it is so from that evenly everywhere 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.440
 warmed up cool it was a review of games on
