welcome back settling here and today
I've<00:00:03.629> got<00:00:03.689> something<00:00:04.410> kind<00:00:04.890> of<00:00:04.980> neat<00:00:05.299> if<00:00:06.299> you

I've got something kind of neat if you

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.490 
I've got something kind of neat if you
ever<00:00:06.540> been<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.810> sporting<00:00:07.140> event<00:00:07.200> you've

ever been to a sporting event you've

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.040 
ever been to a sporting event you've
probably<00:00:07.859> seen<00:00:08.189> people<00:00:08.550> doing<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.880> wave<00:00:09.050> kind

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
probably seen people doing the wave kind

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.789 
probably seen people doing the wave kind
of<00:00:10.139> go<00:00:10.260> around<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.650> stadium<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:12.740> just<00:00:13.740> a

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
of go around the stadium and just a

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.160 
of go around the stadium and just a
little<00:00:13.980> sound<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.660> put<00:00:15.660> your<00:00:15.750> arms<00:00:15.990> in<00:00:16.080> the

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
little sound and put your arms in the

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.769 
little sound and put your arms in the
air<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.980> forms<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.340> cool<00:00:17.490> wave<00:00:17.760> well<00:00:18.539> I've

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
air and it forms a cool wave well I've

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.590 
air and it forms a cool wave well I've
I've<00:00:19.580> convinced<00:00:20.580> these<00:00:20.670> iron<00:00:20.939> golems<00:00:21.359> they

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
I've convinced these iron golems they

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.550 
I've convinced these iron golems they
should<00:00:21.750> do<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.900> wave<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:22.350> they're<00:00:22.470> doing

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
should do the wave and so they're doing

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.210 
should do the wave and so they're doing
the<00:00:22.740> wave<00:00:22.830> now<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:24.029> works<00:00:24.180> ok<00:00:24.510> if<00:00:25.439> you're<00:00:25.769> if

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
the wave now it works ok if you're if

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.099 
the wave now it works ok if you're if
you<00:00:26.460> have<00:00:26.490> really<00:00:26.970> good<00:00:27.119> eyes<00:00:27.269> or<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.990> just

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
you have really good eyes or you just

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.929 
you have really good eyes or you just
heard<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.529> zombie<00:00:28.830> sounds<00:00:29.220> might<00:00:29.760> already

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
heard the zombie sounds might already

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.089 
heard the zombie sounds might already
have<00:00:30.060> figured<00:00:30.359> out<00:00:30.570> what's<00:00:30.720> going<00:00:30.900> on

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
have figured out what's going on

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.440 
have figured out what's going on
basically<00:00:32.099> I'm<00:00:32.550> just<00:00:32.579> summoning<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.180> bunch<00:00:33.329> of

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
basically I'm just summoning a bunch of

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.470 
basically I'm just summoning a bunch of
zombies<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.579> iron<00:00:35.579> golems<00:00:35.969> are<00:00:36.120> attacking

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
zombies and iron golems are attacking

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.430 
zombies and iron golems are attacking
him<00:00:37.940> the<00:00:38.940> redstone<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.420> underground<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.379> I'm

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
him the redstone is underground and I'm

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.270 
him the redstone is underground and I'm
going<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.620> show<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.040> minute

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
going to show you that in a minute

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.369 
going to show you that in a minute
the<00:00:42.120> zombies<00:00:42.450> are<00:00:42.570> invisible<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:43.140> course

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
the zombies are invisible of course

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.660 
the zombies are invisible of course
that's<00:00:43.620> why<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.829> can't<00:00:44.070> see<00:00:44.250> most<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
that's why you can't see most of the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.970 
that's why you can't see most of the
time<00:00:44.850> but<00:00:45.120> there<00:00:45.809> seems<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.079> be<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> slight<00:00:46.620> bug

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
time but there seems to be a slight bug

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.619 
time but there seems to be a slight bug
where<00:00:47.340> when<00:00:47.550> they<00:00:47.640> spawn<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.120> there

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
where when they spawn in there

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.479 
where when they spawn in there
sometimes<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.530> was<00:00:49.590> visible<00:00:50.039> for<00:00:50.280> about<00:00:50.340> a

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
sometimes it was visible for about a

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.910 
sometimes it was visible for about a
frame<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.570> that's<00:00:52.199> probably<00:00:52.440> showing<00:00:52.739> up<00:00:52.829> in

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
frame so that's probably showing up in

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.920 
frame so that's probably showing up in
the<00:00:52.980> video<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.219> little<00:00:53.340> bit<00:00:53.460> but<00:00:53.820> if<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.750> come<00:00:54.899> a

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
the video a little bit but if I come a

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.389 
the video a little bit but if I come a
little<00:00:55.050> closer<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.559> can<00:00:55.710> definitely<00:00:58.280> you<00:00:59.280> can

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
little closer you can definitely you can

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.959 
little closer you can definitely you can
definitely<00:00:59.550> hear<00:00:59.820> what's<00:01:00.000> going<00:01:00.030> on

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
definitely hear what's going on

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.240 
definitely hear what's going on
yeah<00:01:02.969> let<00:01:03.359> me<00:01:03.390> uh<00:01:03.449> let<00:01:04.019> me<00:01:04.350> pop<00:01:04.589> underground<00:01:05.070> I

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
yeah let me uh let me pop underground I

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.789 
yeah let me uh let me pop underground I
can<00:01:05.430> show<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:07.200> Redstone<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:08.330> basically

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
can show you the Redstone it's basically

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.910 
can show you the Redstone it's basically
yeah<00:01:10.820> it's<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.210> stuff<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:13.439> did<00:01:13.710> write<00:01:13.890> a

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
yeah it's this stuff I I did write a

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.499 
yeah it's this stuff I I did write a
little<00:01:14.130> mcedit<00:01:14.729> filters<00:01:15.060> make<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.299> happen

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
little mcedit filters make this happen

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.200 
little mcedit filters make this happen
but<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:16.080> doesn't<00:01:16.979> need<00:01:17.189> an<00:01:17.310> MC<00:01:17.520> edit<00:01:17.939> filter

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
but this doesn't need an MC edit filter

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.120 
but this doesn't need an MC edit filter
really<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:19.409> basically<00:01:19.650> there's<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> bunch<00:01:20.070> of

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
really so basically there's a bunch of

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.340 
really so basically there's a bunch of
these<00:01:20.250> units<00:01:20.640> each<00:01:20.880> one<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.240> them

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
these units each one of them

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.679 
these units each one of them
first<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.100> all<00:01:23.189> Red's<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.790> redstone<00:01:24.119> block<00:01:24.479> is

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
first of all Red's a redstone block is

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.310 
first of all Red's a redstone block is
spawn<00:01:24.960> here<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.590> then<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.790> causes<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.630> zombie

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
spawn here and then that causes a zombie

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.399 
spawn here and then that causes a zombie
to<00:01:28.470> be<00:01:28.590> summoned<00:01:28.829> up<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.060> stadium<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
to be summoned up in the stadium and the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.410 
to be summoned up in the stadium and the
zombie<00:01:31.799> has<00:01:32.040> invisibility<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.240> has<00:01:33.390> a

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
zombie has invisibility and it has a

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.450 
zombie has invisibility and it has a
wither<00:01:33.720> effect<00:01:34.110> that'll<00:01:34.380> kill<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.619> kill<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.250> in

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
wither effect that'll kill it kill it in

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.819 
wither effect that'll kill it kill it in
a<00:01:35.579> couple<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.210> seconds<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.689> then<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:37.530> also

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
a couple of seconds and then it's also

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.370 
a couple of seconds and then it's also
wearing<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.490> helmet<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.479> doesn't<00:01:39.630> get<00:01:39.780> gets<00:01:40.259> out

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
wearing a helmet so doesn't get gets out

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.719 
wearing a helmet so doesn't get gets out
of<00:01:40.500> fire<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.829> helmets<00:01:41.100> actually<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.610> a

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
of fire the helmets actually just a

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.850 
of fire the helmets actually just a
diamond<00:01:42.270> which<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.110> which<00:01:43.409> doesn't<00:01:43.710> render

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
diamond which is which doesn't render

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.649 
diamond which is which doesn't render
and<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.520> that's<00:01:44.850> why<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.180> not<00:01:45.240> visible<00:01:45.450> so

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
and so that's why it's not visible so

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.510 
and so that's why it's not visible so
you<00:01:45.750> can<00:01:45.869> see<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> redstone<00:01:46.350> blocks<00:01:46.619> spawning

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
you can see the redstone blocks spawning

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.889 
you can see the redstone blocks spawning
in<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.790> then<00:01:47.880> being<00:01:48.060> immediately<00:01:48.299> D<00:01:48.630> spawned

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
in and then being immediately D spawned

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.940 
in and then being immediately D spawned
by<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.200> set<00:01:49.680> block<00:01:49.920> with<00:01:50.790> air<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.329> then<00:01:51.950> so

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
by this set block with air and then so

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.679 
by this set block with air and then so
basically<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.340> sets<00:01:53.579> block<00:01:53.790> here<00:01:54.119> of

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
basically that sets block here of

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.149 
basically that sets block here of
redstone<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.409> then<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.649> gets<00:01:55.740> cleared<00:01:56.040> out

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
redstone and then it gets cleared out

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.450 
redstone and then it gets cleared out
then<00:01:56.759> after<00:01:57.060> 2<00:01:57.390> ticks<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.780> repeater

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
then after 2 ticks this repeater

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.010 
then after 2 ticks this repeater
triggers<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.549> block<00:01:59.790> which<00:01:59.969> sets<00:02:00.240> plot<00:02:00.509> set

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
triggers this block which sets plot set

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.050 
triggers this block which sets plot set
blocks<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:02.219> redstone<00:02:02.610> block<00:02:02.790> for<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.030> next

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
blocks the redstone block for the next

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.340 
blocks the redstone block for the next
one<00:02:03.570> in<00:02:03.810> order<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:05.689> yeah<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:06.990> that's<00:02:07.290> what

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
one in order and yeah so that's what

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.050 
one in order and yeah so that's what
causes<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.950> redstone<00:02:08.310> block<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.700> kind<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:08.910> go

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
causes the redstone block to kind of go

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.530 
causes the redstone block to kind of go
around<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.479> circle<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:11.090> yeah<00:02:12.090> that's

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
around in the circle and yeah that's

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.150 
around in the circle and yeah that's
pretty<00:02:12.629> much<00:02:12.750> how<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.959> works

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
pretty much how it works

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.750 
pretty much how it works
not<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.640> lot<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:14.880> it<00:02:15.290> really<00:02:16.290> it's<00:02:17.220> kind<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.460> kind

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
not a lot to it really it's kind of kind

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.580 
not a lot to it really it's kind of kind
of<00:02:17.850> cool<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.240> was<00:02:18.390> definitely<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:18.900> pain<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.500> get

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
of cool it was definitely a pain to get

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.520 
of cool it was definitely a pain to get
it<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:19.860> work<00:02:20.810> you'd<00:02:21.810> be<00:02:21.930> surprised<00:02:22.320> how

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
it to work you'd be surprised how

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.400 
it to work you'd be surprised how
reluctant<00:02:22.980> iron<00:02:23.790> golems<00:02:24.120> can<00:02:24.300> be<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.810> attack

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
reluctant iron golems can be to attack

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.040 
reluctant iron golems can be to attack
zombies<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.130> think<00:02:26.730> what<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.360> cause<00:02:27.570> of<00:02:27.600> my

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
zombies I think what the cause of my

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.740 
zombies I think what the cause of my
devotees<00:02:28.440> were<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.770> that<00:02:28.880> say<00:02:29.880> if<00:02:30.210> I<00:02:30.420> spawn<00:02:30.720> a

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
devotees were is that say if I spawn a

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.590 
devotees were is that say if I spawn a
zombie<00:02:30.930> here<00:02:31.590> for<00:02:31.800> this<00:02:31.890> iron<00:02:32.160> golem<00:02:32.550> then<00:02:33.180> as

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
zombie here for this iron golem then as

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.810 
zombie here for this iron golem then as
the<00:02:34.110> iron<00:02:34.290> golem<00:02:34.410> over<00:02:34.680> here<00:02:35.040> looks<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:35.700> sees

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
the iron golem over here looks and sees

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.850 
the iron golem over here looks and sees
that<00:02:36.000> zombie<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.570> so<00:02:36.750> when<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.050> zombie<00:02:37.710> gets

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
that zombie and so when the zombie gets

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.280 
that zombie and so when the zombie gets
found<00:02:38.040> over<00:02:38.250> here<00:02:38.430> for<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:38.700> one<00:02:38.959> it's<00:02:39.959> it's

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
found over here for this one it's it's

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.960 
found over here for this one it's it's
still<00:02:40.740> trying<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.100> track<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.430> other<00:02:41.580> zombies

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
still trying to track the other zombies

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.730 
still trying to track the other zombies
so<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.180> had<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.570> mess<00:02:43.020> around<00:02:43.170> with<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.530> iron

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
so I had to mess around with the iron

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.370 
so I had to mess around with the iron
golems<00:02:44.160> follow<00:02:45.150> range<00:02:45.510> in<00:02:45.810> order<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:46.110> try<00:02:46.350> and

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
golems follow range in order to try and

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.770 
golems follow range in order to try and
get<00:02:46.590> him<00:02:46.740> to<00:02:46.850> only<00:02:47.850> attack<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:48.270> zombies<00:02:48.750> that

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
get him to only attack the zombies that

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.340 
get him to only attack the zombies that
were<00:02:49.020> in<00:02:49.200> their<00:02:49.650> cell<00:02:50.160> of<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.810> of<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:52.020> arena

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
were in their cell of the of the arena

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.770 
were in their cell of the of the arena
but<00:02:53.190> kind<00:02:53.459> of<00:02:53.489> cool<00:02:53.640> it's<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:53.850> wave<00:02:54.060> it's

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
but kind of cool it's the wave it's

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.590 
but kind of cool it's the wave it's
about<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.020> thanks<00:02:55.230> for<00:02:55.320> watching
