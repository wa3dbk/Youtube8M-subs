a<00:00:15.089> long<00:00:15.420> intro<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:16.199> didn't<00:00:16.560> pay<00:00:16.680> attention<00:00:16.830> to

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
a long intro I didn't pay attention to

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.840 
a long intro I didn't pay attention to
that<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:17.910> only<00:00:18.350> figured<00:00:19.350> out<00:00:19.619> what<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.460> piano

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
that I only figured out what the piano

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.060 
that I only figured out what the piano
is<00:00:21.060> playing<00:00:21.240> which<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.689> looped<00:00:22.199> throughout

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
is playing which is looped throughout

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.630 
is playing which is looped throughout
the<00:00:23.250> entire<00:00:23.550> song<00:00:24.560> although<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.859> kind<00:00:26.430> of

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
the entire song although it is kind of

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.540 
the entire song although it is kind of
stopped<00:00:27.029> some<00:00:27.420> times<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.080> produced<00:00:28.560> away<00:00:29.220> but

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
stopped some times and produced away but

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.749 
stopped some times and produced away but
you<00:00:30.539> can<00:00:30.750> get<00:00:31.199> away<00:00:31.320> with<00:00:31.590> just<00:00:31.830> playing<00:00:32.130> this

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
you can get away with just playing this

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.319 
you can get away with just playing this
or<00:00:33.090> else<00:00:33.450> just<00:00:33.809> listen<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.590> where<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.910> kind

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
or else just listen to where it it kind

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.330 
or else just listen to where it it kind
of<00:00:36.420> stops<00:00:36.840> sometimes<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.559> then<00:00:37.680> continues

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
of stops sometimes and then continues

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:48.220 
of stops sometimes and then continues
okay<00:00:39.090> let's<00:00:39.450> dive<00:00:39.719> right<00:00:39.750> into<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.590> here<00:00:40.620> we<00:00:40.829> go

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.529 

all<00:00:49.230> right<00:00:49.469> that's<00:00:50.070> it

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
all right that's it

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.430 
all right that's it
first<00:00:52.050> chord<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:53.149> an<00:00:54.149> E<00:00:54.360> minor<00:00:54.629> chord<00:00:54.780> this

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
first chord is an E minor chord this

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.470 
first chord is an E minor chord this
would<00:00:55.710> be<00:00:55.860> your<00:00:56.039> regular<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.489> minor<00:00:56.789> invert<00:00:57.329> at

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
would be your regular a minor invert at

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.389 
would be your regular a minor invert at
one<00:00:57.629> time<00:00:57.899> like<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.379> left<00:00:58.859> hand<00:00:59.129> plays<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
one time like this left hand plays the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:07.940 
one time like this left hand plays the
root<00:00:59.760> note<00:00:59.969> e<00:01:00.530> one<00:01:01.530> two<00:01:02.160> three<00:01:02.879> four<00:01:06.470> yeah<00:01:07.470> so

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
root note e one two three four yeah so

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.310 
root note e one two three four yeah so
that<00:01:08.189> will<00:01:08.369> be<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.760> rhythmic<00:01:09.210> well<00:01:09.540> listen<00:01:10.229> to

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
that will be a rhythmic well listen to

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.050 
that will be a rhythmic well listen to
your<00:01:10.500> original<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.010> try<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.369> play<00:01:11.640> along<00:01:11.790> I

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
your original and try to play along I

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.800 
your original and try to play along I
think<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.420> get<00:01:12.710> a<00:01:13.710> second<00:01:14.549> chord<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.630> we'll

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
think you get a second chord so we'll

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.149 
think you get a second chord so we'll
get<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:20.450> so<00:01:21.450> what<00:01:21.659> happens<00:01:21.990> there<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.920> left

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
get it so what happens there is the left

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.880 
get it so what happens there is the left
hand<00:01:23.369> plays<00:01:23.580> D<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.330> D<00:01:24.509> chord<00:01:24.930> we<00:01:25.320> invert<00:01:25.680> it

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
hand plays D it's a D chord we invert it

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.249 
hand plays D it's a D chord we invert it
like<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.700> then<00:01:26.850> again<00:01:27.030> like<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.780> and

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
like this and then again like this and

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.230 
like this and then again like this and
you<00:01:28.770> play<00:01:29.689> and<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> d<00:01:31.409> sauce<00:01:31.740> for<00:01:32.240> just

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
you play and this is a d sauce for just

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:47.569 
you play and this is a d sauce for just
one<00:01:33.420> time<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:38.990> yeah<00:01:41.450> together<00:01:42.450> with<00:01:42.659> EE<00:01:46.579> then

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
one time so yeah together with EE then

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.760 
one time so yeah together with EE then
we<00:01:47.820> move<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.570> next<00:01:48.750> chord<00:01:49.140> which<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.740> a

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
we move on to the next chord which is a

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.109 
we move on to the next chord which is a
B<00:01:50.369> minor<00:01:51.290> they<00:01:52.290> like<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:53.970> your

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
B minor they like this so this is your

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.050 
B minor they like this so this is your
regular<00:01:54.659> B<00:01:54.840> minor<00:01:55.159> invert<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.310> one<00:01:56.460> time<00:01:56.729> and

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
regular B minor invert it one time and

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.660 
regular B minor invert it one time and
another<00:01:57.600> time<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.320> we<00:01:58.439> have<00:01:58.530> F<00:01:58.710> sharp<00:01:58.770> B<00:01:59.369> D

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
another time and we have F sharp B D

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.900 
another time and we have F sharp B D
same<00:02:02.670> rhythm<00:02:03.090> thing<00:02:03.360> sorry<00:02:03.719> for<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.020> mistake

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:14.820 

so<00:02:07.910> these<00:02:08.119> three<00:02:08.479> cords<00:02:08.869> after<00:02:09.170> one<00:02:09.320> another

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.800 

and<00:02:15.830> then<00:02:16.010> we<00:02:16.130> get<00:02:16.310> onto<00:02:16.550> a<00:02:16.790> C<00:02:17.360> chord<00:02:19.600> so<00:02:20.600> that

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
and then we get onto a C chord so that

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.260 
and then we get onto a C chord so that
rhythm<00:02:21.380> thing<00:02:21.650> is<00:02:21.830> always<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:23.060> same<00:02:23.300> C<00:02:24.260> chord

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
rhythm thing is always the same C chord

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.960 
rhythm thing is always the same C chord
inverted<00:02:26.270> one<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:27.440> another<00:02:27.860> time<00:02:28.310> so<00:02:28.790> make

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
inverted one and another time so make

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.070 
inverted one and another time so make
sure<00:02:29.000> these<00:02:29.360> on<00:02:29.870> top<00:02:30.140> so<00:02:30.410> if<00:02:30.530> g<00:02:30.800> c<00:02:31.340> e<00:02:31.810> left<00:02:32.810> hand

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
sure these on top so if g c e left hand

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.310 
sure these on top so if g c e left hand
now<00:02:33.290> plays<00:02:34.220> not<00:02:34.730> only<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.240> root<00:02:35.420> note<00:02:35.630> c<00:02:36.020> but

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
now plays not only the root note c but

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.640 
now plays not only the root note c but
also<00:02:36.530> in<00:02:36.830> he<00:02:37.040> so<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:37.670> 1<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.060> a<00:02:38.120> 3<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:41.410> loop<00:02:42.410> the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
also in he so a 1 and a 3 and loop the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:50.890 
also in he so a 1 and a 3 and loop the
thing<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:49.700> that's<00:02:50.450> it

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
thing and that's it
