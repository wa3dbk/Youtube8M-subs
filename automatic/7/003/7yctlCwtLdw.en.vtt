and hear nature around me and I'm not
working<00:02:34.560> too<00:02:34.769> hard<00:02:34.800> because<00:02:35.250> there's<00:02:35.610> no

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
working too hard because there's no

clutch to keep pressing in and in and in
and<00:02:37.860> out<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:38.360> it's<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.420> little<00:02:39.540> bit<00:02:39.630> nippy<00:02:40.019> than

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
and out so it's a little bit nippy than

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.620 
and out so it's a little bit nippy than
I<00:02:40.290> thought<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:40.950> was<00:02:41.150> even<00:02:42.150> though<00:02:42.299> it's<00:02:42.420> only<00:02:42.540> a

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
I thought it was even though it's only a

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.080 
I thought it was even though it's only a
one<00:02:42.900> liter<00:02:43.140> engine<00:02:43.709> I've<00:02:43.980> just<00:02:44.040> build<00:02:44.640> up<00:02:44.879> as

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
one liter engine I've just build up as

one liter engine I've just build up as
well<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.780> thought<00:02:46.549> it<00:02:47.549> was<00:02:47.580> bone<00:02:48.150> dry<00:02:48.180> when<00:02:48.720> I

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
well and thought it was bone dry when I

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.990 
well and thought it was bone dry when I
got<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.080> right<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:50.069> get<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:50.280> awesome<00:02:50.519> fueling

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
got it right to get it awesome fueling

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.259 
got it right to get it awesome fueling

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440
