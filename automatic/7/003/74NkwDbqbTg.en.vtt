 customize them with photos and drawings and 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.030
 also add some writing then the 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.640
 my phone is a samsung galaxy s3 e 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.040
 I bought it two years ago now like 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.720
 lock screen put my photo e 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:10.180
 my boyfriend's background instead 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.190
 it's me with my chimera of course 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:17.020
 on the main screen 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:22.420
 I put the whatsapp youtube camera 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:25.330
 instagram then here is bubble witch 2 that 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.850
 this is the crash year or no saga 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.440
 facebook and page management and then 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.370
 oh well here at the top is the clock col 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.500
 weather 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.040
 then on the second screen or the weather 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.840
 certainly more reliable than the other 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.960
 mp3 downloader where I download the ringtones 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.000
 the songs the translator I need 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.280
 more than anything for orders from abroad 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.870
 because it's not that I can translate all the 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.070
 languages and sometimes even English ones 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.350
 I struggle 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.600
 and oh well shazam you all know that 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.250

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.840
 to find the top titles all mp3 and 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.070

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:09.039
 screen or meyer pisa which is nothing else 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.139
 that the car gps is in the last one 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.099
 I have virtually all my screens 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:13.790

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.320
 selling on them that I need 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.010

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.710

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.390

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.900
 icons that I showed you later later 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.970

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.780
 written signatures 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:51.099
 various Latin cable learns to run that 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.780
 I used it once it's never more secret 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.550
 which is a calorie counter too 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.000

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.670

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.220
 the icons for the various apps you have on the 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.170
 phone there are both packages and 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.569
 they make you change all of them 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.700
 they all become on the same theme 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.040
 in short, all blue type, all pink 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.989
 all in puppet or you can 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.380
 choose individually as I have 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.690
 I did indeed there are so many 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.299
 is there for facebook youtube 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.730
 in short, anything and then oh well there 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.440
 I'm also like the watermelon the kiss like that 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.720
 which you can use for whatever you want 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.360
 maybe for the camera you want to put 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.950
 I don't know the watermelon just while 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.260
 the watermelon otherwise there is just the 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.540
 instagram camera same thing you can 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.870
 put popcorn for example or 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.120
 instagram ie the instagram icon 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:03.329
 in short, you can customize it as 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.329
 you want we saw out 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:10.690
 ok then the menu is fine there is nothing 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.120
 that there are the classic apps already 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.720
 installed in the phone and then those that 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:22.620
 I downloaded 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:25.120
 let's see whatsapp from where you can do it 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.740
 then it should be very few wow 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.289
 conversations because opel has reset 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.860
 the telephone and therefore most of the 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.910
 I lost 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:37.479
 unfortunately and I wanted to show you it 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:40.580
 background ok the background obviously here too 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:46.129
 I put a pink and white cupcake with 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:50.270
 berlin and then there's the camera yes 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:53.979
 gallery not the camera ok 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:57.319
 photo and here are the uniforms for folders 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:05:00.169
 because I put room which are the photos 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:03.159
 okay then what do pc Room 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:05.689
 are the photos that already exported on the pc 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:08.090
 up all the photos of my creations 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:11.120
 video pc here too the videos I already have 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.919
 put on the pc peaks how many times 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.750
 I'm saying it and then ok, whatsapp 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.750
 imagine the images they send me up 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:21.500
 whatsapp is nothing in essence the 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:25.099
 this is the phone and I don't think so 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.229
 facebook no i think i won't have to 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:29.150
 see nothing more 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:31.580
 then maybe later if you like 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.740
 if you are interested I will make you a video 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.629
 precisely on all my covers that I don't 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.060
 there are so many, but I'd like to do it 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:40.879
 because they are nice and I recommend it 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.189
 read in the info box why the release 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:45.800
 the site of this cover here where I have it 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:47.719
 purchased this cover and you can 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.000
 customize as you wish for any 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:53.629
 phone and in addition there is also a code 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.729
 discount this cost 10 euros 

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:58.699
 then it seems to me that there are also 15 euros 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:02.659
 but maybe they are for the iPhone 6 maybe it is 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:05.839
 for samsung axis 6 however I don't know there 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:07.759
 are all the prices precisely and maybe with 

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:09.229
 a small discount I know that just 10 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:11.599
 however less you can save 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:13.400
 something i hope this video is there 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:15.759
 liked it and see you at the next video 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.759
