00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.950 
beyond Mark Wahlberg in Boogie Nights
the<00:02:04.960> best<00:02:05.350> casting<00:02:05.770> to<00:02:06.549> the<00:02:06.670> book<00:02:06.909> is<00:02:07.540> Susan

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
the best casting to the book is Susan

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.620 
the best casting to the book is Susan
Sarandon<00:02:08.410> as<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.399> grandmother<00:02:09.670> even<00:02:10.450> though

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
Sarandon as the grandmother even though

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.670 
Sarandon as the grandmother even though
physically<00:02:11.019> they<00:02:11.230> have<00:02:11.350> completely

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
physically they have completely

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.020 
physically they have completely
different<00:02:11.739> description<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:12.580> I<00:02:12.640> think<00:02:12.850> that's

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
different description and I think that's

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.190 
different description and I think that's
a<00:02:13.150> sign<00:02:13.330> of<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.570> fact<00:02:13.750> that<00:02:13.810> Susan<00:02:13.989> Sarandon

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
a sign of the fact that Susan Sarandon

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.900 
a sign of the fact that Susan Sarandon
is<00:02:14.739> still<00:02:15.040> one<00:02:15.160> of<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.280> best<00:02:15.400> actresses<00:02:15.640> in

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
is still one of the best actresses in

is still one of the best actresses in
the<00:02:15.940> world

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.600 

the<00:02:21.390> one<00:02:21.599> problem<00:02:21.840> with<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.650> book<00:02:22.860> which

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
the one problem with the book which

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.760 
the one problem with the book which
wasn't<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.330> problem<00:02:24.510> until<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:25.230> saw<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.470> film

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
wasn't a problem until I saw the film

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.100 
wasn't a problem until I saw the film
was<00:02:26.010> it<00:02:26.130> became<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.940> was<00:02:27.030> unclear<00:02:27.480> what<00:02:27.870> kind

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
was it became it was unclear what kind

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.229 
of state status Suzy was in when she
died<00:02:34.340> whether<00:02:35.340> she<00:02:35.580> was<00:02:35.700> in<00:02:35.880> kind<00:02:36.150> of

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
died whether she was in kind of

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.839 
died whether she was in kind of
purgatory<00:02:36.900> or<00:02:36.950> they<00:02:37.950> call<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.400> in-between

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
purgatory or they call it the in-between

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.280 
purgatory or they call it the in-between
in<00:02:38.970> both<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.209> book<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.660> film<00:02:39.720> but<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.200> was

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
in both the book and the film but it was

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.040 
in both the book and the film but it was
made<00:02:40.530> more<00:02:40.739> clear<00:02:41.040> in<00:02:41.400> in<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.510> film<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:42.900> she

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
made more clear in in the film that she

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.410 
made more clear in in the film that she
was<00:02:43.170> going<00:02:43.440> on<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.709> specific<00:02:43.980> journey<00:02:44.610> I<00:02:44.880> think

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
was going on a specific journey I think

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.630 
was going on a specific journey I think
and<00:02:45.660> they<00:02:45.870> actually<00:02:46.019> created<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.370> world

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
and they actually created that world

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.960 
and they actually created that world
very<00:02:48.319> visually<00:02:49.319> fantastic<00:02:50.040> as<00:02:50.160> Peter<00:02:50.400> Peter

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
very visually fantastic as Peter Peter

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.210 
very visually fantastic as Peter Peter
Jackson<00:02:51.390> of<00:02:51.450> course<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.840> he's<00:02:52.380> well<00:02:53.190> known

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
Jackson of course and he's well known

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.570 
Jackson of course and he's well known
for<00:02:53.549> his<00:02:53.670> visual<00:02:54.019> mastery<00:02:55.019> of<00:02:55.049> directing<00:02:55.709> that

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
for his visual mastery of directing that

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.210 
for his visual mastery of directing that
was<00:02:56.760> very<00:02:57.000> very<00:02:57.239> good<00:02:57.769> the<00:02:58.769> only<00:02:58.890> problem<00:02:59.160> with

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
was very very good the only problem with

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.150 
was very very good the only problem with
it<00:02:59.280> was<00:02:59.730> that<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.299> you<00:03:00.720> know<00:03:00.840> as<00:03:01.019> a<00:03:01.049> reading<00:03:01.620> you

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
it was that I you know as a reading you

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.770 
it was that I you know as a reading you
have<00:03:02.340> your<00:03:02.489> own<00:03:02.610> images<00:03:03.150> in<00:03:03.299> your<00:03:03.420> head<00:03:03.569> I

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
have your own images in your head I

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.350 
have your own images in your head I
would<00:03:04.410> say<00:03:04.650> go<00:03:05.069> and<00:03:05.160> watch<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.549> film<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.000> then

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
would say go and watch the film and then

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.270 
would say go and watch the film and then
read<00:03:06.599> the<00:03:06.720> book<00:03:06.900> because<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.890> will<00:03:08.069> make

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
read the book because you will make

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.610 
read the book because you will make
judgments<00:03:08.760> about<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.090> film<00:03:09.330> on<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:10.200> basis<00:03:10.530> of

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
judgments about the film on the basis of

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.949 
judgments about the film on the basis of
the<00:03:10.739> book<00:03:10.920> because<00:03:11.069> it's<00:03:11.459> 300<00:03:12.030> pages<00:03:12.239> turned

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
the book because it's 300 pages turned

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.440 
the book because it's 300 pages turned
into<00:03:13.110> two<00:03:13.380> hours<00:03:13.410> which<00:03:14.190> in<00:03:14.430> text<00:03:15.090> form<00:03:15.330> is

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
into two hours which in text form is

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.360 
into two hours which in text form is
only<00:03:15.630> about<00:03:15.900> hundred<00:03:16.349> pages<00:03:16.560> long<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:17.099> you<00:03:17.160> can

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
only about hundred pages long so you can

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.520 
only about hundred pages long so you can
only<00:03:17.489> be<00:03:17.700> losing<00:03:17.819> 2/3<00:03:18.510> of<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.870> book<00:03:19.049> so<00:03:19.319> I

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
only be losing 2/3 of the book so I

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.170 
only be losing 2/3 of the book so I
would<00:03:19.980> definitely<00:03:20.340> go<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.519> see<00:03:20.670> that<00:03:20.819> first

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
would definitely go and see that first

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.810 
would definitely go and see that first
if<00:03:22.140> you<00:03:22.290> ask<00:03:22.440> me<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.650> compare<00:03:22.980> them<00:03:23.250> I<00:03:23.459> think

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
if you ask me to compare them I think

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.180 
if you ask me to compare them I think
the<00:03:24.000> books<00:03:24.209> better<00:03:24.690> than<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.019> film<00:03:25.260> but<00:03:25.950> it's

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
the books better than the film but it's

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.860 
the books better than the film but it's
worth<00:03:26.459> going<00:03:26.760> to<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.120> film<00:03:27.359> because<00:03:27.510> there

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
worth going to the film because there

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.819 
worth going to the film because there
are<00:03:28.049> two<00:03:28.500> or<00:03:28.650> three<00:03:30.170> brilliant<00:03:31.170> performance

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
are two or three brilliant performance

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.680 
are two or three brilliant performance
in<00:03:31.920> there<00:03:32.160> Sandling<00:03:32.519> teacher<00:03:32.730> who<00:03:32.910> plays<00:03:33.150> the

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
in there Sandling teacher who plays the

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.960 
in there Sandling teacher who plays the
the<00:03:33.959> pedophile<00:03:34.380> in<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.650> is<00:03:34.829> brilliant<00:03:35.609> and

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
the pedophile in it is brilliant and

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.880 
the pedophile in it is brilliant and
again<00:03:36.600> very<00:03:36.870> similar<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.440> it<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.769> the

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
again very similar to it to the

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:47.490 
again very similar to it to the
character<00:03:38.280> in<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.459> book
