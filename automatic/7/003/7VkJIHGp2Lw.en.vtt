kicking<00:02:15.540> around<00:02:15.780> we<00:02:15.900> took<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.200> rabbit<00:02:16.410> your

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
kicking around we took the rabbit your

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.280 
kicking around we took the rabbit your
valve<00:02:17.010> cap<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.270> valve<00:02:18.570> cap<00:02:18.900> back<00:02:19.140> in

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
valve cap this is a valve cap back in

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.220 
valve cap this is a valve cap back in
the<00:02:19.380> olden<00:02:19.680> days<00:02:19.710> and<00:02:20.570> we<00:02:21.570> just<00:02:21.750> put<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:21.930> on<00:02:22.050> to

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
the olden days and we just put it on to

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.720 
the olden days and we just put it on to
a<00:02:22.260> valve<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:22.650> we<00:02:22.800> cut<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.190> we<00:02:23.280> had<00:02:23.430> our<00:02:23.550> own

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
a valve that we cut and we had our own

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.610 
a valve that we cut and we had our own
so<00:02:23.970> we<00:02:24.000> have<00:02:24.300> our<00:02:24.450> own<00:02:24.600> homemade<00:02:25.020> kind<00:02:25.320> of<00:02:25.470> tool

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
so we have our own homemade kind of tool

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.470 
so we have our own homemade kind of tool
that<00:02:26.130> we've<00:02:26.250> been<00:02:26.340> using<00:02:26.550> for<00:02:26.670> years<00:02:27.030> but<00:02:27.210> Park

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
that we've been using for years but Park

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.420 
that we've been using for years but Park
came<00:02:27.660> out<00:02:27.810> with<00:02:27.960> it<00:02:28.080> they<00:02:28.200> owe<00:02:28.470> us<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:29.100> patent

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
came out with it they owe us the patent

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.040 
came out with it they owe us the patent
rights<00:02:29.610> on<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.510> how<00:02:30.720> does<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:30.900> work

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
rights on that so how does that work

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.320 
rights on that so how does that work
exactly<00:02:31.490> okay<00:02:32.490> here<00:02:32.760> we<00:02:32.880> go

exactly okay here we go
I<00:02:33.380> pulled<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.820> Schrader<00:02:35.870> tube<00:02:36.870> out<00:02:37.200> for<00:02:37.860> demos

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
I pulled a Schrader tube out for demos

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.670 
I pulled a Schrader tube out for demos
here<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.550> I<00:02:42.230> don't<00:02:43.230> know<00:02:43.290> if<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:43.440> want<00:02:43.620> to

keep my camera's into it so this part

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.830 
keep my camera's into it so this part
here<00:02:47.580> goes<00:02:47.610> right<00:02:47.970> into<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.300> center<00:02:48.690> of<00:02:48.720> that

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
here goes right into the center of that

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.060 
here goes right into the center of that
bad<00:02:49.170> boy<00:02:49.250> and<00:02:50.480> then<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.600> twist<00:02:51.930> this<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.410> it

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
bad boy and then you twist this and it

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.699 
bad boy and then you twist this and it
takes<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.610> inside<00:02:54.300> of<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:55.080> Schrader<00:02:55.560> valve

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
takes the inside of the Schrader valve

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.699 
takes the inside of the Schrader valve
out<00:03:00.530> okay

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
out okay

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.230 
out okay
that's<00:03:02.190> tough<00:03:02.430> now<00:03:02.610> it's<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.850> home<00:03:03.000> run<00:03:03.180> right

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
that's tough now it's a home run right

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.910 
that's tough now it's a home run right
into<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.780> thing<00:03:03.990> this<00:03:04.200> is<00:03:04.350> what<00:03:04.500> it's<00:03:04.860> a

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.440 
into the thing this is what it's a
little<00:03:05.010> check<00:03:05.280> valve<00:03:05.490> keeps<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.910> air<00:03:06.060> in<00:03:06.270> and

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
little check valve keeps the air in and

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.030 
little check valve keeps the air in and
it<00:03:06.540> doesn't<00:03:06.840> let<00:03:06.990> it<00:03:07.020> out<00:03:07.170> unless<00:03:07.740> you<00:03:07.860> put

changed<00:03:24.450> my<00:03:24.600> valve<00:03:24.840> core<00:03:25.200> it's<00:03:25.350> leaking<00:03:25.650> out

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
changed my valve core it's leaking out

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.759 
changed my valve core it's leaking out
of<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:25.950> valve<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.870> would<00:03:27.870> say<00:03:28.019> nine<00:03:28.260> point<00:03:28.590> nine

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
of the valve I would say nine point nine

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.290 
of the valve I would say nine point nine
percent<00:03:29.190> of<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.340> time<00:03:29.519> it's<00:03:29.700> not<00:03:29.850> coming<00:03:30.090> out

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
percent of the time it's not coming out

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.610 
percent of the time it's not coming out
of<00:03:30.420> that<00:03:30.540> it's<00:03:30.660> coming<00:03:30.930> out<00:03:31.080> of<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.290> actual

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
of that it's coming out of the actual

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.100 
of that it's coming out of the actual
tube<00:03:31.860> but<00:03:32.670> I<00:03:32.790> tell<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:33.090> when<00:03:33.209> I<00:03:33.269> do<00:03:33.390> use<00:03:33.810> ours

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
tube but I tell you when I do use ours

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.380 
tube but I tell you when I do use ours
in<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.440> in<00:03:34.650> house<00:03:34.890> is<00:03:35.130> every<00:03:35.489> single<00:03:35.940> time<00:03:36.180> we

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
in the in house is every single time we

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.140 
in the in house is every single time we
put<00:03:36.750> a<00:03:36.780> new<00:03:36.959> tube<00:03:37.260> in<00:03:37.470> we<00:03:37.980> check<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:39.120> make

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
put a new tube in we check it to make

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.050 
put a new tube in we check it to make
sure<00:03:39.330> that<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.560> valve<00:03:40.830> core<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:41.459> tight<00:03:41.820> in

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
sure that the valve core is tight in

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.090 
sure that the valve core is tight in
there<00:03:42.209> from<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.420> manufacturer<00:03:43.170> so<00:03:43.620> we<00:03:43.830> use

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
there from the manufacturer so we use

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.210 
there from the manufacturer so we use
something<00:03:44.550> like<00:03:44.730> this<00:03:45.239> almost<00:03:46.230> every<00:03:46.830> not

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
something like this almost every not

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.180 
something like this almost every not
almost<00:03:47.430> we<00:03:48.030> change<00:03:48.330> a<00:03:48.570> lot<00:03:48.989> of<00:03:49.140> tubes<00:03:49.350> and<00:03:49.620> we

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
almost we change a lot of tubes and we

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.190 
almost we change a lot of tubes and we
do<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.370> lot<00:03:50.700> so<00:03:50.970> that's<00:03:51.330> why<00:03:51.630> we<00:03:51.840> have<00:03:51.989> these

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
do a lot so that's why we have these

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.080 
do a lot so that's why we have these
little<00:03:52.650> homemade<00:03:53.010> guides<00:03:53.280> around<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:53.850> shop

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
little homemade guides around the shop

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.509 
little homemade guides around the shop
but<00:03:54.660> this<00:03:54.840> is<00:03:55.050> parks<00:03:55.519> okay<00:03:56.519> now<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.630> next<00:03:57.660> one

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
but this is parks okay now the next one

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.430

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
could get another one of these or if you

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.080 
could get another one of these or if you
had<00:04:57.720> to<00:04:57.840> let<00:04:58.020> a<00:04:58.050> bunch<00:04:58.110> of<00:04:58.380> air<00:04:58.590> out<00:04:58.920> or<00:04:59.090> but

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
had to let a bunch of air out or but

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.630 
had to let a bunch of air out or but
again<00:05:00.420> the<00:05:00.570> only<00:05:00.690> time<00:05:00.960> I<00:05:00.990> use<00:05:01.200> this<00:05:01.800> and<00:05:02.070> we

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
again the only time I use this and we

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.670 
again the only time I use this and we
never<00:05:02.820> had<00:05:03.120> one<00:05:03.150> it<00:05:03.540> was<00:05:03.600> nice<00:05:03.870> and<00:05:04.110> fancy<00:05:04.290> like

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
never had one it was nice and fancy like

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.230 
never had one it was nice and fancy like
this<00:05:04.860> I<00:05:05.040> think<00:05:05.250> we<00:05:05.340> might<00:05:05.520> have<00:05:05.670> to<00:05:05.790> get<00:05:05.940> one<00:05:06.150> it

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
this I think we might have to get one it

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.360 
this I think we might have to get one it
works<00:05:06.330> pretty<00:05:06.660> darn<00:05:06.990> nice<00:05:07.200> now<00:05:08.100> that<00:05:08.280> I'm

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.710 
works pretty darn nice now that I'm
seeing<00:05:08.550> how<00:05:08.760> that<00:05:08.940> works<00:05:09.120> the<00:05:09.330> first<00:05:09.480> time<00:05:09.600> I

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
seeing how that works the first time I

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.480 
seeing how that works the first time I
ever<00:05:09.990> used<00:05:10.110> one<00:05:10.530> I<00:05:10.650> didn't<00:05:10.890> this<00:05:11.130> brand-new

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
ever used one I didn't this brand-new

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.110 
ever used one I didn't this brand-new
four<00:05:11.730> part<00:05:12.020> okay<00:05:13.050> usually<00:05:14.040> what<00:05:14.220> we<00:05:14.250> did<00:05:14.700> was

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
four part okay usually what we did was

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.870 
four part okay usually what we did was
we<00:05:15.150> would<00:05:15.480> use<00:05:15.630> stay<00:05:15.870> where<00:05:16.050> you<00:05:16.170> are<00:05:16.200> a<00:05:19.880> little

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
we would use stay where you are a little

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.620 
we would use stay where you are a little
pair<00:05:21.150> of<00:05:21.180> ignition<00:05:22.050> pliers<00:05:22.770> and<00:05:23.420> I<00:05:24.420> would

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
pair of ignition pliers and I would

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.600 
pair of ignition pliers and I would
tighten<00:05:24.990> up<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.290> valve<00:05:25.500> core<00:05:25.830> on<00:05:26.100> there<00:05:26.340> just

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
tighten up the valve core on there just

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.130 
tighten up the valve core on there just
grabbing<00:05:27.030> the<00:05:27.150> flats<00:05:27.450> and<00:05:27.630> giving<00:05:27.930> it<00:05:28.050> a

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
grabbing the flats and giving it a

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.680 
grabbing the flats and giving it a
little<00:05:28.350> twist<00:05:28.850> so<00:05:29.850> now<00:05:30.060> I<00:05:30.090> have<00:05:30.450> a<00:05:30.480> special

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690

now<00:06:11.430> I'm<00:06:11.550> talking<00:06:11.820> about<00:06:11.850> wheels<00:06:12.240> that<00:06:12.450> cost

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
now I'm talking about wheels that cost

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.320 
now I'm talking about wheels that cost
you<00:06:12.750> know<00:06:12.890> $1,500<00:06:13.890> apiece<00:06:14.010> have<00:06:14.730> this<00:06:14.910> carbon

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
you know $1,500 apiece have this carbon

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.450 
you know $1,500 apiece have this carbon
fiber<00:06:15.360> shot<00:06:15.990> that's<00:06:16.230> about<00:06:16.470> this<00:06:16.770> the<00:06:16.980> profile

fiber shot that's about this the profile
of<00:06:17.670> the<00:06:17.760> rim<00:06:17.970> is<00:06:18.120> just<00:06:18.360> huge<00:06:18.810> even<00:06:19.500> if<00:06:19.590> you<00:06:19.680> had

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
of the rim is just huge even if you had

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.440 
of the rim is just huge even if you had
a<00:06:19.830> sixty<00:06:20.280> millimeter<00:06:20.520> valve<00:06:21.030> it<00:06:21.210> still

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
a sixty millimeter valve it still

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.940 
a sixty millimeter valve it still
doesn't<00:06:21.690> come<00:06:21.900> up<00:06:22.050> to<00:06:22.170> be<00:06:22.290> able<00:06:22.380> to<00:06:22.530> put<00:06:22.650> air<00:06:22.830> in

doesn't come up to be able to put air in

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.970 
doesn't come up to be able to put air in
and<00:06:23.190> you<00:06:23.700> would<00:06:23.790> use<00:06:24.000> what<00:06:24.210> they<00:06:24.330> call<00:06:24.360> a

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:24.980 
and you would use what they call a

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.890 
and you would use what they call a
Presta<00:06:25.980> valve<00:06:26.400> extender<00:06:27.330> and<00:06:27.450> it<00:06:27.540> looks<00:06:27.720> like

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
Presta valve extender and it looks like

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.070 
Presta valve extender and it looks like
this<00:06:28.140> and<00:06:28.620> one

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
this and one

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.420 
this and one
is<00:06:30.030> some<00:06:31.030> of<00:06:31.240> them<00:06:31.419> now<00:06:31.629> not<00:06:31.840> all<00:06:32.050> Presta<00:06:32.860> valve

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
is some of them now not all Presta valve

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.809 
is some of them now not all Presta valve
extenders<00:06:34.419> have<00:06:35.020> these<00:06:35.349> on<00:06:35.770> it<00:06:36.129> this<00:06:36.490> would<00:06:36.669> go

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:36.819 
extenders have these on it this would go

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:38.490 
extenders have these on it this would go
right<00:06:36.970> onto<00:06:37.180> here<00:06:37.449> and<00:06:37.569> it<00:06:37.659> threads<00:06:37.960> on<00:06:38.139> almost

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 
right onto here and it threads on almost

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.679 
right onto here and it threads on almost
like<00:06:38.620> a<00:06:40.169> valve<00:06:41.169> cap<00:06:41.979> and<00:06:42.310> then<00:06:42.849> some<00:06:43.330> of<00:06:43.509> them

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:43.689 
like a valve cap and then some of them

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:46.200 
like a valve cap and then some of them
have<00:06:43.930> a<00:06:43.960> little<00:06:44.439> flat<00:06:44.860> and<00:06:45.189> that's<00:06:45.879> where<00:06:46.090> this

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210 
have a little flat and that's where this

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.999 
have a little flat and that's where this
would<00:06:46.389> come<00:06:46.539> into<00:06:46.629> play<00:06:46.719> and<00:06:47.050> it<00:06:47.139> clicks<00:06:47.500> on<00:06:47.680> to

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:48.009 
would come into play and it clicks on to

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:50.550 
would come into play and it clicks on to
there<00:06:48.219> and<00:06:48.400> then<00:06:49.360> you<00:06:49.479> can<00:06:49.599> use<00:06:50.020> this<00:06:50.289> to

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 
there and then you can use this to

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.209 
there and then you can use this to
tighten<00:06:50.919> the<00:06:51.009> valve<00:06:51.189> core<00:06:51.550> this<00:06:51.939> I<00:06:53.219> very

00:06:54.209 --> 00:06:54.219 
tighten the valve core this I very

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:56.929 
tighten the valve core this I very
rarely<00:06:54.370> do<00:06:54.819> I<00:06:54.849> come<00:06:55.090> across<00:06:55.389> a<00:06:55.569> valve<00:06:56.110> core<00:06:56.560> a

00:06:56.929 --> 00:06:56.939 
rarely do I come across a valve core a

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:59.999 
rarely do I come across a valve core a
valve<00:06:57.939> extender<00:06:58.659> that<00:06:58.810> has<00:06:59.080> flats<00:06:59.469> on<00:06:59.710> it<00:06:59.860> but

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:00.009 
valve extender that has flats on it but

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:01.439
