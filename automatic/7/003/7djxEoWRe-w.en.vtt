maybe actually a bit more hot paprika so
that<00:01:12.270> although<00:01:12.570> really<00:01:12.869> just<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.200> tiny<00:01:13.530> amount

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
that although really just a tiny amount

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.719 
that although really just a tiny amount
just<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.030> kind<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.420> get<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.290> nuts<00:01:16.619> nice<00:01:17.369> and

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
just to kind of get the nuts nice and

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.880 
just to kind of get the nuts nice and
wet<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:19.040> is<00:01:20.040> roughly<00:01:20.900> how<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.140> Luke<00:01:22.710> it

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
wet so that is roughly how that Luke it

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.550 
wet so that is roughly how that Luke it
also<00:01:23.700> add<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:24.030> dash<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.170> salt<00:01:26.570> and<00:01:27.570> ate<00:01:28.110> some

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
also add in dash of salt and ate some

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.380 
also add in dash of salt and ate some
almonds<00:01:29.070> as<00:01:29.310> well<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:29.820> these<00:01:30.030> are<00:01:30.210> Bruce

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
almonds as well so these are Bruce

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.210

adductors<00:01:30.840> was<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.229> Allens<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.740> think<00:01:31.920> they're

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
adductors was the Allens I think they're

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.060 
adductors was the Allens I think they're
already<00:01:32.430> roof<00:01:32.930> so<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:33.960> means<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
already roof so that means that the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.069 
already roof so that means that the
things<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.460> I'm<00:01:35.670> sure<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:36.030> not<00:01:36.240> actually<00:01:36.930> a

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
things that I'm sure it's not actually a

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.569

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
once that's all nice and lush in I might

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.280 
once that's all nice and lush in I might
just<00:02:40.220> add<00:02:40.370> a<00:02:40.430> little<00:02:40.640> bit<00:02:40.790> more<00:02:41.060> like<00:02:41.840> just

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
just add a little bit more like just

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.460 
just add a little bit more like just
dashing<00:02:42.950> some<00:02:43.130> salt<00:02:43.370> on<00:02:43.810> that's<00:02:44.810> just<00:02:45.079> so<00:02:45.260> the

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
dashing some salt on that's just so the

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.699 
dashing some salt on that's just so the
spinach<00:02:46.160> leaves<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:46.549> get<00:02:46.670> it<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:47.120> then

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
spinach leaves and get it and then

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.470 
spinach leaves and get it and then
thankfully<00:02:48.709> a<00:02:48.829> job<00:02:49.099> of<00:02:49.310> just<00:02:49.459> using<00:02:49.760> the

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
thankfully a job of just using the

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.479 
thankfully a job of just using the
spinach<00:02:50.959> leaves<00:02:51.230> like<00:02:51.769> just<00:02:51.980> grabbing<00:02:52.340> them

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
spinach leaves like just grabbing them

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.539 
spinach leaves like just grabbing them
and<00:02:52.700> then<00:02:53.540> just<00:02:53.660> grabbing<00:02:54.260> like<00:02:54.590> nuts<00:02:55.250> and

and then just grabbing like nuts and
seeds<00:02:55.760> off<00:02:55.970> it<00:02:59.019> maybe<00:03:00.019> leave<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.290> spinach<00:03:00.590> out

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
seeds off it maybe leave the spinach out

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.009 
seeds off it maybe leave the spinach out
so<00:03:00.950> it's<00:03:01.099> not<00:03:01.190> cold<00:03:01.519> because<00:03:02.000> I<00:03:02.060> always<00:03:02.810> have

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
in the fridge I like it more if the

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:07.809 
in the fridge I like it more if the
spinach<00:03:06.379> is<00:03:06.470> warmer<00:03:06.920> like<00:03:07.280> leave<00:03:07.549> it<00:03:07.670> in<00:03:07.730> the

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
spinach is warmer like leave it in the

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
Sun or some of that but that for what it

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.729 
Sun or some of that but that for what it
is<00:03:13.310> just<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.060> low<00:03:14.209> ball<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:14.920> look<00:03:15.920> at<00:03:16.480> mmm

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
is just a low ball and look at mmm

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.500 
is just a low ball and look at mmm
finger-licking<00:03:18.739> good<00:03:18.769> so<00:03:19.130> I<00:03:19.160> would<00:03:19.370> say<00:03:19.519> make

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
finger-licking good so I would say make

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.440 
finger-licking good so I would say make
this<00:03:20.720> I<00:03:22.329> would<00:03:23.329> you<00:03:23.420> call<00:03:23.569> it<00:03:23.709> finger<00:03:24.709> food<00:03:24.889> and

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
this I would you call it finger food and

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.960 
this I would you call it finger food and
make<00:03:26.450> it<00:03:26.630> so<00:03:26.840> that<00:03:27.019> it<00:03:30.190> takes<00:03:31.190> a<00:03:31.340> while<00:03:31.519> to<00:03:31.790> eat

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
make it so that it takes a while to eat

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.129 
make it so that it takes a while to eat
that<00:03:32.150> thing<00:03:32.209> so<00:03:32.690> use<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:34.480> spinach<00:03:35.480> to<00:03:35.900> hold

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
that thing so use the spinach to hold

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.280 
that thing so use the spinach to hold
all<00:03:36.319> the<00:03:36.440> nuts<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:36.709> seeds<00:03:37.870> and<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:38.959> fat<00:03:39.109> nose
