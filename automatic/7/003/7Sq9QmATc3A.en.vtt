00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.440
 Hello everyone will fall a separate topic 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.740
 high-altitude fasted belts have reduced 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.959
 the choice fell on this game because 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:11.279
 I like the movie of the same name 

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.249
 anyway, the first three parts are 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:16.490
 the leader of this film is why not 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.080
 and since I never played in conversation yo yes 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.289
 I was interested to see what it is 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.060
 in general is 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.939
 and while everyone will be playing recently 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.619
 come out find all trains 3 and 2 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.619
 apparently as I will play after the fight 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.700
 but how soon refused nothing 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.450
 there is nothing interesting in this year 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.800
 let's start in order the first screensaver 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.720
 show how much profit poor graphics 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.429
 Yes, I understand that this morning is not so 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:48.109
 multiplatform which went out on everyone 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:49.670
 existing consoles 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.420
 except probably the console 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.000
 wolves is 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.940
 although 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.830
 but in any case poke on pessimism 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.620
 the load to the department of nintendo will unite end des des 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.840
 my wrong 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.650
 I certainly did not become a level schedule 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.610
 make up 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.660
 but at least a clear shadow texture could 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.860
 would make dawn this game at all 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.860
 something 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.790
 next item is music 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.960
 Husband music everything is clear she is holy 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.200
 sofia poppy 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.930
 so caviar cart share rac can 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.920
 boast music from hans himself 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.860
 tsimera 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.140
 as some qualities and Julia motor but 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.140
 fire 25 days 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.990
 essentially repeats the movie 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.680
 here only if you have not seen stylish 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.070
 do not understand 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.640
 I call coming up with one thing 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.770
 despite the fact that Russia has released a new 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.360
 disk 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.620
 Nevertheless, in my memory it is 1c 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.980
 releases the game without and dialog services 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.690
 so in this game there is no the local 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.330
 nor the riverman even subtitles in all that 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.350
 you can hear from the mouth of this character 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.230
 autumn 100 style some kind of grunt in 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.750
 general translation needs only 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.750
 by name 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.830
 characters kind of like vms films too 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.330
 Is that some of them like Cyrus 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.390
 Knightley apparently refused to 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.529
 their image got off 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:13.129
 as a result, the similarities between some 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.129
 other models and actors zero 

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:21.069
 gimpu and this is again something 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.280
 management unavailability 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.899
 eastern steam beneath it 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:25.759
 the game itself is of itself 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:28.219
 solving all these kinds of puzzles 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:29.629
 sometimes difficult 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.719
 which is not even difficult but rather for 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:32.629
 tricky 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:33.689
 visible to 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:35.279
 spent on passing more 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:36.239
 of time 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.359
 the game contains elements 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.319
 unpretentious fighting game 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.389
 well, a considerable part will take 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:43.579
 view kotstsa on which there really 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.609
 many they are quite long suits v 56 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.609
 second inspection 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.689
 so how does afloat the market have no money 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.409
 or which is really huge 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:57.179
 lots of 

00:02:57.179 --> 00:03:00.369
 answers therefore it is necessary not only deputies 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:02.819
 Firstly, I think we will find the arrest issued 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.509
 flat i never 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:05.889
 came back as he played 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:07.069
 but supposedly funny moments 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.389
 developers shove quite a lot 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.899
 as well as a preschool game for children 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.249
 age well or so 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:15.439
 they may this day and will fall on 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:16.329
 to taste 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.930
 yet they have not yet started watching resolving 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.540
 brain television comedy like the very 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.540
 best movie name of american pie 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:28.180
 the second aspect is the same 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.519
 multiplatform due to the fact that the game 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.579
 released on six platforms 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.879
 in the first weeks after the release it is possible 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:35.659
 will even be 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:36.889
 in top sales 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.299
 but not to spend money on optimization 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.399
 so on my developers 

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:43.149
 make versions of the game for the weakest 

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:46.789
 platforms such as nintendo sharp olympic 

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:48.719
 and this version is already ported to 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:50.289
 the rest of the console with increased 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:51.229
 by permission 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:53.489
 so on normal consoles from Egypt 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.489
 looks like a point 

00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:00.039
 third aspect 

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:02.499
 come from the popular universe 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:04.669
 warriors and indians johns 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:07.219
 such a series of Kozak deputies did not show 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:08.419
 high sales 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:10.499
 I wonder why 

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:13.059
 these facts make the game pretty salable 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.999
 popular 

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:15.889
 despite the fact that some articles 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.810
 low marks for example i will leave 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.009
 Odessa for BBC 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.090
 happiness out of ten 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.770
 and even the fact that it is made according to 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.889
 movies that i really like 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.770
 although let's see what the fans present 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.770
 fourth part 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:37.200
 Sobievich was with you all good luck and 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.590
 players good games 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.210
 that is, don't play greek finger
