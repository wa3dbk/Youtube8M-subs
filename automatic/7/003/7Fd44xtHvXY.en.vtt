00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
pop that in our fryer okay so I'm frying

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:30.699 
pop that in our fryer okay so I'm frying
this<00:03:29.760> up<00:03:29.970> on

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
this up on

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.649 
this up on
shallow<00:03:31.159> frying<00:03:31.519> pan<00:03:31.879> I've<00:03:32.180> got<00:03:32.360> about<00:03:32.450> an

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:32.659 
shallow frying pan I've got about an

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.300 
shallow frying pan I've got about an
inch<00:03:32.780> of<00:03:33.049> oil<00:03:33.230> in<00:03:33.470> there<00:03:33.590> which<00:03:33.739> I'm<00:03:33.920> heating

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
inch of oil in there which I'm heating

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.740 
inch of oil in there which I'm heating
up<00:03:34.430> wants<00:03:34.879> to<00:03:35.000> come<00:03:35.120> up<00:03:35.239> to<00:03:35.390> about<00:03:35.569> a<00:03:35.629> hundred

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
up wants to come up to about a hundred

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.809 
up wants to come up to about a hundred
and<00:03:36.230> ninety<00:03:36.560> degrees<00:03:36.890> Celsius<00:03:37.519> I<00:03:37.640> think

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
and ninety degrees Celsius I think

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.119 
and ninety degrees Celsius I think
that's<00:03:37.940> about<00:03:38.090> 350<00:03:38.720> or<00:03:39.049> 375<00:03:39.470> degrees

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
that's about 350 or 375 degrees

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:41.830 
that's about 350 or 375 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:03:40.310> but<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:41.090> can<00:03:41.209> test<00:03:41.420> it<00:03:41.540> by<00:03:41.599> just

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
Fahrenheit but you can test it by just

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.119 
Fahrenheit but you can test it by just
dropping<00:03:42.019> a<00:03:42.230> little<00:03:42.470> bit<00:03:42.560> of<00:03:42.650> bread<00:03:42.799> in<00:03:42.950> there

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
dropping a little bit of bread in there

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.970 
dropping a little bit of bread in there
and<00:03:43.400> if<00:03:43.670> if<00:03:44.360> it<00:03:44.510> sizzles<00:03:45.049> like<00:03:45.260> that<00:03:45.500> you're

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
and if if it sizzles like that you're

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.350 
and if if it sizzles like that you're
pretty<00:03:46.129> much<00:03:46.310> sure<00:03:46.580> your<00:03:46.790> batter<00:03:46.970> is<00:03:47.150> gonna

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
pretty much sure your batter is gonna

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.309 
pretty much sure your batter is gonna
sizzle<00:03:47.690> too

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
sizzle too

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.350
