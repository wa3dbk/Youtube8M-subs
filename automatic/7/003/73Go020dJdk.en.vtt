 This I think is what metal polish like 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:20.400
 I think that I would like to go by saying that it will become beautiful if I turn it and buy it. 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.400

 This is not a good felt 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.980
 It seems that this is often incompatible with this 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.770
 I wonder 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.060
