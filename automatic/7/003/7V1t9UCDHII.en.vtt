00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.259
 map the carriers are not that 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.540

 complicated so that's the one now 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.070
 Moth does not want to introduce and to 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.850
 suitable for use 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.810

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.660
 placed but first look what that 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:48.030
 whole because you give him a beetle 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:56.540

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.750
 resume 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.730
 I tried all the time from 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.190
 other side to ask because they are with 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.660
 the script and vw does not have it 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.820
 worked out that I think it must be exactly 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.770
 as it is now pictured here then 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.770
