that's<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.980> minor<00:00:56.219> pentatonic<00:00:56.489> scale<00:00:57.210> it's

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
that's the minor pentatonic scale it's

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:07.460 
that's the minor pentatonic scale it's
14<00:00:59.989> 13<00:01:01.370> 13<00:01:02.370> 13<00:01:03.229> 10<00:01:04.250> 14<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.729> then<00:01:06.290> descending<00:01:07.290> on

backwards you got for 14 13 13 13 14 1

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.429 
backwards you got for 14 13 13 13 14 1
how<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.000> exercise<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.869> we're<00:01:16.020> going<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.200> do

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
how the exercise that we're going to do

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.240 
how the exercise that we're going to do
is<00:01:16.770> using<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.670> scale<00:01:18.180> but<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:19.130> sequence<00:01:20.130> of

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
is using that scale but the sequence of

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.670 
is using that scale but the sequence of
the<00:01:20.369> notes<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.820> going<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.060> go<00:01:21.240> up<00:01:21.409> three<00:01:22.409> notes

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the notes is going to go up three notes

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.460 
the notes is going to go up three notes
then<00:01:23.040> back<00:01:23.310> one<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.479> can<00:01:24.659> from<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.229> first

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
then back one so you can from the first

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.429 
then back one so you can from the first
time<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.860> go<00:01:26.009> one<00:01:26.340> two<00:01:26.670> three<00:01:27.210> then<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.320> go

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
time you go one two three then you go

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.700 
time you go one two three then you go
back<00:01:28.740> one<00:01:29.070> note<00:01:29.659> from<00:01:30.659> there<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.140> go<00:01:31.290> up<00:01:31.409> three

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
back one note from there you go up three

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:49.920 
back one note from there you go up three
one<00:01:32.220> two<00:01:32.549> three<00:01:33.290> back<00:01:35.450> 1123<00:01:36.450> back<00:01:37.020> 11

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.300 

now<00:01:50.930> when<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:51.170> get<00:01:51.380> up<00:01:51.500> to<00:01:51.650> the<00:01:51.770> top<00:01:51.800> to<00:01:52.280> the

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
now when you get up to the top to the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.440 
now when you get up to the top to the
first<00:01:52.610> string<00:01:53.860> that's<00:01:54.860> one<00:01:55.220> two<00:01:55.580> three<00:01:56.000> three

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
first string that's one two three three

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.150 
first string that's one two three three
notes<00:01:56.750> then<00:01:57.020> you<00:01:57.140> go<00:01:57.260> three<00:01:57.590> notes<00:01:57.770> from<00:01:57.950> this

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
notes then you go three notes from this

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.790 
notes then you go three notes from this
from<00:01:58.550> your<00:01:58.700> fourth<00:01:58.940> finger<00:01:59.560> second<00:02:00.560> string

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
from your fourth finger second string

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.230 
from your fourth finger second string
fourth<00:02:01.160> fret<00:02:01.250> 0<00:02:02.080> 3<00:02:03.250> now<00:02:04.250> here<00:02:04.580> when<00:02:04.910> it<00:02:05.000> turns

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
fourth fret 0 3 now here when it turns

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.499 
fourth fret 0 3 now here when it turns
around<00:02:05.570> you're<00:02:05.900> just<00:02:06.080> going<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.530> notes<00:02:07.509> then

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
around you're just going to notes then

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.040 
around you're just going to notes then
you<00:02:08.660> go<00:02:08.780> back<00:02:08.810> up<00:02:09.259> one<00:02:10.450> back<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.690> our<00:02:11.750> three

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
you go back up one back to our three

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:26.979 
you go back up one back to our three
notes<00:02:12.260> sequence<00:02:20.830> one<00:02:21.830> down<00:02:22.220> three

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:49.309 

so<00:02:27.989> altogether<00:02:28.379> it<00:02:28.709> goes

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.350 

and<00:02:50.319> then<00:02:50.860> when<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:51.159> practice<00:02:51.670> this<00:02:51.879> once<00:02:52.209> you

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
and then when you practice this once you

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.479 
and then when you practice this once you
get<00:02:52.540> that<00:02:52.690> memorized<00:02:53.260> you<00:02:53.920> want<00:02:54.129> to<00:02:54.220> move<00:02:54.340> it

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
get that memorized you want to move it

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.880 
get that memorized you want to move it
up<00:02:54.580> one<00:02:54.879> fret<00:02:55.120> at<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:55.420> time<00:02:55.690> so<00:02:56.409> we<00:02:56.590> move<00:02:56.799> the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
up one fret at a time so we move the

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.289 
up one fret at a time so we move the
whole<00:02:57.069> pattern<00:02:57.340> up<00:02:57.610> starting<00:02:58.060> from<00:02:58.209> the

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
whole pattern up starting from the

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:04.080 
whole pattern up starting from the
second<00:02:58.720> fret<00:03:01.110> boom<00:03:02.110> so<00:03:02.890> on<00:03:03.040> also<00:03:03.940> it's

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
second fret boom so on also it's

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.839 
second fret boom so on also it's
important<00:03:04.629> for<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.709> right<00:03:05.920> hand<00:03:06.280> your

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
important for the right hand your

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.900 
important for the right hand your
picking<00:03:07.599> hand<00:03:07.629> to<00:03:08.049> pick<00:03:08.290> down<00:03:08.590> and<00:03:08.860> up<00:03:09.069> so<00:03:09.370> if

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
picking hand to pick down and up so if

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.940 
picking hand to pick down and up so if
you<00:03:10.180> have<00:03:10.360> a<00:03:10.390> metronome<00:03:11.019> a<00:03:11.379> good<00:03:11.739> way<00:03:11.890> to

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
you have a metronome a good way to
