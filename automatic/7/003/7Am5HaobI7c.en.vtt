00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.440

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.810

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.740
 all kinds of packages you have to 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.199
 surely be the driver 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.830
 he is a driver I prefer 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.830
 carriers 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.640
 anywhere and for anyone 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:42.449
 how would I recognize customers 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.449
 non-community information 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:54.900
 in your opinion it's too much not these rules 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.050
 rule number 1 never change the 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.640

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.140
 was moving and inside the capsule 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.450
 there are a few drops of a toxin 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.280
 deadly 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.190
 what is rule number 2 now 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.869
 never no rule number 3 never 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.740
 open the package 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.240
 what annoys me is for you 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.659
 recover I had to take 20 minutes of 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.979
 delay on schedule 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.500
 so that's all I'm for a 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.189
 parcels among others rules 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.860
 unchangeable 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.420
 unless he decides to change them what he 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.640
 done every time 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.060
 or are you going to be a little trick 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.060

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.450
 commodity and a person is 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.410
 intervened to prevent theft but or 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.410
