looking at a little bit later so let's

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.009 
looking at a little bit later so let's
look<00:00:23.100> at<00:00:23.279> f/4<00:00:23.820> first<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.300> all<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:25.220> black<00:00:26.220> plays

c4 that's having to sit opposite black

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.069 
c4 that's having to sit opposite black
screen<00:00:35.010> at<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.190> moment<00:00:35.550> he<00:00:35.969> he<00:00:36.390> drops<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.870> back

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
screen at the moment he he drops it back

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.270 
screen at the moment he he drops it back
to<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.440> e2<00:00:37.860> square<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:39.469> what<00:00:40.469> White's<00:00:40.739> theory

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
to the e2 square and what White's theory

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.850 
to the e2 square and what White's theory
is<00:00:41.399> now<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.059> he's<00:00:42.300> he's<00:00:42.780> transposed<00:00:43.710> into

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
is now is that he's he's transposed into

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.060 
is now is that he's he's transposed into
a<00:00:44.010> kind<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.370> classical<00:00:44.940> dragon<00:00:45.980> except<00:00:46.980> that

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
a kind of classical dragon except that

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.110 
a kind of classical dragon except that
black<00:00:47.430> has<00:00:47.640> played<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.210> move<00:00:48.539> Queen<00:00:48.750> c7<00:00:49.469> which

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
black has played the move Queen c7 which

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.600 
black has played the move Queen c7 which
some<00:00:51.120> people<00:00:51.270> feel<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.840> not<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> best<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:53.070> think

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
some people feel is not the best I think

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.860 
some people feel is not the best I think
it's<00:00:53.730> actually<00:00:54.000> quite<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.210> good<00:00:54.329> system<00:00:54.809> for

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
it's actually quite a good system for

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.400 
it's actually quite a good system for
black<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.340> what<00:00:56.550> makes<00:00:57.260> Queen<00:00:58.260> a

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
black and and this is what makes Queen a

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.670 
black and and this is what makes Queen a
5<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.579> eminently<00:01:00.449> playable<00:01:00.980> so<00:01:03.049> Bishop<00:01:04.049> e2<00:01:04.439> is

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
5 so eminently playable so Bishop e2 is

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.580 
5 so eminently playable so Bishop e2 is
played<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.460> now<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.180> point<00:01:06.479> behind<00:01:06.960> going

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
played and now the point behind going

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.429 
played and now the point behind going
back<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.950> c7<00:01:08.340> with<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.640> queen<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:10.320> you're

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
back to c7 with the queen is that you're

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.830

going<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.650> adopt<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.130> setup<00:01:11.520> like<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.729> with<00:01:12.299> b6

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
going to adopt a setup like this with b6

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.590 
going to adopt a setup like this with b6
and<00:01:13.580> putting<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.150> bishop<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.600> b7<00:01:16.020> and

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
whites got two main moves now one of

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
whites got two main moves now one of
which<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:24.380> high<00:01:25.380> progressive<00:01:26.009> g4<00:01:26.549> which

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
which is the high progressive g4 which

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.510 
which is the high progressive g4 which
will<00:01:27.000> look<00:01:27.119> at<00:01:27.330> now<00:01:27.890> in<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.100> next<00:01:29.250> section

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
will look at now in the next section

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.899 
will look at now in the next section
