00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.910
 I think we know by now that 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.670
 our country we love to celebrate with 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.619
 food not all sitting in family of 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.920
 a table and Christmas is the moment 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.960
 perfect to do it obviously the table 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.930
 becomes the protagonist in 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.239
 today I will visit karina barum 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.130
 and she is in charge of it, I think the 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:33.380
 Most showcases and Christmas trees 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.890
 that we see in different centers 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.710
 commercial business centers 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.239
 characterized by a very particular style 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.370
 Christmas and want to share with us 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.760
 some secrets on how to decorate the 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.760
 Christmas table 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.440
 It seems to me that the important thing in a 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:58.960
 table is to save a little bit of 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.370
 coherence in what is done I no longer 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.120
 like for example that if I am 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:07.420
 putting now tapes and things measured 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.270
 all of a sudden I take off and many 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.300
 things already also for each table has its 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.610
 topic is not necessary to invest in things 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.430
 faces for example buy yourself a tableware 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.110
 of Christmas especially when you're going to 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.170
 use one day and you will save all the 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.390
 year I do not think it is as stated 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.270
 suddenly if the paper napkin that you 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.070
 tap or suddenly a dessert for 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.800
 the center of the table and point because in 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.500
 serious everything else that you put in a 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.030
 Christmas table looks like I think 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.190
 you teach good to each obviously you 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.570
 you have thousands of tablecloths and things 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.090
 different but crime if it is 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.180
 indispensable that can not be lacking in that 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.140
 we must invest and in what we can 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.120
 recycle what we have obviously not 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.729
 good depends a lot on the style of the 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.650
 table so it's square round this 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.190
 Christmas particularly we are going to do 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:01.430
 few in my house then if I'm going to leave 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.360
 let the video be noticed, well, let's go 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.360
 make a table 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.740
 where you are going to let see the glass and that 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.539
 it does not mean that it's going to take away 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.670
 formality will now know that all 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.350
 decorated is the nice karina something 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.180
 that I think most of us want to achieve 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.120
 in our Christmas tables is that it 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.220
 see how warm it looks to invite you to 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.959
 sit down with the family and share how 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.280
 we get it, look, I think a lot 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:29.650
 depends on the attitude of the host or the 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.440
 hostess has to know how to make sense 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.270
 to everyone comfortable 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.720
 it must be noted that it is a table 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:40.090
 placed by her I will use individual 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.030
 and centerpiece bonus to a little house 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.620
 of ginger where in the end the children go 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.710
 to be able to come and break the house and 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.500
 eat all the candy you are doing 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.850
 stand for dessert and these are not 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.260
 you were letting him just take out 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.260
 everyone does not have glasses at home 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.900
 very important to you 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.310
 I love the idea of ​​dishware 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.730
 yes 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:13.140
 they are useful because they also do not weigh when 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.180
 you invite someone to your house he gives his 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.400
 base and his cup with his little ball and so not 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.580
 you have to be washing 500 glasses to 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.200
 only necessary and since each one 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.180
 identifies your exact cup in what 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.670
 usually happens is where my cup is not 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:34.769
 importing takes out others with that no longer happens 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.769
 that and now on top of the plate 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:45.019
 let's put the series for you to put 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.019
 the cutlery 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.770
 and the champagne glass will always be the 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.030
 entrance of the one of the piqueos but 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.860
 then you can always put the 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.560
 cost because everyone ends up 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.720
 drink champagne at the table he loved that 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.940
 have the practicality so in mind 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.530
 because many times we focus on that 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.480
 everything looks very nice and we had 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.070
 exhausted and we just do not enjoy 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.870
 Christmas Eve look because we are 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.010
 delighted with all the efforts that 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.390
 we have put so that all 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.130
 guests and all of our families is 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.370
 happy then I think you have to do 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.350
 a balance that visually looks cute 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.350
 but that we feel it ours that we do not 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.850
 come to touch it live it and simply 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.650
 is to enjoy that finally is the 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.340
 essence of Christmas being with the 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.920
 family share have fun and be 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.000
 together not so much the ornaments and the things 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.000
 that we put in the sale 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.460
 Y
