00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.439 
fantastic kicker with the king and
that's<00:00:53.910> probably<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.780> end<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.410> good<00:00:55.590> news

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449

kicker<00:00:59.010> which<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> good<00:01:00.210> way<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.420> start<00:01:00.899> it's

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
kicker which is a good way to start it's

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.100

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
things and that's not really what we

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
take a chance I'd like to check in this

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.249 
take a chance I'd like to check in this
position<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.610> flop<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.240> looks<00:01:37.049> like

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
position it is a flop that looks like

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.960 
position it is a flop that looks like
somebody<00:01:37.619> could<00:01:37.770> have<00:01:37.860> caught<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.100> piece<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.520> it

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
somebody could have caught a piece of it

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.520 
somebody could have caught a piece of it
and<00:01:39.000> will<00:01:39.390> be<00:01:39.509> hoping<00:01:39.810> somebody<00:01:40.229> bets

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
and will be hoping somebody bets

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.980 
and will be hoping somebody bets
preferably<00:01:41.159> later<00:01:41.430> in<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.820> round<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.899> we

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
preferably later in the round so that we

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.899 
preferably later in the round so that we
have<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.200> opportunity<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:43.920> check<00:01:44.280> raise<00:01:44.579> them

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
have the opportunity to check raise them

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.270 
have the opportunity to check raise them
maybe<00:01:45.210> for<00:01:45.689> some<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.110> our<00:01:46.229> opponents<00:01:46.770> out<00:01:46.950> of

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
maybe throw a couple of chips out and he

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.839 
maybe throw a couple of chips out and he
does<00:02:06.630> Larry<00:02:06.990> bets<00:02:07.350> which<00:02:08.160> gives<00:02:08.429> us<00:02:08.670> the

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
time let's see what larry has in the

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.430 
time let's see what larry has in the
hole<00:03:16.330> ace<00:03:17.050> Jack<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:19.030> turns<00:03:19.450> out<00:03:19.690> that<00:03:19.750> our<00:03:20.019> ace

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
hole ace Jack it turns out that our ace

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.020 
hole ace Jack it turns out that our ace
king<00:03:20.739> beats<00:03:21.010> ace<00:03:21.190> Jack<00:03:21.489> we're<00:03:21.700> going<00:03:21.820> to<00:03:21.880> pick

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030

king beats ace Jack we're going to pick
up<00:03:22.060> this<00:03:22.420> pot<00:03:22.750> and<00:03:23.050> I<00:03:23.350> think<00:03:23.709> that<00:03:24.150> when<00:03:25.150> we

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
up this pot and I think that when we

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.330 
up this pot and I think that when we
took<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.660> opportunity<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:26.320> protect<00:03:26.800> our<00:03:27.010> hand

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
took the opportunity to protect our hand

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.190 
took the opportunity to protect our hand
even<00:03:27.580> though<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:28.060> pot<00:03:28.300> was<00:03:28.510> large<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:29.019> we

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
even though the pot was large and we

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.170 
even though the pot was large and we
were<00:03:29.320> out<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.590> position<00:03:29.920> it<00:03:30.400> worked<00:03:30.610> out<00:03:30.820> for

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
were out of position it worked out for

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.060 
were out of position it worked out for
us<00:03:31.239> we<00:03:31.450> were<00:03:31.540> able<00:03:31.870> to<00:03:32.170> chase<00:03:32.530> some<00:03:32.800> players

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
us we were able to chase some players

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.850 
us we were able to chase some players
out<00:03:33.370> of<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.640> pot<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:35.170> turned<00:03:35.380> out<00:03:35.560> to<00:03:35.709> be<00:03:35.830> a

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
out of the pot it turned out to be a

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.560 
out of the pot it turned out to be a
play<00:03:36.130> that<00:03:36.310> may<00:03:36.550> have<00:03:36.760> made<00:03:37.330> the<00:03:37.360> difference
