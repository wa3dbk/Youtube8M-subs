Sam near the captain of the chief I
think

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
think

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.640 
think
the<00:00:20.060> first<00:00:20.300> game<00:00:20.509> was<00:00:20.630> a<00:00:20.689> bit<00:00:21.320> of<00:00:21.380> a<00:00:21.410> shock<00:00:21.619> to

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
the first game was a bit of a shock to

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.790 
the first game was a bit of a shock to
us<00:00:21.800> really<00:00:22.509> coming<00:00:23.509> out<00:00:23.570> against<00:00:23.779> Costa<00:00:24.169> the

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
us really coming out against Costa the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.220 
us really coming out against Costa the
home<00:00:25.400> side<00:00:25.669> as<00:00:25.849> well<00:00:26.029> had<00:00:26.660> a<00:00:26.720> big<00:00:26.869> character

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
home side as well had a big character

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.819 
home side as well had a big character
behind<00:00:27.739> them<00:00:27.980> I<00:00:28.160> think<00:00:28.730> we<00:00:29.419> just<00:00:29.480> got<00:00:29.829> bit

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:30.829 
behind them I think we just got bit

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.369 
behind them I think we just got bit
overwhelmed<00:00:31.309> with<00:00:31.399> the<00:00:32.079> experience<00:00:33.079> really

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379 
overwhelmed with the experience really

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:36.069 
overwhelmed with the experience really
but<00:00:33.769> then<00:00:33.890> oversee<00:00:34.399> back<00:00:34.750> backed<00:00:35.750> out<00:00:35.930> with<00:00:36.050> a

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
but then oversee back backed out with a

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:37.590 
but then oversee back backed out with a
good<00:00:36.260> performance<00:00:36.559> against<00:00:36.860> bath<00:00:37.129> in<00:00:37.430> the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
good performance against bath in the

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.170 
good performance against bath in the
second<00:00:38.600> game<00:00:38.750> we<00:00:39.409> really<00:00:39.500> showed<00:00:40.180> especially

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
second game we really showed especially

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.630 
second game we really showed especially
being<00:00:41.360> so<00:00:41.510> young<00:00:41.720> with<00:00:42.110> the<00:00:42.140> young<00:00:42.890> lads<00:00:43.100> what

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
being so young with the young lads what

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.930 
being so young with the young lads what
we<00:00:44.329> can<00:00:44.449> really<00:00:44.600> do<00:00:44.809> and<00:00:45.050> a<00:00:45.730> bit<00:00:46.730> of<00:00:46.790> at<00:00:46.850> this

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
we can really do and a bit of at this

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.240 
we can really do and a bit of at this
point<00:00:47.030> in<00:00:47.329> performance<00:00:48.260> against<00:00:48.470> London<00:00:48.860> iris

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
point in performance against London iris

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.750 
point in performance against London iris
as<00:00:49.399> well<00:00:49.550> but<00:00:49.989> still<00:00:51.250> massively<00:00:52.250> positive

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
as well but still massively positive

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.130 
as well but still massively positive
think<00:00:53.090> coming<00:00:53.359> away<00:00:53.510> from<00:00:53.539> the<00:00:53.809> especially

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
think coming away from the especially

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.580 
think coming away from the especially
last<00:00:54.410> year<00:00:55.000> improving<00:00:56.000> this<00:00:56.120> year's<00:00:56.590> roster

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
last year improving this year's roster

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.830 
last year improving this year's roster
match<00:00:57.949> we<00:00:58.250> seem<00:00:58.460> to<00:00:58.489> be<00:00:58.670> cause<00:00:59.359> the<00:00:59.480> headlights

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
match we seem to be cause the headlights

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.630 
match we seem to be cause the headlights
a<00:00:59.989> bit<00:01:00.140> and<00:01:00.320> then<00:01:00.469> we've<00:01:00.590> got<00:01:00.710> momentum<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:01.550> I

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
a bit and then we've got momentum and I

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.950 
a bit and then we've got momentum and I
was<00:01:01.730> at<00:01:01.820> st.<00:01:01.969> directly<00:01:02.420> I<00:01:02.449> think<00:01:02.480> I<00:01:02.690> did<00:01:02.809> been<00:01:02.929> a

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
was at st. directly I think I did been a

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.869 
was at st. directly I think I did been a
couple<00:01:03.140> minutes<00:01:03.289> longer<00:01:03.710> my<00:01:04.039> yeah<00:01:04.220> I<00:01:04.460> think

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
couple minutes longer my yeah I think

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.210 
couple minutes longer my yeah I think
the<00:01:05.750> majority<00:01:05.869> of<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.200> pool<00:01:06.440> as<00:01:06.649> well<00:01:06.860> so<00:01:07.190> I

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
the majority of the pool as well so I

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.540 
the majority of the pool as well so I
think<00:01:07.600> momentum<00:01:08.600> could<00:01:08.750> swing<00:01:09.080> but<00:01:09.440> I<00:01:09.770> think

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
think momentum could swing but I think

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.999 
think momentum could swing but I think
it<00:01:11.390> was<00:01:11.509> lost<00:01:11.690> in<00:01:11.840> there<00:01:12.020> in<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:12.590> first<00:01:12.800> half

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
it was lost in there in the first half

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:14.950 
it was lost in there in the first half
really<00:01:13.220> I<00:01:13.520> think<00:01:13.910> we'd<00:01:14.030> be<00:01:14.149> bitten<00:01:14.509> for<00:01:14.690> points

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
really I think we'd be bitten for points

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.389 
really I think we'd be bitten for points
in<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.140> second<00:01:15.410> half<00:01:15.440> you<00:01:15.920> know<00:01:16.039> I<00:01:16.070> knew<00:01:16.280> it

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
in the second half you know I knew it

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.690 
in the second half you know I knew it
once

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
once

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.609 
once
oh<00:01:16.759> yeah<00:01:17.000> it<00:01:17.270> was<00:01:17.420> there<00:01:17.630> but<00:01:17.750> I<00:01:18.050> think<00:01:18.350> we<00:01:18.470> beat

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
oh yeah it was there but I think we beat

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.109 
oh yeah it was there but I think we beat
him<00:01:18.679> in<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:18.920> for<00:01:19.220> points<00:01:19.490> in<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:19.640> second<00:01:19.940> half

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
him in the for points in the second half

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.660 
him in the for points in the second half
which<00:01:20.869> is<00:01:20.899> good<00:01:21.140> for<00:01:21.289> us<00:01:21.409> too<00:01:21.770> yeah<00:01:22.190> exactly<00:01:22.399> so

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
which is good for us too yeah exactly so

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.290 
which is good for us too yeah exactly so
yeah<00:01:23.569> but<00:01:23.929> like<00:01:24.140> you<00:01:24.170> said<00:01:24.380> I<00:01:24.440> think<00:01:25.300> overwhelm

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
yeah but like you said I think overwhelm

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.540 
yeah but like you said I think overwhelm
do<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.539> experience<00:01:26.989> really<00:01:27.140> anything<00:01:27.520> okay

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
do the experience really anything okay

do the experience really anything okay
in<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.209> bath<00:01:29.899> game<00:01:30.229> or<00:01:30.440> quiet<00:01:31.220> ride<00:01:31.489> class

00:01:31.839 --> 00:01:31.849 
in the bath game or quiet ride class

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:34.020 
in the bath game or quiet ride class
from<00:01:32.090> here<00:01:32.360> which<00:01:32.599> was

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
from here which was

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.550 
from here which was
really<00:01:35.030> well<00:01:35.210> yeah<00:01:35.509> you<00:01:35.750> can't<00:01:35.960> get<00:01:36.229> London

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
really well yeah you can't get London

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.469 
really well yeah you can't get London
Irish<00:01:36.680> school<00:01:37.100> to<00:01:37.189> first<00:01:37.430> try<00:01:40.210> we<00:01:41.210> felt<00:01:41.420> like

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
Irish school to first try we felt like

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.780 
Irish school to first try we felt like
we<00:01:41.810> always<00:01:42.560> had<00:01:42.770> it<00:01:42.890> really<00:01:43.130> we<00:01:43.310> always<00:01:43.520> had<00:01:43.670> it

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
we always had it really we always had it

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.300 
we always had it really we always had it
in<00:01:43.820> with<00:01:44.630> if<00:01:45.200> we<00:01:45.350> just<00:01:45.590> held<00:01:45.740> up<00:01:45.890> for<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.159> first

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
in with if we just held up for the first

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.240 
in with if we just held up for the first
off<00:01:46.610> I<00:01:47.119> think<00:01:47.659> it<00:01:47.810> 75<00:01:48.290> at<00:01:48.500> halftime<00:01:48.680> to<00:01:49.070> them

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
off I think it 75 at halftime to them

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.149 
off I think it 75 at halftime to them
it's<00:01:49.700> called<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.119> last<00:01:50.299> play<00:01:50.570> I<00:01:51.290> think<00:01:51.950> if<00:01:52.040> we

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
it's called the last play I think if we

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.770 
it's called the last play I think if we
just<00:01:52.369> held<00:01:52.549> out<00:01:52.729> until<00:01:52.880> halftime<00:01:53.240> we<00:01:53.630> could

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
just held out until halftime we could

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.960 
just held out until halftime we could
run<00:01:53.990> with<00:01:54.140> some<00:01:54.259> replacements<00:01:54.830> about<00:01:54.979> that<00:01:55.159> we

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
run with some replacements about that we

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.190 
run with some replacements about that we
still<00:01:56.180> you<00:01:56.270> have<00:01:56.360> a<00:01:56.420> good<00:01:56.570> old<00:01:56.720> team<00:01:56.930> talk

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
the games that we did the game that we

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.710 
the games that we did the game that we
did<00:02:06.440> when<00:02:06.650> and<00:02:06.890> obviously<00:02:07.790> lost<00:02:08.060> as<00:02:08.209> well<00:02:08.390> but

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
did when and obviously lost as well but

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.020 
did when and obviously lost as well but
the<00:02:09.200> experience<00:02:09.709> that<00:02:10.009> we've<00:02:10.520> all<00:02:10.670> hardened<00:02:10.970> I

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
the experience that we've all hardened I

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.030 
the experience that we've all hardened I
think<00:02:11.240> Brickley<00:02:11.900> just<00:02:12.110> real<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:12.620> all<00:02:12.950> the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
think Brickley just real and all the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.070 
think Brickley just real and all the
coaches<00:02:13.220> really<00:02:13.550> a<00:02:13.610> real<00:02:13.760> part<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.180> what<00:02:14.780> all

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
coaches really a real part of what all

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.920 
coaches really a real part of what all
of<00:02:15.110> us<00:02:15.290> chunks<00:02:15.590> youngsters<00:02:16.040> do<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.490> I<00:02:17.450> think

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
of us chunks youngsters do and I think

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.600 
of us chunks youngsters do and I think
we<00:02:17.990> really<00:02:18.020> made<00:02:18.770> a<00:02:18.830> good<00:02:18.980> example<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.430> what

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
we really made a good example of what

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.190 
we really made a good example of what
XAR<00:02:20.000> do<00:02:22.360> I<00:02:23.360> think<00:02:23.510> we're<00:02:23.690> all<00:02:23.750> heads<00:02:24.020> well

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
XAR do I think we're all heads well

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.600 
XAR do I think we're all heads well
sheets<00:02:24.500> right<00:02:24.770> to<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.070> end<00:02:25.190> of<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.430> laughs

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
sheets right to the end of the laughs

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.400 
sheets right to the end of the laughs
idea<00:02:26.090> there's<00:02:26.420> something<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.840> maybe<00:02:26.989> write<00:02:27.260> in

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
idea there's something to maybe write in

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.960 
idea there's something to maybe write in
there<00:02:27.590> won't<00:02:27.739> we<00:02:27.860> -<00:02:28.010> laughs<00:02:28.190> yeah<00:02:28.489> exactly<00:02:28.520> I
