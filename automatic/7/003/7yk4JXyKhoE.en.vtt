00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello love with gangster my name is 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.649
 khan and I have a little one too 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.210
 little bit about the almost perfect 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.460
 gt mf5 to complain 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.360
 this is in my opinion the 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:19.050
 three biggest weaknesses of the game 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:21.630
 graphic slip up the world of 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.109
 gt5 is full of lovingly placed 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.849
 details and breathtaking moments 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.890
 However, it is quite annoying 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.890
 through the detailed environment to 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.859
 beach to drive around then such textures 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.899
 to have to look at something like that 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:40.469
 if somehow you are in the wrong movie 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.850
 Game such blatant failures come 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.850
 but fortunately very rare 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:52.030
 in the mirror at gt5 a car from the 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.070
 Controlling ego-perspective is one 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.920
 completely different driving experience than in erfurt 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.020
 staff they actually a terrific thing 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.870
 that is much more realistic 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.370
 just stupid that rockstars does not feel 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.630
 has worked well 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.370
 to install rearview mirror 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.080
 I'm not sure if it's on 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.210
 lack of time or missing hardware 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.450
 performance is but potent 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:17.760
 systems like ps4 and xbox when should 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.760
 such details should actually be possible 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.770
 closed lives 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.050
 dos santos is just like the real go 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.460
 angeles full of small shops the 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.340
 Rockstar games in the city ​​landscape 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.080
 However, it was a pity that integrated 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.580
 we stand in front of closed doors 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.649
 We will be in these shops 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.920
 just want to look around in some 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.420
 clothes shops and single expandable 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.110
 We can do the inner business 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.450
 marvel at 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.310
 this is part of the realism 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.009
 otherwise you lost the game like that 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.810
 builds up perfectly how cool would it be 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.810
 been able to enter comic shops
