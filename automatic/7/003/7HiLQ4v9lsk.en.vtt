 the staff who was 9 years old 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.040
 and this introduction of law course had to group shaper a 2007 commendations 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.740
 what are the prerequisite price and experience courses in support to the 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:16.880
 windows sharjah 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.999
 2000 2003 to 2008 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:24.320
 precisely person also grana and melted year 2003 to use a resource 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.939
 in 2007 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.270
 experience in microsoft network support 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.390
 and familiarity with abi 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.809
 if you do not have zip requirements no problem you can study 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.180
 free 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.150
 in the website 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.420
 teacher - 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.680
 with which 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.680
 You come here and avoid evil. 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.990
 The Right Hindu 2008 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.520
 if you find the necessary basis 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.450
 to study why installing the server 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.450
 the initial configuration the concepts of which to oab 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.270
 the installation of the tracking dua if I can first contacts with bt ao 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.000
 create or 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 and also the Chinese part works stations of the mine 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.469
 In this section you will always find several classes 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:19.469
 of 2007 all free 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.990
 or that environment studies mind study will be based avoided to weave 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.160
 to study this real machine you despite at least three counters 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.160
 commitment to the server and two workstations 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.230
 already told that if you can have it all on your home computer 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.100
 Let's see these marks. 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.180
 I have here a virtual machine harvested 2008 serves to contain price 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.680
 on this machine 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.680
 I'm a criciúma supporter 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.280
 border computer users 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.449
 is that I try the environment and silver 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:09.979
 to study 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:10.939
 Cyprus or 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:12.729
 I have some pains 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:15.729
 with some users 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.419
 it's in this environment 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:22.929
 working with creation has control 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:25.609
 to gp11 on sunday 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:28.609
 and has also 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:33.329
 two workstations in my case I'm using windows 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.409
 xp with service pack 3 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.079
 your most used system in Brazil count a lot is interesting to test sock 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:44.799
 there is also the modern environment in the world cup ctt mind can be one of the 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.279
 seen 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:47.629
 in case you 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.639
 have a different environment companies can already be here 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.639
 the version of the client operating system you will use 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.809
 is a structure based on the mini is a white man has a general policy 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:09.809
 practice of the domain and policies are applied to my ears 

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:12.809
 and consequently in their users 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:19.439
 give us a look at this 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.639
 then the open panache and 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.829
 for example has one of the teacher's plans within the one 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.449
 new digital course 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:32.099
 here I have the users 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.369
 xandão jéferson leandro neusinha 

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:37.539
 another other pt 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:40.969
 brought enough on course 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:42.629
 the users here 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.849
 little bellies 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.849
 groups also for example david villa 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:50.930
 the sea went up to the patio 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.779
 the most notorious as you see fit 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:54.489
 it is a basic structure 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:55.389
 d 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.389
 the bear users create groups 

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:10.329
 but what is a group policy 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.149
 group goal is designed for you to manage computer users 

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:16.389
 to ensure TV rules and regulations 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.759
 simplifies administrative tasks 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.680
 implement security settings 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.539
 I think you're going to ride this I gave everything from a single central machine with 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.129
 your English server with open 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:30.180
 these policies did not apply to their 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.110
 users and their computers to network in very simplified environments of you 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.010
 configures only once, this will happen in every domain 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.300
 of your mind 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.440
 successes of these police and security guards the most diverse 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.229
 for example creating a different rule 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.159
 if you prohibit your users from 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:48.250
 run certain applications 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.600
 or prohibit users from downloading 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.860
 the balance up to the moment the user makes the goal 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.820
 thank users to use certain kind of wallpaper ban 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:04:59.110
 application action 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.450
 the piston applications in all the computers of the network travel by sea or 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:06.290
 if you install those apps that you're no longer interested in 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.550
 reverencio in the folder my documents into the server 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.550
 a policy of 100 paving stronger security 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.930
 are exempt from control if I get the vegetable I will have 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.409
 an administration 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:26.749
 in the more reinforced simplified I will have a greater security I will guarantee that 

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:29.969
 certain environmental and business rules and standards are applied 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.930
 I will manage computer users transparently 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.720
 like all 2008 server 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.779
 the role goes up the order of precedence p group directive you can have several 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:41.729
 levels 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.680
 the first level is on the computer itself you can use applications and 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.089
 I asked what kind it is to win and apply a local directive but this demands a lot 

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:51.979
 time and lots of administrative effort 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.279
 since you do this by machine by machine 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:57.479
 this first directive if applied in the game 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:58.629
 on the computer 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:02.369
 the second being a policy blatant peace you have a more complex tree more 

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:03.620
 one outside this 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.819
 what name 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:08.759
 then you have a general domino policy that only applies to all domains. 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:11.270
 Users' computers are part of Sunday 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.270
 and how it can be applied 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.370
 a team or parent is the parent contains error 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.460
 User the pat is really 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.089
 to the child 

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:22.409
 and the order of application you saw 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:27.830
 from the outside to the inside it's definitely going to be the days crying may not 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.009
 runs will finish the task 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:33.680
 to or closer to the user 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.229
 it is denoted that he passes ethical 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:37.900
 the general policy of the domino 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.559
 may lack a hypothesis 

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:41.740
 for the policy applied to 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.740
 and finally the policy applied to a child 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.469
 when Group Policy applies 

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:54.469
 when you turn the machine on or off the machine 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.289
 at the moment of the goal 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:06:59.460
 or the South Lake 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.660
 in terms of time predefined 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.110
 the default is 90 minutes from 90 in 90 minutes at the station 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.110
 bailey group policies updated on Sunday 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:11.970
 or when you force it through the gp command or pdt / photos 

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:15.559
 we will give enough command during the course 

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:17.740
 Do not have to wait that long. 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.919
 and if necessary when you said as said the pdt / foz to billabong or august 

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:25.809
 they turned off the machine and the command 

00:07:25.809 --> 00:07:29.899
 then ex-serious silver command upgrade group additive in the woods 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.639
 it's an introduction and now 

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:40.139
 we can study in two ways or follow the sequence of the course itself 

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:41.909
 learn loads per hectare 

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:46.050
 or simply with an accent interested in the whole course and learned this rule of 

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.189
 isolated form 

00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:50.239
 the success of treatment the study
