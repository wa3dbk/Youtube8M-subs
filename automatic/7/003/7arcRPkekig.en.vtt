 here it is still more difficult 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.079
 the idea of â€‹â€‹letting go 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.630
 it's simple

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.590
 so the ground 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.860
 this one 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.400
 the Turkish press 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.860

 natixis he is a victim 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.760
 it's still sad that the Iraq was delivering plates 30 to 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.970
 within windows orco had recently been resurrected as attacking

 six hours later it's more in the mass media 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.919
 it's not even this new site 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.999
 this strong secret identity echoes 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.999

 Bostonians this concept was simple his little guitar sometimes on this 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:28.999

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:35.089
 he participates 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:36.549
 that question 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:37.799
 Furthermore 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.319
 the written press 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.019

 r it hurts 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:56.269
 however, Canadians

 I thought it was so true 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.390

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:06.129
 moreover he has a political line 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.129
 it's a hen 6 recovery that could have imagined
