00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
only thing you need to remember is that

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.259 
only thing you need to remember is that

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
this is not a permanent custom firmware

meaning if you reboot your PSP or your
battery<00:02:44.239> dies<00:02:44.450> you<00:02:45.019> will<00:02:45.049> have<00:02:45.349> to<00:02:45.469> go<00:02:45.590> through

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
battery dies you will have to go through

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.770 
battery dies you will have to go through
another<00:02:46.040> step<00:02:46.370> in<00:02:46.579> order<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.969> enable<00:02:47.239> custom

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
another step in order to enable custom

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.960 
another step in order to enable custom
firmware<00:02:47.989> again<00:02:48.379> and<00:02:48.590> to<00:02:49.129> do<00:02:49.250> that<00:02:49.430> you'll

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
firmware again and to do that you'll

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.330 
firmware again and to do that you'll
just<00:02:50.150> need<00:02:50.329> to<00:02:50.390> run<00:02:50.720> faster<00:02:51.200> recovery<00:02:51.829> and<00:02:52.069> I'm

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
just need to run faster recovery and I'm

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.410 
just need to run faster recovery and I'm
going<00:02:52.489> to<00:02:52.549> do<00:02:52.670> that<00:02:52.819> real<00:02:52.970> quick

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
going to do that real quick

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.259

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:58.689 
process enables custom firmware again

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:01.449 
process enables custom firmware again
okay<00:02:59.689> so<00:02:59.750> reenable<00:03:00.290> in<00:03:00.590> custom<00:03:00.980> firmware<00:03:01.159> on

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459
