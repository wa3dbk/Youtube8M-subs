for<00:02:22.080> example<00:02:22.440> if<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:22.590> take<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.800> look<00:02:22.890> at<00:02:23.130> the

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
for example if you take a look at the

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.710 
for example if you take a look at the
global<00:02:23.460> temperature<00:02:23.970> records<00:02:24.300> in<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.420> past

global temperature records in the past

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.150 
global temperature records in the past
you<00:02:24.900> can<00:02:25.050> see<00:02:25.230> it's<00:02:25.380> not<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.590> small<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:25.950> graph

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
you can see it's not a small to graph

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.940 
you can see it's not a small to graph
but<00:02:26.400> every<00:02:26.670> year<00:02:26.700> being<00:02:27.060> warm<00:02:27.330> data<00:02:27.510> periods

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
but every year being warm data periods

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.320 
but every year being warm data periods
and<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.070> see<00:02:29.220> exactly<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.700> same<00:02:29.880> pattern<00:02:30.180> for

and you see exactly the same pattern for

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.020 
and you see exactly the same pattern for
local<00:02:30.570> temperature<00:02:31.020> records<00:02:31.320> so<00:02:32.130> in<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.310> few<00:02:32.370> 70

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
local temperature records so in a few 70

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.000

years<00:02:33.210> haven't<00:02:33.480> been<00:02:33.540> warmer<00:02:33.990> or<00:02:34.740> you<00:02:34.860> get<00:02:34.980> a

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
years haven't been warmer or you get a

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.950 
years haven't been warmer or you get a

does not mean that of warming as top or
even<00:02:39.810> isn't<00:02:40.140> happening<00:02:41.150> so<00:02:42.150> what<00:02:42.300> exactly<00:02:42.420> is

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
even isn't happening so what exactly is
