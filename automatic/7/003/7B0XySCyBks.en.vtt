00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
don't think it's gonna be nearly as

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.329 
don't think it's gonna be nearly as
customizable<00:00:51.079> as<00:00:51.409> in<00:00:51.530> like<00:00:51.649> advanced<00:00:51.949> warfare

and obviously it's not an exosuit quote
unquote<00:00:54.620> it<00:00:55.579> doesn't<00:00:55.819> have<00:00:55.909> the<00:00:55.940> same

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059

your you want marathon as a perk so you

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.469

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
something like lightweight for instance

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.840 
something like lightweight for instance
what<00:01:30.469> if<00:01:30.500> that<00:01:30.740> means<00:01:30.920> that<00:01:31.100> your<00:01:31.610> character

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
what if that means that your character

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.749 
what if that means that your character
had<00:01:32.299> some<00:01:32.570> sort<00:01:32.840> of<00:01:32.990> a<00:01:33.079> leg<00:01:33.890> upgrade<00:01:34.369> like<00:01:34.549> your

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
had some sort of a leg upgrade like your

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.240 
had some sort of a leg upgrade like your
leg<00:01:35.000> armor<00:01:35.539> was<00:01:36.020> um<00:01:36.350> something<00:01:37.009> that<00:01:37.100> made<00:01:37.219> you

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
leg armor was um something that made you

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.459 
leg armor was um something that made you
run<00:01:37.520> faster<00:01:37.909> or<00:01:38.060> this<00:01:38.420> this<00:01:39.170> sounds<00:01:39.439> very

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
run faster or this this sounds very

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:40.990 
run faster or this this sounds very
stupid<00:01:40.189> but<00:01:40.310> I<00:01:40.340> think<00:01:40.520> would<00:01:40.609> be<00:01:40.700> cool<00:01:40.909> the

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
stupid but I think would be cool the

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.160 
stupid but I think would be cool the
same<00:01:41.210> time<00:01:41.420> like<00:01:41.600> what<00:01:41.780> if<00:01:41.899> your<00:01:41.990> character

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
same time like what if your character

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.230 
same time like what if your character
had<00:01:42.500> like<00:01:42.680> prosthetic<00:01:43.310> legs<00:01:43.609> I<00:01:43.880> think<00:01:44.149> that

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
had like prosthetic legs I think that

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.399

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
would be really really cool like you

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.170 
would be really really cool like you

just by looking at them in the pregame

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.179 
just by looking at them in the pregame

more bulky or underarms you could tell

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:07.840 
more bulky or underarms you could tell

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
that people were using fast hands

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.210 
that people were using fast hands
because<00:02:08.270> of<00:02:08.479> how<00:02:08.960> their<00:02:09.380> character<00:02:09.860> look<00:02:10.070> you

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
because of how their character look you

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.620 
because of how their character look you
could<00:02:10.340> tell<00:02:10.550> people<00:02:10.910> were<00:02:11.030> using<00:02:11.210> dead

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
silence or scavenger or hardline because

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.910

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.920 
of how their character looked personally
I<00:02:16.099> think<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:16.790> would<00:02:16.879> be<00:02:16.909> a<00:02:17.000> really<00:02:17.390> really<00:02:17.659> cool

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
I think it would be a really really cool

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
the game because I think that would be

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.160 
the game because I think that would be
absolutely<00:02:25.820> awesome<00:02:26.060> you<00:02:26.480> know<00:02:26.540> you<00:02:27.020> have<00:02:27.140> a
