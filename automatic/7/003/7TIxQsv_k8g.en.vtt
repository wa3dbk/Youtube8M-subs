such a good call there well there were a

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.710 
such a good call there well there were a
lot<00:00:29.890> of<00:00:30.010> things<00:00:30.699> about<00:00:30.880> the<00:00:31.119> way<00:00:31.240> played<00:00:31.570> his

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
lot of things about the way played his

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.470 
lot of things about the way played his
hand<00:00:31.990> which<00:00:32.289> to<00:00:33.220> me<00:00:33.399> added<00:00:33.760> up<00:00:33.910> that<00:00:34.149> like

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
hand which to me added up that like

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.650 
hand which to me added up that like
maybe<00:00:34.690> he<00:00:34.870> didn't<00:00:35.079> have<00:00:35.200> a<00:00:35.230> maid<00:00:35.530> hand<00:00:35.739> so<00:00:36.660> you

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
maybe he didn't have a maid hand so you

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.010 
maybe he didn't have a maid hand so you
know<00:00:37.750> I<00:00:37.989> mean<00:00:38.320> I<00:00:38.440> bet<00:00:38.890> the<00:00:39.040> flop<00:00:39.160> on<00:00:39.579> 974<00:00:40.510> in<00:00:40.899> a

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
know I mean I bet the flop on 974 in a

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.780 
know I mean I bet the flop on 974 in a
three-way<00:00:41.410> pot<00:00:41.649> after<00:00:41.860> he<00:00:42.130> defended<00:00:42.520> the<00:00:42.640> big

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
three-way pot after he defended the big

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.680 
three-way pot after he defended the big
blind<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:45.160> make<00:00:45.309> it<00:00:45.399> three<00:00:45.579> handed<00:00:45.940> whether

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
blind to make it three handed whether

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.090 
blind to make it three handed whether
there<00:00:46.870> was<00:00:46.989> a<00:00:47.020> flush<00:00:47.290> draw<00:00:47.320> and<00:00:47.829> he<00:00:47.920> just

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
there was a flush draw and he just

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.400 
there was a flush draw and he just
called<00:00:48.489> leaving<00:00:49.360> in<00:00:49.480> the<00:00:49.570> raiser<00:00:49.750> behind<00:00:50.200> him

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
called leaving in the raiser behind him

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.270 
called leaving in the raiser behind him
I<00:00:50.910> mean<00:00:51.910> that's<00:00:52.030> a<00:00:52.120> pretty<00:00:52.270> draw<00:00:52.600> heavy<00:00:52.840> board

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
I mean that's a pretty draw heavy board

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.020 
I mean that's a pretty draw heavy board
so<00:00:54.280> I<00:00:54.969> would<00:00:55.809> have<00:00:55.930> thought<00:00:56.110> like<00:00:56.410> -<00:00:57.030> not

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
so I would have thought like - not

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.060 
so I would have thought like - not
always<00:00:58.360> but<00:00:58.809> I<00:00:58.960> do<00:00:59.140> the<00:00:59.320> decent<00:00:59.649> chance<00:00:59.860> like

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
always but I do the decent chance like

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.170 
always but I do the decent chance like
two<00:01:00.250> pair<00:01:00.520> or<00:01:00.940> a<00:01:01.030> set<00:01:01.390> would<00:01:01.570> check<00:01:01.870> race<00:01:02.100> so

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
two pair or a set would check race so

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.309 
two pair or a set would check race so
you<00:01:04.180> know<00:01:04.299> I'm<00:01:04.570> not<00:01:04.600> gonna<00:01:04.869> say<00:01:05.079> that's<00:01:05.199> a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:05.319 
you know I'm not gonna say that's a

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.199 
you know I'm not gonna say that's a
hundred<00:01:05.590> percent<00:01:05.709> but<00:01:06.130> you<00:01:06.219> know<00:01:06.340> III<00:01:06.670> figure

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:07.209 
hundred percent but you know III figure

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:08.279 
hundred percent but you know III figure
some<00:01:07.389> of<00:01:07.479> the<00:01:07.539> time<00:01:07.719> he<00:01:07.840> would<00:01:07.959> with<00:01:08.139> those

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:08.289 
some of the time he would with those

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:10.319 
some of the time he would with those
hands<00:01:08.590> and<00:01:08.859> then<00:01:09.399> a<00:01:09.429> king<00:01:09.729> hits<00:01:09.939> the<00:01:10.119> turn

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
hands and then a king hits the turn

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:12.419 
hands and then a king hits the turn
which<00:01:10.569> is<00:01:10.719> pretty<00:01:11.139> much<00:01:11.229> a<00:01:11.350> blank<00:01:11.679> like<00:01:12.310> it

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:12.429 
which is pretty much a blank like it

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:13.859 
which is pretty much a blank like it
doesn't<00:01:12.639> hit<00:01:12.729> any<00:01:12.909> straight<00:01:13.240> draws<00:01:13.479> I<00:01:13.749> mean

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
doesn't hit any straight draws I mean

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.749 
doesn't hit any straight draws I mean
you<00:01:13.959> know<00:01:14.079> it<00:01:14.229> could<00:01:14.469> hit<00:01:14.619> like<00:01:14.889> kings<00:01:15.310> up<00:01:15.549> now

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
you know it could hit like kings up now

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.669 
you know it could hit like kings up now
or<00:01:16.119> some<00:01:16.450> weird<00:01:16.659> like<00:01:16.840> king-high<00:01:17.229> flush<00:01:17.259> draw

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:17.679 
or some weird like king-high flush draw

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:21.209 
or some weird like king-high flush draw
so<00:01:18.670> then<00:01:18.819> I<00:01:18.969> check<00:01:19.359> he<00:01:19.990> checks<00:01:20.319> and<00:01:20.499> I<00:01:20.560> bet<00:01:20.829> and

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
so then I check he checks and I bet and

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:25.589 
so then I check he checks and I bet and
I<00:01:21.579> mean<00:01:22.149> I<00:01:22.240> bet<00:01:22.479> like<00:01:23.310> maybe<00:01:24.310> half<00:01:24.849> the<00:01:24.880> pot<00:01:25.299> or

00:01:25.589 --> 00:01:25.599 
I mean I bet like maybe half the pot or

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:27.510 
I mean I bet like maybe half the pot or
just<00:01:25.840> over<00:01:26.229> but<00:01:26.560> it's<00:01:26.679> in<00:01:26.979> like<00:01:27.099> a<00:01:27.130> tournament

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
just over but it's in like a tournament

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.519 
just over but it's in like a tournament
that's<00:01:27.819> like<00:01:27.939> a<00:01:27.969> decent-sized<00:01:28.719> bet<00:01:28.990> kind<00:01:29.409> of

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:29.529 
that's like a decent-sized bet kind of

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:32.190 
that's like a decent-sized bet kind of
and<00:01:30.119> he<00:01:31.119> was<00:01:31.240> thinking<00:01:31.599> about<00:01:31.689> it<00:01:31.869> and<00:01:32.049> then

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
and he was thinking about it and then

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.499 
and he was thinking about it and then
men<00:01:32.439> raised<00:01:32.679> me<00:01:32.979> and<00:01:33.189> I<00:01:33.490> called<00:01:33.819> and<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.240> river

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
men raised me and I called and the river

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.260 
men raised me and I called and the river
was<00:01:34.719> a<00:01:34.749> queen<00:01:35.049> and<00:01:35.469> then<00:01:36.369> he<00:01:36.490> went<00:01:36.639> all<00:01:36.729> in<00:01:36.939> for

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
was a queen and then he went all in for

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.730 
was a queen and then he went all in for
you<00:01:37.689> know<00:01:37.779> a<00:01:37.810> big<00:01:38.079> bet<00:01:38.289> like<00:01:38.439> four<00:01:38.619> hundred

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
you know a big bet like four hundred

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.649 
you know a big bet like four hundred
thousand<00:01:39.369> you<00:01:39.669> know<00:01:39.729> after<00:01:40.029> he<00:01:40.060> had<00:01:40.209> been<00:01:40.419> rate

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
thousand you know after he had been rate

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.889 
thousand you know after he had been rate
raised<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.319> turn<00:01:41.499> to<00:01:41.619> 230<00:01:42.009> so<00:01:43.919> so<00:01:44.919> I<00:01:45.899> was

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
raised the turn to 230 so so I was

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:47.849 
raised the turn to 230 so so I was
trying<00:01:47.049> to<00:01:47.139> put<00:01:47.289> a<00:01:47.319> lot<00:01:47.469> of<00:01:47.560> things<00:01:47.649> together

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:47.859 
trying to put a lot of things together

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:49.199 
trying to put a lot of things together
because<00:01:48.130> I'd<00:01:48.369> only<00:01:48.399> played<00:01:48.789> with<00:01:48.999> the<00:01:49.090> guy

00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:49.209 
because I'd only played with the guy

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:52.139 
because I'd only played with the guy
really<00:01:49.509> like<00:01:49.779> one<00:01:49.989> hand<00:01:50.229> today<00:01:50.469> and<00:01:51.340> he<00:01:51.609> like

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
really like one hand today and he like

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.289 
really like one hand today and he like
had<00:01:53.109> re-raise<00:01:53.739> small<00:01:54.159> and<00:01:54.549> then<00:01:54.669> bet<00:01:54.880> small

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
had re-raise small and then bet small

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.510 
had re-raise small and then bet small
twice<00:01:55.719> with<00:01:56.079> ace<00:01:56.289> king<00:01:56.590> on<00:01:56.770> a<00:01:56.799> king<00:01:57.069> high<00:01:57.249> board

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
twice with ace king on a king high board

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.569 
twice with ace king on a king high board
and<00:01:57.789> then<00:01:58.209> checked<00:01:58.539> the<00:01:58.689> river<00:01:58.899> after<00:01:59.289> like

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
and then checked the river after like

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.069 
and then checked the river after like
couple<00:02:00.579> scary<00:02:00.999> cards<00:02:01.419> came<00:02:01.659> and<00:02:01.869> it<00:02:01.929> wasn't

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
couple scary cards came and it wasn't

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:02.760 
couple scary cards came and it wasn't
too<00:02:02.319> scary

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
too scary

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.949 
too scary
so<00:02:03.549> he<00:02:03.669> didn't<00:02:03.880> seem<00:02:04.059> like<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.270> type<00:02:04.599> that<00:02:04.840> was

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:04.959 
so he didn't seem like the type that was

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.320 
so he didn't seem like the type that was
like<00:02:05.229> really<00:02:06.039> go<00:02:06.159> into<00:02:06.399> town<00:02:06.579> for<00:02:06.849> value

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
like really go into town for value

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.300 
like really go into town for value
and<00:02:08.420> they're<00:02:09.350> already<00:02:09.500> things<00:02:09.860> like<00:02:10.070> he

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
and they're already things like he

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.340 
and they're already things like he
didn't<00:02:11.180> fast<00:02:11.360> play<00:02:11.570> his<00:02:11.720> hand<00:02:11.900> on<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.050> flop

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
didn't fast play his hand on the flop

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.470 
didn't fast play his hand on the flop
he's<00:02:13.070> so<00:02:13.310> like<00:02:13.520> what<00:02:13.730> did<00:02:13.910> he<00:02:13.970> make<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.240> Kings

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
he's so like what did he make the Kings

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.020 
he's so like what did he make the Kings
up<00:02:14.690> makes<00:02:14.960> sense<00:02:15.230> right<00:02:15.590> but<00:02:16.340> then<00:02:16.550> kind<00:02:16.940> of

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
up makes sense right but then kind of

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.240 
up makes sense right but then kind of
like<00:02:17.150> shoving<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.720> river<00:02:17.930> he<00:02:18.770> kind<00:02:19.010> of<00:02:19.070> seemed

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
like shoving the river he kind of seemed

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.280 
like shoving the river he kind of seemed
like<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.520> type<00:02:19.730> like<00:02:20.300> King<00:02:20.570> seven<00:02:21.050> on<00:02:21.170> the

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
like the type like King seven on the

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.790 
like the type like King seven on the
river<00:02:21.470> is<00:02:21.800> good<00:02:22.550> but<00:02:23.540> most<00:02:24.080> people<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.680> way

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
river is good but most people the way

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.110 
river is good but most people the way
they<00:02:24.920> think<00:02:25.130> about<00:02:25.190> poker<00:02:25.700> they<00:02:25.850> don't<00:02:26.000> like

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
they think about poker they don't like

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.150 
they think about poker they don't like
love<00:02:26.330> that<00:02:26.390> hand<00:02:26.810> when<00:02:27.140> they<00:02:27.260> get<00:02:27.440> called<00:02:27.740> for

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
love that hand when they get called for

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.910 
love that hand when they get called for
like<00:02:28.400> a<00:02:28.430> huge<00:02:28.790> riverbed<00:02:29.590> so<00:02:30.590> I<00:02:30.620> mean<00:02:30.830> there

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
like a huge riverbed so I mean there

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.650 
like a huge riverbed so I mean there
were<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.040> lot<00:02:31.160> of<00:02:31.250> things<00:02:31.430> like<00:02:31.610> that<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.210> then

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
were a lot of things like that and then

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.870 
were a lot of things like that and then
I<00:02:32.690> mean<00:02:33.350> obviously<00:02:33.530> I<00:02:34.010> thought<00:02:34.340> maybe<00:02:34.580> because

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
I mean obviously I thought maybe because

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.150 
I mean obviously I thought maybe because
I<00:02:35.240> bet<00:02:35.420> big<00:02:35.600> enough<00:02:35.750> on<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.050> turn<00:02:36.290> he<00:02:36.920> just

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
I bet big enough on the turn he just

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.310 
I bet big enough on the turn he just
decided<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.880> like<00:02:38.060> take<00:02:38.390> a<00:02:38.420> draw<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:38.930> play<00:02:39.140> it

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
decided to like take a draw and play it

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.860 
decided to like take a draw and play it
funny<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:39.800> like<00:02:40.430> raised<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.060> then<00:02:41.630> on<00:02:41.750> the

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
funny and like raised and then on the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.580 
funny and like raised and then on the
river<00:02:42.050> he's<00:02:42.230> like<00:02:42.410> I<00:02:42.530> can't<00:02:42.770> win<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:43.460> go<00:02:43.730> all-in

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
river he's like I can't win so go all-in

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.510 
river he's like I can't win so go all-in
you<00:02:45.590> know<00:02:45.710> when<00:02:45.860> I<00:02:45.890> was<00:02:46.040> trying<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.310> think<00:02:46.490> like

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
you know when I was trying to think like

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.250 
you know when I was trying to think like
maybe<00:02:46.880> could<00:02:47.300> he<00:02:47.390> really<00:02:47.540> be<00:02:47.660> bluffing<00:02:48.080> with

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
maybe could he really be bluffing with

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.430 
maybe could he really be bluffing with
anything<00:02:48.590> that<00:02:48.620> beats<00:02:48.920> me<00:02:49.160> I<00:02:49.660> don't<00:02:50.660> think<00:02:50.720> so

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
anything that beats me I don't think so

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.840 
anything that beats me I don't think so
which<00:02:51.620> we<00:02:51.770> haven't<00:02:52.040> established<00:02:52.100> yet<00:02:52.580> by<00:02:52.820> the

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
think through a hand and I feel like

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:26.979 
think through a hand and I feel like
this<00:03:25.760> is<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.000> right<00:03:26.150> decision<00:03:26.300> it's<00:03:26.780> like

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
this is the right decision it's like

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.199 
this is the right decision it's like
I've<00:03:27.140> learned<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.410> just<00:03:27.650> say<00:03:27.800> I<00:03:28.040> mean<00:03:28.790> like<00:03:28.970> it

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
I've learned to just say I mean like it

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.420 
I've learned to just say I mean like it
could<00:03:29.450> be<00:03:29.480> stupid<00:03:30.010> you<00:03:31.010> know<00:03:31.100> maybe<00:03:31.310> he's

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
could be stupid you know maybe he's

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.949 
could be stupid you know maybe he's
gonna<00:03:31.520> show<00:03:31.790> me<00:03:31.820> slow<00:03:32.150> played<00:03:32.390> sevens

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
gonna show me slow played sevens

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.620 
gonna show me slow played sevens
maybe<00:03:33.500> he's<00:03:33.650> gonna<00:03:33.709> show<00:03:33.950> me<00:03:34.130> like<00:03:34.310> King<00:03:34.580> 9<00:03:34.820> but

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
maybe he's gonna show me like King 9 but

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.690 
maybe he's gonna show me like King 9 but
uh<00:03:35.660> you<00:03:36.290> know<00:03:36.410> let's<00:03:36.620> go<00:03:36.770> with<00:03:36.920> it<00:03:36.950> so<00:03:37.340> I<00:03:37.370> called

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
uh you know let's go with it so I called

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.300 
uh you know let's go with it so I called
and<00:03:37.970> he<00:03:38.390> had<00:03:38.540> a<00:03:38.840> hand<00:03:39.440> I<00:03:39.530> really<00:03:40.070> didn't<00:03:40.280> think

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
and he had a hand I really didn't think

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.120 
and he had a hand I really didn't think
he<00:03:40.459> would<00:03:40.640> have<00:03:40.790> which<00:03:41.030> is<00:03:41.150> 2<00:03:41.360> eights<00:03:41.980> which<00:03:42.980> he

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
he would have which is 2 eights which he

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.530 
he would have which is 2 eights which he
had<00:03:43.220> turned<00:03:43.400> into<00:03:43.580> a<00:03:43.670> bluff<00:03:43.970> which<00:03:44.239> was<00:03:44.390> very

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
had turned into a bluff which was very

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.090 
had turned into a bluff which was very
interesting<00:03:44.870> I<00:03:45.350> thought<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:45.650> was<00:03:45.739> more<00:03:45.920> likely

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
interesting I thought it was more likely

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.479 
interesting I thought it was more likely
to<00:03:46.190> have<00:03:46.370> a<00:03:46.400> Miss<00:03:46.640> draw<00:03:46.880> but<00:03:47.290> but<00:03:48.290> yeah<00:03:48.489> super

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
to have a Miss draw but but yeah super

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.580 
to have a Miss draw but but yeah super
super<00:03:49.970> interesting<00:03:50.180> these<00:03:50.510> are<00:03:50.660> I<00:03:50.959> think<00:03:51.410> some

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
super interesting these are I think some

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:52.960 
super interesting these are I think some
of<00:03:51.620> our<00:03:51.770> best<00:03:51.980> videos<00:03:52.310> when<00:03:52.520> players<00:03:52.700> really

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
of our best videos when players really

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.729 
of our best videos when players really
good<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.270> to<00:03:53.750> get<00:03:53.930> inside<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.410> heads<00:03:54.590> of

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
good to to get inside the heads of

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:55.780 
good to to get inside the heads of
someone<00:03:54.980> like<00:03:55.100> you<00:03:55.220> who's<00:03:55.310> been<00:03:55.430> playing<00:03:55.550> the

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
someone like you who's been playing the

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.490 
someone like you who's been playing the
game<00:03:55.910> for<00:03:56.060> so<00:03:56.209> long<00:03:56.360> and<00:03:56.600> great<00:03:56.989> advice<00:03:57.260> -<00:03:57.470> I

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
game for so long and great advice - I

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.530 
game for so long and great advice - I
think<00:03:57.650> it's<00:03:57.920> there's<00:03:58.760> a<00:03:58.850> lot<00:03:58.880> of<00:03:59.090> strategy<00:03:59.420> and

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
think it's there's a lot of strategy and

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.120 
think it's there's a lot of strategy and
all<00:03:59.630> this<00:03:59.750> involved<00:04:00.140> of<00:04:00.230> course<00:04:00.260> and<00:04:00.709> math<00:04:00.860> and

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
all this involved of course and math and

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.320 
all this involved of course and math and
numbers<00:04:01.250> but<00:04:01.550> a<00:04:01.610> lot<00:04:01.820> of<00:04:01.940> it<00:04:02.030> comes<00:04:02.180> down

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
numbers but a lot of it comes down

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.960 
numbers but a lot of it comes down
sometimes<00:04:02.870> to<00:04:03.050> just<00:04:03.080> go<00:04:03.920> in<00:04:04.070> with<00:04:04.220> your<00:04:04.340> gut<00:04:04.550> so

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
sometimes to just go in with your gut so

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.850 
sometimes to just go in with your gut so
there's<00:04:05.750> a<00:04:05.840> little<00:04:06.019> advice<00:04:06.320> by<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:06.739> way<00:04:06.830> I

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
there's a little advice by the way I

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.680 
there's a little advice by the way I
probably<00:04:07.489> do<00:04:07.580> better<00:04:07.700> videos<00:04:08.120> when<00:04:08.390> I<00:04:08.420> talk

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
probably do better videos when I talk
