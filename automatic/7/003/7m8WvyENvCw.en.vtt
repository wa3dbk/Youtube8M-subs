00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
little bit on the boar I didn't really

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.120

like<00:00:30.880> the<00:00:31.000> way<00:00:31.030> that<00:00:31.240> they<00:00:31.390> did<00:00:31.449> the<00:00:31.770> orc<00:00:32.770> boars

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.850 
like the way that they did the orc boars
in<00:00:33.550> theirs<00:00:33.850> but<00:00:34.440> everything<00:00:35.440> else<00:00:35.560> about<00:00:35.680> the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
in theirs but everything else about the

and how deep it within the model is so
you<00:05:39.880> try<00:05:40.090> to<00:05:40.120> work<00:05:40.630> from<00:05:40.810> the<00:05:40.930> base<00:05:41.139> out<00:05:41.409> so

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
you try to work from the base out so

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.040 
you try to work from the base out so
that<00:05:42.490> the<00:05:42.610> deepest<00:05:43.030> areas<00:05:43.570> that<00:05:43.750> are<00:05:43.870> going<00:05:43.960> to

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
that the deepest areas that are going to

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.710 
that the deepest areas that are going to
be<00:05:44.110> hard<00:05:44.289> to<00:05:44.349> paint<00:05:44.590> later<00:05:44.770> and<00:05:45.449> also<00:05:46.449> looking

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
be hard to paint later and also looking

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.589 
be hard to paint later and also looking
at<00:05:46.900> the<00:05:46.960> the<00:05:47.919> largest<00:05:48.250> sort<00:05:48.940> of<00:05:49.030> surface<00:05:49.389> area

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:49.599 
at the the largest sort of surface area

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:53.580 
at the the largest sort of surface area
working<00:05:50.320> down<00:05:51.190> so<00:05:51.610> I<00:05:51.909> guess<00:05:52.870> blue<00:05:53.139> probably

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
working down so I guess blue probably

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.730 
working down so I guess blue probably
had<00:05:53.740> more<00:05:53.919> but<00:05:54.190> didn't<00:05:54.940> do<00:05:55.000> that<00:05:55.150> first<00:05:55.360> so<00:05:55.740> not

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
had more but didn't do that first so not

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:57.870 
had more but didn't do that first so not
that<00:05:56.919> there's<00:05:57.099> always<00:05:57.250> a<00:05:57.370> good<00:05:57.550> rhyme<00:05:57.729> and

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
that there's always a good rhyme and

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.120 
that there's always a good rhyme and
reason<00:05:58.000> to<00:05:58.300> it<00:05:58.449> but<00:05:58.740> that's<00:05:59.740> kind<00:06:00.009> of<00:06:00.070> the

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
reason to it but that's kind of the

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.029 
reason to it but that's kind of the
general<00:06:00.370> idea<00:06:00.550> here<00:06:00.909> you<00:06:01.389> can<00:06:01.509> see<00:06:01.659> that<00:06:02.039> stake

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 
general idea here you can see that stake

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:06.420 
general idea here you can see that stake
it<00:06:03.159> on<00:06:03.250> green<00:06:03.870> Skip's<00:06:04.870> taken<00:06:05.110> on<00:06:05.169> screen<00:06:05.770> so

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
it on green Skip's taken on screen so

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.999 
it on green Skip's taken on screen so
tech<00:06:06.639> green<00:06:06.880> and<00:06:07.180> temple<00:06:07.780> guard<00:06:07.960> blue<00:06:08.289> it

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:09.009 
tech green and temple guard blue it

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:13.050 
tech green and temple guard blue it
works<00:06:09.190> up<00:06:09.370> there<00:06:10.110> and<00:06:11.520> the<00:06:12.520> areas<00:06:12.880> that<00:06:12.909> you

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
works up there and the areas that you

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.420 
works up there and the areas that you
didn't<00:06:13.330> see<00:06:13.509> where<00:06:13.750> the<00:06:13.780> the<00:06:14.110> blue<00:06:14.380> on<00:06:15.190> all

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
didn't see where the the blue on all

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.770 
didn't see where the the blue on all
these<00:06:15.610> sort<00:06:15.789> of<00:06:15.820> war<00:06:16.030> paint<00:06:16.180> so<00:06:16.360> this<00:06:16.509> one<00:06:16.630> here

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
these sort of war paint so this one here

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.450 
these sort of war paint so this one here
actually<00:06:16.990> has<00:06:17.229> raised<00:06:17.500> war<00:06:17.770> paint<00:06:17.919> which<00:06:18.190> I

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
actually has raised war paint which I

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.640 
actually has raised war paint which I
like<00:06:19.440> makes<00:06:20.440> a<00:06:20.530> lot<00:06:20.740> easier<00:06:20.770> and<00:06:22.470> did<00:06:23.470> these

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
like makes a lot easier and did these

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.529 
like makes a lot easier and did these
some<00:06:23.830> eyes<00:06:24.070> in<00:06:24.099> there<00:06:24.669> did<00:06:25.210> a<00:06:25.240> little<00:06:25.389> bit<00:06:25.509> of

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:25.539 
some eyes in there did a little bit of

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:27.659 
some eyes in there did a little bit of
gold<00:06:25.780> on<00:06:26.020> some<00:06:26.169> of<00:06:26.289> his<00:06:26.440> jewels

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:27.669 
gold on some of his jewels

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:29.760 
gold on some of his jewels
not<00:06:28.210> much<00:06:28.449> gold<00:06:28.780> on<00:06:28.930> there<00:06:29.080> and<00:06:29.229> also

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
not much gold on there and also

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.219 
not much gold on there and also
highlighted<00:06:30.400> up<00:06:30.550> this<00:06:30.940> little<00:06:31.270> squeak<00:06:31.960> here

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:32.229 
highlighted up this little squeak here

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:35.580 
highlighted up this little squeak here
which<00:06:32.860> had<00:06:33.190> the<00:06:33.400> corn<00:06:33.880> red<00:06:34.150> waz<00:06:34.750> Dacca<00:06:35.080> red<00:06:35.349> and

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590 
which had the corn red waz Dacca red and

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.629 
which had the corn red waz Dacca red and
squag<00:06:36.099> orange

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:41.869 

and<00:06:38.759> I<00:06:38.969> think<00:06:39.030> that's<00:06:39.330> about<00:06:39.479> it<00:06:40.699> some<00:06:41.699> of<00:06:41.729> the

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:41.879 
and I think that's about it some of the

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:43.640 
and I think that's about it some of the
actually<00:06:42.360> this<00:06:42.509> leather<00:06:42.750> here<00:06:43.139> was<00:06:43.319> given

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
actually this leather here was given

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.580 
actually this leather here was given
that<00:06:43.860> the<00:06:44.069> steel<00:06:44.580> Legion<00:06:45.090> drab<00:06:45.389> Clarence<00:06:46.319> and

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590 
that the steel Legion drab Clarence and

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.770 
that the steel Legion drab Clarence and
and<00:06:46.860> Carrick<00:06:47.280> stone<00:06:50.000> and<00:06:51.000> I<00:06:51.180> think<00:06:51.360> that's<00:06:51.539> it

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 
and Carrick stone and I think that's it

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.749 
and Carrick stone and I think that's it
yeah<00:06:51.960> so<00:06:52.110> I<00:06:52.139> have<00:06:52.289> bone<00:06:52.530> flesh<00:06:53.599> fur<00:06:55.759> leather

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759 
yeah so I have bone flesh fur leather

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:59.439 
yeah so I have bone flesh fur leather
ish<00:06:57.270> stuff

00:06:59.439 --> 00:06:59.449 
ish stuff

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:05.869 
ish stuff

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.020 
yeah there's a whole lots of different

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.350 
yeah there's a whole lots of different
