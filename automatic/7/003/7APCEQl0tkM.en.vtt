 guys it's about and here's you shiny 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.010
 jobs act as you see the Japanese name 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:29.460
 level one hundred is Japanese of course 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.779
 since most users 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.350
 that they have on their own are i 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.880
 Japanese and then the order of through 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.530
 an exchange but it was not 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.230
 traded directly by a Japanese 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.090
 but from a user he knew about 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:48.180
 youtube which is called the rimini and user 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.989
 that you can find in the messages of the 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.699
 video of the Christmas special and smooth in 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.350
 italy in which he found shane i terrapins a 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.219
 on white 2 and nothing now having seen 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.210
 gene saks 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:12.229
 I always show you the gene 7 though 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:15.229
 in battle here I also have with the console 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.229
 download 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.530
 I have to change little because in the first ones 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.530
 team 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:37.740
 in fact team for the first man in 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:40.820
 plastic and here are 7 perfect days now 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.820
 Genesis enters the field 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:55.130
 here is eni james with its little stars 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:58.230
 which indicate the factor of being shiny 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:05.870
 and also the download ability that increases 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:09.360
 the attack now we use a move we say 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:12.990
 unique precisely because only gender 7 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:17.190
 then learning it is called bang technician 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:20.460
 that depending on the module that you see 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.950
 here at the top which is already marked 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.790
 in 7 it will have a different type 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:32.610
 there are four modules one of water 1 of 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:37.560
 electro one of fire and what time not 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:40.080
 remember and precisely depending on which of 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.150
 these tools are assigned the 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:49.170
 move will have the characteristic card type 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:52.350
 of the instrument in this case is the type 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.830
 electric because the instrument I have 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:00.120
 entrusted sometimes module is precisely what 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:02.670
 to switch to the electric type for what 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.260
 he saw in the future a few more like 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.940
 both agenda the normal yes it is 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.560
 legendary shining so to speak 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.489
 all except the decades in Greece and me 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.489
 to the next
