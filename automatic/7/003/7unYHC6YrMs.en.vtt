00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.700
 Sometime between 1938 and 1941, Walker Evans landed 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.500
 To Metro New York City with his camera. 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.100
 He hid it in the folds of his coat, sat opposite his fellow passengers 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.734
 Taking pictures. I have pictured 

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:30.200
 People as they were. They were not aware that Evans 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.567
 Shoot them. Most of us feel 

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:37.600
 Uncomfortable when we know that someone is portraying us. 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.967
 These people, do not take positions of images and are lost in their own ideas. that they 

00:00:42.967 --> 00:00:47.300
 They only live their lives. Evans thought that was an experience 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.700
 The tunnel was part of the contemporary civic life poem. They reveal 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:59.867
 How close we are to the other person and how, even if neither person is together, when taken 

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:05.467
 The image, they become bound together forever. When it is finished, trim the string 

00:01:05.467 --> 00:01:09.100
 To about ninety pictures. When these photos were finally published 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.533
 In the 1960s, he called, "many are invited." Sent from the Bible. Full quote, 

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:19.400
 "Many are invited, but few are chosen." 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.200
 The language of deep photography is about 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.433
 Selectivity. I have harvested the photographer 

00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:29.133
 These passengers, these fellow citizens: 

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.900
 Those who were sleeping or wearing hats, 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.667
 And those looking to one another and to him. Evans wrote about 

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:38.100
 Pictures of this tunnel: "Look. 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.334
 They are the way to educate the eye and more. 

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:44.567
 They gazed, pecked, listened, listened. 

00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:48.533
 Learn something before death. You will not be here long " 

00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:51.500
 I think this is one of his first conceptual art projects 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.266
 Evans taught me that vision is a creative act. 

00:01:55.266 --> 00:02:00.233
 You have to be a geek who does not know remorse. these pictures 

00:02:00.233 --> 00:02:03.400
 Has been painted in fact 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.334
 Perceptual. I do not look at her tenderly, 

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:08.834
 I do not say, "Oh, I wish I lived in the time I wear it 

00:02:08.834 --> 00:02:13.200
 People Fedora hat or comb their hair in a certain way. "I never feel this way. 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.834
 She salutes 

00:02:15.834 --> 00:02:17.100
 My special interest 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.367
 In my time. 

00:02:19.367 --> 00:02:23.500
 The idea is that the pictures are there on the street. I believe that she 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.834
 An incredible gift for those of us who live in cities 

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:31.600
 Who enjoy the preview of our human companion.
