particular<00:00:12.929> video<00:00:13.380> shoot<00:00:13.679> we're<00:00:14.460> talking

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
particular video shoot we're talking

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.330 
particular video shoot we're talking
today<00:00:15.000> about<00:00:15.150> how<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.770> difference<00:00:17.160> between

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
today about how the difference between

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.820 
today about how the difference between
using<00:00:17.940> thinning<00:00:18.510> shears<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.140> using<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.500> razor

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
using thinning shears and using a razor

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.480 
using thinning shears and using a razor
-<00:00:20.460> for<00:00:21.270> hair<00:00:21.769> they're<00:00:22.769> very<00:00:23.039> different

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
- for hair they're very different

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.099 
- for hair they're very different
actually<00:00:23.640> from<00:00:23.880> each<00:00:24.150> other<00:00:24.390> both<00:00:24.660> create

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
actually from each other both create

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.150 
actually from each other both create
similar<00:00:26.099> effects<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:27.439> different<00:00:28.439> contrast

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
similar effects and different contrast

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.099 
similar effects and different contrast
so<00:00:29.340> there's<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.609> term<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:29.910> we<00:00:30.210> use<00:00:30.480> called

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
so there's a term that we use called

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.410 
so there's a term that we use called
texture<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.920> there's<00:00:32.759> also<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.000> term<00:00:33.210> called

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
texture and there's also a term called

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.940 
texture and there's also a term called
thinning<00:00:33.870> now<00:00:34.050> thinning<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.530> lot<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.739> times

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
thinning now thinning a lot of times

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.020 
thinning now thinning a lot of times
people<00:00:35.250> think<00:00:35.280> like<00:00:35.520> oh<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.670> don't<00:00:35.850> want<00:00:35.969> my

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
people think like oh I don't want my

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.220 
people think like oh I don't want my
hair<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.270> be<00:00:36.300> thinned<00:00:36.600> out<00:00:36.750> because<00:00:37.050> you're

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
hair to be thinned out because you're

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.740 
hair to be thinned out because you're
going<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.380> be<00:00:37.500> taking<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.340> hair<00:00:38.520> away<00:00:38.670> but<00:00:39.629> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
going to be taking the hair away but the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.720 
going to be taking the hair away but the
way<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:39.989> we're<00:00:40.140> using<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.250> relation

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
way that we're using it is in relation

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.990 
way that we're using it is in relation
to<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.270> amount<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.050> hair<00:00:43.320> or<00:00:43.590> bulk<00:00:44.100> removal<00:00:44.879> is

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
to the amount of hair or bulk removal is

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.360 
to the amount of hair or bulk removal is
probably<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.390> better<00:00:45.539> way<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.170> coin<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
probably a better way to you coin the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.549 
probably a better way to you coin the
phrase<00:00:47.520> for<00:00:47.969> thinning<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.690> case<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
phrase for thinning in this case the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.040 
phrase for thinning in this case the
other<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.920> texture<00:00:50.520> which<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.940> meaning<00:00:51.329> do<00:00:51.930> you

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
other is texture which is meaning do you

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.889 
other is texture which is meaning do you
have<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.910> flat<00:00:53.910> texture<00:00:54.329> do<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.660> have<00:00:54.809> an

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
have a flat texture do you have an

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.049 
have a flat texture do you have an
activated<00:00:55.500> texture<00:00:56.129> what<00:00:56.460> that's<00:00:56.699> talking

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
activated texture what that's talking

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.729 
activated texture what that's talking
about<00:00:57.300> basically<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.230> when<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.559> have<00:00:58.710> your

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
about basically is when you have your

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.010 
about basically is when you have your
hair<00:00:59.039> cut<00:00:59.070> if<00:00:59.520> you're<00:01:00.059> using<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.420> regular<00:01:00.690> pair

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
hair cut if you're using a regular pair

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.789 
hair cut if you're using a regular pair
of<00:01:01.170> shears<00:01:01.500> for<00:01:01.770> example<00:01:03.199> it's<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:04.680> a

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
of shears for example it's a it's a

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.130 
of shears for example it's a it's a
blunt<00:01:05.189> straight<00:01:05.729> across<00:01:05.970> cut<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:06.720> all<00:01:06.960> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
blunt straight across cut so all the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.350 
blunt straight across cut so all the
hairs<00:01:07.350> are<00:01:07.650> being<00:01:08.100> cut<00:01:08.340> you're<00:01:08.850> taking<00:01:09.150> up<00:01:09.240> a

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
hairs are being cut you're taking up a

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.120 
hairs are being cut you're taking up a
section<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.780> hair<00:01:09.930> you're<00:01:10.409> cutting<00:01:10.770> across

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
section of hair you're cutting across

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.789 
section of hair you're cutting across
and<00:01:11.490> that's<00:01:11.549> leaving<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.210> straight<00:01:13.049> flat<00:01:13.439> cut

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
and that's leaving a straight flat cut

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.050 
and that's leaving a straight flat cut
almost<00:01:14.040> like<00:01:14.220> if<00:01:14.369> you're<00:01:14.490> cutting<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.820> blade<00:01:15.030> of

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
almost like if you're cutting a blade of

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
almost like if you're cutting a blade of
grass<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.960> nice<00:01:16.140> even<00:01:16.470> flat<00:01:16.950> straight

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
grass and it's a nice even flat straight

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.649 
grass and it's a nice even flat straight
manicured<00:01:19.080> cut<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:20.280> you're<00:01:20.909> using<00:01:21.060> thinning

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
manicured cut if you're using thinning

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.440 
manicured cut if you're using thinning
shears<00:01:22.020> as<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:23.280> notice<00:01:23.909> on<00:01:24.119> if<00:01:24.299> you're

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
shears as you notice on if you're

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.690 
shears as you notice on if you're
looking<00:01:24.750> at<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.110> shear<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.619> they<00:01:26.159> come<00:01:26.549> in

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
looking at the shear and they come in

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.609 
looking at the shear and they come in
different<00:01:26.880> sizes<00:01:27.229> you'll<00:01:28.229> notice<00:01:28.500> that

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
different sizes you'll notice that

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.710 
different sizes you'll notice that
there's<00:01:28.799> little<00:01:29.040> grooves<00:01:29.490> going<00:01:30.390> into<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
there's little grooves going into the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.690 
there's little grooves going into the
shears<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.380> what<00:01:31.770> that's<00:01:32.009> doing<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.520> it's

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
shears and what that's doing is it's

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.530 
shears and what that's doing is it's
it's<00:01:32.880> removing<00:01:33.509> bulk<00:01:33.810> hair<00:01:34.200> from<00:01:35.420> from<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
it's removing bulk hair from from the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.850 
it's removing bulk hair from from the
area<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.990> you're<00:01:37.140> cutting<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.740> it's

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
area that you're cutting and it's

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.580 
area that you're cutting and it's
actually<00:01:38.250> taking<00:01:39.180> out<00:01:39.299> only<00:01:39.750> pieces<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.409> hair

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
actually taking out only pieces of hair

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.950 
actually taking out only pieces of hair
that<00:01:40.619> fall<00:01:41.100> within<00:01:41.369> those<00:01:41.759> grooves<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.869> you

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
that fall within those grooves so you

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.870 
that fall within those grooves so you
can<00:01:43.140> have<00:01:43.320> bigger<00:01:43.710> grooves<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.220> can<00:01:44.430> smaller

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
can have bigger grooves you can smaller

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.480 
can have bigger grooves you can smaller
grooves<00:01:45.320> these<00:01:46.320> are<00:01:46.470> my<00:01:46.560> most<00:01:46.770> common<00:01:47.220> shears

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
grooves these are my most common shears

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.420 
grooves these are my most common shears
that<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.329> use<00:01:48.509> for<00:01:48.899> doing<00:01:49.619> bulk<00:01:50.100> hair

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
that I like to use for doing bulk hair

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.069 
that I like to use for doing bulk hair
removal<00:01:51.000> if<00:01:51.119> you're<00:01:51.240> trying<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.509> thin<00:01:51.869> out<00:01:52.049> a

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
removal if you're trying to thin out a

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.580 
removal if you're trying to thin out a
section<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.829> also<00:01:53.579> create<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.149> texture<00:01:55.049> so

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
section and also create a texture so

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.039 
section and also create a texture so
it's<00:01:55.770> still<00:01:55.979> going<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.369> create<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.939> flat<00:01:57.780> edge

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
it's still going to create a flat edge

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.620 
it's still going to create a flat edge
but<00:01:58.979> it's<00:01:59.100> going<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.310> remove<00:01:59.610> different<00:01:59.880> parts

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
but it's going to remove different parts

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.569 
but it's going to remove different parts
of<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.810> hair<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.380> lays<00:02:01.740> down<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.490> it

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
it gets unmanageable so if we take a

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.870 
it gets unmanageable so if we take a
section<00:02:25.090> of<00:02:25.210> this<00:02:25.330> of<00:02:25.570> his<00:02:25.750> hair<00:02:25.990> for<00:02:26.200> example

thing<00:02:53.050> with<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.260> razor<00:02:53.560> is<00:02:53.890> again<00:02:54.850> it<00:02:55.060> has

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
thing with a razor is again it has

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.790 
thing with a razor is again it has
grooves<00:02:55.690> so<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:55.990> have<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:56.170> straight<00:02:56.560> edge

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
grooves so you have a straight edge

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.699 
grooves so you have a straight edge
razor<00:02:57.100> blade<00:02:57.580> that's<00:02:58.030> on<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.300> inside<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.080> on

the outer side the section that's facing
the<00:03:01.690> client<00:03:02.200> you<00:03:02.860> have<00:03:03.040> these<00:03:03.220> grooves<00:03:03.610> so

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
the client you have these grooves so

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.120 
the client you have these grooves so
anything<00:03:04.330> that<00:03:04.480> any<00:03:04.780> hair<00:03:05.410> that<00:03:05.440> falls<00:03:05.830> within

anything that any hair that falls within

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.710 
anything that any hair that falls within
the<00:03:06.340> grooves<00:03:06.610> is<00:03:06.880> what's<00:03:07.090> going<00:03:07.240> to<00:03:07.300> be<00:03:07.450> cut

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
the grooves is what's going to be cut

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.380 
the grooves is what's going to be cut
what's<00:03:08.440> nice<00:03:08.650> with<00:03:08.830> a<00:03:08.950> with<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.430> razor<00:03:09.850> is<00:03:10.240> that

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
what's nice with a with a razor is that

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.410 
what's nice with a with a razor is that
it<00:03:10.510> creates<00:03:10.840> what<00:03:11.620> we<00:03:11.740> call<00:03:11.920> a<00:03:12.130> jagged<00:03:12.760> edge<00:03:12.940> so

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
it creates what we call a jagged edge so

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.990 
it creates what we call a jagged edge so
instead<00:03:14.080> of<00:03:14.140> being<00:03:14.350> straight<00:03:14.770> across<00:03:15.040> it's

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
instead of being straight across it's

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.850 
instead of being straight across it's
creating<00:03:16.420> an<00:03:16.510> angled<00:03:16.990> edge<00:03:17.200> because<00:03:17.650> of<00:03:17.680> the

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
creating an angled edge because of the

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.280 
creating an angled edge because of the
way<00:03:17.950> that<00:03:18.160> you're<00:03:18.310> using<00:03:18.550> it<00:03:18.850> to<00:03:19.570> create<00:03:20.019> that

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
way that you're using it to create that

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.060 
way that you're using it to create that
angled<00:03:20.650> edge<00:03:20.800> its<00:03:22.050> leaves<00:03:23.050> it<00:03:23.200> more<00:03:23.350> activated

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
angled edge its leaves it more activated

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.890 
angled edge its leaves it more activated
so<00:03:24.250> instead<00:03:24.820> of<00:03:24.910> hair<00:03:25.090> just<00:03:25.269> laying<00:03:25.510> straight

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
so instead of hair just laying straight

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.190 
so instead of hair just laying straight
down<00:03:26.290> it<00:03:26.650> lays<00:03:27.130> at<00:03:27.370> an<00:03:27.489> angle<00:03:27.940> and<00:03:28.150> it<00:03:28.570> tends<00:03:29.110> to

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
down it lays at an angle and it tends to

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.540 
down it lays at an angle and it tends to
be<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.470> more<00:03:29.590> natural<00:03:30.100> way<00:03:30.220> that<00:03:30.400> your<00:03:30.519> hair

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
be the more natural way that your hair

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.110 
be the more natural way that your hair
grows<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:32.080> key<00:03:32.769> thing<00:03:33.070> with<00:03:33.280> a<00:03:33.310> razor<00:03:33.610> though<00:03:33.970> is

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
grows a key thing with a razor though is

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.310 
grows a key thing with a razor though is
you<00:03:34.239> need<00:03:34.390> to<00:03:34.420> make<00:03:34.540> sure<00:03:34.660> that<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:35.110> hair<00:03:35.290> is

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
you need to make sure that the hair is

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.740 
you need to make sure that the hair is
either<00:03:35.709> damp<00:03:36.459> or<00:03:36.670> wet<00:03:36.730> when<00:03:37.150> you're<00:03:37.269> using<00:03:37.450> it

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
either damp or wet when you're using it

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.560 
either damp or wet when you're using it
because<00:03:38.620> if<00:03:38.920> not<00:03:39.400> it<00:03:39.610> will<00:03:39.670> pull<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.060> clients

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
because if not it will pull the clients

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.170 
because if not it will pull the clients
head<00:03:40.780> so<00:03:41.140> you<00:03:42.100> always<00:03:42.310> want<00:03:42.489> to<00:03:42.519> you<00:03:42.880> know<00:03:42.970> add

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
head so you always want to you know add

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.979 
head so you always want to you know add
a<00:03:43.209> little<00:03:43.450> water<00:03:43.690> into<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.230> picture<00:03:45.930> and<00:03:46.930> you

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
a little water into the picture and you

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.500 
a little water into the picture and you
can<00:03:47.110> just<00:03:47.380> sort<00:03:47.530> of<00:03:47.730> cut<00:03:48.730> down<00:03:48.940> now<00:03:49.120> like<00:03:49.300> for

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
can just sort of cut down now like for

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.390 
can just sort of cut down now like for
example<00:03:49.600> if<00:03:50.080> I'm<00:03:50.260> using<00:03:50.500> it<00:03:50.709> on<00:03:50.800> the<00:03:50.950> top<00:03:51.190> of

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
example if I'm using it on the top of

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.040 
example if I'm using it on the top of
his<00:03:51.610> head<00:03:51.820> that's<00:03:52.060> probably<00:03:52.360> the<00:03:52.480> most<00:03:52.660> common

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
his head that's probably the most common

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.590 
his head that's probably the most common
place<00:03:53.260> that<00:03:53.290> I<00:03:53.530> would<00:03:53.769> use<00:03:53.980> a<00:03:54.160> razor<00:03:55.150> of<00:03:55.450> this

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
place that I would use a razor of this

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.650 
place that I would use a razor of this
kind<00:03:55.840> of<00:03:55.959> capacity<00:03:56.709> I<00:03:57.090> would<00:03:58.090> take<00:03:58.300> a<00:03:58.330> section

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
kind of capacity I would take a section

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.860 
kind of capacity I would take a section
of<00:03:58.900> his<00:03:59.050> hair<00:04:00.090> but<00:04:01.090> I<00:04:01.180> wanted<00:04:01.450> to<00:04:01.570> create<00:04:01.840> that

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
of his hair but I wanted to create that

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.550 
of his hair but I wanted to create that
more<00:04:02.940> sort<00:04:03.940> of<00:04:04.000> jagged<00:04:04.209> edge<00:04:04.600> I<00:04:04.900> would<00:04:05.230> take

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
more sort of jagged edge I would take

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.250 
more sort of jagged edge I would take
and<00:04:05.830> hold<00:04:05.980> it<00:04:06.190> in<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:06.640> you<00:04:07.510> can<00:04:07.690> see<00:04:07.900> that<00:04:08.080> the

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
and hold it in and you can see that the

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.110 
and hold it in and you can see that the
where<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.650> sections<00:04:09.100> are<00:04:09.310> that<00:04:09.640> it's<00:04:09.790> fooling

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
where the sections are that it's fooling

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.140 
where the sections are that it's fooling
in<00:04:10.299> and<00:04:10.480> you<00:04:10.930> just<00:04:11.080> sort<00:04:11.230> of<00:04:11.320> pull<00:04:12.070> it<00:04:12.190> up<00:04:12.400> put

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
in and you just sort of pull it up put

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.550 
in and you just sort of pull it up put
your<00:04:13.269> thumb<00:04:13.510> right<00:04:13.540> against<00:04:13.989> the<00:04:14.080> base<00:04:14.260> here

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
your thumb right against the base here

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.460 
your thumb right against the base here
and<00:04:14.680> you<00:04:14.920> pull<00:04:15.160> up<00:04:15.370> and<00:04:15.780> what's<00:04:16.780> that<00:04:16.959> doing<00:04:17.320> is

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
and you pull up and what's that doing is

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.070 
and you pull up and what's that doing is
that's<00:04:17.979> its<00:04:18.250> cutting<00:04:18.850> but<00:04:19.600> it's<00:04:19.720> cutting<00:04:19.959> at

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
that's its cutting but it's cutting at

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.750 
that's its cutting but it's cutting at
that<00:04:20.229> jagged<00:04:20.680> edge<00:04:20.859> as<00:04:21.160> you're<00:04:21.280> pulling<00:04:21.609> up

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
that jagged edge as you're pulling up

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.890 
that jagged edge as you're pulling up
and<00:04:21.940> that's<00:04:22.090> going<00:04:22.300> to<00:04:22.419> create<00:04:22.539> a<00:04:22.690> very

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
and that's going to create a very

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.440 
and that's going to create a very
textured<00:04:23.530> look<00:04:23.830> rather<00:04:24.130> than<00:04:24.280> having<00:04:25.000> it<00:04:25.240> be

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
textured look rather than having it be

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.150 
textured look rather than having it be
just<00:04:25.690> straight<00:04:26.080> across<00:04:26.350> laying

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
just straight across laying

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.430 
just straight across laying
flat<00:04:27.340> it's<00:04:28.000> going<00:04:28.150> to<00:04:28.240> cut<00:04:28.390> at<00:04:28.540> various<00:04:28.990> angles

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
flat it's going to cut at various angles

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.560 
flat it's going to cut at various angles
and<00:04:29.740> when<00:04:29.950> it<00:04:30.040> grows<00:04:30.280> it'll<00:04:31.090> grow<00:04:31.240> it<00:04:31.330> a<00:04:31.420> more

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
and when it grows it'll grow it a more

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.200 
and when it grows it'll grow it a more
natural<00:04:31.600> length<00:04:32.350> rather<00:04:32.650> than<00:04:33.210> growing

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
natural length rather than growing

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.240 
natural length rather than growing
straight<00:04:34.480> across<00:04:34.750> so<00:04:35.140> I<00:04:35.590> hope<00:04:35.770> that<00:04:35.920> answers

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
straight across so I hope that answers

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.160 
straight across so I hope that answers
some<00:04:36.520> of<00:04:36.550> your<00:04:36.670> questions<00:04:36.790> about<00:04:37.450> what's<00:04:38.020> the

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
difference between using thinning shears

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.420 
difference between using thinning shears
