00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.749 
for that elongated shape then I'm going
to<00:01:38.790> blend<00:01:39.420> from<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:40.020> line<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.590> across<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
to blend from that line and across the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.910 
to blend from that line and across the
crease<00:01:42.030> with<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.570> same<00:01:42.930> dark<00:01:43.320> brown<00:01:43.590> shadow

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
crease with that same dark brown shadow

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.160 
crease with that same dark brown shadow
if<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.610> work<00:01:44.820> your<00:01:45.030> way<00:01:45.149> from<00:01:45.210> light<00:01:45.689> colors

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
if you work your way from light colors

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.200 
if you work your way from light colors
to<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.500> darker<00:01:46.950> colors<00:01:47.310> it's<00:01:47.729> going<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.060> make

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
to the darker colors it's going to make

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.270 
to the darker colors it's going to make
the<00:01:48.360> blending<00:01:48.689> process<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.380> much<00:01:49.560> easier<00:01:50.130> for

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
the blending process so much easier for

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.399
