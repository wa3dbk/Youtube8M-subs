00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
going to show you how to make a paper

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.810 
going to show you how to make a paper
cup<00:00:05.690> this<00:00:06.690> one's<00:00:07.020> probably<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:08.160> easiest

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
cup this one's probably the easiest

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.940 
cup this one's probably the easiest
origami<00:00:09.420> you<00:00:09.630> can<00:00:09.690> ever<00:00:09.990> make<00:00:10.670> so<00:00:12.440> you<00:00:13.440> fold<00:00:13.740> it

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
origami you can ever make so you fold it

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:25.240 
origami you can ever make so you fold it
over<00:00:14.130> like<00:00:16.340> this

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.180 

and<00:00:26.030> then<00:00:27.460> you<00:00:28.460> have<00:00:28.580> to<00:00:28.670> fold<00:00:28.940> it<00:00:29.090> perfectly

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 
and then you have to fold it perfectly

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.479 
and then you have to fold it perfectly
so<00:00:31.190> you<00:00:31.279> fold<00:00:31.520> it<00:00:31.640> over<00:00:31.790> like<00:00:32.000> that<00:00:33.309> so<00:00:34.309> it's

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
so you fold it over like that so it's

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.560 
so you fold it over like that so it's
like<00:00:34.700> this<00:00:35.120> okay<00:00:36.080> then<00:00:36.830> you<00:00:37.760> get<00:00:37.970> the<00:00:38.150> extra

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
like this okay then you get the extra

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.470 
like this okay then you get the extra
paper<00:00:38.870> and<00:00:39.260> you<00:00:40.250> cut<00:00:40.460> it<00:00:40.580> off<00:00:40.730> so<00:00:41.000> it's<00:00:41.120> just<00:00:41.360> a

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
paper and you cut it off so it's just a

00:00:41.480 --> 00:01:05.200 
paper and you cut it off so it's just a
triangle<00:00:53.710> get<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:54.890> edges<00:00:55.340> here<00:01:01.960> see<00:01:03.009> so<00:01:04.210> just

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
triangle get the edges here see so just

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.650 
triangle get the edges here see so just
throw<00:01:05.449> that<00:01:05.750> over<00:01:05.930> there<00:01:06.910> okay<00:01:07.910> so<00:01:08.330> you<00:01:08.390> have

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
throw that over there okay so you have

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.020 
throw that over there okay so you have
it<00:01:08.840> like<00:01:08.990> this<00:01:09.259> okay<00:01:09.830> so<00:01:10.250> then<00:01:10.490> you<00:01:10.610> get<00:01:10.789> there

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
it like this okay so then you get there

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:18.240 
it like this okay so then you get there
to<00:01:11.149> corner<00:01:11.570> and<00:01:12.140> you<00:01:12.170> fold<00:01:12.740> it<00:01:12.890> like<00:01:13.039> that<00:01:13.280> then

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.130 

you<00:01:19.250> get<00:01:19.520> it<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:19.789> other<00:01:19.910> corner<00:01:20.450> and<00:01:20.690> date<00:01:20.840> do

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
you get it the other corner and date do

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:33.840 
you get it the other corner and date do
the<00:01:21.289> same<00:01:21.530> thing

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.149

and then you get it you have both
triangles<00:01:39.159> and<00:01:39.580> then<00:01:39.850> fold<00:01:40.150> them<00:01:40.390> both<00:01:40.689> over

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
triangles and then fold them both over

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:49.410 
triangles and then fold them both over
seas<00:01:41.890> and<00:01:42.159> the<00:01:42.580> other<00:01:42.759> side<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:48.149> then<00:01:49.149> you
