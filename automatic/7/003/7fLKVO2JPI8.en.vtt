00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
all right as you can see the flame draws

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.280 
all right as you can see the flame draws
inward<00:00:34.150> real<00:00:34.360> quickly<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.750> far<00:00:38.020> it's<00:00:38.200> a

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
inward real quickly so so far it's a

inward real quickly so so far it's a
very<00:00:38.560> easy<00:00:38.710> light<00:00:39.040> up<00:00:39.600> we'll<00:00:40.600> come<00:00:40.720> back<00:00:40.870> when

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
very easy light up we'll come back when

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.420 
very easy light up we'll come back when
the<00:00:41.140> kindling<00:00:41.530> is<00:00:41.650> caught<00:00:41.890> and<00:00:42.040> we're<00:00:42.160> putting

the kindling is caught and we're putting

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.320 
the kindling is caught and we're putting
some<00:00:42.550> bigger<00:00:42.730> boy<00:00:42.910> wood<00:00:43.330> on<00:00:43.480> the<00:00:43.600> fire

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
still got a lot of fuel in it so it is

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.499 
still got a lot of fuel in it so it is
burning<00:01:02.440> a<00:01:02.650> little<00:01:02.860> rich<00:01:03.129> right<00:01:03.460> now<00:01:03.640> we'll

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
burning a little rich right now we'll

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:05.969 
burning a little rich right now we'll
see<00:01:04.690> how<00:01:04.809> she<00:01:04.869> goes<00:01:05.110> when<00:01:05.380> I<00:01:05.410> start<00:01:05.710> actually

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979

see how she goes when I start actually
putting<00:01:06.310> bigger<00:01:06.580> pieces<00:01:06.820> of<00:01:07.060> wood<00:01:07.150> off<00:01:07.270> the

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
putting bigger pieces of wood off the

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.660 
putting bigger pieces of wood off the
fire<00:01:07.800> I'll<00:01:08.800> show<00:01:08.979> that<00:01:09.009> here<00:01:09.400> in<00:01:09.490> a<00:01:09.520> few

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
fire I'll show that here in a few

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.450 
fire I'll show that here in a few
minutes

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
minutes

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.270 
minutes
all<00:01:12.460> right<00:01:12.640> she's<00:01:12.940> burning<00:01:13.270> rich<00:01:13.660> still<00:01:14.280> but

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
all right she's burning rich still but

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.230 
all right she's burning rich still but
you<00:01:15.430> should<00:01:15.670> be<00:01:15.820> able<00:01:15.880> to<00:01:16.030> see<00:01:16.150> the

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
you should be able to see the

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.350 
you should be able to see the
gasification<00:01:16.630> going<00:01:17.229> on<00:01:17.410> in<00:01:17.619> there

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
gasification going on in there

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.150 
gasification going on in there
that<00:01:19.360> is<00:01:19.540> pretty<00:01:19.900> impressive<00:01:20.110> let<00:01:20.860> me<00:01:20.890> see<00:01:21.070> if

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
that is pretty impressive let me see if

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.980 
that is pretty impressive let me see if
I<00:01:21.250> can<00:01:21.369> zoom<00:01:21.400> in<00:01:21.729> that<00:01:21.970> scorched<00:01:22.360> my<00:01:22.540> camera

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
I can zoom in that scorched my camera

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.190 
I can zoom in that scorched my camera
here<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.790> wind<00:01:25.030> keeps<00:01:25.180> changing<00:01:25.570> on<00:01:25.899> there's

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
here the wind keeps changing on there's

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.340 
here the wind keeps changing on there's
a<00:01:26.259> slight<00:01:26.530> breeze<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.810> should<00:01:29.050> be<00:01:29.200> able<00:01:29.259> see

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
a slight breeze you should be able see

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.440 
a slight breeze you should be able see
those<00:01:29.590> gasification<00:01:30.399> Jets<00:01:32.880> yeah<00:01:33.880> my<00:01:34.119> fingers

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
those gasification Jets yeah my fingers

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.320 
those gasification Jets yeah my fingers
crossed<00:01:34.750> this<00:01:34.990> is<00:01:35.140> looking<00:01:35.440> like<00:01:35.500> a<00:01:35.649> success

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
crossed this is looking like a success

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.669 
crossed this is looking like a success
it's<00:01:37.330> got<00:01:37.479> a<00:01:37.509> choke<00:01:37.750> back<00:01:37.960> on<00:01:38.170> how<00:01:38.289> much<00:01:38.470> wood

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:38.679 
it's got a choke back on how much wood

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:44.600 
it's got a choke back on how much wood
is<00:01:38.800> in<00:01:38.950> here<00:01:39.160> and<00:01:39.280> we<00:01:39.399> should<00:01:39.460> be<00:01:39.670> good<00:01:40.330> to<00:01:40.420> go

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.559 

all<00:01:45.610> right<00:01:45.759> so<00:01:45.970> we've<00:01:46.090> been<00:01:46.119> running<00:01:46.390> for

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
all right so we've been running for

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:47.609 
all right so we've been running for
about<00:01:46.750> an<00:01:47.020> hour<00:01:47.110> now

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
about an hour now

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.749 
about an hour now
I<00:01:47.649> just<00:01:48.130> put<00:01:48.369> three<00:01:49.149> more<00:01:49.240> logs<00:01:49.630> on<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:49.959> fire

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
I just put three more logs on the fire

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.090 
I just put three more logs on the fire
these<00:01:51.759> are<00:01:51.819> good<00:01:52.209> sized<00:01:52.420> ones<00:01:52.800> so<00:01:53.800> the<00:01:53.890> first

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
these are good sized ones so the first

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.029 
these are good sized ones so the first
thing<00:01:54.250> we'll<00:01:54.369> look<00:01:54.550> at<00:01:54.789> is<00:01:55.179> the<00:01:55.830> amount<00:01:56.830> of

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
thing we'll look at is the amount of

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.290 
thing we'll look at is the amount of
coal<00:01:57.310> buildup<00:01:57.789> and<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.090> size<00:01:58.330> thereof<00:02:00.300> it's

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
coal buildup and the size thereof it's

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.029 
coal buildup and the size thereof it's
not<00:02:01.479> bad<00:02:01.660> for<00:02:01.899> an<00:02:01.990> hour's<00:02:02.229> time<00:02:02.500> I've<00:02:02.800> not

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
not bad for an hour's time I've not

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.710 
not bad for an hour's time I've not
scraped<00:02:03.340> it<00:02:03.490> out<00:02:03.729> as<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:04.000> can<00:02:04.119> see<00:02:04.300> there's<00:02:04.569> no

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
scraped it out as you can see there's no

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.210 
scraped it out as you can see there's no
scrapings<00:02:05.259> yet<00:02:06.929> that's<00:02:07.929> that

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
scrapings yet that's that

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.060 
scrapings yet that's that
since<00:02:11.060> I<00:02:11.150> just<00:02:11.360> put<00:02:11.540> wood<00:02:12.290> on<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.620> fire<00:02:12.800> we

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
since I just put wood on the fire we

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.490 
since I just put wood on the fire we
should<00:02:13.310> have<00:02:13.520> amazing<00:02:14.240> gasification<00:02:14.990> going

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
should have amazing gasification going

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.500 
should have amazing gasification going
I<00:02:15.910> think<00:02:16.910> that's<00:02:17.090> roundabout<00:02:17.900> shots<00:02:18.260> here<00:02:19.510> I'm

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
I think that's roundabout shots here I'm

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.030 
I think that's roundabout shots here I'm
using<00:02:20.690> shorter<00:02:21.170> pieces<00:02:21.500> of<00:02:21.590> firewood<00:02:21.980> I

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
using shorter pieces of firewood I

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.710 
using shorter pieces of firewood I
recommend<00:02:22.520> using<00:02:22.700> about<00:02:22.970> 10<00:02:23.360> inch<00:02:23.630> long

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
recommend using about 10 inch long

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.620 
recommend using about 10 inch long
pieces<00:02:24.820> you'll<00:02:25.820> notice<00:02:26.120> very<00:02:26.390> nice

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
pieces you'll notice very nice

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.660 
pieces you'll notice very nice
gasification<00:02:27.440> going<00:02:27.710> on<00:02:27.800> along<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.280> side

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
gasification going on along the side

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.620 
gasification going on along the side
swells<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.270> top<00:02:29.510> of<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.870> air<00:02:30.500> injector<00:02:31.630> just

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
swells the top of the air injector just

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.610 
swells the top of the air injector just
working<00:02:32.990> exactly<00:02:33.440> as<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:33.950> planned

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
working exactly as I planned

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.960 
working exactly as I planned
and<00:02:36.620> then<00:02:36.830> to<00:02:37.010> give<00:02:37.160> you<00:02:37.280> an<00:02:37.370> idea<00:02:37.520> of<00:02:37.700> what<00:02:37.850> the

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
and then to give you an idea of what the

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.310 
and then to give you an idea of what the
exhaust<00:02:38.270> looks<00:02:38.570> like<00:02:38.720> even<00:02:38.960> though<00:02:39.170> we're

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
exhaust looks like even though we're

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.880 
exhaust looks like even though we're
running<00:02:39.650> rich<00:02:39.890> look<00:02:40.280> how<00:02:40.460> clear<00:02:40.760> that<00:02:40.790> is<00:02:41.890> you

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
running rich look how clear that is you

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.520 
running rich look how clear that is you
got<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.160> Sun<00:02:43.540> going<00:02:44.540> right<00:02:44.840> across<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.320> top

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
got the Sun going right across the top

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.070 
got the Sun going right across the top
there<00:02:48.730> about<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.850> only<00:02:50.120> emissions<00:02:50.570> I<00:02:50.690> really

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
there about the only emissions I really

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.380 
there about the only emissions I really
picked<00:02:51.350> up<00:02:51.530> on<00:02:51.740> much<00:02:52.130> is<00:02:52.490> a<00:02:52.520> little<00:02:53.030> bit<00:02:53.120> of<00:02:53.210> fly

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
picked up on much is a little bit of fly

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.960 
picked up on much is a little bit of fly
ash<00:02:53.600> and<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.320> faintest<00:02:54.920> bit<00:02:55.190> of<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.460> wood<00:02:55.670> smoke

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
ash and the faintest bit of a wood smoke

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.960 
ash and the faintest bit of a wood smoke
smelt<00:02:56.300> just<00:02:56.600> faint<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:58.310> I<00:02:58.460> think<00:02:58.670> that<00:02:58.850> could

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
smelt just faint and I think that could

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.860 
smelt just faint and I think that could
be<00:02:59.000> cleared<00:02:59.330> up<00:02:59.450> with<00:02:59.600> some<00:02:59.750> insulation<00:03:00.430> so

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
be cleared up with some insulation so

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.210 
be cleared up with some insulation so
very<00:03:02.870> happy<00:03:03.140> with<00:03:03.470> this<00:03:04.300> seems<00:03:05.300> to<00:03:05.480> work<00:03:06.220> the

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
very happy with this seems to work the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.740 
very happy with this seems to work the
injector<00:03:07.670> seems<00:03:07.880> to<00:03:08.000> be<00:03:08.090> fine<00:03:08.360> I<00:03:08.390> don't<00:03:08.630> think

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
injector seems to be fine I don't think

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.360 
injector seems to be fine I don't think
I'm<00:03:08.870> gonna<00:03:09.020> need<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.350> change<00:03:09.560> anything<00:03:10.130> on

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
I'm gonna need to change anything on

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.240 
I'm gonna need to change anything on
that<00:03:10.640> so<00:03:11.710> looks<00:03:12.710> like<00:03:12.770> it's<00:03:12.890> a<00:03:13.070> rock-solid

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
that so looks like it's a rock-solid

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.120 
that so looks like it's a rock-solid
