00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
into site Seaver but I thought Detroit

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.000

would<00:00:32.219> be<00:00:32.399> an<00:00:32.700> ideal<00:00:33.120> map<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.870> test<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:34.800> gun

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
would be an ideal map to test this gun

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.660 
would be an ideal map to test this gun
out<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.910> know<00:00:36.030> there's<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.300> lot<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.480> sort<00:00:37.230> of

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
out you know there's a lot of sort of

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.819 
out you know there's a lot of sort of
areas<00:00:38.670> little<00:00:38.969> corners<00:00:39.530> honestly<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.649> feels

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
areas little corners honestly it feels

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.529 
areas little corners honestly it feels
weird<00:00:41.219> using<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.680> no<00:00:43.680> no<00:00:44.100> no<00:00:44.489> no<00:00:44.969> I've<00:00:45.239> added

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
weird using it no no no no I've added

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.150

the<00:00:45.840> silencer<00:00:46.410> as<00:00:46.530> well<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.739> don't<00:00:47.010> know<00:00:47.100> if

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
the silencer as well I don't know if

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.209 
the silencer as well I don't know if
that<00:00:47.280> was<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.760> good<00:00:48.300> idea<00:00:48.660> purely<00:00:49.590> because<00:00:49.829> I

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
that was a a good idea purely because I

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.400 
that was a a good idea purely because I
want<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> bit<00:00:51.030> stealthy<00:00:51.329> using<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> SMG

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
want to be a bit stealthy using the SMG

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.040 
want to be a bit stealthy using the SMG
always<00:00:52.590> better<00:00:52.829> get<00:00:53.010> close<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.460> people<00:00:54.020> but<00:00:55.020> I

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
always better get close to people but I

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.450 
always better get close to people but I
don't<00:00:55.710> know<00:00:55.800> if<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:56.010> going<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.160> do<00:00:56.250> many

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
don't know if it's going to do many

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.110 
don't know if it's going to do many
favors<00:00:56.940> it's<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.690> down<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.140> bars<00:00:58.440> already

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
favors it's it's down to bars already

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.399 
favors it's it's down to bars already
with<00:01:01.070> what<00:01:02.070> sits<00:01:02.399> down<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.550> bars<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.409> range

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
with what sits down to bars on a range

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.280 
with what sits down to bars on a range
so<00:01:05.150> but<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.180> didn't<00:01:06.510> think<00:01:06.570> range<00:01:07.080> would<00:01:07.229> be

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
so but I didn't think range would be

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.450 
so but I didn't think range would be
like<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> major<00:01:08.010> problem<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:09.210> map<00:01:10.280> it's<00:01:11.280> my

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
like a major problem on this map it's my

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.160 
like a major problem on this map it's my
first<00:01:11.640> ever<00:01:11.880> time<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.210> using<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.630> as<00:01:12.720> well<00:01:12.900> at

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
first ever time of using it as well at

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.859 
first ever time of using it as well at
honestly<00:01:13.830> at<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> moment<00:01:14.430> I've<00:01:15.240> got<00:01:15.420> grip<00:01:15.659> and

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
honestly at a moment I've got grip and

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.630 
honestly at a moment I've got grip and
suppressor<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:16.979> bill<00:01:17.159> was<00:01:17.310> kind<00:01:17.549> of

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
suppressor and it's bill was kind of

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.719 
suppressor and it's bill was kind of
weird<00:01:17.930> I've<00:01:18.930> used<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.409> original<00:01:20.009> no<00:01:20.700> I

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729
