your<00:02:17.020> quarter<00:02:17.260> 20<00:02:17.530> goes<00:02:17.710> into<00:02:18.040> your<00:02:18.160> tripod

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
your quarter 20 goes into your tripod

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.710 
your quarter 20 goes into your tripod
mount<00:02:19.300> I<00:02:19.600> actually<00:02:20.110> started<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.710> spin<00:02:21.100> and

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
mount I actually started to spin and

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.920 
mount I actually started to spin and
ruin<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:23.310> tripod<00:02:24.310> mount<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.510> did<00:02:25.690> for<00:02:25.840> the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
ruin the tripod mount and I did for the

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.220 
ruin the tripod mount and I did for the
whole<00:02:25.990> thing<00:02:26.230> way<00:02:26.580> so<00:02:27.580> I<00:02:27.940> got<00:02:28.690> that<00:02:28.900> one<00:02:29.080> on

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
whole thing way so I got that one on

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.630 
whole thing way so I got that one on
there<00:02:29.410> this<00:02:29.800> one's<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.040> little<00:02:30.160> shorter

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
there this one's a little shorter

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.680 
there this one's a little shorter
because<00:02:30.820> I<00:02:31.560> wanted<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:32.650> mount<00:02:32.860> it<00:02:33.040> onto<00:02:33.190> my<00:02:33.400> AR

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
because I wanted to mount it onto my AR

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.780 
because I wanted to mount it onto my AR
here<00:02:34.690> is<00:02:34.930> just<00:02:35.380> a<00:02:35.580> flashlight<00:02:38.160> holder<00:02:39.160> the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
here is just a flashlight holder the

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.440 
here is just a flashlight holder the
mouth<00:02:40.180> under<00:02:40.510> your<00:02:40.630> rail<00:02:42.090> this<00:02:43.090> one's<00:02:43.330> a

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
mouth under your rail this one's a

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.040 
mouth under your rail this one's a
one-inch<00:02:44.070> diameter<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:46.330> I<00:02:46.360> made<00:02:46.570> this<00:02:46.750> one

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
one-inch diameter so I made this one

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
one-inch diameter so I made this one
inch<00:02:47.320> I'm<00:02:47.920> sure<00:02:48.100> you<00:02:48.190> can<00:02:48.340> buy<00:02:48.520> one<00:02:49.090> inch<00:02:50.070> they

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
inch I'm sure you can buy one inch they

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.910 
inch I'm sure you can buy one inch they
put<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.400> in<00:02:51.490> there<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:52.500> then<00:02:53.500> you<00:02:53.620> can<00:02:53.739> mount

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
put it in there and then you can mount

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.130 
put it in there and then you can mount
your<00:02:54.010> GoPro<00:02:54.220> on<00:02:54.550> there<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.269> attach<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:56.110> to

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
your GoPro on there and attach it to

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.900 
your GoPro on there and attach it to
your<00:02:56.260> rail<00:02:57.570> works<00:02:58.570> pretty<00:02:58.750> good<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.730> then<00:03:00.880> I

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
your rail works pretty good and then I

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.729 
your rail works pretty good and then I
probably<00:03:01.180> they<00:03:01.540> got<00:03:01.720> some<00:03:01.840> good<00:03:01.959> video<00:03:02.380> for

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
probably they got some good video for

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.199 
probably they got some good video for
that<00:03:02.769> and<00:03:05.070> this<00:03:06.070> one<00:03:06.310> you<00:03:06.459> gonna<00:03:06.700> need<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:06.940> late

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
that and this one you gonna need a late

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.990 
that and this one you gonna need a late
for<00:03:07.630> it's<00:03:08.110> just<00:03:08.200> aluminum<00:03:08.680> I<00:03:09.220> wanted

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
for it's just aluminum I wanted

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.640 
for it's just aluminum I wanted
something<00:03:10.239> a<00:03:10.269> little<00:03:10.410> looked<00:03:11.410> a<00:03:11.530> little

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
something a little looked a little

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.009 
something a little looked a little
cooler<00:03:11.980> so<00:03:12.850> I<00:03:12.880> put<00:03:13.180> some<00:03:13.209> nice<00:03:13.480> ridges<00:03:13.870> on

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
cooler so I put some nice ridges on

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.460 
cooler so I put some nice ridges on
there<00:03:14.230> for<00:03:14.470> a<00:03:14.709> little<00:03:15.280> extra<00:03:15.459> grip<00:03:16.470> like

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
there for a little extra grip like

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.729 
there for a little extra grip like
heavier-duty<00:03:18.060> just<00:03:19.060> feels<00:03:19.299> real<00:03:19.540> nice<00:03:19.750> that's

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
heavier-duty just feels real nice that's

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.199 
heavier-duty just feels real nice that's
what<00:03:20.799> I<00:03:20.920> did<00:03:21.160> on<00:03:21.280> this<00:03:21.430> one<00:03:21.700> is<00:03:21.820> that<00:03:22.090> is

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
what I did on this one is that is

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.340 
what I did on this one is that is
counterbored<00:03:22.930> big<00:03:23.739> hole<00:03:24.930> bigger<00:03:25.930> than<00:03:26.170> the

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
counterbored big hole bigger than the

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.759 
counterbored big hole bigger than the
size<00:03:26.530> of<00:03:26.799> the<00:03:26.980> quarter-twenty<00:03:27.760> head<00:03:28.620> 1/4<00:03:29.620> 20

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
size of the quarter-twenty head 1/4 20

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:35.250 
size of the quarter-twenty head 1/4 20
bolt<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.930> then<00:03:32.650> on<00:03:33.519> this<00:03:33.850> side<00:03:33.910> you<00:03:34.480> drill

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
bolt and then on this side you drill

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.160 
bolt and then on this side you drill
your<00:03:35.830> quarter<00:03:36.340> 20<00:03:36.780> hole<00:03:37.780> for<00:03:38.080> your<00:03:38.170> quarter<00:03:38.440> 23

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
your quarter 20 hole for your quarter 23

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:46.380 
your quarter 20 hole for your quarter 23
I<00:03:39.670> believe<00:03:40.670> for<00:03:40.880> a<00:03:40.940> quarter<00:03:41.180> twenty<00:03:41.390> it<00:03:41.960> is<00:03:45.010> to

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
I believe for a quarter twenty it is to

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:53.340 
I believe for a quarter twenty it is to
201<00:03:47.390> which<00:03:48.230> is<00:03:48.440> 201<00:03:50.800> thousands<00:03:51.800> an<00:03:52.459> inch

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
201 which is 201 thousands an inch

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.520 
201 which is 201 thousands an inch
go<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.410> say<00:03:54.740> 201<00:03:55.250> in<00:03:55.340> your<00:03:55.490> drill<00:03:56.230> this<00:03:57.230> side<00:03:57.500> I

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
go to say 201 in your drill this side I

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:06.310 
go to say 201 in your drill this side I
believe<00:03:57.709> is<00:04:00.100> believe<00:04:01.100> it's<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:04.870> 315<00:04:05.870> which<00:04:05.900> is<00:04:06.290> a

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
believe is believe it's a 315 which is a

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.560 
believe is believe it's a 315 which is a
5/16<00:04:07.220> drill<00:04:07.280> I<00:04:07.959> used<00:04:08.980> so<00:04:09.980> that<00:04:10.040> pretty<00:04:10.370> much

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
5/16 drill I used so that pretty much

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.910 
5/16 drill I used so that pretty much
stick<00:04:11.570> the<00:04:11.690> bolt<00:04:11.900> down<00:04:12.290> in<00:04:12.500> there<00:04:12.620> after<00:04:12.709> you

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
stick the bolt down in there after you

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.610 
stick the bolt down in there after you
drill<00:04:13.160> of<00:04:13.280> your<00:04:13.430> counter<00:04:13.730> bore<00:04:13.940> side<00:04:14.209> and<00:04:14.620> he

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
drill of your counter bore side and he

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.319 
drill of your counter bore side and he
drilled<00:04:15.860> and<00:04:16.010> tapped<00:04:16.070> to<00:04:16.489> your<00:04:16.609> quarter<00:04:16.940> 20<00:04:17.239> on

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
drilled and tapped to your quarter 20 on

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.960 
drilled and tapped to your quarter 20 on
this<00:04:17.540> side<00:04:17.859> you<00:04:18.859> can<00:04:18.919> need<00:04:19.100> to<00:04:19.190> do<00:04:19.310> a<00:04:19.340> long<00:04:19.609> one

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
this side you can need to do a long one

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.060 
this side you can need to do a long one
or<00:04:20.209> you<00:04:20.269> can<00:04:20.329> only<00:04:21.019> have<00:04:21.230> it<00:04:21.350> about<00:04:21.560> that<00:04:21.769> far

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
or you can only have it about that far

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.280 
or you can only have it about that far
so<00:04:22.280> you<00:04:22.370> don't<00:04:22.610> have<00:04:22.700> to<00:04:22.880> tap<00:04:23.030> in<00:04:23.330> you<00:04:24.230> just

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
so you don't have to tap in you just

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.409 
so you don't have to tap in you just
take<00:04:24.500> your<00:04:24.650> bolt<00:04:24.830> through<00:04:25.010> this<00:04:25.130> side<00:04:25.400> run<00:04:26.300> it

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
take your bolt through this side run it

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.710 
take your bolt through this side run it
through<00:04:26.630> and<00:04:27.850> your<00:04:28.850> thread<00:04:29.060> should<00:04:29.300> stick<00:04:29.570> out

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
through and your thread should stick out

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.280 
through and your thread should stick out
right<00:04:30.440> there<00:04:30.680> some<00:04:31.070> amount<00:04:31.930> tripod<00:04:32.930> mount<00:04:33.200> on

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
right there some amount tripod mount on

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
right there some amount tripod mount on
there<00:04:40.570> so<00:04:41.570> I<00:04:41.600> think<00:04:41.720> once<00:04:42.680> you<00:04:42.770> paint<00:04:43.070> these

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
there so I think once you paint these

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.280 
there so I think once you paint these
and<00:04:43.370> clean<00:04:43.850> them<00:04:44.000> up<00:04:44.120> they<00:04:44.630> look<00:04:44.840> a<00:04:44.930> lot<00:04:45.080> better

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
and clean them up they look a lot better

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.110 
and clean them up they look a lot better
than<00:04:45.590> piece<00:04:46.190> of<00:04:46.370> PVC<00:04:46.550> pipe<00:04:47.210> painted<00:04:48.110> or<00:04:49.120> just

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
than piece of PVC pipe painted or just

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.460 
than piece of PVC pipe painted or just
plain<00:04:50.390> I've<00:04:50.630> seen<00:04:50.810> a<00:04:50.840> lot<00:04:50.990> of<00:04:51.020> people<00:04:51.350> doing

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470
