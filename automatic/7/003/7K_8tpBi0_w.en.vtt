00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.340
 and that is when there are so many people 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.870
 you have not heard 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.719
 what 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.760
 I had not felt anything like hearing a cow 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.760
 but it turns out that it was a dog 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.320
 you have not heard 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.960
 I'm sure you do not want to talk 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.410
 where are they going to put a farm man not 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.940
 I know but here 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.940
 go Go 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.650
 and then we go to a farm 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.360
 I do not know 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:08.299
 so we are very funny 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.880
 that makes me music and also makes 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.030
 sounds 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.869
 which contained devices 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.369
 we're just looking at how it works like this 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.549
 You cheated us almost for 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.869
 We were hoping to find everything 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.869
 this full of animals 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.250
 lowers the volume man 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.090
 and now what happens 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.090
 walking 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.600
 because I was hooked yes 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.600
 do not be scared but take care 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.929
 and a lot 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.249
 Hold on hold I think I have the 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.249
 solution 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.500
 although you did not like my machine 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.310
 what I'm going to buy me one
