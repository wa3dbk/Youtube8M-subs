00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:10.519
 in gymnosperms in pines 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.219
 the sport or phyto presents flowers 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.369
 male nude formed 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:19.279
 exclusively by the micros stamens 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:23.689
 by off and the each of which 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:25.530
 It carries two political bags ie it is 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.740
 for years 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:32.250
 on the underside or instead 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.610
 inside are the micro pores and 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.850
 cough or pollen stem cells that by 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:43.160
 half each four micro are formed 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.790
 spores or pollen grains nucleated one and 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.390
 in pines the mature pollen grain is at 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.820
 side vesicle 2 and contains four 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.840
 cells formed by myth divisions 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:00.500
 of the micro spore two cells 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.470
 prostate a cell before the ideal or 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.710
 generative and a tube cell 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:10.509
 politician in this state is released from 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.270
 the anthers and pollination occurs 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:16.270
 in angiosperms 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:20.560
 the political sacks of the anthers 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:24.399
 found in the mics by bears or 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.920
 voley stem cells every cell 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:30.159
 mother suffers a meiosis that gives 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.450
 result four daughter cells that 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:38.200
 they constitute a tetra d that is to say a 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.240
 set of four micros spores at 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.229
 beginning of meiosis 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:47.289
 the mics by bears are connected between 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:50.679
 yes by wide cytoplasmic bridges ticos 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:53.920
 that are formed by expansion of 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:56.739
 he captured naked turning all the 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.009
 mass of micro by bears of the micro is 

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:02.670
 by agio to a breast cited with fast 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.860
 transport and distribution of nutrients 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.660
 this continuity is responsible for the 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.069
 meiosis is synchronous within the 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.219
 3 per share 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.469
 I quote cinema sis this division of 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:19.780
 cytoplasm that happens after the end of 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:22.689
 meiosis according to the moment in which 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.739
 form the walls and how they are oriented 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:29.530
 the uses to chromatic the four cells 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:32.620
 resulting from meiosis that form a 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.530
 set called behind there then 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.709
 available dis may be available 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.739
 different form in the cytokines and 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.859
 successive each division is succeeded by 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:48.250
 the division of the cytoplasm occurs in 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:50.769
 monocotyledons and the micro spores that 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.500
 make arranged in the same plane the 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:57.849
 Central can be from dragon to 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:02.349
 quintals linear or in the form of 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:05.169
 tea in the cytosine sis simultaneous 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.000
 walls are formed just after finishing the 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:08.970
 meiosis 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.860
 is typical of onyia nicotine and in 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.640
 the micros hours are arranged in 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:19.830
 several theatrical planes can be 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:22.380
 tetrahedron tetrahedra or crusades with 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.230
 the pollen big ones resulting 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.500
 establishes a polar axis with the pole 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:32.420
 proximal to the center of late trade and 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.420
 the distal pole towards the periphery 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.840
 the mat is the fabric in charge of the 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.510
 nutrition of the micros and now the 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.570
 formation of the corner part and the 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.000
 synthesis and release of substances that 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:49.150
 they will form the fine tri and the cement 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.050
 politician your cells have plasma success 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:57.400
 very tense are typically 2 or 4 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:59.230
 nucleated or with a polyploid nucleus 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.170
 two kinds of mats according to their 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.740
 running the secret mat or 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:08.640
 softness and the carpet invader or love 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.640
