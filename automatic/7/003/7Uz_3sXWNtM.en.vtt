 Our sound is the sound 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:21.070
 I came to Holothly where 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:24.789
 4 What's different from what? 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:32.349
 I was worried about it. 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:37.899

 Now what else Erg 4 cup akgisa 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.579
 True technology 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:48.740
 You can just sing 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.559
 Yejun can find three who have proven Rock 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.949

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.510
 A great sword 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:25.760
 What the hell is that? 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:29.440
 That day it was itchy, and I brought the knife from it and saw it too. 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.440
 There is a grid. 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:37.530
 I saw your face, such as for example an attacker to leave them a reality after two people fighting 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.610
 He said he saw a face. 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:47.210
 The appearance that he's torn on personal face 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.210

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:02.690
 I made consonants. 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:06.230
 A person makes a sound because it has a pronoun , so I made it short. 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:10.580
 The language is spring prosecuted 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:14.620
