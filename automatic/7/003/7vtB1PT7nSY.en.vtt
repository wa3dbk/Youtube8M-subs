00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.830 
outline in the description here I'm just
making<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.000> thinner<00:00:45.149> because<00:00:45.300> I've<00:00:45.510> got<00:00:45.629> way

making it thinner because I've got way

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.910 
making it thinner because I've got way
too<00:00:45.870> much<00:00:46.110> board<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.469> deal<00:00:46.649> with<00:00:46.770> at<00:00:46.890> the

too much board to deal with at the
moment

drilling<00:00:47.700> holes<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.300> pendant<00:00:48.660> should<00:00:48.780> be

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
drilling holes in the pendant should be

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.389 
drilling holes in the pendant should be
done<00:00:49.050> now<00:00:49.260> even<00:00:49.800> though<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.920> holes<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.309> the

done now even though the holes in the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.069 
done now even though the holes in the
pendant<00:00:50.730> are<00:00:50.879> trend<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.570> can<00:00:51.600> match<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
pendant are trend you can match the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.200 
pendant are trend you can match the
drill<00:00:52.440> sizes<00:00:52.680> up<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.250> radius<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.760> part<00:00:54.030> of

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
the holes once those are in remove any

the holes once those are in remove any
extra<00:00:56.640> material<00:00:56.850> with<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.239> coping<00:00:57.539> saw<00:00:57.660> because

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
extra material with a coping saw because

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.810 
extra material with a coping saw because
the<00:00:58.410> Dremel<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:58.890> much<00:00:59.039> faster<00:00:59.250> than<00:00:59.489> doing

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
the Dremel is so much faster than doing

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.549 
the Dremel is so much faster than doing
anything<00:01:00.059> by<00:01:00.300> hand<00:01:00.539> I'll<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:00.930> using<00:01:01.109> as<00:01:01.410> much

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
anything by hand I'll be using as much

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.560 
anything by hand I'll be using as much
as<00:01:01.710> possible<00:01:01.890> below<00:01:02.670> certain<00:01:02.969> spots<00:01:03.329> where

the general can't reach and that's where

what I mean well the other edges that

what I mean well the other edges that
can<00:01:44.250> be<00:01:44.340> reached<00:01:44.580> easily<00:01:44.880> should<00:01:45.360> be<00:01:45.480> rounded

and oil it so start with around 120 grit
and<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.080> move<00:01:52.200> up<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.530> grits<00:01:52.710> removing<00:01:53.130> the

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
and and move up the grits removing the

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.650 
and and move up the grits removing the
scratches<00:01:53.550> from<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.850> last<00:01:54.030> grit<00:01:54.270> each<00:01:54.420> time

scratches from the last grit each time

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.780 
scratches from the last grit each time
you<00:01:54.810> move<00:01:54.930> up<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.410> you<00:01:55.680> should<00:01:55.830> go<00:01:55.980> to<00:01:56.550> at

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
you move up and you should go to at

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.390 
you move up and you should go to at
least<00:01:56.940> 400<00:01:57.540> grit<00:01:57.690> and<00:01:57.930> then<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.250> need<00:01:59.340> to

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
least 400 grit and then you just need to

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.820 
least 400 grit and then you just need to

put oil on I'm using a linseed slash
Terps<00:02:02.400> mix<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.750> now<00:02:03.870> you<00:02:03.930> might<00:02:04.140> just<00:02:04.350> want<00:02:04.500> to

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
Terps mix and now you might just want to

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.140 
Terps mix and now you might just want to
put<00:02:04.650> some<00:02:04.680> leather<00:02:04.980> thong<00:02:05.250> one<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.730> make<00:02:06.000> it

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
put some leather thong one to make it

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.850 
put some leather thong one to make it
into<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.420> necklace<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:07.020> going<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.560> want<00:02:07.770> to

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
into a necklace just going to want to

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.570 
into a necklace just going to want to
match<00:02:08.280> up<00:02:09.230> two<00:02:10.230> ends<00:02:10.850> pull<00:02:11.850> it<00:02:12.000> out<00:02:12.180> do<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.230> get

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
match up two ends pull it out do you get

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.720 
match up two ends pull it out do you get
the<00:02:14.580> middle<00:02:14.880> here<00:02:16.520> then<00:02:17.540> I'm<00:02:18.540> going<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.810> thread

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
the middle here then I'm going to thread

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.110 
the middle here then I'm going to thread
this<00:02:20.730> through<00:02:21.150> here<00:02:22.670> once<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:23.820> pull<00:02:24.030> it

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
this through here once you pull it

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:32.350 
this through here once you pull it
through<00:02:26.120> you<00:02:27.120> um<00:02:27.800> then<00:02:29.240> pull<00:02:30.240> this<00:02:30.600> through

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
through you um then pull this through

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:40.130 
through you um then pull this through
then<00:02:35.270> you<00:02:36.270> let<00:02:36.540> this<00:02:38.330> these<00:02:39.330> end<00:02:39.690> back<00:02:40.110> through

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
then you let this these end back through

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:56.960 
then you let this these end back through
again

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.410 

so<00:02:57.570> if<00:02:57.750> this<00:02:57.900> makes<00:02:58.170> sense<00:02:58.320> that<00:02:59.240> you've<00:03:00.240> got

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
so if this makes sense that you've got

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.180 
so if this makes sense that you've got
your<00:03:00.600> first<00:03:00.900> layer<00:03:01.440> coming<00:03:01.740> through<00:03:01.980> here

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
your first layer coming through here

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.060 
your first layer coming through here
then<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.490> comes<00:03:02.700> through<00:03:02.850> again<00:03:06.920> so<00:03:07.920> you've

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
then it comes through again so you've

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.250 
then it comes through again so you've
just<00:03:08.100> got<00:03:08.430> that<00:03:08.640> twice<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.270> then<00:03:09.630> these<00:03:09.930> feet

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
just got that twice and then these feet

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:18.729 
just got that twice and then these feet
through<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.530> hoop

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.470 

you<00:03:19.280> don't<00:03:19.430> have<00:03:19.579> to<00:03:19.700> do<00:03:19.819> a<00:03:19.849> double<00:03:20.000> but<00:03:20.360> some

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
you don't have to do a double but some

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.819 
you don't have to do a double but some
reason<00:03:20.720> when<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:20.930> only<00:03:21.079> do<00:03:21.230> a<00:03:21.260> single<00:03:21.500> the

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
reason when you only do a single the

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.850 
reason when you only do a single the
pendant<00:03:22.189> tries<00:03:22.370> to<00:03:22.519> twist<00:03:22.670> sideways<00:03:23.500> now<00:03:24.500> next

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
pendant tries to twist sideways now next

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.589 
pendant tries to twist sideways now next
thing<00:03:24.980> you<00:03:25.129> want<00:03:25.280> to<00:03:25.310> do<00:03:25.959> get<00:03:26.959> two<00:03:27.230> ends<00:03:28.599> take

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
thing you want to do get two ends take

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.309 
thing you want to do get two ends take
one<00:03:29.870> here<00:03:30.230> and<00:03:31.299> you<00:03:32.299> put<00:03:32.540> it<00:03:32.659> around<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:33.200> other
