the<00:00:57.199> sixth<00:00:57.559> string<00:00:57.829> this<00:00:58.039> is<00:00:58.100> going<00:00:58.340> to<00:00:58.399> be

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
the sixth string this is going to be

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.689 
the sixth string this is going to be
your<00:00:58.640> first<00:00:58.850> grip<00:00:59.980> and<00:01:00.980> pick<00:01:01.190> those<00:01:01.370> at<00:01:01.579> the

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
your first grip and pick those at the

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.330 
your first grip and pick those at the
same<00:01:01.940> time<00:01:04.630> so<00:01:05.630> that<00:01:05.660> also<00:01:06.410> is<00:01:06.590> a<00:01:06.619> major<00:01:06.920> chord

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
same time so that also is a major chord

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.850 
same time so that also is a major chord
so<00:01:07.429> in<00:01:07.640> this<00:01:07.789> case<00:01:08.060> because<00:01:08.590> this<00:01:09.590> thing<00:01:09.830> is

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
so in this case because this thing is

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.480 
so in this case because this thing is
tuned<00:01:10.190> to<00:01:10.250> e<00:01:10.340> ninth<00:01:10.759> chromatic<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:12.830> 10th<00:01:13.160> the

tuned to e ninth chromatic the 10th the
eighth<00:01:14.179> and<00:01:14.929> six<00:01:15.520> that's<00:01:16.520> an<00:01:16.789> E<00:01:17.000> major<00:01:17.179> chord

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
eighth and six that's an E major chord

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.980 
eighth and six that's an E major chord
so<00:01:19.149> that's<00:01:20.149> going<00:01:20.270> to<00:01:20.330> be<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:20.509> first<00:01:20.690> grip

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
so that's going to be the first grip

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.650 
so that's going to be the first grip
you're<00:01:21.140> going<00:01:21.259> to<00:01:21.319> want<00:01:21.500> to<00:01:21.530> work<00:01:21.709> on<00:01:25.599> now<00:01:26.599> the

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
you're going to want to work on now the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.070 
you're going to want to work on now the
next<00:01:26.899> grip<00:01:27.170> is<00:01:27.289> going<00:01:27.410> to<00:01:27.470> be<00:01:27.800> the<00:01:28.340> a<00:01:28.369> string

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
next grip is going to be the a string

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:36.590 
next grip is going to be the a string
the<00:01:30.080> sixth<00:01:30.530> string<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:31.069> the<00:01:31.580> fifth<00:01:31.819> string

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.090

so a string with your thumb

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.180 
so a string with your thumb
six<00:01:40.550> string<00:01:40.790> with<00:01:40.910> your<00:01:40.970> index<00:01:41.800> this<00:01:42.800> string

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
six string with your index this string

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.690 
six string with your index this string
with<00:01:43.550> your<00:01:43.580> middle<00:01:43.700> finger<00:01:43.910> and<00:01:48.550> again<00:01:49.550> that's

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
also an E major chord so same chord it's

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.260 
also an E major chord so same chord it's
a<00:01:52.100> different<00:01:52.400> inversion<00:01:54.940> so<00:01:55.940> you<00:01:56.000> get<00:01:56.090> ten

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
a different inversion so you get ten

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:03.210 
a different inversion so you get ten
eight<00:01:56.420> six<00:01:56.450> eight<00:01:59.200> six<00:02:00.200> five

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.580 

your<00:02:04.220> next<00:02:04.490> strip<00:02:04.670> is<00:02:04.790> going<00:02:04.940> to<00:02:05.000> be<00:02:05.090> six<00:02:05.590> five

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
your next strip is going to be six five

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.249 
your next strip is going to be six five
and<00:02:07.070> four

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.770 

six<00:02:11.190> with<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.490> thumb<00:02:12.020> five<00:02:13.020> with<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.260> index

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
six with the thumb five with the index

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:25.570 
six with the thumb five with the index
for<00:02:15.260> with<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.500> metal

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.320 

and<00:02:26.950> then<00:02:27.950> finally<00:02:28.370> your<00:02:28.670> next<00:02:28.910> trip<00:02:29.060> will<00:02:29.210> be

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.300 
five with the thumb
for<00:02:39.319> Matty<00:02:39.620> index

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
for Matty index

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.880 
for Matty index
and<00:02:41.790> three<00:02:42.060> with<00:02:42.210> the<00:02:42.300> middle

and three with the middle

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.950 
and three with the middle
again<00:02:44.550> that's<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.880> deep<00:02:45.120> that's<00:02:45.360> an<00:02:45.480> E<00:02:45.720> major

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
again that's a deep that's an E major

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.250 
again that's a deep that's an E major
chord<00:02:46.170> with<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:46.800> being<00:02:47.040> open<00:02:47.960> these<00:02:48.960> are<00:02:49.140> all

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
chord with it being open these are all

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.010 
chord with it being open these are all
different<00:02:49.470> inversions<00:02:50.240> so<00:02:51.240> ten<00:02:51.510> eight<00:02:51.690> six

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
different inversions so ten eight six
