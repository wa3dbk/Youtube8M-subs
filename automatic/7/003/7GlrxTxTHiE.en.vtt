okay<00:00:01.560> we've<00:00:01.949> got<00:00:02.159> a<00:00:02.190> US<00:00:03.090> automatic<00:00:03.750> Patriot

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
okay we've got a US automatic Patriot

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.369 
okay we've got a US automatic Patriot
one<00:00:04.710> solar<00:00:05.580> application<00:00:06.480> gate<00:00:06.660> operator<00:00:07.080> here

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
one solar application gate operator here

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.299 
one solar application gate operator here
on<00:00:08.160> dist<00:00:08.490> your<00:00:08.670> standard<00:00:09.800> 14<00:00:10.800> foot

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:19.160 

residential<00:00:14.309> ranch<00:00:14.580> gate<00:00:16.940> okay<00:00:18.020> flip<00:00:19.020> this

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
residential ranch gate okay flip this

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.920 
residential ranch gate okay flip this
over

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
over

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.720 
over
so<00:00:22.930> in<00:00:23.930> here<00:00:24.380> we<00:00:24.439> just<00:00:24.590> have<00:00:24.949> a<00:00:24.980> regular<00:00:25.189> Napa

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
so in here we just have a regular Napa

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.600 
so in here we just have a regular Napa
it's<00:00:26.270> not<00:00:26.539> a<00:00:26.570> it's<00:00:27.170> not<00:00:27.259> a<00:00:27.410> gel<00:00:27.860> cell<00:00:28.160> battery<00:00:28.520> I

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:28.610 
it's not a it's not a gel cell battery I

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.370 
it's not a it's not a gel cell battery I
do<00:00:28.759> recommend<00:00:29.180> using<00:00:29.630> the<00:00:29.900> gel<00:00:30.110> cell

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
do recommend using the gel cell

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.090 
do recommend using the gel cell
batteries<00:00:31.480> whenever<00:00:32.480> you<00:00:32.720> can<00:00:32.930> I<00:00:33.200> know<00:00:33.530> money

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
batteries whenever you can I know money

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.990 
batteries whenever you can I know money
sometimes<00:00:34.760> is<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:35.180> main<00:00:35.420> reason<00:00:36.699> gel<00:00:37.699> cells

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
sometimes is the main reason gel cells

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.049 
sometimes is the main reason gel cells
are<00:00:38.210> typically<00:00:38.570> about<00:00:38.809> $100<00:00:39.350> more<00:00:39.850> this<00:00:40.850> is

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
are typically about $100 more this is

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.320 
are typically about $100 more this is
the<00:00:41.180> u.s.<00:00:41.390> automatic<00:00:41.960> circuit<00:00:42.350> board<00:00:42.589> as<00:00:43.339> you

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
the u.s. automatic circuit board as you

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.700 
the u.s. automatic circuit board as you
can<00:00:44.449> see<00:00:44.660> it's<00:00:44.780> a<00:00:44.870> distinct<00:00:45.350> difference

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
can see it's a distinct difference

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.860 
can see it's a distinct difference
between<00:00:45.769> the<00:00:46.100> Apollo<00:00:46.400> board<00:00:46.730> you're<00:00:47.600> actually

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
between the Apollo board you're actually

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.280 
between the Apollo board you're actually
going<00:00:47.989> to<00:00:48.080> have<00:00:48.230> a<00:00:48.580> master<00:00:49.580> and<00:00:49.879> a<00:00:50.180> slave<00:00:50.360> port

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
to hook your motor up to so if something

to hook your motor up to so if something
goes<00:00:53.750> wrong<00:00:53.809> with<00:00:54.170> this<00:00:54.320> one

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
goes wrong with this one

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:56.859 
goes wrong with this one
you<00:00:55.220> always<00:00:55.460> have<00:00:55.610> this<00:00:55.760> one<00:00:56.000> to<00:00:56.119> rely<00:00:56.420> on<00:00:56.449> for

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:56.869 
you always have this one to rely on for

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:00.939 
you always have this one to rely on for

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
you to put a photo I on the US automatic

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.740 
you to put a photo I on the US automatic
unit<00:01:23.229> okay<00:01:24.229> we<00:01:24.380> got<00:01:24.500> an<00:01:24.619> LED<00:01:25.330> push<00:01:26.330> button<00:01:26.660> on

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
unit okay we got an LED push button on

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.590 
unit okay we got an LED push button on
this<00:01:26.990> which<00:01:27.470> pollow<00:01:28.190> it<00:01:28.490> took<00:01:28.640> them<00:01:28.820> a<00:01:28.850> long

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
this which pollow it took them a long

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.000 
this which pollow it took them a long
while<00:01:29.870> to<00:01:30.080> come<00:01:30.200> out<00:01:30.320> with<00:01:30.470> it<00:01:30.590> right<00:01:30.770> now<00:01:30.950> you

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
while to come out with it right now you

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.300 
while to come out with it right now you
can<00:01:31.160> see<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.430> red<00:01:31.610> light<00:01:31.820> is<00:01:32.090> on<00:01:32.920> extend<00:01:33.920> limit

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
can see the red light is on extend limit

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.310 
can see the red light is on extend limit
which<00:01:34.520> means<00:01:34.760> it's<00:01:34.940> fully<00:01:35.180> closed<00:01:35.570> there<00:01:36.290> was

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
which means it's fully closed there was

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.230 
which means it's fully closed there was
a<00:01:36.440> problem<00:01:36.740> with<00:01:37.010> the<00:01:37.130> gate<00:01:37.340> you<00:01:37.970> would<00:01:38.090> see

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
a problem with the gate you would see

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.790 
a problem with the gate you would see
one<00:01:38.390> of<00:01:38.480> these<00:01:38.570> lights<00:01:38.930> light<00:01:39.290> up<00:01:39.320> on<00:01:39.650> this

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
one of these lights light up on this

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.000 
one of these lights light up on this
side<00:01:40.010> over<00:01:40.190> here<00:01:40.900> okay<00:01:41.900> on<00:01:42.140> this<00:01:42.500> one<00:01:42.740> we<00:01:42.860> do
