reminds me a lot of Flying Lotus and in
the<00:05:34.889> middle<00:05:35.159> of<00:05:35.250> this<00:05:35.430> whole<00:05:35.699> album<00:05:36.000> there's

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:36.509 
the middle of this whole album there's

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:39.800 
the middle of this whole album there's
this<00:05:36.659> one<00:05:36.960> track<00:05:37.349> that<00:05:37.969> it's<00:05:38.969> it's<00:05:39.330> titled

sweat<00:05:40.349> and<00:05:40.590> I'm<00:05:40.949> surprised<00:05:41.340> it<00:05:41.520> wasn't<00:05:41.789> a

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:41.819 
sweat and I'm surprised it wasn't a

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:43.909

single<00:05:42.090> for<00:05:42.419> this<00:05:42.539> LP<00:05:42.900> because<00:05:43.229> I<00:05:43.259> think<00:05:43.440> it's

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
single for this LP because I think it's

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.490 
single for this LP because I think it's
the<00:05:44.159> most<00:05:44.310> accessible<00:05:44.789> thing<00:05:45.389> on<00:05:45.690> here<00:05:46.199> the

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
the most accessible thing on here the

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.700 
the most accessible thing on here the
track<00:05:46.770> samples<00:05:47.339> these<00:05:47.550> horn<00:05:48.449> and<00:05:48.870> drum<00:05:49.259> brakes

track samples these horn and drum brakes

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.159 
track samples these horn and drum brakes
that<00:05:49.949> sound<00:05:50.219> like<00:05:50.339> they<00:05:50.550> were<00:05:50.580> recorded<00:05:51.330> about

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
that sound like they were recorded about

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.790 
that sound like they were recorded about
20<00:05:52.710> years<00:05:53.009> ago<00:05:53.219> or<00:05:53.639> so<00:05:54.089> and<00:05:54.569> the<00:05:54.810> waste<00:05:55.020> ashes

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
20 years ago or so and the waste ashes

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.850 
20 years ago or so and the waste ashes
and<00:05:56.360> Catherine's<00:05:57.360> vocals<00:05:57.960> lace<00:05:58.259> up<00:05:58.529> on<00:05:58.710> the

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
and Catherine's vocals lace up on the

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.800 
and Catherine's vocals lace up on the
hook<00:05:59.009> of<00:05:59.129> this<00:05:59.279> track<00:05:59.550> it<00:06:00.060> just<00:06:00.330> kind<00:06:00.539> of<00:06:00.569> feels

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
hook of this track it just kind of feels

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.670 
hook of this track it just kind of feels
like<00:06:01.080> a<00:06:01.440> sweet<00:06:02.279> R&amp;B<00:06:03.029> jam<00:06:03.449> from<00:06:03.750> the<00:06:03.900> 90s

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
like a sweet R&amp;B jam from the 90s

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.499 
like a sweet R&amp;B jam from the 90s

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:06.509 
these satisfaction still kind of makes

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:09.019 
these satisfaction still kind of makes
it<00:06:06.719> their<00:06:07.259> own<00:06:07.289> even<00:06:07.800> though<00:06:07.860> it<00:06:08.039> is<00:06:08.279> the

it their own even though it is the
Poppaea<00:06:09.539> sting<00:06:09.900> I<00:06:10.199> think<00:06:10.469> this<00:06:10.620> album<00:06:10.800> has<00:06:11.159> to

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:11.339 
Poppaea sting I think this album has to

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:14.089 
Poppaea sting I think this album has to
offer<00:06:11.550> they<00:06:12.360> still<00:06:12.659> take<00:06:12.930> it<00:06:12.960> out<00:06:13.589> of<00:06:13.919> there

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:14.099 
offer they still take it out of there

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:16.399 
offer they still take it out of there
they<00:06:14.520> still<00:06:14.759> put<00:06:14.969> a<00:06:15.000> really<00:06:15.300> eccentric<00:06:15.810> spin

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:16.409 
they still put a really eccentric spin

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:18.709 
they still put a really eccentric spin
on<00:06:16.560> it<00:06:16.770> toward<00:06:17.069> the<00:06:17.159> end<00:06:17.250> of<00:06:17.460> this<00:06:17.550> LP<00:06:17.969> v<00:06:18.210> album
