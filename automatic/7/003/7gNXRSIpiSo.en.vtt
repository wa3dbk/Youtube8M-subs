case<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.900> first<00:03:33.140> place<00:03:33.440> I<00:03:33.590> think<00:03:33.830> that's<00:03:33.980> just

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
case the first place I think that's just

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.009 
case the first place I think that's just
a<00:03:34.310> standard<00:03:34.670> thresh<00:03:34.970> lantern<00:03:35.450> back<00:03:35.660> into<00:03:35.989> a

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
a standard thresh lantern back into a

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.720 
a standard thresh lantern back into a
flash<00:03:36.350> fly<00:03:36.650> there's<00:03:36.890> almost<00:03:37.040> nothing<00:03:37.430> that

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
flash fly there's almost nothing that

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.860 
flash fly there's almost nothing that
you<00:03:37.790> can<00:03:37.940> do<00:03:38.090> in<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.269> situation<00:03:38.450> you<00:03:38.810> just

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
you can do in the situation you just

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.210 
you can do in the situation you just
have<00:03:39.080> to<00:03:39.170> respect<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.620> fact<00:03:39.830> that<00:03:39.920> you<00:03:40.010> could

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
have to respect the fact that you could

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.890 
have to respect the fact that you could
have<00:03:40.310> gotten<00:03:40.459> flash<00:03:40.760> played<00:03:41.060> cuz<00:03:41.510> here<00:03:41.720> it's
