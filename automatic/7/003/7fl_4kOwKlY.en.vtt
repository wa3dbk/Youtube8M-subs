I'll start the review off with this
brush<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.820> an<00:00:35.970> angled<00:00:36.450> foundation<00:00:37.170> brush

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
brush this is an angled foundation brush

brush this is an angled foundation brush
and<00:00:38.720> in<00:00:39.720> my<00:00:39.900> opinion<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.560> is<00:00:40.620> too<00:00:41.130> small<00:00:41.490> to

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
and in my opinion this is too small to

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.390 
and in my opinion this is too small to
be<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> foundation<00:00:42.420> brush<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.620> dense<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.220> it

be a foundation brush it is dense and it

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
why I got this honestly be just to see

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.809 
why I got this honestly be just to see
what<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.420> does<00:02:03.690> but<00:02:04.050> there<00:02:04.380> just<00:02:04.410> is<00:02:05.399> such<00:02:05.789> a

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
what it does but there just is such a

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:08.150 
what it does but there just is such a
thin<00:02:06.360> layer<00:02:06.660> of<00:02:06.720> bristles<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.530> really<00:02:07.890> does

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
thin layer of bristles it really does

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.010 
thin layer of bristles it really does
anything<00:02:08.460> it<00:02:08.789> doesn't<00:02:09.000> even<00:02:09.300> really<00:02:09.600> brush

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
anything it doesn't even really brush

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.820 
anything it doesn't even really brush
off<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:11.270> fallout<00:02:12.270> from<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.780> shadow<00:02:13.140> or<00:02:13.470> glitter

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
off the fallout from a shadow or glitter

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.460 
off the fallout from a shadow or glitter
event<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.150> just<00:02:15.420> complete<00:02:16.080> waste<00:02:16.290> of

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
event so this is just complete waste of

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.500 
event so this is just complete waste of
money<00:02:16.680> i<00:02:16.860> would<00:02:17.190> not<00:02:17.490> recommend<00:02:17.760> getting<00:02:18.180> it

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
money i would not recommend getting it

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.500 
money i would not recommend getting it
but<00:02:19.260> if<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.470> do<00:02:19.800> want<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:20.280> cheap<00:02:20.580> fan<00:02:20.970> brush<00:02:21.300> i

but if you do want a cheap fan brush i

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.270 
but if you do want a cheap fan brush i
suppose<00:02:21.959> you<00:02:21.990> could<00:02:22.200> just<00:02:22.440> get<00:02:22.740> it<00:02:22.890> but<00:02:23.130> I

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
suppose you could just get it but I

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.650 
suppose you could just get it but I
don't<00:02:23.370> know<00:02:23.580> what<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:23.910> would<00:02:24.060> use<00:02:24.209> it<00:02:24.390> for

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
don't know what you would use it for

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.430 
don't know what you would use it for
because<00:02:25.560> it's<00:02:25.920> just<00:02:26.069> so<00:02:26.340> flimsy<00:02:27.140> can't<00:02:28.140> really

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
because it's just so flimsy can't really

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.699 
because it's just so flimsy can't really
brushed<00:02:28.709> anything<00:02:29.130> off<00:02:29.340> or<00:02:29.700> even<00:02:29.940> on<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.709> tried

I and it goes on clear like chapstick
and<00:03:53.010> it<00:03:53.400> burned<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:54.299> burn<00:03:54.750> like<00:03:55.049> hell<00:03:55.100> usually<00:03:56.100> I

and it burned a burn like hell usually I
like<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:57.230> feeling<00:03:58.230> of<00:03:58.560> lip<00:03:58.980> plumpers<00:03:59.400> but

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.600 
like the feeling of lip plumpers but
this<00:04:00.120> burns<00:04:00.510> so<00:04:00.840> much<00:04:00.900> like<00:04:01.500> I<00:04:01.799> had<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:02.310> rub<00:04:02.459> it

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
this burns so much like I had to rub it

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.350 
this burns so much like I had to rub it
off<00:04:02.760> it<00:04:03.060> was<00:04:03.239> just<00:04:03.890> unbearable<00:04:04.890> to<00:04:05.340> me<00:04:05.370> so<00:04:06.269> if

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
off it was just unbearable to me so if

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.870 
off it was just unbearable to me so if
you<00:04:06.390> have<00:04:06.540> some<00:04:06.750> sort<00:04:06.930> of<00:04:06.989> lips<00:04:07.459> not<00:04:08.459> one<00:04:08.700> for

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
you have some sort of lips not one for

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.430 
you have some sort of lips not one for
you<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.090> wouldn't<00:04:09.510> even<00:04:09.600> recommend<00:04:09.989> it<00:04:10.260> for

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
you I wouldn't even recommend it for

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.580 
you I wouldn't even recommend it for
regular<00:04:10.829> lips<00:04:11.100> and<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.970> other<00:04:12.120> side<00:04:12.450> is<00:04:12.720> for

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
regular lips and the other side is for

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.410 
regular lips and the other side is for
priming<00:04:14.070> it's<00:04:14.700> supposed<00:04:14.850> to<00:04:15.120> make<00:04:15.269> your

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
priming it's supposed to make your

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.330 
priming it's supposed to make your
lipstick<00:04:15.780> last<00:04:15.959> longer<00:04:16.169> or<00:04:16.769> lip<00:04:17.100> gloss

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
lipstick last longer or lip gloss

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.210 
lipstick last longer or lip gloss
whatever<00:04:17.609> but<00:04:18.570> I<00:04:18.630> feel<00:04:18.780> like<00:04:18.870> it's<00:04:19.049> too<00:04:19.320> big<00:04:19.739> to

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
whatever but I feel like it's too big to

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.690 
whatever but I feel like it's too big to
be<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.370> primer<00:04:21.049> because<00:04:22.049> it<00:04:22.770> ruins<00:04:23.100> the<00:04:23.430> color

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
be a primer because it ruins the color

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.450 
be a primer because it ruins the color
and<00:04:24.060> it<00:04:24.600> goes<00:04:24.840> on<00:04:24.990> really<00:04:25.050> cakey<00:04:25.740> and<00:04:25.950> yellow

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
and it goes on really cakey and yellow

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.780
