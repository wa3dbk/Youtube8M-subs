00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.300
 Hi all 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.890
 I imagine that until closing the same as 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.350
 to me 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.039
 the fridge filled 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.510
 good appetite and as messi as messi 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:43.879
 like more and when they all count 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.690
 well he has gained a lot of weight not 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.350
 we have to lose 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.780
 today we are going to start experimenting with 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.609
 this new diet of the diet of the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.969
 proteins, calorie forgiveness 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:55.969
 negative 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.070
 that is to say 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:07.650
 there are calories that if you take them 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.900
 fatten you for example 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.600
 if you eat a chorizo, obviously you 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.390
 will get fat but there are other calories 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.700
 that are negative 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.590
 are contained for example in these 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:24.560
 food the tomato the pepper the 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.460
 onion celery 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.460
 the cauliflower 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.600
 they have negative proteins 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.830
 and you can say that the more you eat of 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.690
 the more you're going to lose weight in this is going to 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.180
 base our new diet 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.390
 I tell you how it's done but it's very, very 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.900
 simple the important thing are only 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.900
 seven days 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.180
 and they say 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.840
 and check if it is true lies 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.550
 that are lost in those four days and 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.640
 half to seven kilos 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.150
 then we will see to see if it is true 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.150
 important to not 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.300
 to know this is so insipid because 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.990
 you can not put oil obviously 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:16.890
 if you can put chicken broth bite 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.470
 vegetable and this soup we will eat everything 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.600
 what we want 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.110
 then evidently throughout the day 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:28.090
 other foods are introduced 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.090
 I'm going to wash these vegetables well 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:36.020
 and cook them in about 78 liters of water 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:39.910
 to have for quite a few days 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.910
 already saying how I'm doing it 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:59.140
 I have calculated between 8 and 10 liters of 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.930
 Water 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.990
 and there I put the washed onions 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:09.340
 put 6 onions now I go with the 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:12.720
 peppers I go first to wash it 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.720
 and three peppers 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.640
 there is also the peppers and the 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.120
 celery twig and now I'm going for the 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.120
 condition 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.240
 die a cabbage the days 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.240
 the cabbage 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.250
 Well now we have three options 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.030
 or put 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:04.069
 5 tomatoes 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.050
 ice cream or replace them 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.440
 for 2 kilos 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:13.140
 the crushed natural tomato 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:16.570
 I will be for the second 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.070
 alternative then I'll let me 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.990
 reduce 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.870
 all this amount of vegetables that I have 

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:26.820
 here and when I reduce it goes a little bit 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:29.760
 I'll put pepper salt 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:33.680
 and for the sake of taste 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.680
 a pill of chicken broth 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.120
 and another of vegetable broth 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.370
 that is, there is nothing left to do but wait 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.090
 recovering full but despite 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.090
 all 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.240
 yes 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.670
 ah 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:06.830
 well even though he does not know anything here we have 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:11.129
 one of the presentation options 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:14.509
 what is a soup with the bits 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:14.509
 that here you can appreciate 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:21.800
 the leek the onion 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:24.080
 here is everything and the second presentation 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.830
 what am I going to do right now that is 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:31.600
 with a cream so I'm going to crush it 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.600
 remember one 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.560
 and 2 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.870
 it's up to you 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:05.010
 you know that this cream soup like that 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.990
 the flames is used as a wild card and that 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:11.210
 as long as you have and andrey and full 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.210
