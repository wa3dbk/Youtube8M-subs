 difficult for the second time in this game

 lieutenant to her there many say how i 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:45.650
 thought and now the old man died already 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:49.309
 but the age is generally very high 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.010
 Of course tennis players for 30 but the same

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:51.039

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.600
 gentleman's tennis he only hits 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.340

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:03.270
 and once with feeling for dignity without 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.270
 any noise 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.750
 super in super style underlines the idea 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:26.950

 Well, the ferrer on the back line does not offer 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.560
 absolutely nothing rishara gasquet complex 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.070
