so<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.200> can<00:02:33.350> drive<00:02:33.530> both<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:34.450> flat<00:02:35.450> panel

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
so you can drive both a flat panel

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.930 
so you can drive both a flat panel
display<00:02:35.990> as<00:02:36.230> well<00:02:36.260> as<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.980> front<00:02:37.340> projector<00:02:37.760> or

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
other one handles nothing but video so

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.110 
other one handles nothing but video so
you<00:02:42.860> can<00:02:42.950> run<00:02:43.160> both<00:02:43.370> outputs<00:02:43.760> at<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:43.940> same

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
you can run both outputs at the same

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.750 
you can run both outputs at the same
time<00:02:44.390> I<00:02:45.260> mean<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:45.980> drive<00:02:46.220> itself<00:02:46.520> we<00:02:46.730> actually

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
time I mean the drive itself we actually

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.730 
time I mean the drive itself we actually
use<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.150> blu-ray<00:02:47.450> recorder<00:02:47.900> drive<00:02:48.170> rather<00:02:48.530> than

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
use a blu-ray recorder drive rather than

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.830 
use a blu-ray recorder drive rather than
a<00:02:48.770> traditional<00:02:48.980> player<00:02:49.720> since<00:02:50.720> the

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
a traditional player since the

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.540 
a traditional player since the
tolerances<00:02:51.260> are<00:02:51.440> stricter<00:02:51.770> and<00:02:52.010> performance

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
tolerances are stricter and performance

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.530 
tolerances are stricter and performance
is<00:02:52.640> better<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:53.480> know<00:02:53.570> composite<00:02:54.170> tray<00:02:55.540> tout

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
is better you know composite tray tout

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.390 
is better you know composite tray tout
feet<00:02:56.960> I<00:02:57.200> mean<00:02:57.320> it<00:02:57.560> literally<00:02:57.860> it<00:02:58.070> pretty<00:02:58.280> much

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
feet I mean it literally it pretty much

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.620 
feet I mean it literally it pretty much
has<00:02:58.460> everything<00:02:58.730> somebody<00:02:59.300> wanted<00:02:59.570> a

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
has everything somebody wanted a

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.760 
has everything somebody wanted a
high-end<00:02:59.990> piece<00:03:00.170> that<00:03:00.410> you<00:03:00.500> would<00:03:00.620> find

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
high-end piece that you would find

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.320 
high-end piece that you would find
normally<00:03:01.130> associated<00:03:01.490> with<00:03:01.550> a<00:03:01.640> very<00:03:01.940> high-end

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
normally associated with a very high-end

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.450 
normally associated with a very high-end
CD<00:03:02.570> player<00:03:02.840> or<00:03:03.290> a<00:03:03.320> very<00:03:03.650> high-end<00:03:04.010> DVD<00:03:04.280> player

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
CD player or a very high-end DVD player

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.830 
CD player or a very high-end DVD player
or<00:03:04.610> a<00:03:04.640> high-end<00:03:04.880> be<00:03:05.060> dealer<00:03:05.300> but<00:03:05.510> all<00:03:05.600> wrapped

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
or a high-end be dealer but all wrapped

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.930 
or a high-end be dealer but all wrapped
into<00:03:05.990> one<00:03:06.080> so<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.590> idea<00:03:06.860> is<00:03:06.950> is<00:03:07.250> you<00:03:07.550> get<00:03:07.730> this

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
into one so the idea is is you get this

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.460 
into one so the idea is is you get this
you<00:03:08.420> know<00:03:08.570> for<00:03:08.750> your<00:03:08.840> audio<00:03:09.080> file<00:03:09.290> your

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
you know for your audio file your

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.410 
you know for your audio file your
high-end<00:03:09.830> custom<00:03:10.190> install<00:03:10.460> client<00:03:10.850> you<00:03:11.240> put

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
high-end custom install client you put

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.240 
high-end custom install client you put
this<00:03:11.540> thing<00:03:11.720> in<00:03:11.900> you<00:03:12.590> don't<00:03:12.680> need<00:03:12.830> a<00:03:12.890> DVD

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
this thing in you don't need a DVD

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.410 
this thing in you don't need a DVD
player<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.610> don't<00:03:13.640> need<00:03:13.850> a<00:03:13.880> CD<00:03:14.120> player<00:03:14.150> this

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
player you don't need a CD player this

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
player you don't need a CD player this
thing<00:03:14.570> is<00:03:14.690> high-end<00:03:14.960> enough<00:03:15.170> it's<00:03:15.350> gonna

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
thing is high-end enough it's gonna

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.479 
thing is high-end enough it's gonna
handle<00:03:15.740> all<00:03:15.950> that

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
handle all that

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.280 
handle all that
yeah<00:03:16.760> and<00:03:16.970> handle<00:03:17.239> it<00:03:17.360> all<00:03:17.450> very<00:03:17.780> very<00:03:17.989> well<00:03:18.260> I

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
yeah and handle it all very very well I

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.410 
yeah and handle it all very very well I
think<00:03:18.470> will<00:03:19.070> satisfy<00:03:19.670> a<00:03:19.880> lot<00:03:20.030> of<00:03:20.180> people's

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
think will satisfy a lot of people's

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.940 
think will satisfy a lot of people's
needs<00:03:20.660> I<00:03:20.810> really<00:03:21.110> looking<00:03:21.350> for<00:03:21.500> one<00:03:21.620> machine
