00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.450
 Hello everyone, today I show you how 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.980
 this upstand bar can be 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.980
 also a really very small table 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.720
 nice to say it's easy to do 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.279
 with pisl a in 3d 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.140
 but before you start to see that 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.980
 what we will need I want to say goodbye to 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.600
 people 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.160
 I want to greet the colors in my hand 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.279
 thoman a big kiss 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.340
 then Roman coals already also you and 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.239
 infinite fringes 05 hello to all three a 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.160
 big kiss 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.829
 and now let's see what we will need it for 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.440
 make this tall tina or small table 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.750
 in 3d with pis but then of course there 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.969
 you'll need the sedans to iron that 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.820
 they are more sla or amabilis in the colors they 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:53.430
 prefer two sheets of baking paper 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:56.250
 like these that only the woman grill a 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.250
 ironing pair and hot glue that 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.500
 this one ok guys this is all 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.210
 what you need to make it happen 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.610
 I hope you like it and move on to 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.890
 tutorial we start immediately take the 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.280
 our round grid and we have to 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.830
 go to position with central row 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:18.630
 of straight pegs vertically in this 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.320
 so way and now let's go get it 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.430
 a white bowl and let's go to 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.979
 place here so like this and 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.930
 let's fill in the whole circle of 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.400
 white or color beads that you have 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.880
 chosen you 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.040
 on the sides we can alternate in this 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.590
 way of different colored sedans 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.509
 so I do every two lines 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.060
 white I put a bead of one color 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.439
 different 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.079
 you can of course do it also with the 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.909
 transparent beads if you have it e 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.700
 so let's fill in this way 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.680
 our whole circle is ours 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.110
 round grid and obviously inside 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.920
 I'm going to put the beads in normally 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.920
 so all white 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:46.530
 and now once we've filled 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:50.790
 the whole interior we are going to iron and 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.709
 now let's turn the grid like this 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.000
 we put another sheet of paper at 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:03:00.120
 public between and now a weight a 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.510
 jar of beads and expect it to 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.180
 cool in the meantime let's go to 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.790
 resume our round grill and 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.370
 let's go and make another record let's say 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.480
 like this we just drafted 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.519
 just the smallest 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.730
 let's go to count we have to put the 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:21.269
 straight round grill with row 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.820
 central straight ahead and count 123 e 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.959
 on the fourth violin we are going to position 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.959
 a white bead 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.519
 in this way now we are going to fill up 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.799
 this circular row of beads 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.959
 I will go to follow the same sequence as 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:41.120
 first then two for white lines one 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.120
 heavenly and so on 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.660
 so let's fill in all this 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.750
 end in circular sedans like you want 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.750
 you 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.720
 and now let's go to fill in hell with 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.720
 the white balls 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.250
 ok now let's go to iron in 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.650
 meanwhile this has also cooled 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.120
 bigger than before 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.489
 see and oral we are going to draft in 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.600
 same way as we did for i 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.600
 previous pieces 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.110
 then we go to turn the grill there 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.870
 put on another sheet of paper 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.120
 baked a jar or something else 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.280
 as heavy as this order for nenÃ¨ e 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.050
 expect it to cool down as I have 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.330
 said before you can also iron 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.880
 both sides if you want ok 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.990
 we take the pan again and go to 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.390
 put a bead here one here now 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.820
 we place another bowl here 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.970
 we basically have to go for a 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.760
 simple classic flower you make 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.010
 with the round grid using the violins 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.430
 central then we go to put the 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:07.130
 beads that way I go now 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.510
 to iron this one side only 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.510
 Florentine with an iron 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:18.850
 so in this way and now let's leave a 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:22.180
 cool moment and let's say of these 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:24.550
 fiorellini we have to do all five 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.760
 equal 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:30.130
 Now come all yours, then 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.970
 inspired are on the one hand you see only from 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.530
 this 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.420
 in the meantime it is also cooled 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.540
 what we have done together now 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.180
 and we have therefore completed all 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.940
 pieces we need to make ours 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:46.060
 back then let's recap five of 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:49.300
 these here are the saddles that 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:52.990
 we will use to do the shank then this 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.870
 big circle and this little one 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.550
 let's start with the little one then 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.980
 we must take hot glue e 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.820
 start attacking the first one 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:06.460
 flower here in the center exactly 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:11.010
 where we see the little flower too 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.010
 here we take hot glue 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:22.360
 let's put a little something here at 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:24.280
 center and put ourselves above this now 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.280
 in this way we continue to attack 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:30.420
 one on top of the other small pieces 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.420
 will serve for the stem 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:49.539
 see this we have 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.909
 practically stacked all these 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:55.840
 bits and now we stick on it 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:07:04.409
 this one this way we go to 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:07.120
 put some hot glue on it now 

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:11.319
 let's wait for it to cool down 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:13.750
 the glue is ok now the glue is 

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:17.409
 cooled well and then glued 

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:19.690
 well the upper part and here is the 

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:22.870
 our backsplash which can also be a 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:25.719
 really nice table you can 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:28.659
 put a cake or a cake 

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:30.699
 whatever you want over and you can 

00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:33.009
 use also as a table I work is 

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:34.719
 really very nice and really also 

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:37.000
 easy to do we have 

00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:38.979
 simply glued pieces one 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.740
 on top of each other and a 

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:43.810
 cute table yes guys boys 

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.669
 extended also to you put me anyway 

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:49.529
 I send you a very big kiss 

00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:49.529
 I greet you and hello to the heritage
