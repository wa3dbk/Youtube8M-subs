00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.030

 this way as being a place where many 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.119
 those who do not 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.760
 two 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.520
 or 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.430
 it is too far 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.210
 two 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.860
 I do not want 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.580

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.220
 filling our body 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.400
 but its that we say far 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:38.670
 the voice is then what we are going to do 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.670
 see it below 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.710

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.350

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.180
 revive it 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.380
 lgl in the description of the video 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.510
 quiet 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.510
 here we put our account 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.120
 the start window of what is 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.670
 compensate the ballot because I'm 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.000
 appreciating the game that soon 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.159
 demonstrate how it is installed as a sequel 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.060
 ok I was not shown what there is 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:47.840
 characters 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:52.390
 and we will put the server where we are in 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.390
 my case is just a reality 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:03.990
 we look for slave characters who died 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.950
 reality 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.950
 and that load 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.260
 this count is already made 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.910
 we want to see where we all have 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.430
 these 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:27.250
 and follow and we will see that he will have revived 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:27.250
 as they see that he has died 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:34.099

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:40.480
 for 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.480

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.290
