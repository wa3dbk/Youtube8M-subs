00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.509
 hi all my name is hair gÃ³mez i am 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.240
 in settat displacement you can see my 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.140
 data on screen a user on twitter 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.520
 Ask me the next question the month 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.730
 more specifically diego towers me 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.590
 question how can you disable or 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.810
 remove the expiration of passwords 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.670
 in windows server 2012 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.949
 this we can do it in two 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.890
 ways if we have our 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.329
 team in a domain let's go to 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.329
 our password policies 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.860
 policies of domain policies or if 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.590
 we have it in local then we have to 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.690
 go to our directives or 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.519
 by local password policy 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.870
 so let's see what the process is 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.840
 what is the guide that we must carry out 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.399
 to be able to have these policies 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.809
 password this is something that is not 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.370
 Recommended for by good 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.800
 policies for good practices 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.500
 sorry to disable the expiration 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.360
 of passwords because this generates a 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.089
 risk to our infrastructure for 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.409
 our network is good to have this well 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:07.289
 this video stipulated for 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.670
 and make our network much more 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:14.580
 strengthened in the face of any attack 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.560
 strangers then let's see how 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.119
 we can configure this we are going then to 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.390
 my virtual machine with windows server 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.869
 2012 here I have as you can see I have a 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.430
 domain controller if I go by 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.880
 example to password policies 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.880
 local 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.640
 in configuration edit directives of 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.570
 group but the locals as you can see 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.530
 here local group 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.450
 and I go 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.290
 in the configuration of the team this all 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.890
 we will be for you native team and 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.659
 we go to windows configuration 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.770
 here in windows configuration we are going to 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.479
 see the security settings and 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.680
 we will look for account directives in 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.650
 account directives we will select 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.320
 password directives here we go to 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.940
 see the passwords directives 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.610
 such as storing passwords 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.979
 with reversible encryption demand the 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.330
 password password history 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.450
 to meet the requirements of 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:17.810
 complexities with these are the ones that by 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:20.340
 example numbers letters characters 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.230
 specials and these so should 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.420
 complete at least 3 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.430
 and uppercase and lowercase then 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.040
 we also have minimum length of the 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.769
 password and we have the maximum validity 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.980
 of the password and the minimum validity of 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.799
 the password if we open 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.629
 maximum validity of the password we are going to 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.060
 see who we have the established value 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.519
 from 42 days but they do not let us 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.220
 modify it here we can not modify 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.260
 because because we are in a domain and 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.870
 domain password policies 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.150
 prevail or are superior to 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.690
 local password policies in the 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.610
 application we can see what 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.770
 this security configuration 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.470
 determines the period of time in days 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.150
 in which a password can be used before 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.790
 that the system asks the user 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.130
 that change it can establish the 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.950
 passwords to expire after a 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.950
 number of days between 1 and 999 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.650
 or you can specify that the passwords 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.260
 never expire by setting the number 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.900
 from days to zero then how can we 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.850
 see gives us those possibilities and also 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.230
 gives us the possibility as the use says 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.290
 of half a question to the user in you at 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.570
 twitter to remove that expiration of 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.950
 passwords but this we have to 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:40.230
 do it by domain directives because 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.780
 at this moment we are in a domain and 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.460
 we have to do it for that reason if 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.560
 we of this one are in our 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:50.430
 local team we are not in a group of 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.560
 dom rupo work we can do 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.330
 by policies of local groups then 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.520
 let's go to our 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.250
 server manager in let's access now 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.780
 yes to our administration of 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.660
 group policies but directives 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.030
 of domain we will see that now here it 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.060
 the editor is going to go and I will see that 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.210
 I have my domain with my policies 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.240
 password in my domain policies and 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.640
 let's for example to edit it from fordo 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.890
 main policy as an example we can 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.540
 create another policy for this too 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.420
 We can set different types of 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.640
 passwords in 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.810
 to users or user groups because 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.180
 this is a new possibility that 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.500
 we have in windows server 2012 and in my 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.960
 youtube channel can find a 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.210
 video already in regards to this then 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.150
 we open edit let's do a test 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.130
 with this password with this directive 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.070
 and then we go to configuration of the 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:47.540
 team directives in directives let's 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.160
 access configuration windows 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.960
 in windows configuration we are going to 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.080
 access security settings on 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.760
 same almost the same route and here in 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.300
 directing account directives 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.070
 password here we will see the same thing the 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.020
 same configurations 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.730
 and we're going to see the maximum validity of the 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.140
 password we are going to open the counter in the 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:10.289
 policy and we see that here if they let us 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.319
 set up 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:15.839
 and is in full force of the 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:17.879
 password then we can not say the 

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:20.550
 policy that we can set the in 0 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:22.740
 days or we can also remove this check 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.999
 which gives us here to define this 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.430
 policy configuration we can 

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:30.169
 remove and as we see it is disabled 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.169
 this option 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.560
 we are going to do what the 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:39.320
 policy we are going to establish that it is in 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.500
 zero and as we see here it tells us that the 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.990
 password will never expire sa 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.840
 as the explanation tells us here 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:50.630
 set the in 0 days as we see here 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.289
 and that will never expire then we will 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:56.070
 tell him to apply 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:06:00.150
 let's tell him to accept 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:02.160
 as we see here has already left us in zero 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.980
 days so the password never 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.990
 will expire we must modify the validity 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.120
 minimum password we open it 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.580
 also and we specify it in 0 days 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.250
 then it tells us that the password is 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.680
 You can change immediately here 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.940
 we can then apply another class 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.190
 directive but we can also 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:23.940
 establish the and as we see already has 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:27.210
 removed the expiration of our 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:30.630
 passwords then this is the father 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:33.420
 these are the steps we have for 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:36.510
 can configure these policies of 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.910
 password as a recommendation and how 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.110
 I recommend microsoft this should have 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.690
 established policies of 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.760
 passwords for our users and more 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:48.720
 if we are administrators at the time of 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:51.860
 protect our network then I hope that 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.480
 this video is very helpful 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:57.870
 see you on a next occasion before 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:03.410
 to tell them who for example visit my 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:03.410
 youtube channel and my blog see you soon
