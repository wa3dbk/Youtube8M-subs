00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
screen right now and it all makes sense

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.070

if<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.039> do<00:00:29.310> read<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.730> none<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.720> out<00:00:31.050> of

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
the ordinary and it's just very

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.150 
the ordinary and it's just very
interesting<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.690> take<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.200> look<00:00:34.410> at<00:00:34.620> however<00:00:35.070> I

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
interesting to take a look at however I

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.380 
interesting to take a look at however I
would<00:00:35.219> just<00:00:35.489> like<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.730> mention<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.210> all

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
would just like to mention this is all

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.389 
would just like to mention this is all
speculation<00:00:36.540> none<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.770> confirmed<00:00:38.280> by

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
speculation none of it is confirmed by

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.549 
speculation none of it is confirmed by
Rockstar<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.510> can't<00:00:39.780> say<00:00:39.960> for<00:00:39.989> sure<00:00:40.140> if<00:00:40.440> this

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
Rockstar so I can't say for sure if this

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.580 
Rockstar so I can't say for sure if this
is<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.829> exact<00:00:41.430> coming<00:00:42.120> into<00:00:42.420> heist<00:00:42.750> dlc<00:00:43.020> but

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
this is exactly what has seemed to be

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.569 
this is exactly what has seemed to be

something really interesting because

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.399 
something really interesting because
what<00:01:40.560> we<00:01:40.680> can<00:01:40.829> see<00:01:41.070> here<00:01:41.119> says<00:01:42.119> heist<00:01:42.810> launch

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
what we can see here says heist launch

what we can see here says heist launch
tutorial<00:01:44.340> enabled<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.420> then<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.780> says<00:01:45.869> value

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
tutorial enabled and then it says value

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.630 
tutorial enabled and then it says value
false<00:01:46.500> which<00:01:46.710> means<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.100> enable<00:01:47.490> or

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
false which means you can enable or

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.899 
false which means you can enable or
disable<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.630> tutorial<00:01:49.110> for<00:01:49.439> heist<00:01:49.710> maybe<00:01:50.579> for

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
disable the tutorial for heist maybe for

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.600 
disable the tutorial for heist maybe for
example<00:01:51.420> if<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.840> go<00:01:52.079> into<00:01:52.350> let's<00:01:53.040> say<00:01:53.130> creator

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
example if you go into let's say creator

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.740 
example if you go into let's say creator
it<00:01:53.909> will<00:01:54.030> give<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.240> some<00:01:54.479> sort<00:01:54.720> of

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
it will give you some sort of

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.690 
it will give you some sort of
instruction<00:01:55.259> on<00:01:55.350> what<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.590> do<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.189> maybe<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
instruction on what to do so maybe the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.280 
instruction on what to do so maybe the
tutorial<00:01:57.329> could<00:01:57.750> be<00:01:57.869> some<00:01:58.049> sort<00:01:58.200> of

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
tutorial could be some sort of

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.139 
tutorial could be some sort of
instruction<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.219> could<00:01:59.399> do<00:01:59.610> for<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.060> high

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
instruction you could do for the high

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.179 
instruction you could do for the high
steel<00:02:00.390> seemly<00:02:00.840> maybe<00:02:01.170> there's<00:02:01.380> some<00:02:01.920> sort<00:02:02.070> of

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
steel seemly maybe there's some sort of

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.550 
steel seemly maybe there's some sort of
like<00:02:02.759> sketchup<00:02:03.450> saying<00:02:03.780> if<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.259> want<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.469> do

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
like sketchup saying if you want to do

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.200 
like sketchup saying if you want to do
Heights<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.189> what's<00:02:05.369> goes<00:02:05.549> down<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:06.060> is

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
Heights this is what's goes down this is

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.910 
Heights this is what's goes down this is
what<00:02:06.420> roles<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:07.049> need<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.530> how<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.799> all

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
what roles you need this is how it all

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.219 
what roles you need this is how it all
works<00:02:08.190> maybe<00:02:08.819> it's<00:02:09.090> really<00:02:09.360> complex<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.200> I

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
works maybe it's really complex and I

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.900 
works maybe it's really complex and I
really<00:02:10.679> want<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.190> see<00:02:11.340> what<00:02:11.489> this<00:02:11.520> heist

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
really want to see what this heist

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.360 
really want to see what this heist
tutorial<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:12.599> maybe<00:02:12.870> it's<00:02:12.959> like<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.080> high

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370

very interesting to see that heist may
in<00:02:47.060> fact<00:02:47.299> cost<00:02:47.690> when<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.319> DLC<00:02:48.620> does<00:02:48.769> come<00:02:48.980> out

in fact cost when the DLC does come out

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.150 
in fact cost when the DLC does come out
which<00:02:49.670> is<00:02:49.940> very<00:02:50.239> very<00:02:50.810> exciting<00:02:51.500> news<00:02:51.739> because

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
which is very very exciting news because

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.910 
which is very very exciting news because
I<00:02:52.370> really<00:02:53.000> really<00:02:53.239> hoped<00:02:53.510> what<00:02:54.140> I<00:02:54.260> mean<00:02:54.500> yes<00:02:54.739> it

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
I really really hoped what I mean yes it

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.979 
I really really hoped what I mean yes it
would<00:02:55.010> be<00:02:55.069> cool<00:02:55.220> if<00:02:55.250> heist<00:02:55.549> to<00:02:55.730> a<00:02:55.760> free<00:02:56.120> but<00:02:56.959> I

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
would be cool if heist to a free but I

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.050 
would be cool if heist to a free but I
kind<00:02:57.620> of<00:02:57.650> hoped<00:02:57.859> house<00:02:58.069> because<00:02:58.489> money<00:02:58.760> cuz<00:02:58.940> if

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
kind of hoped house because money cuz if

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.390 
kind of hoped house because money cuz if
they<00:02:59.180> cost<00:02:59.450> money<00:02:59.720> then<00:03:00.500> surely<00:03:01.010> you'll<00:03:01.129> mean

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
they cost money then surely you'll mean

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.580 
they cost money then surely you'll mean
we<00:03:01.909> can<00:03:02.120> use<00:03:02.390> heights<00:03:02.690> as<00:03:02.900> many<00:03:03.170> times<00:03:03.409> as<00:03:03.530> we

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
we can use heights as many times as we

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.930 
we can use heights as many times as we
like<00:03:03.920> we<00:03:04.069> can<00:03:04.099> keep<00:03:04.310> doing<00:03:04.340> them<00:03:04.579> over<00:03:04.849> and

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
like we can keep doing them over and

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.280 
like we can keep doing them over and
over<00:03:05.030> again<00:03:05.239> because<00:03:05.569> there's<00:03:05.870> some<00:03:06.049> risk

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
over again because there's some risk

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.500 
over again because there's some risk
involved<00:03:06.709> if<00:03:06.980> it<00:03:07.579> was<00:03:07.909> something<00:03:08.239> which<00:03:08.420> would

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
involved if it was something which would

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.580 
involved if it was something which would
just<00:03:08.659> give<00:03:08.750> you<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:08.870> ton<00:03:09.049> of<00:03:09.079> money<00:03:09.200> for<00:03:09.379> free

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
just give you a ton of money for free

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.289 
just give you a ton of money for free
then<00:03:10.280> maybe<00:03:10.430> they<00:03:10.609> could<00:03:10.760> restrict<00:03:11.000> them<00:03:11.180> now

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
then maybe they could restrict them now

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.390 
then maybe they could restrict them now
it's<00:03:11.450> just<00:03:11.569> my<00:03:11.690> small<00:03:12.319> prediction<00:03:12.950> that<00:03:13.129> is

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
it's just my small prediction that is

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.430 
it's just my small prediction that is
nothing<00:03:13.640> to<00:03:13.970> do<00:03:14.150> with<00:03:14.690> anything<00:03:14.959> to<00:03:15.170> with<00:03:15.290> high

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
nothing to do with anything to with high

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.539 
nothing to do with anything to with high
switch<00:03:15.650> would<00:03:15.739> come<00:03:15.859> out<00:03:15.980> is<00:03:16.129> actually<00:03:16.459> just

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
switch would come out is actually just

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:17.920 
switch would come out is actually just
my<00:03:16.760> prediction<00:03:17.209> I<00:03:17.239> put<00:03:17.389> on<00:03:17.480> Twitter<00:03:17.810> and

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
my prediction I put on Twitter and

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.270 
my prediction I put on Twitter and
everyone<00:03:18.169> was<00:03:18.260> kind<00:03:18.380> of<00:03:18.470> talking<00:03:18.620> about<00:03:18.919> it<00:03:19.040> so

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
everyone was kind of talking about it so

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.220 
everyone was kind of talking about it so
don't<00:03:19.489> believe<00:03:19.940> any<00:03:20.120> of<00:03:20.209> my<00:03:20.450> predictions<00:03:20.989> but

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
don't believe any of my predictions but

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.229 
don't believe any of my predictions but
this<00:03:21.349> coding<00:03:21.799> is<00:03:21.980> from<00:03:22.700> a<00:03:22.760> very<00:03:22.970> reliable

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
this coding as well I'm not going to be

this coding as well I'm not going to be
releasing<00:03:28.819> it<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.060> you<00:03:29.120> guys<00:03:29.359> though<00:03:29.629> under

releasing it to you guys though under

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.500 
releasing it to you guys though under
circumstances<00:03:31.129> of<00:03:31.370> what<00:03:31.639> I<00:03:31.760> believe<00:03:32.180> in<00:03:32.419> and

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
circumstances of what I believe in and

circumstances of what I believe in and
what<00:03:33.109> I<00:03:33.379> just<00:03:33.739> don't<00:03:34.129> think<00:03:34.370> Rockstar<00:03:34.760> want<00:03:35.000> me

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
what I just don't think Rockstar want me

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.819 
what I just don't think Rockstar want me
to<00:03:35.239> release<00:03:35.359> as<00:03:35.629> well<00:03:35.690> because<00:03:36.470> it's<00:03:36.650> fair

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
to release as well because it's fair

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.020 
to release as well because it's fair
enough<00:03:37.099> releasing<00:03:37.549> a<00:03:37.669> tiny<00:03:37.849> bit<00:03:37.970> of

enough releasing a tiny bit of

enough releasing a tiny bit of

money and remove it from your account
instantly<00:03:51.650> there<00:03:52.160> are<00:03:52.310> thresholds<00:03:52.609> in<00:03:53.120> some

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:53.419 
instantly there are thresholds in some

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:54.819 
instantly there are thresholds in some

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
of the coding which I will not be

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.979 
of the coding which I will not be
releasing<00:03:55.310> so<00:03:55.519> unfortunately<00:03:56.120> you<00:03:56.569> guys<00:03:56.750> I'm

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
releasing so unfortunately you guys I'm

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
not going to be releasing it and the

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
thresholds for the antenna system it's

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.479

not going to be released on this channel

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.220

because I really don't believe in
releasing<00:04:03.949> stuff<00:04:04.430> Rockstar<00:04:04.790> probably<00:04:05.239> don't

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:05.419 
releasing stuff Rockstar probably don't

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:06.879 
releasing stuff Rockstar probably don't
want<00:04:05.569> me<00:04:05.629> to<00:04:05.690> release<00:04:05.840> so<00:04:06.199> guys<00:04:06.500> let<00:04:06.799> me<00:04:06.829> know
