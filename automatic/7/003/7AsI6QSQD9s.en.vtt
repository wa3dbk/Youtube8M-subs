00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
welcome back to lethal hammers channel

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.410 
welcome back to lethal hammers channel
finally<00:00:03.959> getting<00:00:04.200> my<00:00:04.319> system<00:00:04.740> complete<00:00:05.420> I've

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
finally getting my system complete I've

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.480 
finally getting my system complete I've
finally<00:00:06.779> gotten<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.710> lot<00:00:07.859> of<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.099> upgrades

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
finally gotten a lot of the upgrades

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.430 
finally gotten a lot of the upgrades
into<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.240> system<00:00:09.660> so<00:00:09.840> i<00:00:09.900> wanted<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.200> show<00:00:10.410> you

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
into the system so i wanted to show you

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.129 
into the system so i wanted to show you
guys<00:00:11.190> were<00:00:11.519> where<00:00:12.420> i'm<00:00:12.509> sitting<00:00:12.719> right<00:00:12.990> now

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
guys were where i'm sitting right now

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.010 
guys were where i'm sitting right now
with<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.410> system<00:00:13.710> so<00:00:14.070> here<00:00:15.000> we<00:00:15.089> go<00:00:17.420> an<00:00:18.420> overall

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
with the system so here we go an overall

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.110 
with the system so here we go an overall
look

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:24.120 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.230 

as<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.840> can<00:00:24.930> see<00:00:25.140> with<00:00:25.290> the<00:00:25.410> system<00:00:25.850> did<00:00:26.850> a<00:00:26.880> few

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
as you can see with the system did a few

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.410 
as you can see with the system did a few
adjustments<00:00:27.570> with<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.320> layout<00:00:29.240> got<00:00:30.240> rid<00:00:30.390> of

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
adjustments with the layout got rid of

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.540 
adjustments with the layout got rid of
the<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:31.200> tubing<00:00:31.620> that<00:00:31.740> was<00:00:31.890> coming<00:00:32.190> down<00:00:32.340> from

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
the the tubing that was coming down from

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.400 
the the tubing that was coming down from
the<00:00:32.670> upper<00:00:32.760> area<00:00:33.240> and<00:00:33.570> right<00:00:33.900> and<00:00:34.020> along<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
the upper area and right and along the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.380 
the upper area and right and along the
back<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.460> way<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.820> gives<00:00:35.970> a<00:00:36.120> little<00:00:36.270> bit

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
back so that way it gives a little bit

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.500 
back so that way it gives a little bit
more<00:00:36.630> cleaner<00:00:36.960> look<00:00:37.260> you'll<00:00:38.190> see<00:00:38.280> both<00:00:38.610> EVGA

I've<00:00:44.280> got<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.550> coolants<00:00:45.059> SLI<00:00:47.180> adapter<00:00:48.980> we<00:00:49.980> ran

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
I've got the coolants SLI adapter we ran

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.580 
I've got the coolants SLI adapter we ran
this<00:00:50.220> tube<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.580> little<00:00:50.790> bit<00:00:50.910> more<00:00:51.059> cleanly<00:00:51.590> got

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
this tube a little bit more cleanly got

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.640 
this tube a little bit more cleanly got
some<00:00:52.770> fill<00:00:52.980> ports<00:00:53.400> to<00:00:53.850> mount<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.690> between<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
some fill ports to mount in between the

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.380 
some fill ports to mount in between the
actual<00:00:55.970> holes<00:00:58.339> so<00:00:59.339> I<00:00:59.400> got<00:00:59.519> a<00:00:59.550> compression<00:01:00.150> and

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
actual holes so I got a compression and

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.390 
actual holes so I got a compression and
an<00:01:00.660> angle<00:01:00.989> fitting<00:01:01.290> down<00:01:01.410> here<00:01:01.830> 90<00:01:02.129> degree

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
an angle fitting down here 90 degree

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.340 
an angle fitting down here 90 degree
angle<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.910> then<00:01:03.510> we<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> 90<00:01:04.080> degree<00:01:04.140> angle

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
angle and then we have a 90 degree angle

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.490 
angle and then we have a 90 degree angle
with<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:05.160> barbed<00:01:05.730> fitting<00:01:06.150> here<00:01:06.570> actually<00:01:07.230> goes

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
with a barbed fitting here actually goes

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.570 
with a barbed fitting here actually goes

to the new T line I put in if you can

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.560 
to the new T line I put in if you can
see<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.790> got<00:01:12.330> rid<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.690> lot<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:14.420> run<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.510> a

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
of course our dual fan controllers just

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.000 
of course our dual fan controllers just
had<00:03:05.239> so<00:03:05.420> many<00:03:05.510> fans<00:03:05.810> in<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.050> system<00:03:06.470> wanted<00:03:06.950> to

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
had so many fans in the system wanted to

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.009 
had so many fans in the system wanted to
make<00:03:07.190> sure<00:03:07.220> can<00:03:08.180> control<00:03:08.540> them<00:03:08.660> all<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:08.930> make

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
make sure can control them all and make

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.949 
make sure can control them all and make
sure<00:03:09.049> we're<00:03:09.350> tracking<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.830> temps<00:03:10.220> I<00:03:10.720> can<00:03:11.720> see

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
sure we're tracking the temps I can see

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.400 
sure we're tracking the temps I can see
this<00:03:12.769> first<00:03:13.070> temp<00:03:13.400> here<00:03:13.790> is<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.900> temperature

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
this first temp here is the temperature

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.820 
this first temp here is the temperature
of<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.590> liquid<00:03:15.620> for<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:17.440> graphics<00:03:18.440> card<00:03:18.650> loop

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
of the liquid for the graphics card loop

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.380 
of the liquid for the graphics card loop
so<00:03:19.250> 28.5<00:03:20.030> Celsius<00:03:20.950> you'll<00:03:21.950> see<00:03:22.190> for<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.910> CPU

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
so 28.5 Celsius you'll see for the CPU

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.690 
so 28.5 Celsius you'll see for the CPU
loop<00:03:23.600> it's<00:03:23.840> running<00:03:24.170> roughly<00:03:24.440> at<00:03:24.700> 33.5

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700
