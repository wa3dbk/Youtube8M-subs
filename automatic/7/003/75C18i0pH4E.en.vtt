hey guys want to do some benchmarks
around<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:03.870> benchmark<00:00:04.350> so<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:04.589> moment<00:00:04.920> ago<00:00:04.980> and

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:06.500 
around the benchmark so a moment ago and

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.140 
around the benchmark so a moment ago and
wow<00:00:07.500> we're<00:00:07.859> really<00:00:08.160> impressive<00:00:08.820> you<00:00:08.970> know<00:00:09.090> I'm

processor so I want to give it a whirl
let's<00:00:14.519> go<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:14.820> do<00:00:14.940> quadrant<00:00:15.450> first<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:17.060> i'll

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
let's go and do quadrant first and i'll

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.109 
let's go and do quadrant first and i'll
let<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.270> see<00:00:18.449> how<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.630> gets<00:00:18.779> down<00:00:20.029> just<00:00:21.029> a

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.120 

this<00:02:40.330> test<00:02:40.630> excuse<00:02:41.350> me<00:02:41.440> from<00:02:41.560> hidden<00:02:41.800> camera

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
this test excuse me from hidden camera

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.970 
this test excuse me from hidden camera
tests<00:02:42.430> are<00:02:42.640> really<00:02:42.910> good<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.590> shows<00:02:44.590> that<00:02:44.770> us<00:02:44.890> a

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
tests are really good it shows that us a

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.800 
tests are really good it shows that us a
really<00:02:45.190> nice<00:02:46.180> processor<00:02:46.960> es<00:02:48.090> es<00:02:49.090> for<00:02:49.390> in<00:02:49.570> there

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
really nice processor es es for in there

00:02:49.810 --> 00:03:03.900 
really nice processor es es for in there
instead<00:02:50.410> of<00:02:50.560> really<00:02:50.860> doing<00:02:51.190> this<00:02:51.280> thing

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:11.059 

just<00:03:04.980> blazing<00:03:05.980> through<00:03:06.190> this<00:03:06.280> thing

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:29.059 

it's<00:03:12.069> really<00:03:12.220> going<00:03:12.489> well

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:36.429 

look<00:03:29.670> at<00:03:29.760> that<00:03:29.909> frame<00:03:30.209> rate<00:03:32.060> look<00:03:33.060> at<00:03:33.150> that<00:03:33.620> 61

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:36.439 
look at that frame rate look at that 61

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:44.350 
look at that frame rate look at that 61
steady<00:03:37.439> flow<00:03:37.709> of<00:03:37.739> 61<00:03:38.540> look<00:03:39.540> at<00:03:39.749> that

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.750 

check<00:03:44.990> the<00:03:45.140> frame<00:03:45.350> rate<00:03:45.620> out<00:03:46.630> 59<00:03:48.040> 60<00:03:49.040> boom

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
check the frame rate out 59 60 boom

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.350 
check the frame rate out 59 60 boom
there<00:03:50.090> it<00:03:50.120> is<00:03:51.850> just<00:03:52.850> getting<00:03:53.030> better<00:03:53.120> and

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
there it is just getting better and

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.500 
there it is just getting better and
better

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.690
