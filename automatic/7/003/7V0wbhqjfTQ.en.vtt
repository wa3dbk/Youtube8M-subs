00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:26.140
 good morning on this occasion 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.950
 speak shaders cdlm manrique 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.320
 art group administrator and 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.870
 Android development 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.650
 in this opportunity I meet with the 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.140
 rumba 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.780
 lollipop b3 the latest version that then 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.450
 I do not know I think I'm going to get this will be the 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.450
 latest version that brings this version 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.090
 let's analyze it and little else 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.070
 and if we look at the adjustment and we're going to 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.810
 find with the settings watching and 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:58.660
 totally phone information 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:01.150
 we will see that we have the version of 25.0 2 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:06.640
 and the number of models to see 50 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:09.670
 developer's meter pressing several 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.479
 times the compilation number for 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:18.330
 have the developer options is 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.330
 highly recommended interactive 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.040
 with methods 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.040
 why 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.079
 we understand 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.469
 we mark good usb debugging that yes 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.469
 It seems 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.810
 if we go to storage 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:45.299
 we can see that it does not have a warehouse bus 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:51.240
 of storage that the mind does not read the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:54.720
 phone I do not like 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.990
 at the request of a member again 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.520
 we have what is the framework and 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.430
 we have to control the animations 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.570
 that we want you to have as is the case 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.570
 I will place the photo 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.130
 lives 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.450
 then this is brought by the first version 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.940
 is implemented again this time 3 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.830
 remind us that we have what is the 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.870
 body plus are cordially in the dead 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.069
 and super you to control what 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.010
 it would be the provisionals 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.530
 superuser in this grave we can 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.989
 buy what would be a monitor of 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:33.440
 data traffic and those things to measure 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.440
 our internal speed 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:42.609
 if we look on the one hand as to the 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.609
 memory management we can see what 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.580
 running has a very fast cost 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.490
 remember that I will also pass on the 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.190
 script a script to improve it then 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.020
 because it is very good next in terms 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.270
 notification panel we have the 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.100
 notifications channel too good 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.590
 which is his first version as 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.840
 we can see it is like that because obviously 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.610
 in the gravity boss but it comes very 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.730
 very similar to its first versions 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.920
 then he with sting does not change anything in 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.550
 how much do we see this that comes with 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.709
 his challenge that when the gift and pop and the 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.920
 Stoppings running too much 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.920
 all right 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.750
 as for the camera is not 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.920
 working perfectly 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.410
 if you like I will leave the description of 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.140
 video the gallery of arrangements in a 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.180
 class file speak for obviously 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.040
 install it and then then 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.640
 this will follow all the outside with the 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.640
 reached 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:55.280
 android lollipop all working at the 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.280
 perfection 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.900
 policy is going to show you what it is 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.860
 the installation then by way and 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.770
 sculptor I will be in the recovery for 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.930
 show them 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.930
 then can boys jagÃ¼el 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.049
 now being between his record and double v 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.639
 uve for w 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.889
 remember that to turn on mode 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.810
 recovery or recovery mode have to 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:24.320
 turn it off manually and turn it on 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:27.020
 pressing what is button on and 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.000
 volume up at a time then being 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.990
 in the recovery it will output 2 interface 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.690
 very similar to mine 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.720
 in this section we will go to what would come 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.410
 to be white 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.760
 Once in white we go to where 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.729
 says advanced white 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.039
 once being in the 5th 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:49.400
 let's check the options that I have 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:52.039
 marked as the cache system 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.199
 data and android security then the 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:57.080
 we mark and confirm the installation 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:59.409
 that scaling that this little circle towards 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.409
 the right 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:07.320
 once we have made the process of 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:10.290
 the white ones we're going to go to glass 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.390
 in these we will have to select the 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:18.300
 lollipop b3 in my case I have it in 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:20.100
 this folder in this section to you 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.320
 it will come out to select depending 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.880
 Where you have it, it is advisable to leave it in 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.240
 the path of the sd card to 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.410
 find it much easier here what 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.210
 will have to do is simply 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.480
 confirm the installation remember 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.540
 when the bear this the little circle before 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.860
 right and it ends in the installation 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:41.200
 then 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.880
 will restart your device and they will go back to 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.330
 turn on in the recovery this time it would be 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.850
 to hit the round then being 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.860
 again within the record and we're going to 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.590
 install 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:57.370
 and being in install let's select 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:06:01.139
 what is the 4.4 rudolf 2 tip that would be 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:03.250
 to spray then we select it and 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.139
 we confirm the installation that you already know 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.620
 how to expand the little circle towards 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:10.110
 right 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:12.780
 once the installation is finished 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:17.100
 that is the route we are going to restart 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:19.710
 our system then the slope is 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:22.230
 restart our system we can see that 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:27.030
 we already have the route and little and it brings us a 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:29.130
 bus it is advisable not to change it and that 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.890
 boozer for supersur because it's going to 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:34.410
 bring inconveniences and inconveniences 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:37.640
 remember then this has been all 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.640

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.800
