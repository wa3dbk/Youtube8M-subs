00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.889 

in<00:00:01.550> this<00:00:01.670> video<00:00:01.850> I'm<00:00:02.030> going<00:00:02.180> to<00:00:02.330> discuss

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:02.899 
in this video I'm going to discuss

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:04.539 
in this video I'm going to discuss
polygon<00:00:03.680> faces<00:00:03.890> in<00:00:04.190> a<00:00:04.220> little<00:00:04.370> bit<00:00:04.460> more

00:00:04.539 --> 00:00:04.549 
polygon faces in a little bit more

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:06.850 
polygon faces in a little bit more
detail<00:00:04.910> and<00:00:05.660> talk<00:00:05.900> about<00:00:06.020> the<00:00:06.440> fact<00:00:06.650> that<00:00:06.740> you

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:06.860 
detail and talk about the fact that you

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.070 
detail and talk about the fact that you
can<00:00:07.009> delete<00:00:07.250> faces<00:00:07.759> off<00:00:07.880> a<00:00:07.910> surface<00:00:08.420> and<00:00:08.990> also

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 
can delete faces off a surface and also

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.480 
can delete faces off a surface and also
replace<00:00:09.530> them<00:00:09.740> if<00:00:09.860> they're<00:00:10.010> missing

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
replace them if they're missing

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.370 
replace them if they're missing
so<00:00:11.269> demonstrate<00:00:11.690> that<00:00:11.840> I'm<00:00:11.930> going<00:00:12.080> to<00:00:12.110> create

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
so demonstrate that I'm going to create

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.320 
so demonstrate that I'm going to create
a<00:00:12.440> polygon<00:00:12.950> cylinder<00:00:13.490> and<00:00:13.610> because<00:00:13.849> it's<00:00:14.090> a

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
a polygon cylinder and because it's a

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.520 
a polygon cylinder and because it's a
little<00:00:14.780> bit<00:00:14.870> different<00:00:15.170> from<00:00:15.230> the<00:00:15.380> other

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530 
little bit different from the other

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.340 
little bit different from the other
primitive<00:00:16.009> so<00:00:16.250> I<00:00:16.490> go<00:00:17.000> to<00:00:17.060> create<00:00:17.480> polygon

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
primitive so I go to create polygon

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.580 
primitive so I go to create polygon
primitives<00:00:19.779> cylinder<00:00:20.779> and<00:00:21.350> there's<00:00:21.529> a

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
primitives cylinder and there's a

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.370 
primitives cylinder and there's a
cylinder<00:00:21.980> I'm<00:00:22.130> going<00:00:22.340> to<00:00:22.460> dalian<00:00:22.880> and<00:00:23.230> turn<00:00:24.230> on

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
cylinder I'm going to dalian and turn on

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.279 
cylinder I'm going to dalian and turn on
smooth<00:00:24.710> shade<00:00:24.949> also<00:00:25.400> we<00:00:25.490> can<00:00:25.580> see<00:00:25.760> this<00:00:25.880> better

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
smooth shade also we can see this better

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.050 
smooth shade also we can see this better
now<00:00:27.289> first<00:00:27.529> thing<00:00:27.619> you<00:00:27.680> may<00:00:27.800> notice<00:00:27.949> is<00:00:28.340> with

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
now first thing you may notice is with

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.359 
now first thing you may notice is with
this<00:00:29.300> primitive<00:00:29.779> you<00:00:30.619> have<00:00:30.769> a<00:00:30.830> combination<00:00:31.010> of

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
this primitive you have a combination of

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.399 
this primitive you have a combination of
quad<00:00:31.670> phases<00:00:32.210> where<00:00:32.390> Tangra<00:00:32.750> face<00:00:32.929> and<00:00:33.289> also

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:33.409 
quad phases where Tangra face and also

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:36.639 
quad phases where Tangra face and also
triangular<00:00:34.039> ones<00:00:34.219> at<00:00:34.370> the<00:00:34.489> top<00:00:34.870> now<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:36.409> truth

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
triangular ones at the top now the truth

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.250 
triangular ones at the top now the truth
is<00:00:36.889> that<00:00:37.280> a<00:00:37.579> polygon<00:00:38.420> surface<00:00:38.659> is<00:00:38.899> actually

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
is that a polygon surface is actually

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.410 
is that a polygon surface is actually
constructed<00:00:39.440> wholly<00:00:40.039> out<00:00:40.370> of<00:00:40.609> triangular

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
constructed wholly out of triangular

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.989 
constructed wholly out of triangular
faces<00:00:41.690> when<00:00:42.109> Maya<00:00:42.289> does<00:00:42.620> for<00:00:43.280> convenience<00:00:43.850> to

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:43.999 
faces when Maya does for convenience to

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:45.669 
faces when Maya does for convenience to
make<00:00:44.149> the<00:00:44.449> display<00:00:44.749> a<00:00:44.809> little<00:00:44.989> easier<00:00:45.440> is

00:00:45.669 --> 00:00:45.679 
make the display a little easier is

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.949 
make the display a little easier is
anytime<00:00:46.489> you<00:00:46.579> have<00:00:46.639> a<00:00:46.699> quad<00:00:46.969> face<00:00:47.299> like<00:00:47.659> on<00:00:47.809> the

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:47.959 
anytime you have a quad face like on the

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:50.379 
anytime you have a quad face like on the
side<00:00:48.199> here<00:00:48.559> every<00:00:49.429> quad<00:00:49.639> face<00:00:49.909> is<00:00:50.089> actually

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:50.389 
side here every quad face is actually

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:52.539 
side here every quad face is actually
composed<00:00:50.600> of<00:00:50.809> two<00:00:50.929> triangles<00:00:51.260> and<00:00:51.739> in<00:00:52.369> Maya

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:52.549 
composed of two triangles and in Maya

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:54.819 
composed of two triangles and in Maya
simply<00:00:52.969> hides<00:00:53.269> a<00:00:53.479> division<00:00:53.929> line<00:00:54.109> to<00:00:54.409> make<00:00:54.589> the

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
simply hides a division line to make the

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.699 
simply hides a division line to make the
display<00:00:55.399> a<00:00:55.670> little<00:00:55.969> less<00:00:56.299> congested<00:00:56.780> so<00:00:57.649> you

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:57.709 
display a little less congested so you

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:59.439 
display a little less congested so you
can<00:00:58.039> imagine<00:00:58.219> that<00:00:58.579> if<00:00:58.819> you<00:00:58.969> would<00:00:59.119> look<00:00:59.299> at

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
can imagine that if you would look at

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.689 
can imagine that if you would look at
one<00:00:59.629> quad<00:00:59.959> like<00:01:00.260> right<00:01:00.499> here<00:01:00.979> and<00:01:01.069> we're<00:01:01.639> to

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
one quad like right here and we're to

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.759 
one quad like right here and we're to
draw<00:01:01.940> a<00:01:01.969> line<00:01:02.269> from<00:01:03.049> one<00:01:03.289> corner<00:01:03.529> to<00:01:03.619> the

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
draw a line from one corner to the

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.010 
draw a line from one corner to the
opposite<00:01:04.129> corner<00:01:04.339> in<00:01:04.580> a<00:01:04.640> diagonal<00:01:04.969> like<00:01:05.600> here

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
opposite corner in a diagonal like here

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.109 
opposite corner in a diagonal like here
that<00:01:06.560> make<00:01:06.829> two<00:01:07.070> triangles<00:01:07.640> and<00:01:07.789> in<00:01:07.939> fact

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
that make two triangles and in fact

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:09.999 
that make two triangles and in fact
that's<00:01:08.329> what's<00:01:08.509> going<00:01:08.780> on<00:01:08.960> why<00:01:09.619> it's<00:01:09.770> hidden

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
that's what's going on why it's hidden

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.110 
that's what's going on why it's hidden
from<00:01:10.189> you<00:01:10.399> again<00:01:11.240> for<00:01:11.479> convenience

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
from you again for convenience

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.490 
from you again for convenience
that's<00:01:13.270> what<00:01:13.420> happens<00:01:13.630> with<00:01:13.720> quads<00:01:14.080> when<00:01:14.380> you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
that's what happens with quads when you

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.400 
that's what happens with quads when you
have<00:01:14.920> quads<00:01:15.280> you<00:01:15.550> make<00:01:15.730> a<00:01:15.760> quad<00:01:16.150> face<00:01:16.540> now<00:01:17.350> you

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
have quads you make a quad face now you

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.350 
have quads you make a quad face now you
can<00:01:17.650> also<00:01:17.800> just<00:01:18.100> have<00:01:18.310> triangles<00:01:18.880> for<00:01:19.300> the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
can also just have triangles for the

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.850 
can also just have triangles for the
sake<00:01:19.540> of<00:01:19.660> having<00:01:19.780> triangles<00:01:20.320> if<00:01:20.410> you<00:01:20.500> want<00:01:20.710> to

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
sake of having triangles if you want to

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.550 
sake of having triangles if you want to
in<00:01:21.070> this<00:01:21.910> case<00:01:22.300> in<00:01:22.570> order<00:01:22.690> to<00:01:22.930> get<00:01:23.260> the<00:01:23.380> top

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
in this case in order to get the top

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.530 
in this case in order to get the top
filled<00:01:23.860> in<00:01:24.010> that<00:01:24.130> was<00:01:24.250> necessary<00:01:24.730> in<00:01:25.360> this

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
filled in that was necessary in this

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.140 
filled in that was necessary in this
case<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:26.620> triangular<00:01:27.070> tips<00:01:27.400> all<00:01:27.670> meet<00:01:27.940> at<00:01:28.120> the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
case the triangular tips all meet at the

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.970 
case the triangular tips all meet at the
center<00:01:28.630> all<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.810> vertices<00:01:29.140> overlap<00:01:29.650> here<00:01:29.890> in

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
center all the vertices overlap here in

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.980 
center all the vertices overlap here in
the<00:01:30.070> center<00:01:30.400> so<00:01:30.550> you<00:01:31.300> can't<00:01:31.690> really<00:01:31.840> have

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
the center so you can't really have

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.840 
the center so you can't really have
quads<00:01:32.350> on<00:01:32.590> top<00:01:32.830> here<00:01:33.100> wouldn't<00:01:33.400> really<00:01:33.550> work

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
quads on top here wouldn't really work

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.760 
quads on top here wouldn't really work
so<00:01:34.210> you're<00:01:34.780> stuck<00:01:35.050> with<00:01:35.260> displaying

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
so you're stuck with displaying

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.190 
so you're stuck with displaying
triangles<00:01:36.700> right<00:01:36.880> here<00:01:37.120> but<00:01:37.810> when<00:01:37.870> you<00:01:37.960> create

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
triangles right here but when you create

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.290 
triangles right here but when you create
polygon<00:01:38.680> services<00:01:39.430> from<00:01:39.610> scratch<00:01:39.940> you<00:01:40.210> do

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
polygon services from scratch you do

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.570 
polygon services from scratch you do
have<00:01:40.420> the<00:01:40.540> option<00:01:41.320> to<00:01:41.350> build<00:01:41.770> quads<00:01:42.190> or

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
have the option to build quads or

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.000 
have the option to build quads or
triangles<00:01:43.360> in<00:01:43.540> fact<00:01:44.350> you<00:01:44.440> can<00:01:44.560> also<00:01:44.710> have

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
triangles in fact you can also have

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.880 
triangles in fact you can also have
faces<00:01:45.610> that<00:01:45.760> are<00:01:46.000> irregular<00:01:46.540> with<00:01:46.870> 5<00:01:47.200> 6<00:01:47.530> 7<00:01:47.800> 8

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
sides now that's not initially ideal

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.760 
sides now that's not initially ideal
it's<00:01:51.100> ideal<00:01:51.520> to<00:01:51.610> have<00:01:52.060> what<00:01:52.840> appears<00:01:53.260> is<00:01:53.440> quads

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
it's ideal to have what appears is quads

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.040 
it's ideal to have what appears is quads
or<00:01:54.160> triangles<00:01:54.880> when<00:01:55.000> you<00:01:55.060> build<00:01:55.270> a<00:01:55.330> model<00:01:55.510> but

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
or triangles when you build a model but

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.920 
or triangles when you build a model but
you<00:01:56.080> can't<00:01:56.470> have<00:01:56.680> mod<00:01:57.040> number<00:01:57.460> of<00:01:57.730> edges<00:01:58.450> when

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
you can't have mod number of edges when

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.600 
you can't have mod number of edges when
you're<00:01:59.080> modeling

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.160 

now<00:02:01.940> I<00:02:01.970> mentioned<00:02:02.390> that<00:02:02.420> you<00:02:02.570> can<00:02:02.930> delete

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
now I mentioned that you can delete

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.440 
now I mentioned that you can delete
faces<00:02:03.650> so<00:02:03.830> you<00:02:04.310> can<00:02:04.460> select<00:02:04.760> the<00:02:04.970> face<00:02:05.180> let's

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
faces so you can select the face let's

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.030 
faces so you can select the face let's
say<00:02:05.570> you're<00:02:05.690> in<00:02:05.780> face<00:02:05.990> mode<00:02:06.290> I'll<00:02:06.530> go<00:02:06.650> to<00:02:06.710> the

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
say you're in face mode I'll go to the

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.120 
say you're in face mode I'll go to the
right<00:02:07.730> mouse<00:02:07.970> button<00:02:08.410> menu<00:02:09.410> here<00:02:09.800> and<00:02:09.920> go<00:02:10.070> to

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
face if you click on the face you can

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.410 
face if you click on the face you can
delete<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.070> or<00:02:13.280> click<00:02:13.520> on<00:02:13.640> more<00:02:14.000> than<00:02:14.090> one<00:02:14.270> with

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
delete it or click on more than one with

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.690 
delete it or click on more than one with
shift<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:14.870> delete<00:02:15.110> those<00:02:15.400> if<00:02:16.400> I<00:02:16.460> hit<00:02:16.610> the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
shift and delete those if I hit the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.220 
shift and delete those if I hit the
Delete<00:02:16.940> key<00:02:16.970> on<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.300> keyboard<00:02:17.390> they<00:02:17.990> go<00:02:18.140> away

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
Delete key on the keyboard they go away

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.890 
Delete key on the keyboard they go away
what<00:02:19.070> you<00:02:19.220> have<00:02:19.310> is<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:19.460> window<00:02:19.820> in<00:02:20.060> your

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
what you have is a window in your

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.200 
what you have is a window in your
surface<00:02:21.400> now<00:02:22.400> it's<00:02:22.550> my<00:02:22.730> advantage<00:02:23.000> of

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
surface now it's my advantage of

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.790 
surface now it's my advantage of
polygons<00:02:23.630> surfaces<00:02:24.110> you<00:02:24.170> cannot<00:02:24.440> do<00:02:24.650> this

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
polygons surfaces you cannot do this

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.950 
polygons surfaces you cannot do this
with<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.070> NURBS<00:02:25.340> surface<00:02:25.760> if<00:02:26.450> you<00:02:26.540> want<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.870> have

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
with a NURBS surface if you want to have

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.600 
with a NURBS surface if you want to have
a<00:02:27.020> similar<00:02:27.350> hole<00:02:27.650> in<00:02:27.800> Erb<00:02:27.950> surface<00:02:28.370> you<00:02:28.490> would

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
a similar hole in Erb surface you would

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.280 
a similar hole in Erb surface you would
actually<00:02:28.760> have<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.180> break<00:02:29.360> surface<00:02:29.960> up<00:02:30.080> into

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
actually have to break surface up into

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.460 
actually have to break surface up into
multiple<00:02:30.610> separate<00:02:31.610> surfaces<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:32.810> simply

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
multiple separate surfaces and simply

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.380 
multiple separate surfaces and simply
move<00:02:33.650> them<00:02:33.890> slightly<00:02:34.190> touch<00:02:34.550> along<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.030> edges

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
move them slightly touch along the edges

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.960 
move them slightly touch along the edges
in<00:02:35.990> this<00:02:36.110> case<00:02:36.380> I<00:02:36.680> have<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:37.010> single<00:02:37.310> polygon

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
in this case I have a single polygon

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.910 
in this case I have a single polygon
surface<00:02:38.210> so<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:38.690> can<00:02:38.930> have<00:02:39.170> holes<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.860> the

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
surface so you can have holes and the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
surface so you can have holes and the
polygon<00:02:40.280> service<00:02:40.640> with<00:02:40.820> no<00:02:40.850> Cali<00:02:41.570> for<00:02:41.870> that

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
polygon service with no Cali for that

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.660 
polygon service with no Cali for that
so<00:02:43.570> you<00:02:43.630> complete<00:02:43.870> any<00:02:44.050> face<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:44.470> want<00:02:44.710> now

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
so you complete any face you want now

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.070 
so you complete any face you want now
you<00:02:45.730> can<00:02:45.850> also<00:02:46.000> replace<00:02:46.390> a<00:02:46.480> face<00:02:46.810> that's

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
you can also replace a face that's

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.360 
you can also replace a face that's
missing<00:02:47.470> let's<00:02:47.650> say<00:02:47.800> you<00:02:47.890> changed<00:02:48.220> your<00:02:48.340> mind

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
missing let's say you changed your mind

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.820 
missing let's say you changed your mind
about<00:02:48.760> cutting<00:02:49.210> a<00:02:49.270> hole<00:02:49.450> into<00:02:49.630> your<00:02:50.410> surface

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
about cutting a hole into your surface

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.440 
about cutting a hole into your surface
or<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:51.070> accidentally<00:02:51.580> delete<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:51.910> face<00:02:52.210> when

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
or you accidentally delete a face when

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.270 
or you accidentally delete a face when
you<00:02:52.540> selected<00:02:52.930> an<00:02:53.110> incorrect<00:02:53.620> one<00:02:53.830> like<00:02:54.070> maybe

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
you selected an incorrect one like maybe

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.440 
you selected an incorrect one like maybe
you<00:02:54.460> selected<00:02:54.790> through<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.030> back<00:02:55.210> by

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
you selected through the back by

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.550 
you selected through the back by
accident<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:55.960> hit<00:02:56.110> delete

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
accident and hit delete

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.940 
accident and hit delete
so<00:02:58.310> you<00:02:58.370> can<00:02:59.120> fill<00:02:59.780> in<00:02:59.990> a<00:03:00.290> missing<00:03:00.319> face<00:03:00.920> a

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
so you can fill in a missing face a

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.340 
so you can fill in a missing face a
moron<00:03:01.340> one<00:03:01.490> missing<00:03:01.910> face<00:03:02.150> with<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:02.900> special

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
moron one missing face with a special

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.710 
moron one missing face with a special
tool<00:03:03.590> so<00:03:04.010> let<00:03:04.130> me<00:03:04.250> cut<00:03:04.910> another<00:03:05.090> hole<00:03:05.360> here<00:03:05.390> I'm

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
tool so let me cut another hole here I'm

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.750 
tool so let me cut another hole here I'm
gonna<00:03:05.870> make<00:03:06.020> a<00:03:06.050> simpler<00:03:06.650> hole<00:03:06.890> I<00:03:07.130> want<00:03:07.670> to

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
gonna make a simpler hole I want to

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.820 
gonna make a simpler hole I want to
leave<00:03:07.880> a<00:03:07.910> single<00:03:08.300> face<00:03:08.480> in<00:03:08.690> this<00:03:08.810> case<00:03:09.050> I'll

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
leave a single face in this case I'll

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.190 
leave a single face in this case I'll
talk<00:03:10.010> about<00:03:10.160> how<00:03:10.220> to<00:03:10.280> fill<00:03:10.550> this<00:03:10.700> one<00:03:10.910> first<00:03:11.209> so

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
talk about how to fill this one first so

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.690 
talk about how to fill this one first so
once<00:03:12.350> you<00:03:12.440> have<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.590> hole<00:03:12.860> in<00:03:12.890> your<00:03:13.069> surface<00:03:13.580> you

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
once you have a hole in your surface you

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.970 
once you have a hole in your surface you
can<00:03:13.790> go<00:03:13.850> up<00:03:13.970> to<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.870> polygons<00:03:15.290> menu<00:03:15.380> set<00:03:15.860> and

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
can go up to the polygons menu set and

go to edit mesh once you're up there you

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.650 
go to edit mesh once you're up there you
can<00:03:18.680> select<00:03:19.100> a<00:03:19.340> pen<00:03:19.550> to<00:03:19.700> polygon<00:03:20.090> tool<00:03:20.390> and

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
mouse pointer becomes a crosshair he

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.360 
mouse pointer becomes a crosshair he
also<00:03:33.680> no<00:03:33.920> said<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.989> border<00:03:35.989> of<00:03:36.170> that<00:03:36.200> hole<00:03:37.010> in

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
also no said the border of that hole in

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:38.740 
also no said the border of that hole in
the<00:03:37.580> surface<00:03:37.760> also<00:03:38.180> becomes<00:03:38.510> a<00:03:38.600> little

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
the surface also becomes a little

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.199 
the surface also becomes a little
heavier<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.350> edges<00:03:39.620> are<00:03:39.769> drawn<00:03:40.010> heavier<00:03:40.459> then

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
heavier the edges are drawn heavier then

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.059 
heavier the edges are drawn heavier then
decay<00:03:41.450> semi<00:03:41.810> recognizes<00:03:42.470> that<00:03:42.590> that's<00:03:42.709> a<00:03:42.890> hole

decay semi recognizes that that's a hole

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.009 
decay semi recognizes that that's a hole
in<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.280> surface<00:03:43.700> and<00:03:43.910> then<00:03:44.630> it<00:03:44.660> might<00:03:44.870> be<00:03:44.989> a

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
in the surface and then it might be a

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.890

can<00:04:04.070> figure<00:04:04.280> out<00:04:04.370> where<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:05.239> new<00:04:05.390> face<00:04:05.660> or

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
can figure out where the new face or

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.010 
can figure out where the new face or
faces<00:04:06.320> go<00:04:06.590> and<00:04:06.980> is<00:04:07.459> able<00:04:07.700> to<00:04:07.850> apply<00:04:08.239> them

faces go and is able to apply them

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.060 
faces go and is able to apply them
so<00:04:10.080> I'm<00:04:10.170> going<00:04:10.290> to<00:04:10.320> take<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.590> suggestion<00:04:11.010> of

corner to the right here I'll click on
that<00:04:15.180> corner

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
that corner

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.140 
that corner
a<00:04:16.900> face<00:04:17.560> gets<00:04:17.829> drawn<00:04:18.100> in<00:04:18.340> so<00:04:18.519> in<00:04:18.579> this<00:04:18.669> case<00:04:18.910> my

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
a face gets drawn in so in this case my

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.180 
a face gets drawn in so in this case my
only<00:04:19.449> needed<00:04:19.780> to<00:04:19.989> have<00:04:20.560> me<00:04:20.709> click<00:04:20.889> on<00:04:21.010> two

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
only needed to have me click on two

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.680 
only needed to have me click on two
corners<00:04:21.669> and<00:04:21.910> it<00:04:22.030> was<00:04:22.120> able<00:04:22.330> to<00:04:22.360> figure<00:04:22.570> out

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
corners and it was able to figure out

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.950 
corners and it was able to figure out
where<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:22.990> face<00:04:23.199> goes<00:04:24.150> now<00:04:25.150> it's<00:04:25.300> pink<00:04:25.479> now<00:04:25.720> so

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
where the face goes now it's pink now so

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.360 
where the face goes now it's pink now so
it's<00:04:26.080> not<00:04:26.169> permanent<00:04:26.500> if<00:04:26.860> I<00:04:27.010> want<00:04:27.190> to<00:04:27.250> make<00:04:27.340> a

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
it's not permanent if I want to make a

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.129 
it's not permanent if I want to make a
permanent<00:04:27.699> I<00:04:27.940> have<00:04:28.120> to<00:04:28.300> hit<00:04:28.479> the<00:04:28.630> enter<00:04:28.780> key<00:04:28.900> on

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
permanent I have to hit the enter key on

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.749 
permanent I have to hit the enter key on
the<00:04:29.410> keyboard

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
the keyboard

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.279 
the keyboard
once<00:04:31.270> to<00:04:31.360> do<00:04:31.479> that<00:04:31.629> the<00:04:31.839> face<00:04:31.990> becomes

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
once to do that the face becomes

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.679 
once to do that the face becomes

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:34.689 
permanent now a new face is not a

permanent now a new face is not a
separate<00:04:35.139> polygon<00:04:35.559> surface<00:04:35.740> it's<00:04:36.069> actually

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
separate polygon surface it's actually

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.610 
separate polygon surface it's actually
integrated<00:04:36.610> into<00:04:37.089> the<00:04:37.180> existing<00:04:37.599> one<00:04:37.779> in<00:04:38.409> fact

integrated into the existing one in fact

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.790 
integrated into the existing one in fact
if<00:04:38.710> you<00:04:38.770> go<00:04:38.889> to<00:04:38.919> a<00:04:39.430> window<00:04:39.699> like<00:04:39.849> the<00:04:40.029> outliner

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.100 

you'll<00:04:43.129> see<00:04:43.370> that<00:04:43.550> indeed<00:04:44.150> I<00:04:44.419> only<00:04:44.569> have<00:04:44.810> one

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
you'll see that indeed I only have one

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.080 
you'll see that indeed I only have one
polygon<00:04:45.590> cylinder<00:04:46.009> surface<00:04:46.220> but<00:04:46.759> I<00:04:46.789> have<00:04:46.909> no

additional polygon surfaces in the scene

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.850 
additional polygon surfaces in the scene
I<00:04:49.280> can<00:04:50.060> tell<00:04:50.210> it<00:04:50.330> because<00:04:50.599> the<00:04:51.110> polygon

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
I can tell it because the polygon

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.230 
I can tell it because the polygon

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
that it's a primitive starts with P so I

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.430 
that it's a primitive starts with P so I
don't<00:04:59.270> see<00:04:59.479> anything<00:04:59.720> else<00:04:59.960> in<00:05:00.139> the<00:05:00.259> scene

don't see anything else in the scene

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.029 
don't see anything else in the scene
right<00:05:00.680> now

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
right now

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:02.740

make<00:05:05.210> a<00:05:05.240> separate<00:05:05.599> surface

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
make a separate surface

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.380 
make a separate surface
so<00:05:08.150> I<00:05:08.180> closed<00:05:08.419> that

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
so I closed that

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.510 
so I closed that
so<00:05:10.600> fill<00:05:10.780> in<00:05:10.930> holes<00:05:11.290> are<00:05:11.590> living<00:05:11.830> more<00:05:11.980> complex

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
so fill in holes are living more complex

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.340 
so fill in holes are living more complex
I'm<00:05:12.850> going<00:05:12.970> to<00:05:13.030> cut<00:05:13.210> another<00:05:13.390> hole<00:05:13.810> here<00:05:13.840> when

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
I'm going to cut another hole here when

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.629 
I'm going to cut another hole here when
I<00:05:14.380> go<00:05:14.590> back<00:05:14.770> to<00:05:14.830> face<00:05:15.160> mode<00:05:16.140> and<00:05:17.140> take<00:05:17.470> a<00:05:17.530> few

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
I go back to face mode and take a few

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.399 
I go back to face mode and take a few
and<00:05:19.759> hit<00:05:19.909> delete<00:05:20.240> and<00:05:20.509> then<00:05:20.990> we'll<00:05:21.110> see<00:05:21.289> if<00:05:21.349> we

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:21.409 
and hit delete and then we'll see if we

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:23.679 
and hit delete and then we'll see if we
can<00:05:21.499> fill<00:05:21.710> this<00:05:21.860> hole<00:05:22.099> in<00:05:22.310> with<00:05:23.240> the<00:05:23.360> append

can fill this hole in with the append

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:25.779 
can fill this hole in with the append
tool<00:05:23.930> might<00:05:24.199> take<00:05:24.349> a<00:05:24.379> few<00:05:24.469> extra<00:05:24.650> steps<00:05:24.919> we

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
tool might take a few extra steps we

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:27.040 
tool might take a few extra steps we
have<00:05:25.849> to<00:05:25.969> make<00:05:26.090> sure<00:05:26.240> the<00:05:26.360> Maya<00:05:26.539> does<00:05:26.719> not<00:05:26.870> get

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
have to make sure the Maya does not get

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.269 
have to make sure the Maya does not get
confused<00:05:27.499> as<00:05:27.680> we<00:05:27.830> do<00:05:27.979> it

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 
existing polygon face now you might just

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:30.260 
existing polygon face now you might just
need<00:06:27.720> to<00:06:27.840> go<00:06:27.930> further<00:06:28.259> along<00:06:28.620> the<00:06:28.830> border<00:06:29.580> in

need to go further along the border in
order<00:06:30.449> for<00:06:30.629> it<00:06:30.720> to<00:06:30.750> sort<00:06:31.259> out<00:06:31.470> where<00:06:31.740> the<00:06:31.860> hole

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:32.009 
order for it to sort out where the hole

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.610 
order for it to sort out where the hole
needs<00:06:32.190> to<00:06:32.400> be<00:06:32.520> filled<00:06:32.940> and<00:06:33.289> for<00:06:34.289> instance<00:06:34.530> in

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
needs to be filled and for instance in

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.200 
needs to be filled and for instance in
my<00:06:34.770> case<00:06:34.800> I<00:06:35.280> haven't<00:06:35.400> filled<00:06:35.639> the<00:06:35.729> hole<00:06:35.909> yet<00:06:36.090> so

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
my case I haven't filled the hole yet so

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.010 
my case I haven't filled the hole yet so
have<00:06:36.300> to<00:06:36.389> keep<00:06:36.539> going

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.990 

and<00:06:40.229> looks<00:06:41.100> like<00:06:41.160> it's<00:06:41.340> I'm<00:06:41.430> pretty<00:06:41.610> good<00:06:41.759> here

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
and looks like it's I'm pretty good here

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.210 
and looks like it's I'm pretty good here
it's<00:06:42.120> able<00:06:42.270> to<00:06:42.389> figure<00:06:42.539> out<00:06:42.780> that<00:06:43.020> sideways<00:06:43.979> t

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 
it's able to figure out that sideways t

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.999 
it's able to figure out that sideways t
shape<00:06:44.550> by<00:06:44.940> just<00:06:45.210> clicking<00:06:45.389> here<00:06:45.810> here<00:06:46.680> all<00:06:46.889> the

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:47.009 
shape by just clicking here here all the

way around each single corner up to here
at<00:06:49.440> that<00:06:49.560> point<00:06:49.620> let's<00:06:50.400> figure<00:06:50.610> it<00:06:50.699> out<00:06:50.789> where

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:50.970 
at that point let's figure it out where

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.480 
at that point let's figure it out where
the<00:06:51.120> hole<00:06:51.509> needs<00:06:51.750> to<00:06:51.840> be<00:06:51.900> filled<00:06:52.229> so<00:06:52.889> if<00:06:53.220> the

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.490 
the hole needs to be filled so if the

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.930 
the hole needs to be filled so if the
hole<00:06:53.699> is<00:06:53.729> filled<00:06:54.030> I<00:06:54.180> can<00:06:54.330> hit<00:06:54.419> enter

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:55.940 
hole is filled I can hit enter

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.440 
hole is filled I can hit enter
and<00:06:56.030> that<00:06:57.020> polygon<00:06:57.470> face<00:06:57.710> is<00:06:57.920> filled<00:06:58.100> in<00:06:58.450> now

00:06:59.440 --> 00:06:59.450 
and that polygon face is filled in now

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.810 
and that polygon face is filled in now
it's<00:06:59.570> a<00:06:59.630> complex<00:07:00.050> face<00:07:00.440> it<00:07:00.740> actually<00:07:01.190> has<00:07:01.400> a

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:01.820 
it's a complex face it actually has a

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.610 
it's a complex face it actually has a
whole<00:07:02.180> number<00:07:02.390> of<00:07:02.570> edges<00:07:02.930> here<00:07:02.960> it's<00:07:03.380> not<00:07:03.590> a

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:03.620 
whole number of edges here it's not a

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.730 
whole number of edges here it's not a
quad<00:07:04.100> and<00:07:04.400> so<00:07:04.490> I<00:07:04.580> try<00:07:05.030> my<00:07:05.780> astronomy<00:07:06.260> a<00:07:06.440> regular

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:06.740 
quad and so I try my astronomy a regular

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.370 
quad and so I try my astronomy a regular
face<00:07:07.010> here<00:07:07.460> now<00:07:08.090> secretly<00:07:08.540> it's<00:07:08.780> divided<00:07:09.350> up

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:09.380 
face here now secretly it's divided up

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.410 
face here now secretly it's divided up
into<00:07:09.560> a<00:07:09.650> bunch<00:07:09.830> triangle<00:07:10.310> so<00:07:10.550> it<00:07:10.700> can<00:07:10.850> compute

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:11.420 
into a bunch triangle so it can compute

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.000 
into a bunch triangle so it can compute
it<00:07:11.570> but<00:07:11.780> just<00:07:12.050> for<00:07:12.170> display<00:07:12.410> you<00:07:12.800> have<00:07:12.980> a

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.010 
it but just for display you have a

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.490 
it but just for display you have a
really<00:07:13.460> odd<00:07:13.880> polygon<00:07:14.660> face<00:07:14.960> with<00:07:15.290> an<00:07:15.410> odd

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:15.500 
really odd polygon face with an odd

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.640 
really odd polygon face with an odd
number<00:07:15.830> of<00:07:15.860> edges<00:07:16.250> now<00:07:17.210> again<00:07:17.540> it's<00:07:18.200> ideal<00:07:18.560> to

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:18.650 
number of edges now again it's ideal to

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.220 
number of edges now again it's ideal to
make<00:07:19.010> your<00:07:19.160> model<00:07:19.520> out<00:07:19.700> of<00:07:19.730> quads<00:07:20.210> or<00:07:20.510> tries<00:07:20.900> or

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:21.230 
make your model out of quads or tries or

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.260 
make your model out of quads or tries or
combination<00:07:21.770> of<00:07:21.890> those<00:07:22.040> and<00:07:22.370> if<00:07:22.940> actually

combination of those and if actually

combination of those and if actually
were<00:07:23.510> to<00:07:23.600> work<00:07:23.720> for<00:07:23.900> a<00:07:23.930> studio<00:07:24.230> they<00:07:24.680> would

were to work for a studio they would
want<00:07:25.010> you<00:07:25.160> to<00:07:25.370> operate<00:07:26.300> in<00:07:26.420> that<00:07:26.510> fashion

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:27.100 
want you to operate in that fashion

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.380 
want you to operate in that fashion
however<00:07:28.100> if<00:07:28.670> you're<00:07:28.850> just<00:07:28.970> working<00:07:29.090> for<00:07:29.270> your

however if you're just working for your

however if you're just working for your
own<00:07:29.480> project<00:07:30.080> or<00:07:30.200> practicing<00:07:30.590> there's<00:07:30.740> no

this you can still texture it it's still

a single polygon surface it's just a

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.950 
a single polygon surface it's just a
little<00:07:37.130> bit<00:07:37.250> unusual<00:07:37.420> now<00:07:38.420> there<00:07:38.570> is<00:07:38.660> a<00:07:38.690> way<00:07:38.900> to

little bit unusual now there is a way to

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.900 
little bit unusual now there is a way to
take<00:07:39.290> this<00:07:39.590> as<00:07:39.890> is<00:07:40.430> and<00:07:40.700> to<00:07:41.630> add<00:07:41.990> additional

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:42.910 
take this as is and to add additional

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:45.670 
take this as is and to add additional
division<00:07:43.910> lines<00:07:44.090> or<00:07:44.330> add<00:07:44.480> additional<00:07:44.680> edges

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 
division lines or add additional edges

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.290 
division lines or add additional edges
to<00:07:45.890> break<00:07:46.070> it<00:07:46.190> up<00:07:46.250> into<00:07:46.400> quads<00:07:46.700> once<00:07:47.030> again

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:47.300 
to break it up into quads once again

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.800 
to break it up into quads once again
we'll<00:07:47.720> talk<00:07:47.840> about<00:07:48.020> that<00:07:48.260> in<00:07:48.320> a<00:07:48.440> later<00:07:48.560> video
