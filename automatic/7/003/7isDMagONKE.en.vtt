for<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.619> do<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.009> same<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.700> key<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:05.939> G

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
for you to do the same in the key of G

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.529 
for you to do the same in the key of G
there's<00:02:07.679> a<00:02:07.770> certain<00:02:08.340> rule<00:02:08.550> we're<00:02:08.849> harmonizing

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
there's a certain rule we're harmonizing

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.759 
there's a certain rule we're harmonizing
the<00:02:09.630> major<00:02:09.840> scale<00:02:10.200> that's<00:02:10.470> what<00:02:10.590> we're<00:02:10.679> gonna

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
the major scale that's what we're gonna

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.370 
the major scale that's what we're gonna
talk<00:02:11.009> about<00:02:11.039> I'm<00:02:11.489> gonna<00:02:11.610> play<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.360> chord<00:02:13.080> for

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
talk about I'm gonna play a chord for

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.080 
talk about I'm gonna play a chord for
every<00:02:13.709> one<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:13.950> these<00:02:14.130> first<00:02:14.430> eighth<00:02:14.760> notes

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
every one of these first eighth notes

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.640 
every one of these first eighth notes
and<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:15.840> would<00:02:15.959> be<00:02:16.019> cool<00:02:16.200> cuz<00:02:16.380> it'll<00:02:16.500> help

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
and this would be cool cuz it'll help

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.320 
and this would be cool cuz it'll help
you<00:02:16.769> practice<00:02:17.190> also<00:02:17.370> name<00:02:17.700> in<00:02:17.819> your<00:02:17.910> notes<00:02:18.090> so

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
you practice also name in your notes so

you practice also name in your notes so
their<00:02:18.870> very<00:02:18.989> first<00:02:19.350> note<00:02:19.830> is<00:02:19.980> obviously<00:02:20.310> gonna

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
their very first note is obviously gonna

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.640 
their very first note is obviously gonna
be<00:02:20.519> a<00:02:20.610> G<00:02:20.819> major<00:02:21.200> right<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:22.470> we're<00:02:22.590> gonna

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
be a G major right so we're gonna

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.090 
be a G major right so we're gonna
outline<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.250> chords<00:02:23.580> one<00:02:24.150> is<00:02:24.330> always<00:02:24.720> major

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
outline the chords one is always major

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.140

relative<00:02:34.620> minor<00:02:35.130> big<00:02:35.430> dude<00:02:35.670> we'll<00:02:35.849> talk<00:02:36.000> about

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
relative minor big dude we'll talk about

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.210 
relative minor big dude we'll talk about
how<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.450> assume<00:02:36.750> we<00:02:36.900> use<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.230> later<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.769> then

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
how to assume we use that later and then

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.670 
how to assume we use that later and then
our<00:02:38.340> last<00:02:38.519> one<00:02:38.700> is<00:02:38.819> diminished<00:02:42.019> theory<00:02:43.019> we<00:02:43.380> can

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
our last one is diminished theory we can

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.280 
our last one is diminished theory we can
mix<00:02:44.010> any<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.640> these<00:02:44.849> together<00:02:45.599> and<00:02:45.989> we're

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
mix any of these together and we're

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.490 
mix any of these together and we're
gonna<00:02:46.349> be<00:02:46.560> able<00:02:46.739> to<00:02:46.860> write<00:02:47.010> us<00:02:47.160> on<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:48.349> can<00:02:49.349> go

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
gonna be able to write us on I can go

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.330 
gonna be able to write us on I can go
from<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.829> G<00:02:50.070> to<00:02:50.280> an<00:02:50.400> email<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:51.650> can<00:02:52.650> go<00:02:52.769> to<00:02:52.829> that<00:02:53.100> B

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
from a G to an email I can go to that B

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.280 
from a G to an email I can go to that B

a<00:02:59.110> little<00:02:59.620> bit<00:02:59.710> easier<00:02:59.740> by<00:03:00.250> understanding

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
a little bit easier by understanding

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.570 
a little bit easier by understanding
port<00:03:01.150> harmony<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:01.990> that's<00:03:02.200> very<00:03:02.440> simple<00:03:02.710> tone

that's the other thing we want to think
about<00:03:05.140> now<00:03:05.260> in<00:03:05.380> a<00:03:05.470> blues-rock<00:03:05.950> setting<00:03:06.310> a<00:03:06.490> lot

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
about now in a blues-rock setting a lot

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.490 
about now in a blues-rock setting a lot
of<00:03:07.000> times<00:03:07.180> you<00:03:07.330> kind<00:03:07.540> of<00:03:07.600> have<00:03:07.810> you<00:03:08.380> know<00:03:08.470> a

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
of times you kind of have you know a

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.120 
of times you kind of have you know a
little<00:03:08.680> bit<00:03:08.800> of<00:03:08.920> a<00:03:08.980> distorted<00:03:09.340> sound<00:03:11.070> kind<00:03:12.070> of

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
little bit of a distorted sound kind of

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.680 
little bit of a distorted sound kind of
a<00:03:12.220> clean<00:03:12.490> sound<00:03:12.760> but<00:03:13.000> either<00:03:13.090> way<00:03:13.300> it's<00:03:13.480> gonna

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
a clean sound but either way it's gonna

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.630 
a clean sound but either way it's gonna
work<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:14.170> serve<00:03:14.350> a<00:03:14.380> strong<00:03:14.680> purpose<00:03:14.950> I<00:03:15.190> like<00:03:15.490> to

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
work to serve a strong purpose I like to

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.540 
work to serve a strong purpose I like to
set<00:03:15.850> mine<00:03:16.030> so<00:03:16.300> it's<00:03:17.020> very<00:03:17.320> you<00:03:18.100> know<00:03:18.220> barely

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
set mine so it's very you know barely

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.860 
set mine so it's very you know barely
distorted<00:03:19.030> I<00:03:19.090> should<00:03:19.240> say<00:03:19.360> and<00:03:19.540> then<00:03:19.600> I<00:03:19.720> turn

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
distorted I should say and then I turn

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.390 
distorted I should say and then I turn
the<00:03:19.990> guitar<00:03:20.110> down<00:03:20.350> and<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.590> cleans<00:03:20.770> up<00:03:20.980> that's

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
the guitar down and it cleans up that's

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.740 
the guitar down and it cleans up that's
the<00:03:21.550> way<00:03:21.640> that<00:03:21.760> I<00:03:21.820> like<00:03:22.030> to<00:03:22.060> set<00:03:22.300> that<00:03:22.420> so<00:03:22.570> if<00:03:22.660> I

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
the way that I like to set that so if I

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.700 
the way that I like to set that so if I
get<00:03:22.810> after<00:03:23.110> it<00:03:24.660> I've<00:03:25.660> got<00:03:25.840> that<00:03:26.050> if<00:03:26.230> I<00:03:26.350> back<00:03:26.560> it

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
get after it I've got that if I back it

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.000 
get after it I've got that if I back it
down<00:03:26.860> just<00:03:27.100> a<00:03:27.130> little<00:03:27.160> bit<00:03:28.650> it's<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:29.770> little<00:03:29.800> bit

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
down just a little bit it's a little bit

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.650 
down just a little bit it's a little bit
cleaner<00:03:30.280> so<00:03:30.760> that's<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.210> tone<00:03:31.390> that<00:03:31.570> I'm

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
cleaner so that's the tone that I'm

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.810 
cleaner so that's the tone that I'm
gonna<00:03:31.780> use<00:03:31.990> to<00:03:32.140> go<00:03:32.230> through<00:03:32.260> this<00:03:32.560> now<00:03:33.370> when<00:03:33.700> it

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
gonna use to go through this now when it

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.400 
gonna use to go through this now when it
