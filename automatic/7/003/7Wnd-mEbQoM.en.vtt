00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
lot of different ways to approach the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.840 
lot of different ways to approach the
missions<00:00:58.199> with<00:00:58.859> our<00:00:59.010> class<00:00:59.219> based<00:00:59.489> system<00:00:59.789> I

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
missions with our class based system I

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
missions with our class based system I
think<00:01:00.030> that's<00:01:00.149> really<00:01:00.270> what<00:01:00.480> sets<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.780> apart

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
think that's really what sets it apart

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.200 
think that's really what sets it apart
from<00:01:01.140> C&amp;C<00:01:01.590> 3<00:01:01.710> where<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.520> really<00:01:02.789> only<00:01:02.940> had

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
from C&amp;C 3 where you really only had

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.119 
from C&amp;C 3 where you really only had
kind<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.629> tank<00:01:03.870> blob<00:01:04.199> gameplay<00:01:04.770> to<00:01:04.979> go

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
kind of the tank blob gameplay to go

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.070 
kind of the tank blob gameplay to go
with<00:01:05.369> another<00:01:06.149> one<00:01:06.300> of<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.479> challenges<00:01:06.960> in

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
with another one of the challenges in

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.270 
with another one of the challenges in

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
you'll have to approach it in a very

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.830 
you'll have to approach it in a very

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.270 
don't want to spoil things but if you
play<00:03:05.720> through<00:03:05.959> both<00:03:06.109> the<00:03:06.230> GDI<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.130> nod

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
play through both the GDI and the nod

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.860 
play through both the GDI and the nod
campaign<00:03:07.819> you're<00:03:08.269> really<00:03:08.540> going<00:03:08.630> to<00:03:08.690> have

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
campaign you're really going to have

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.800 
campaign you're really going to have
that<00:03:09.079> complete<00:03:09.549> answer<00:03:10.549> to<00:03:11.000> what<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.630> whole

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
that complete answer to what the whole

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.700 
that complete answer to what the whole
saga<00:03:12.049> is<00:03:12.319> about

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.500 

so<00:03:16.280> plug<00:03:16.460> progression<00:03:16.940> is<00:03:17.060> one<00:03:17.240> of<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:17.390> really

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
so plug progression is one of the really

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.570 
so plug progression is one of the really
cool<00:03:17.600> things<00:03:17.780> in<00:03:18.200> command<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:18.530> conquer<00:03:18.830> 4<00:03:19.070> so

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
cool things in command and conquer 4 so

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
the single player campaign which is an

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.030 
the single player campaign which is an
especially<00:03:59.750> awesome<00:04:00.170> thing<00:04:00.530> if<00:04:00.710> you're

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
especially awesome thing if you're

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
having trouble with one of the single

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.940 
having trouble with one of the single
player<00:04:02.540> missions<00:04:02.780> you<00:04:03.320> can<00:04:03.470> take<00:04:03.620> it<00:04:03.740> down<00:04:03.770> a

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
player missions you can take it down a

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.740 
player missions you can take it down a
notch<00:04:04.250> and<00:04:04.370> difficulty<00:04:04.910> get<00:04:05.300> some<00:04:05.480> new<00:04:05.570> toys

notch and difficulty get some new toys

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.540 
notch and difficulty get some new toys

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.770 
and then go back and roll over everybody
ultimately<00:04:10.550> I<00:04:10.940> think<00:04:10.970> our<00:04:11.330> single<00:04:11.630> player

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
ultimately I think our single player

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.180 
ultimately I think our single player
missions<00:04:11.960> this<00:04:12.350> time<00:04:12.530> around<00:04:12.650> are<00:04:12.950> going<00:04:13.130> to
