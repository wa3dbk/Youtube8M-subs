disney castle or whatever but we also
have<00:01:37.810> a<00:01:37.840> whole<00:01:38.140> suite<00:01:38.350> of<00:01:38.470> toys<00:01:38.770> that<00:01:39.280> have

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
have a whole suite of toys that have

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.610 
have a whole suite of toys that have
programmable<00:01:40.270> logic<00:01:40.659> to<00:01:40.780> them<00:01:40.960> so<00:01:41.409> you<00:01:41.440> can

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
programmable logic to them so you can

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.840 
programmable logic to them so you can
connect<00:01:41.860> these<00:01:42.010> toys<00:01:42.220> together<00:01:42.580> to<00:01:42.670> create

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
connect these toys together to create

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.280 
connect these toys together to create
behaviors<00:01:43.390> I<00:01:43.479> mean<00:01:43.630> a<00:01:43.690> really<00:01:43.810> simple<00:01:44.200> example

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
behaviors I mean a really simple example

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.560 
behaviors I mean a really simple example
is<00:01:44.800> you<00:01:45.220> can<00:01:45.400> connect<00:01:45.760> a<00:01:45.850> button<00:01:46.120> to<00:01:46.270> a<00:01:46.299> door

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
is you can connect a button to a door

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.640 
is you can connect a button to a door
and<00:01:46.840> you<00:01:46.900> push<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.229> button<00:01:47.260> and<00:01:47.470> the<00:01:47.590> door

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
and you push the button and the door

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.890 
and you push the button and the door
opens<00:01:48.159> and<00:01:48.280> closes<00:01:48.340> right<00:01:48.970> so<00:01:49.450> we<00:01:49.570> have<00:01:49.690> toys

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
opens and closes right so we have toys

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.780 
opens and closes right so we have toys
that<00:01:50.080> do<00:01:50.140> things<00:01:50.320> like<00:01:50.560> spawn<00:01:51.220> enemies<00:01:51.370> and

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
that do things like spawn enemies and

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.460 
that do things like spawn enemies and
keep<00:01:51.909> track<00:01:52.060> of<00:01:52.120> the<00:01:52.299> score<00:01:52.570> and<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:52.840> time<00:01:53.200> let

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
keep track of the score and the time let

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.899 
keep track of the score and the time let
you<00:01:53.530> choose<00:01:53.710> what<00:01:53.830> team<00:01:54.100> you're<00:01:54.280> on<00:01:54.430> or<00:01:54.700> even

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
you choose what team you're on or even

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.399 
you choose what team you're on or even
change<00:01:55.150> the<00:01:55.299> perspective<00:01:55.570> of<00:01:55.900> the<00:01:55.990> game<00:01:56.170> to

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
change the perspective of the game to

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:57.870 
change the perspective of the game to
like<00:01:56.530> a<00:01:56.560> top-down<00:01:56.950> perspective<00:01:57.159> or<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.670> side

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
like a top-down perspective or a side

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.420 
like a top-down perspective or a side
view<00:01:57.909> perspective<00:01:58.330> so<00:01:59.170> using<00:01:59.500> these<00:01:59.619> tools<00:01:59.950> in

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
view perspective so using these tools in

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.190 
view perspective so using these tools in
these<00:02:00.700> advanced<00:02:01.180> ways<00:02:01.330> you<00:02:01.690> can<00:02:01.869> recreate

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
these advanced ways you can recreate

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.680 
these advanced ways you can recreate
retro<00:02:02.590> arcade<00:02:02.770> games<00:02:03.280> we<00:02:03.909> were<00:02:03.970> able<00:02:04.150> rebuilt

what<00:02:26.260> they<00:02:26.379> end<00:02:26.500> up<00:02:26.560> sharing<00:02:26.799> through<00:02:27.129> dizzy

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
what they end up sharing through dizzy
