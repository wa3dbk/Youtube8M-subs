visualizing such a wide range of data
let's<00:05:39.229> look<00:05:39.320> at<00:05:39.470> the<00:05:39.560> measurement<00:05:39.979> tool<00:05:40.360> touch

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
let's look at the measurement tool touch

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.300 
let's look at the measurement tool touch
and<00:05:41.630> drag<00:05:41.900> to<00:05:42.260> position<00:05:42.740> the<00:05:42.860> start<00:05:43.130> of<00:05:43.250> a
