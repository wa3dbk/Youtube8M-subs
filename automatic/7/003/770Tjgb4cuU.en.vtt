00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.600
 days and we'll look at visiting areas so 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.800
 I hope to have more luck in this setting and 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.540

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.850

 we are here the second day of the 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.560
 bet of our second bet and 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.300
 Here I am going to teach you to give to the Greek 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.780
 Market Stall 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.780
 i 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.430

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.680
 the king 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.460
 yes 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:02.260
 at the moment everything is on wheels 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.030
 and nothing every day 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.870
 we will record to see how much I play with 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.909
 this second bet 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.590
 Y 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:14.170
 remember that the before and proposals 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.930
 they all left clear he laid five eggs 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.599
 and so nothing guys 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.150
 nothing else we will see tomorrow students 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.450
 We are here on the third day of 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.450
 breeding 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.080
 this morning we removed him in the third 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.590
 egg got the canary is to say what 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.590
 I can teach 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.400
 so you can see it 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.860
 and I put the third plastic 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.860
 we have you here 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.230
 so you can see 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.069
 it seems that one came out more clearly that is 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.290
 per second 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.989
 and nothing else we are waiting for 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.349
 put the last here the fourth day of the 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.599
 second bet of my canaries and nothing 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.599
 I'm going to teach you in the egg the 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.599
 questionnaire 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.730
 although he tells us he can produce 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.880
 if we remove them we will do a process of 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.460
 we will always put one of plastic 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.680
 and nothing awaits her if tomorrow she puts a 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.079
 fifth egg 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.609
 Well, we will continue to wait and if it does not 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.069
 tomorrow none then we will place everything 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.989
 the truth of them two of them and it's 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.840
 we will remove the plastic ones and then 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.930
 wait a week if they are chopped or 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.930
 do not 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:54.010
 like here the fifth day of the second 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.319
 putting my canaries and nothing we are going to 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.920
 always do the same ritual because 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.350
 teach the egg 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.260
 to see if you can appreciate 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.630
 but you can see 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.600
 if I went there well 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.130
 is a base tone of 2.2 degrees that 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.319
 comes yes that is the last egg of the 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.209
 putting of the fifth 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.739
 is the first bet of point 5 and in 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.650
 this also opposed 5 the truth that the 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.900
 pay you see that it's pretty strong 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.479
 after the first putting so 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.169
 nothing we are going to remove the nest we are going to 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.039
 remove the plastic ones we are going to put 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.729
 all of them that I have here 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.729
 saved 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.320
 It can be seen 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:40.130
 and nothing 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.410
 and already but about six or seven days and the 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.000
 we will look as before 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.200
 we did and sometimes so heavy is yes 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.780

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.410
