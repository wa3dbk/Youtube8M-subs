website<00:00:41.090> actually<00:00:42.090> did<00:00:42.270> two<00:00:42.480> layers<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.870> what

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
website actually did two layers of what

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.000 
website actually did two layers of what
he<00:00:43.320> shows<00:00:43.789> so<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.590> turns<00:00:46.590> into<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.800> nice

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
he shows so that it turns into a nice

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
he shows so that it turns into a nice
cone<00:00:47.250> otherwise<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:47.879> kind<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.559> dish

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
circuit the simple schoolgirl circuit

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.680 
circuit the simple schoolgirl circuit
and<00:00:57.680> it's<00:00:58.680> pretty<00:00:59.489> cool<00:00:59.640> what's<00:00:59.940> going<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.390> I

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
and it's pretty cool what's going on I

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.009 
and it's pretty cool what's going on I
wanted<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.530> show<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.660> what's<00:01:03.660> going<00:01:03.930> on

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
wanted to show you the what's going on

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.899 
wanted to show you the what's going on
on<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.229> scope<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.830> how<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.760> actually

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
on the scope and how it's actually

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.160 
on the scope and how it's actually
charging<00:01:06.570> batteries<00:01:08.540> this<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.720> little<00:01:09.930> jig

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
charging batteries this is a little jig

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.300 
charging batteries this is a little jig
I<00:01:10.290> made<00:01:10.530> for<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.630> for<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.750> guy<00:01:12.960> 24<00:01:13.950> points

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
I made for the for this guy 24 points

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.410 
I made for the for this guy 24 points
evenly<00:01:14.670> spaced<00:01:14.970> 15<00:01:15.840> degrees<00:01:16.170> apart<00:01:17.240> this<00:01:18.240> is

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
evenly spaced 15 degrees apart this is

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.289 
evenly spaced 15 degrees apart this is
the<00:01:18.509> other<00:01:18.630> one<00:01:21.650> 36<00:01:22.650> points<00:01:23.189> but<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.670> skip

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
the other one 36 points but you skip

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.770 
the other one 36 points but you skip
every<00:01:24.540> third<00:01:24.750> one<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:26.180> it's<00:01:27.180> still<00:01:27.420> based<00:01:27.630> on

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
every third one and it's still based on

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.920 
every third one and it's still based on
24<00:01:28.320> points<00:01:29.009> but<00:01:29.159> each<00:01:29.909> separation<00:01:30.509> is<00:01:30.630> 10

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
24 points but each separation is 10

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.990 
24 points but each separation is 10
degrees<00:01:31.640> so<00:01:33.740> that's<00:01:34.740> how<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.360> made<00:01:36.360> those<00:01:36.659> guys

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
degrees so that's how I made those guys

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.300 
degrees so that's how I made those guys
see<00:01:39.259> you<00:01:40.259> know<00:01:40.380> go<00:01:40.560> ahead<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.799> cut<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.159> get

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
this thing set up all right I wanted to

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.080 
this thing set up all right I wanted to
make<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.020> couple<00:01:46.320> men<00:01:46.590> notes<00:01:47.220> before<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.640> started

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
make a couple men notes before I started

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.170 
make a couple men notes before I started
to<00:01:48.180> sing<00:01:48.360> up<00:01:49.070> especially<00:01:50.070> for<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.579> folks<00:01:51.090> who

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.130 
to sing up especially for the folks who
want<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.390> play<00:01:51.509> with<00:01:51.659> Abedini<00:01:52.049> circuit<00:01:54.140> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
want to play with Abedini circuit the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.590 
want to play with Abedini circuit the
normal<00:01:55.500> coil<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:56.070> know<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.939> start<00:01:57.270> you

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
normal coil you know you you start you

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.450 
normal coil you know you you start you
keep<00:01:57.840> winding<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.680> keep<00:01:58.799> winding<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.340> then

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
keep winding and keep winding and then

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.600 
keep winding and keep winding and then
you<00:01:59.640> end<00:02:00.170> and<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.530> consider<00:02:01.890> this<00:02:02.159> beginning

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
you end and you consider this beginning

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.929 
you end and you consider this beginning
in<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.270> end<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.490> deal<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.850> you

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
in the end of the of the deal and you

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.700 
in the end of the of the deal and you
gotta<00:02:06.420> hook<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.840> circuit<00:02:07.170> up<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.530> certain

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
gotta hook the circuit up in a certain

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.809 
gotta hook the circuit up in a certain
way<00:02:08.090> well<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.300> coil

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.699 

because<00:02:12.150> it's<00:02:12.390> by<00:02:12.569> filer<00:02:13.110> wound<00:02:13.319> in<00:02:13.620> the

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
because it's by filer wound in the

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.580 
because it's by filer wound in the
opposite<00:02:14.250> direction<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.269> you<00:02:16.200> got<00:02:16.439> to

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
opposite direction so you got to

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.949 
opposite direction so you got to
actually<00:02:16.739> flip<00:02:17.189> two<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.549> the<00:02:17.640> lead<00:02:17.849> so<00:02:18.209> you<00:02:18.780> got

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
actually flip two of the lead so you got

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.770 
actually flip two of the lead so you got
to<00:02:19.079> basically<00:02:19.200> pair<00:02:19.799> up<00:02:20.090> one<00:02:21.090> of<00:02:21.209> these<00:02:21.359> with

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
to basically pair up one of these with

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.390 
to basically pair up one of these with
one<00:02:21.959> of<00:02:22.079> these<00:02:24.109> so<00:02:25.109> if<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.859> find<00:02:26.069> that<00:02:26.250> you're

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
one of these so if you find that you're

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.970 
one of these so if you find that you're
plugging<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:27.060> in<00:02:27.180> with<00:02:28.079> this<00:02:28.230> coil<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.709> it's

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
plugging it in with this coil and it's

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.720 
plugging it in with this coil and it's
not<00:02:29.129> working

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
not working

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.819 
not working
reverse<00:02:30.629> two<00:02:30.870> of<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.049> leads<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.650> should

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
reverse two of the leads and it should

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.630 
reverse two of the leads and it should
work<00:02:32.599> this<00:02:33.599> guy's<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:34.379> Wow<00:02:35.189> I'm<00:02:35.250> just

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
work this guy's is Wow I'm just

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.259 
work this guy's is Wow I'm just
basically<00:02:36.299> like<00:02:36.599> this<00:02:36.780> one<00:02:37.939> so<00:02:38.939> it<00:02:39.090> has<00:02:39.239> a

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
basically like this one so it has a

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.849 
basically like this one so it has a
beginning<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.810> end<00:02:40.019> and<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.319> didn't<00:02:40.590> have<00:02:40.739> to

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
beginning and end and I didn't have to

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:41.949 
beginning and end and I didn't have to
flip<00:02:41.099> that<00:02:41.400> one

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
flip that one

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.690 
flip that one
yeah<00:02:42.959> we're<00:02:43.500> not<00:02:43.620> running<00:02:43.980> we're<00:02:44.430> not<00:02:44.549> gonna

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
yeah we're not running we're not gonna

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.979 
yeah we're not running we're not gonna
be<00:02:44.819> running<00:02:45.030> this<00:02:45.209> one<00:02:45.420> we're<00:02:45.569> just<00:02:45.599> gonna<00:02:45.810> be

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
be running this one we're just gonna be

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.020 
be running this one we're just gonna be
running<00:02:46.260> this<00:02:46.379> coil<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:47.099> wanted<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.700> make<00:02:47.819> that

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
running this coil so wanted to make that

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:55.520 
running this coil so wanted to make that
note<00:02:48.269> oh<00:02:52.489> and<00:02:53.489> also<00:02:53.609> I'm<00:02:53.939> using<00:02:54.150> about<00:02:54.780> 300

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
note oh and also I'm using about 300

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.580 
note oh and also I'm using about 300
ohms<00:02:55.709> on<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.430> on<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:57.090> circuit<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:58.319> make<00:02:58.470> this

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
ohms on the on the circuit to make this

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.199 
ohms on the on the circuit to make this
thing<00:02:58.799> work<00:02:59.030> and<00:03:00.709> this<00:03:01.709> there's<00:03:02.489> about<00:03:02.700> 180

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
thing work and this there's about 180

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.309 
thing work and this there's about 180
feet<00:03:04.669> 160<00:03:05.669> feet<00:03:06.000> of<00:03:06.150> wire<00:03:06.299> and<00:03:06.540> this<00:03:06.629> one<00:03:06.870> in

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
feet 160 feet of wire and this one in

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.929 
feet 160 feet of wire and this one in
about<00:03:07.590> 220<00:03:08.430> feet<00:03:08.930> in<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:10.169> one<00:03:10.549> and<00:03:11.549> that's

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939 
about 220 feet in that one and that's

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:18.170 
about 220 feet in that one and that's
per<00:03:12.239> wire<00:03:12.450> length<00:03:12.750> so<00:03:13.049> anyway<00:03:13.709> okay<00:03:17.180> alright

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
per wire length so anyway okay alright

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.789 
per wire length so anyway okay alright
and<00:03:18.449> of<00:03:18.690> course<00:03:18.989> here's<00:03:19.379> my<00:03:19.680> little<00:03:21.229> 4b<00:03:22.229> that's

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
and of course here's my little 4b that's

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.699 
and of course here's my little 4b that's
dying<00:03:23.250> on<00:03:23.790> my<00:03:24.030> table<00:03:24.389> it's<00:03:24.930> been<00:03:25.229> here<00:03:25.500> all

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
dying on my table it's been here all

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.119 
dying on my table it's been here all
night<00:03:27.470> for<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.530> little<00:03:28.859> guy

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:36.530 

yeah<00:03:33.979> anyway<00:03:34.979> spin<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.579> little<00:03:35.849> mask<00:03:36.060> out<00:03:36.359> of

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
yeah anyway spin the little mask out of

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.300 
yeah anyway spin the little mask out of
the<00:03:36.629> evening<00:03:37.019> thought<00:03:37.440> I'd<00:03:37.590> share<00:03:37.829> that<00:03:37.889> with

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
the evening thought I'd share that with

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.750 
the evening thought I'd share that with
you<00:03:38.430> yeah<00:03:39.090> alright<00:03:39.959> okay

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.059 

borrow<00:03:45.359> you<00:03:45.569> fire<00:03:45.780> this<00:03:45.930> thing<00:03:45.989> up<00:03:46.349> I<00:03:46.560> wanted

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
borrow you fire this thing up I wanted

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.280 
borrow you fire this thing up I wanted
to<00:03:47.190> do<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.370> comparison<00:03:48.060> for<00:03:48.479> you<00:03:48.510> on<00:03:48.959> the

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
to do a comparison for you on the

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.189 
to do a comparison for you on the
oscilloscope<00:03:49.919> so<00:03:50.430> I'm<00:03:51.209> gonna<00:03:51.359> start<00:03:51.690> this

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
oscilloscope so I'm gonna start this

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:55.119 
oscilloscope so I'm gonna start this
wheel<00:03:52.470> here<00:03:53.389> background

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:55.129 
wheel here background

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:00.229 
wheel here background
step2<00:03:56.129> coiler<00:03:56.430> I<00:03:56.699> got<00:03:56.909> going<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:58.970> want<00:03:59.970> to<00:04:00.060> show

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
step2 coiler I got going I want to show

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:18.590 
step2 coiler I got going I want to show
you<00:04:00.299> the<00:04:00.540> signal<00:04:01.079> it<00:04:01.199> puts<00:04:01.470> out

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.500 

okay<00:04:19.500> so<00:04:19.800> you<00:04:19.860> can<00:04:20.220> see<00:04:20.370> where<00:04:20.610> this<00:04:21.240> will<00:04:21.420> go

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
okay so you can see where this will go

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.750 
okay so you can see where this will go
down<00:04:21.540> to<00:04:21.810> one<00:04:22.020> spike<00:04:22.350> we're<00:04:23.190> basically<00:04:23.460> on<00:04:23.580> the

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
down to one spike we're basically on the

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.040 
down to one spike we're basically on the
five<00:04:24.210> Miller<00:04:24.560> second<00:04:25.560> scale<00:04:26.100> right<00:04:26.430> there<00:04:27.050> and

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
five Miller second scale right there and

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.580 
five Miller second scale right there and
that's<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.920> big<00:04:29.190> wheel<00:04:29.400> in<00:04:29.760> the<00:04:30.030> back<00:04:30.590> back

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
that's the big wheel in the back back

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:39.230 
that's the big wheel in the back back
there<00:04:31.650> that<00:04:32.490> dude<00:04:33.230> that's<00:04:34.230> signal<00:04:36.320> now<00:04:38.240> I'm

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
there that dude that's signal now I'm

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.390 
there that dude that's signal now I'm
going<00:04:39.450> to<00:04:39.510> turn<00:04:39.830> turn<00:04:40.830> it<00:04:41.010> to<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:41.250> other

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
going to turn turn it to the other

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.280 
going to turn turn it to the other
channel<00:04:41.730> and<00:04:42.120> turn<00:04:42.330> this<00:04:43.400> guy<00:04:44.400> on<00:04:44.900> back<00:04:45.900> up<00:04:46.140> so

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
channel and turn this guy on back up so

00:04:46.290 --> 00:05:02.120 
channel and turn this guy on back up so
you<00:04:46.350> can<00:04:48.230> meters<00:04:49.230> here<00:04:52.340> okay

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.860 

so<00:05:02.790> you<00:05:03.390> can<00:05:03.510> see<00:05:03.750> that<00:05:05.000> are<00:05:06.000> drawn<00:05:06.240> about

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
so you can see that are drawn about

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.010 
so you can see that are drawn about
their<00:05:07.710> you<00:05:08.040> know<00:05:08.070> 400<00:05:08.850> milliamps<00:05:09.120> is<00:05:09.660> the<00:05:09.810> draw

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
their you know 400 milliamps is the draw

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:16.120 
their you know 400 milliamps is the draw
and<00:05:10.940> power<00:05:11.940> is<00:05:12.150> going<00:05:12.360> into<00:05:13.020> the<00:05:13.200> battery<00:05:14.870> and

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
and power is going into the battery and

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.930 
and power is going into the battery and
here's<00:05:17.130> the<00:05:17.370> stigma<00:05:17.850> on<00:05:18.120> that<00:05:18.390> one<00:05:19.820> so<00:05:20.820> it

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
here's the stigma on that one so it

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.790 
here's the stigma on that one so it
looks<00:05:21.090> like<00:05:21.180> this<00:05:21.480> some<00:05:21.690> lines<00:05:21.930> right<00:05:22.410> but

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
looks like this some lines right but

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.440 
looks like this some lines right but
when<00:05:23.790> we<00:05:23.910> zoom<00:05:24.120> in<00:05:24.360> here<00:05:25.880> start<00:05:26.880> seeing<00:05:27.270> that

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
when we zoom in here start seeing that

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.900 
when we zoom in here start seeing that
same<00:05:28.320> H<00:05:28.740> wave<00:05:29.780> that<00:05:30.780> we're<00:05:30.960> looking<00:05:31.230> for<00:05:31.910> you

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
same H wave that we're looking for you

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:39.280 
same H wave that we're looking for you
can<00:05:33.030> see<00:05:33.210> we're<00:05:33.390> getting<00:05:33.770> in<00:05:34.770> about<00:05:35.040> a<00:05:35.070> 50<00:05:36.470> 55

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
can see we're getting in about a 50 55

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:46.720 
can see we're getting in about a 50 55
10<00:05:40.290> 20<00:05:40.800> 30<00:05:41.010> 40<00:05:41.370> 50<00:05:41.520> about<00:05:42.180> 55<00:05:42.660> volts<00:05:42.990> spikes<00:05:43.850> and

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
10 20 30 40 50 about 55 volts spikes and

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.970 
10 20 30 40 50 about 55 volts spikes and
now<00:05:47.730> I'm<00:05:48.090> going<00:05:48.330> to<00:05:48.390> combine<00:05:48.840> the<00:05:49.290> two<00:05:49.320> signals

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
now I'm going to combine the two signals

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:57.370 
now I'm going to combine the two signals
so<00:05:50.100> you<00:05:50.220> can<00:05:50.370> see<00:05:51.300> the<00:05:51.420> difference<00:05:53.930> you<00:05:54.930> know

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.610 

just<00:05:58.380> to<00:05:58.500> show<00:05:58.710> you<00:05:58.770> the<00:05:58.980> frequency

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
just to show you the frequency

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.590 
just to show you the frequency
comparatively<00:06:01.620> I<00:06:01.680> mean<00:06:01.920> this<00:06:02.070> this<00:06:03.030> coil<00:06:03.360> is

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
comparatively I mean this this coil is

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.140 
comparatively I mean this this coil is
just<00:06:03.780> slamming<00:06:04.200> by<00:06:04.790> whereas<00:06:05.790> here<00:06:08.030> you<00:06:09.030> know

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
just slamming by whereas here you know

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.950 
just slamming by whereas here you know
there's<00:06:09.810> there's<00:06:10.320> the<00:06:10.500> scale<00:06:10.770> difference<00:06:11.190> so

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
there's there's the scale difference so

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:19.960 
there's there's the scale difference so
this<00:06:12.960> court<00:06:13.230> really<00:06:13.590> goes<00:06:14.220> fast<00:06:14.610> I<00:06:15.120> must<00:06:15.360> say

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.500 

zoom<00:06:20.970> way<00:06:21.240> in<00:06:21.270> here<00:06:21.600> I<00:06:21.630> don't<00:06:21.780> know<00:06:23.300> you<00:06:24.300> can

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
zoom way in here I don't know you can

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.670 
zoom way in here I don't know you can
see<00:06:24.780> this<00:06:24.990> well<00:06:25.290> or<00:06:25.530> not<00:06:25.770> but<00:06:26.070> just<00:06:27.500> quite<00:06:28.500> the

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
see this well or not but just quite the

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:40.040 
see this well or not but just quite the
crazy<00:06:29.100> wave

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.230 

so<00:06:40.620> you<00:06:40.710> can<00:06:40.830> see<00:06:40.950> it's<00:06:41.130> just<00:06:41.310> just<00:06:41.730> be<00:06:42.090> do<00:06:42.210> be

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 
do do bouncing and then you know even an

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.250 
do do bouncing and then you know even an
out<00:06:47.430> so<00:06:47.730> it's<00:06:47.880> really<00:06:47.970> swinging<00:06:48.840> right<00:06:49.110> in

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:49.260 
out so it's really swinging right in

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220 
set up it's just this coil sitting here

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.490 
set up it's just this coil sitting here
self<00:07:02.700> oscillating<00:07:03.920> no<00:07:04.920> magnets<00:07:05.370> required<00:07:06.500> and
