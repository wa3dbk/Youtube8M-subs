00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.350 
dry add a little bit of water you're
gonna<00:03:07.130> do<00:03:07.280> that<00:03:07.400> until<00:03:07.790> you<00:03:07.850> get<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.210> right

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
gonna do that until you get the right

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.350 

so<00:03:16.610> once<00:03:16.790> you<00:03:16.879> get<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.090> right<00:03:17.239> consistency

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
okay so I use measuring cups but if you

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:26.990 
okay so I use measuring cups but if you
have<00:03:25.830> cookie<00:03:26.099> cutters<00:03:26.400> they<00:03:26.580> work<00:03:26.730> even

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
have cookie cutters they work even

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.690

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
after we pinch the ends we're gonna use

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.699
