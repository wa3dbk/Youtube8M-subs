of<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.719> most<00:00:45.960> impressive<00:00:46.350> servos<00:00:47.420> available

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
of the most impressive servos available

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.340 
of the most impressive servos available
on<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.719> market

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
on the market

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.670 
on the market
so<00:00:49.950> we'll<00:00:50.610> do<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:51.930> fired<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.379> up<00:00:52.440> not

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
so we'll do is I just fired it up not

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.069 
so we'll do is I just fired it up not
too<00:00:52.860> long<00:00:53.039> ago<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:53.820> should<00:00:54.629> still<00:00:54.930> be

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
too long ago so it's should still be

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.000 
too long ago so it's should still be
fired<00:00:55.559> up<00:00:55.710> ready<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.980> go

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.400 

so

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
it has just an immediate response to the

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.820 
it has just an immediate response to the
torque<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:21.580> just<00:01:22.119> incredible<00:01:22.720> off<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:23.619> line

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
torque it's just incredible off the line

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.330 
torque it's just incredible off the line
you<00:01:24.190> can<00:01:24.430> see<00:01:25.260> you<00:01:26.260> can<00:01:26.410> see<00:01:26.650> it<00:01:26.860> just

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.039 

it<00:01:30.340> just<00:01:30.520> jumps<00:01:31.000> and<00:01:31.149> so<00:01:31.299> this<00:01:31.509> is<00:01:31.689> actually

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
it just jumps and so this is actually

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.190 
it just jumps and so this is actually
still<00:01:32.229> using<00:01:32.619> the<00:01:32.710> 8,000<00:01:33.250> rpm<00:01:33.609> high<00:01:34.149> response

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
still using the 8,000 rpm high response

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.390 
still using the 8,000 rpm high response
chun-hyang<00:01:36.159> clutch

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400

so what's a great it's a great
performing<00:01:56.150> engine<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:59.030> power<00:01:59.240> bands<00:01:59.570> really

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
performing engine the power bands really

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.680 
performing engine the power bands really
linear<00:02:00.229> with<00:02:00.620> the<00:02:00.710> tune<00:02:00.890> pipe<00:02:01.360> it<00:02:02.360> just<00:02:02.510> really

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
linear with the tune pipe it just really

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.340 
linear with the tune pipe it just really
goes<00:02:02.900> to<00:02:03.110> show<00:02:03.320> how<00:02:04.240> versatile<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.450> Dominator

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
goes to show how versatile the Dominator

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.800 
goes to show how versatile the Dominator
is<00:02:06.560> for<00:02:06.800> the<00:02:06.860> low<00:02:07.010> c5

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
is for the low c5

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.570 
is for the low c5
it<00:02:08.810> just<00:02:09.020> works<00:02:09.259> with<00:02:09.470> works<00:02:10.070> well<00:02:10.310> with<00:02:10.490> the

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
it just works with works well with the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.850 
it just works with works well with the
stock<00:02:10.850> engine<00:02:11.360> works<00:02:11.600> well<00:02:11.870> with<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.260> Noah<00:02:12.410> G

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
stock engine works well with the Noah G

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.910 
stock engine works well with the Noah G
to<00:02:13.010> 90s<00:02:13.570> so

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.190 

I'm<00:02:18.760> pretty<00:02:19.090> confident<00:02:19.660> that<00:02:19.840> if<00:02:19.960> we<00:02:19.990> had<00:02:20.170> a

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
I'm pretty confident that if we had a

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.840 
I'm pretty confident that if we had a
centered<00:02:20.620> if<00:02:20.770> Locker<00:02:21.100> in<00:02:21.340> here<00:02:21.490> that<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.730> would

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
centered if Locker in here that it would

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:29.090 
centered if Locker in here that it would
probably<00:02:22.090> do<00:02:22.540> wheelies

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:36.710
