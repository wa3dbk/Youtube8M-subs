and I had started out with this and it's

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.609 
and I had started out with this and it's
so<00:00:14.849> crazy<00:00:15.150> how<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.509> can<00:00:15.780> move<00:00:15.929> your<00:00:15.990> sliders

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
little bit too difficult so you can

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.990 
little bit too difficult so you can
adjust<00:00:22.289> them<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.430> how<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.550> started
