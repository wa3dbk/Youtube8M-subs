after several hours of trying and

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.230 
after several hours of trying and
searching<00:00:15.570> through<00:00:15.949> post<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:17.369> think<00:00:17.670> we<00:00:18.090> would

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
searching through post I think we would

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.740 
searching through post I think we would
finally<00:00:18.660> come<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.500> solution<00:00:19.830> we<00:00:20.760> done<00:00:21.630> the

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
finally come to the solution we done the

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.679 
finally come to the solution we done the
repair<00:00:22.109> on<00:00:22.380> one<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.369> our<00:00:23.550> two<00:00:23.760> car<00:00:24.029> seats<00:00:24.060> so

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
let's see if I can complete it on par

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.840 
let's see if I can complete it on par
seat<00:00:28.650> number<00:00:28.890> two<00:00:30.590> the<00:00:31.590> we<00:00:32.160> took<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.430> one<00:00:32.669> hand

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
seat number two the we took a one hand

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.770 
seat number two the we took a one hand
hit<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.090> back<00:00:33.270> off<00:00:33.540> from<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:35.600> I'm<00:00:36.600> going

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
hit the back off from this and I'm going

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.389 
hit the back off from this and I'm going
to<00:00:36.809> take<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.200> part<00:00:37.530> off<00:00:37.770> just<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.219> make<00:00:38.250> it

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
to take this part off just to make it

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.910 
to take this part off just to make it
easier<00:00:40.129> the<00:00:41.129> best<00:00:41.430> suggestion<00:00:42.390> we<00:00:42.540> found<00:00:42.920> was

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
easier the best suggestion we found was

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.850 
easier the best suggestion we found was
to<00:00:45.559> switch<00:00:46.700> take<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.870> I'm<00:00:49.559> going<00:00:49.739> to

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
to switch take this and I'm going to

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.709 
to switch take this and I'm going to
flip<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.160> upside<00:00:50.250> down<00:00:50.520> but<00:00:50.910> take<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.420> part

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
flip it upside down but take this part

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.910 
flip it upside down but take this part
of<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.870> car<00:00:52.770> seat<00:00:53.129> buckle<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.059> pull<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.410> tight

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
of the car seat buckle and pull it tight

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.979 
of the car seat buckle and pull it tight
so<00:00:56.190> you'll<00:00:56.430> like<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.820> one<00:00:56.879> hand<00:00:57.360> down<00:00:57.570> here

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
so you'll like this one hand down here

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.180 
so you'll like this one hand down here
tot<00:00:59.629> move<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:00.840> black<00:01:01.109> strap<00:01:01.590> out<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.980> way

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
tot move this black strap out of the way

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.520 
tot move this black strap out of the way
as<00:01:02.370> much<00:01:02.399> as<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.760> can<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:04.019> team<00:01:04.290> it

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
as much as you can and this team it

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.080 
as much as you can and this team it
seems<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.860> be<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.129> secrets<00:01:05.549> are<00:01:05.729> getting<00:01:06.000> it

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
seems to be the secrets are getting it

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.710 
seems to be the secrets are getting it
really<00:01:06.450> taught<00:01:07.549> turn<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.729> buckle<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.180> put<00:01:09.630> it

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
really taught turn the buckle and put it

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.130 
really taught turn the buckle and put it
through<00:01:09.840> only<00:01:10.409> as<00:01:10.590> much<00:01:10.920> as<00:01:11.420> it<00:01:12.420> will<00:01:12.750> barely

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
through only as much as it will barely

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.200 
through only as much as it will barely
fit<00:01:13.560> because<00:01:13.920> if<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.189> try<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.490> turn<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.000> all

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
fit because if you try and turn it all

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.060 
fit because if you try and turn it all
the<00:01:15.240> way<00:01:15.420> sideways<00:01:16.110> you'll<00:01:16.380> never<00:01:16.680> get<00:01:16.920> done

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
the way sideways you'll never get done

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.050 
the way sideways you'll never get done
with<00:01:17.340> us<00:01:17.840> so<00:01:18.840> we'll<00:01:19.650> see<00:01:20.869> still<00:01:22.670> not<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
with us so we'll see still not the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.080 
with us so we'll see still not the
easiest<00:01:24.390> thing<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.960> earth<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.590> do<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:26.729> think

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
easiest thing on earth to do you think

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.230 
easiest thing on earth to do you think
that<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:28.710> high<00:01:28.890> paid<00:01:29.250> engineers<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.060> work

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
that the high paid engineers that work

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.920 
that the high paid engineers that work
for<00:01:30.479> Graco's<00:01:32.720> an<00:01:33.920> easier<00:01:34.920> solution<00:01:35.130> for<00:01:35.700> this

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
for Graco's an easier solution for this

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.200 
for Graco's an easier solution for this
but<00:01:36.930> I'm<00:01:37.200> pulling<00:01:37.890> down<00:01:38.220> on<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.579> strap<00:01:38.850> on<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
but I'm pulling down on the strap on the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:50.399 
but I'm pulling down on the strap on the
bottom<00:01:40.759> and

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.410 

but<00:01:51.409> it<00:01:51.530> popped<00:01:51.800> out<00:01:52.040> so<00:01:53.890> to<00:01:54.890> fix<00:01:55.580> it<00:01:55.850> likely

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
but it popped out so to fix it likely

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.149 
but it popped out so to fix it likely
much<00:01:56.780> easier<00:01:57.200> always<00:01:57.560> make<00:01:57.740> sure<00:01:57.770> that<00:01:57.950> the

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
much easier always make sure that the

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.910 
much easier always make sure that the
strap<00:01:58.520> is<00:01:58.700> pointed<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.180> right<00:01:59.360> direction<00:01:59.920> put

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
strap is pointed the right direction put

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.520 
strap is pointed the right direction put
it<00:02:01.010> back<00:02:01.159> in<00:02:01.490> again<00:02:01.909> kind<00:02:02.540> of<00:02:02.570> keep<00:02:02.780> it<00:02:02.930> taut<00:02:03.229> as

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
it back in again kind of keep it taut as

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.730 
it back in again kind of keep it taut as
much<00:02:03.740> as<00:02:03.890> possible<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:05.810> then<00:02:06.200> push<00:02:07.869> in<00:02:08.869> double

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
much as possible and then push in double

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.550 
much as possible and then push in double
check<00:02:09.979> it's<00:02:10.580> in<00:02:10.820> place<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:12.020> you<00:02:12.110> put<00:02:12.320> the<00:02:12.410> car

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
check it's in place and you put the car

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.800 
check it's in place and you put the car
seat<00:02:12.590> back<00:02:12.980> together<00:02:13.190> so<00:02:14.150> that's<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.450> biggest

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
seat back together so that's the biggest

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.900 
seat back together so that's the biggest
secret<00:02:15.170> on<00:02:15.320> this<00:02:15.800> end<00:02:16.070> make<00:02:16.280> sure<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:16.580> keep<00:02:16.730> it

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
secret on this end make sure to keep it

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.690 
secret on this end make sure to keep it
taut<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.600> only<00:02:18.500> put<00:02:18.739> as<00:02:18.920> much<00:02:19.100> of<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.340> metal

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
taut and only put as much of the metal

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.330 
taut and only put as much of the metal
to<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:19.970> side<00:02:20.209> as<00:02:20.569> barely<00:02:21.470> necessary<00:02:22.100> to<00:02:22.220> get

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
to the side as barely necessary to get

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.860 
to the side as barely necessary to get
it<00:02:22.459> through<00:02:22.730> if<00:02:22.940> not<00:02:23.239> you're<00:02:23.450> going<00:02:23.570> to<00:02:23.630> end<00:02:23.750> up
