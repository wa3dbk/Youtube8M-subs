00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
game which at that logic it probably

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.870

that we built any of this starting to

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.420 
that we built any of this starting to
look<00:03:07.060> familiar<00:03:07.800> it's<00:03:08.800> great<00:03:09.010> looking<00:03:09.250> at<00:03:09.340> it

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
look familiar it's great looking at it

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.550

you can do is go to your segments we're

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.140 
you can do is go to your segments we're
in<00:04:10.930> hangar<00:04:11.230> bay<00:04:11.380> so<00:04:11.440> pick<00:04:12.220> hangar<00:04:12.640> up<00:04:12.850> and<00:04:13.090> uh

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
in hangar bay so pick hangar up and uh

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.250 
in hangar bay so pick hangar up and uh
pick<00:04:13.990> hangar<00:04:14.290> bay<00:04:14.410> ceiling<00:04:15.010> and<00:04:15.959> we<00:04:16.959> are<00:04:17.049> going

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.939 

okay<00:04:25.400> and<00:04:26.139> then<00:04:27.139> the<00:04:27.289> same<00:04:27.530> thing<00:04:27.740> for<00:04:27.889> the

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949 
okay and then the same thing for the

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:42.559 
okay and then the same thing for the
control<00:04:28.280> room

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:42.569 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:47.059 

all<00:04:43.289> right<00:04:43.879> and<00:04:44.879> what<00:04:45.119> this<00:04:45.270> does<00:04:45.569> it<00:04:45.990> kind<00:04:46.919> of

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.069 
all right and what this does it kind of

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:49.129 
all right and what this does it kind of
saves<00:04:47.369> memory<00:04:47.849> if<00:04:48.089> something's<00:04:48.629> not<00:04:48.839> being

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
saves memory if something's not being

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.089 
saves memory if something's not being
used<00:04:49.409> it<00:04:50.029> should<00:04:51.029> need<00:04:51.419> to<00:04:51.449> be<00:04:51.719> wasted<00:04:52.589> on<00:04:52.740> on

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
used it should need to be wasted on on

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:55.189 
used it should need to be wasted on on
computer<00:04:53.819> processing<00:04:54.360> and<00:04:54.509> memory<00:04:54.629> again<00:04:54.959> and

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
computer processing and memory again and

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:02.239 
computer processing and memory again and
whatnot<00:04:57.229> so<00:04:58.490> so<00:04:59.490> yeah<00:04:59.849> and<00:05:00.800> then<00:05:01.800> to<00:05:01.919> go<00:05:02.009> down<00:05:02.219> a

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:02.249 
whatnot so so yeah and then to go down a

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:07.369 
whatnot so so yeah and then to go down a
level<00:05:02.490> you<00:05:02.729> hit<00:05:02.849> the<00:05:02.969> minus<00:05:03.300> key<00:05:04.490> and<00:05:06.080> you<00:05:07.080> saw

00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:07.379 
level you hit the minus key and you saw

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:10.790 
level you hit the minus key and you saw
how<00:05:07.589> the<00:05:07.649> game<00:05:07.949> looks<00:05:07.979> and<00:05:08.490> in<00:05:08.819> real<00:05:09.059> life<00:05:09.800> all

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
how the game looks and in real life all

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.199
