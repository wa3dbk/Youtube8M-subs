00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
I was really really wicked yeah now I

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.490 
I was really really wicked yeah now I
know<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.890> all<00:02:20.600> had<00:02:21.600> not<00:02:21.810> had<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.170> lot<00:02:22.440> of

acting<00:02:22.860> experience<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.760> guess<00:02:23.820> Rupert<00:02:24.330> had<00:02:24.450> a

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
acting experience I guess Rupert had a

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.300 
acting experience I guess Rupert had a
little<00:02:24.690> more<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.110> new<00:02:25.380> mo<00:02:25.650> when<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.070> got

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
these roles and it was probably a little

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.390 
these roles and it was probably a little
intimidating<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.470> work<00:02:31.680> with<00:02:31.950> someone<00:02:32.250> like
