it<00:03:38.910> was<00:03:39.060> time<00:03:39.270> to<00:03:39.570> move<00:03:39.660> on<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.020> torque<00:03:40.260> arm

it was time to move on to the torque arm

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.600 
it was time to move on to the torque arm
okay<00:03:41.610> now<00:03:41.790> this<00:03:42.180> is<00:03:42.480> really<00:03:43.140> cool<00:03:43.440> Moser<00:03:44.040> added

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
okay now this is really cool Moser added
