00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 at the time pruzzo to castiglioncello ai 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.649
 bmw awards a lifetime achievement award a 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.540
 special prize your career 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.940
 studded with successes that has been missed 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.019
 something or you're satisfied anyway 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.660
 one hundred percent 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.619
 retracing his career I am not 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.580
 happy with what i did i don't have 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:27.449
 regrets I decided to stop when 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.310
 I wanted to play in three teams 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.410
 that's enough because I decided to just search 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.840
 in three teams for which I did that 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.880
 I wanted to do and we talk to you a little 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.160
 of the two former teams the rome how it is 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.079
 born in your opinion there has been some 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.200
 however, the initial blow is always the 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.640
 search for a striker in Rome 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.399
 I think he has to take a champion 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.820
 forward if you can take a 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.539
 player who can be followed by 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.900
 what unfortunately will no longer be totti 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:59.690
 I think he can win right now 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.360
 the championship if however continues to 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.170
 take good players 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.690
 but not of that level that I say 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.100
 the juventus will always arrive in front 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.190
 missing you would have taken then it is finished at 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.190
 milan 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.400
 thank goodness the Milan is over in the 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:23.180
 meaning you are forced to take one 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.060
 stronger and then and then yes 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.150
 even the jackson names thin 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.630
 mornings it went jacko I do not know I have 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.670
 there is no more berry then you have to take 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.229
 a stronger one I could not indicate that a 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.110
 unless you can get to 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:45.350
 ibrahimovic I live my dream o 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.500
 they played or van basten you go with van 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.500
 persie 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.370
 it seems he must go and bother these 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.160
 players here if you really want to do 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.229
 a leap forward otherwise I do not say 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.000
 that one is worth the other but more or less 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.760
 I release laces you would have left 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.800
 leaving above all those figures is a 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.920
 good bertolacci player who did 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.619
 great season but if sabatini is 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.789
 managed to revenge 20 million did 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.170
 definitely a great deal 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.170
 you like falquÃ© 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.270
 marassi but the effect must always weigh 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.580
 be careful though I have to say that 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.880
 which did very well but I go the 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.770
 carnet genova not only are not rome 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.770
 but it's a good buy
