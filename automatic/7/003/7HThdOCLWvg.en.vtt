orbiting<00:02:18.160> fire<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:21.640> gift<00:02:22.640> entire<00:02:23.209> server<00:02:23.630> so<00:02:24.380> I

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
orbiting fire a gift entire server so I

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.350 
orbiting fire a gift entire server so I
guess<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:24.709> can<00:02:24.890> gift<00:02:25.190> crates<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:26.060> entire

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
guess I can gift crates the entire
