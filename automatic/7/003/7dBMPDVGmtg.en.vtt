00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.610
 hello youtube friends today we go with a 

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.210
 video of how to tame or take 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.210
 hamster 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:16.179
 first before adopting it or buying it 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:20.739
 they have to know what reason 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:24.369
 there are two tips very much but I do not 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:26.979
 I know a lot about races but the only ones 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.590
 three I know and that I know how they are 

00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:32.550
 version 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:36.150
 the Chinese hamster is one of the most 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.370
 difficult to tame tame as 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.230
 when they are unconscious safe with 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.730
 a person bite 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.730
 after being Russian 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.560
 what 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.400
 well it did not cost me so much it bit me 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.399
 two or three times 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:05.019
 at the beginning and I long ago I have 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:05.019
 because the cage was eating 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:13.060
 then good after the Russian is a 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:16.540
 cancer that in my case not 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.540
 the humanists 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:25.550
 we do not leave very well is something 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.550
 good as you can fall in love 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:34.750
 then there is the golden site 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:39.800
 which is a week I recommend that they are the 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:42.770
 more docile and good are the lares 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.230
 then in the first week that you have 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.940
 a hamster it is advisable to leave the 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.460
 cage do not touch it 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.950
 do not take it out so you get used to it 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.829
 ambient 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.829
 since good the mind very very different 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.720
 the atmosphere of your house the cage the 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.680
 that you have in the chest of an area or where 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.000
 you bought it 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.230
 it's very different 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.030
 and then better to leave it so that 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.420
 good yes 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.390
 get used to the new bar 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.480
 I mean the second week you're going to 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.670
 to be able to get the most 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.980
 because they will be more fortunate and the 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.980
 they dressed in their hands 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.480
 they are accustomed to abounding everything that 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:40.629
 they want so you have to get used to 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.000
 everything I know that you like 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.340
 stop what you do not want what you want 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.879
 touch 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.630
 but if I have to take dawn or something 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:55.620
 some we will use gloves before 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.720
 I do not know I do not know before but good ones 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.520
 gloves but they are not the wool threads 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.890
 they can be very helpful as they are 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.910
 You can hook the nail so it's better 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:09.080
 another another glove case but they are 11 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.370
 gloves so I do not know very well 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.040
 after 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.819
 good if it gets scary where you get gloves and 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.849
 has that autologous stitching do not touch 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.890
 and you have to reward it 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:26.099
 once afterwards there is that first with 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:30.120
 some candy crisis what you have or 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:32.280
 directly with the diabladas 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.879
 I recommend you do this little game 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.709
 of the hands that at the beginning is very 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:41.790
 unsure they might have but for 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:45.180
 more that it bites you to be moved all the 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.000
 side that by June whatever you do not say 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.510
 never fall because after 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:57.349
 street crisis 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:57.349
 obviously it's going to have to fall 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.629
 you do not have to leave it, leave it after 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:13.780
 to see accustomed to what I do is 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:16.500
 put the hand that are come 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.500
 but good 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:23.750
 just that I recommend this to you so 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.750
 bye
