00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.570
 are looking for great 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.550
 Attractions 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.009
 one of them is located entirely in the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.410
 near the stadium of the fc red bull 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.780
 salzburg the westphalian leaf roger 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.969
 schmidt former player and coach 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.610
 the sc paderborn at his new 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.399
 visited in Austria and 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.410
 because asked what the 47 year old 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.989
 actually done by his 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.149
 holds former clubs and then on the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.920
 third table place is even still 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.890
 contact to the first has is 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.239
 of course a great performance and and 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.039
 the team has earned 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.930
 maybe something else right now 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.539
 difficult start to each other 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.299
 I think the transfers are good 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.950
 brought young players and he is wide 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.780
 also very well placed and who has 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.040
 now won a lot of games 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.750
 also rightly won the team 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.210
 has many weapons in the game forward 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.520
 defensive is stable 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.009
 unfortunately not a game since I left 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.049
 I'm in the stadium but I saw it live 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.720
 I am very happy about it and hope 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.580
 of course, that make it this time 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.400
 olga schmidt did it too 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.740
 his team picked up only 28 games 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.820
 the fifth master title of the 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.850
 club history 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.979
 the masterpiece already in the 28 round 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.650
 is new league record in the 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.869
 alps republic knows this achievement too 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.759
 Sports Director Ralf Rangnick appreciated 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.180
 which expresses itself as follows over the 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.680
 former paderborn from the beginning 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.950
 believe here is very clear 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.610
 that he is a trainer 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.320
 has seduced high empathy and 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.149
 also about very big emotional 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.189
 intelligence has a very good one 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.450
 ratio already in paderborn to his 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.039
 I knew that too 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.450
 because of one or the other 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.869
 talk with a former player 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.429
 from him and in paderborn and that has 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.989
 confirmed here from the beginning 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.849
 he really has a kind with the 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.470
 to handle players so that they do 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.970
 feel that he is right about you 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.730
 cares for her and cares 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.709
 that should be synonymous before high binding 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.410
 also personal bond between him 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.060
 and the team and has become now 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.040
 certainly with us now again in the 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.450
 last one and a half years in all 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.209
 other areas once again enormously 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.680
 The rhetoric has evolved as well 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.180
 a good approach to dealing with 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.099
 the media is concerned nowadays 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.690
 also not unimportant and im 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.280
 tactical area I have to say 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.840
 we are now once again enormously 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.040
 ours is also developing forward 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.920
 game against the ball is now 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.200
 really become a real weapon 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.760
 and do all these points together 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.890
 they are really one of them 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.030
 from my point of view most interesting yet 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.390
 younger trainer we in Germany 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.390
 to have
