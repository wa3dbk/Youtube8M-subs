because I actually even though I don't

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.849 
because I actually even though I don't
really<00:01:00.359> like<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.930> idea<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.350> them<00:01:01.590> being

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
really like the idea of them being

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.500 
really like the idea of them being
sneaky<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.760> horrid<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.210> putting<00:01:03.420> in

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
sneaky and horrid and putting in

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.870 
sneaky and horrid and putting in
microtransactions<00:01:04.500> for<00:01:05.129> lifting<00:01:05.519> parts<00:01:05.790> of

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
microtransactions for lifting parts of

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.060 
microtransactions for lifting parts of
DLCs<00:01:06.299> like<00:01:06.600> camos<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.290> stuff<00:01:07.619> like<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.920> I

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
DLCs like camos and stuff like that I

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.469 
DLCs like camos and stuff like that I
think<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.580> quite<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.790> good<00:01:08.939> idea<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.450> way

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
think it's quite a good idea in a way

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.210 
think it's quite a good idea in a way
because<00:01:09.930> some<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.439> camos<00:01:10.680> they<00:01:10.979> actually

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
because some of the camos they actually

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.219 
because some of the camos they actually
come<00:01:11.369> up<00:01:11.460> with<00:01:11.520> are<00:01:11.820> really<00:01:12.090> really<00:01:12.510> nice<00:01:12.659> for

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
come up with are really really nice for

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.020 
come up with are really really nice for
example<00:01:13.650> let<00:01:13.770> me<00:01:13.830> go<00:01:13.950> all<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.430> way<00:01:14.460> back<00:01:14.790> to

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
example let me go all the way back to

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.820 
example let me go all the way back to
black<00:01:15.210> ops<00:01:15.360> 2<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.810> reckon<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.290> my<00:01:16.500> favourite

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
black ops 2 I reckon that my favourite

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.469 
black ops 2 I reckon that my favourite
carry<00:01:17.009> from<00:01:17.189> black<00:01:17.369> ops<00:01:17.549> 2<00:01:17.790> for<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
carry from black ops 2 for the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.539 
carry from black ops 2 for the
microtransaction<00:01:19.380> stuff<00:01:19.619> was<00:01:20.100> actually<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
microtransaction stuff was actually the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.010 
microtransaction stuff was actually the
sidewalk<00:01:20.939> arrow<00:01:21.180> because<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:21.600> really<00:01:21.780> cool

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
sidewalk arrow because it's really cool

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.770 
sidewalk arrow because it's really cool

camo came out on the I think was the

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.990 
camo came out on the I think was the
10th<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:07.140> February<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.789> the<00:02:08.789> actual

10th of February and the actual

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.550 
10th of February and the actual
championship<00:02:09.509> color<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.810> really<00:02:10.080> cool<00:02:10.289> it's

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560
