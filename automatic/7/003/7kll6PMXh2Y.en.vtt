00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.710
 you are looking for a simple and fast idea 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.030
 that is the same fanciful time but 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.650
 light 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.230
 today I propose whole-wheat spaghetti 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.150
 lands lands enclosed in fragrant 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.549
 find the right balance 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.480
 between healthy and tasty cuisine has always been 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.890
 my personal challenge 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.220
 let's see if I can do this too 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.220
 time 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.890
 for the preparation of spaghetti 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.200
 terrae mare we start from the end that is 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.690
 from the decoration of the dish I use 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.500
 only the peel of the eggplant la 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.500
 fur with a potato peeler 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.929
 cut my eggplant peel a 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.929
 julienne with a knife 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.250
 see I'm cutting the peel of 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.180
 eggplant from the light side so it will be more 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.180
 simple to cut it 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.110
 now it's in flour 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.600
 I always use rice flour 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.190
 because in my opinion it is lighter and a gift 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.190
 a crisp and dry fry 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.790
 now it's time to do them 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.660
 we are ready for frying remember that 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.000
 you never have to exceed 180 degrees with 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.380
 seed oil 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.180
 this is the only sin of gluttony that there is 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.810
 let's just have to fry 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.810
 few seconds 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.680
 if you are perpetually on a diet like you can 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.570
 always decorate the dish with some 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.190
 grilled aubergines or passed on to 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.190
 oven with some breadcrumbs on top 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.390
 I put the water will boil now not me 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.720
 all that remains is to cut the eggplant and the 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.720
 swordfish 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.630
 I cut it first 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.489
 and then in cubes 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.220
 I chose aubergine because a 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.620
 vegetable low in calories but a lot 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.120
 tasty if you don't like eggplant 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.860
 you can always use zucchini 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.670
 or from the peppers that are very much there 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.670
 good with fish 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:33.829
 I also cut swordfish first 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:35.590
 I remove the skin and now cut it 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:38.060
 strips and then cubes 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.519
 I chose the swordfish because it has 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.470
 lean meats and is very digestible 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.870
 besides being very protein but then 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.220
 replace it with salmon of the turn 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.220
 or even cod 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.370
 I remove garlic 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.370
 and I cook the aubergines 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.620
 bring cooking by adding a little water 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.620
 hot 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.030
 a pinch of salt and cook for 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.720
 at least 15 minutes puts the salt also 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.720
 in the water of the pasta 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:56.190
 and I throw the eggplant noodles are 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.190
 ready now I add the swordfish 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.100
 blends with white wine 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:09.330
 the wine evaporated or I reach a cherry tomato 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.330
 and finally salt 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.219
 pp 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.440
 and a few basil leaves 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:38.070
 drain the pasta al dente and it 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:38.070
 flavored in the sauce I now prepare cartocci 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:50.820
 flavored with lemon peel but 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.140
 the fish is also very good 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.940
 orange peel the important thing is 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.940
 always use untreated citrus fruits 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:03.560
 of basil and close the bag 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.340
 I'm using parchment paper but 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.750
 you are want you can use 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.750
 of aluminum or fairy paper 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:23.590
 Here is the heart made in the oven at 200 degrees 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.590
 for 4 minutes 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.900
 and we see it as it bakes all 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.120
 ingredients needed to prepare
