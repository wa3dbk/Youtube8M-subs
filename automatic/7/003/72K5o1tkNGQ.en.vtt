00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.890
 Oh Iko' is Tokoro 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.890
 me 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:18.860
 I think that this type of social car would make me to compete if it was Japan. 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:22.000
 When I came to it, I wonder why this is the ultimate finesse worm 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.000
 Very thin 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.010
 Such a thin but 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:39.840
 Only the bottom part is made to be able to produce the water resistance firmly 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:45.590
 While much is better caught parachute or rather helicopter 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:51.720
 In Texas rig to say plunge in ne of the other lighter jig head 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:53.600
 Like a small horseback , I said it was dropped with a small hook 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.370
 That is 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:01.070
 Even if I do Wacky style with this 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:05.339
 Let's put in a new nail book from the head 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:09.920
 I will sink slowly while slowly sinking rate 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:15.860
 I just move a little bit at the bottom 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:17.810
 After all executives is a really Tteyuu activity with no bus is and say senior managing about persistent in 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.760
 is not it 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:25.950
 And this is also very extreme 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:29.090
 said was a worm that you You're the form of k stations 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:34.780
 Personally when I to the fishing 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:37.409
 I want to put my own fishing together somehow without using slow lure up to here 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.890
 The type of type you want 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:46.650
 Part of you You're Galax this say when 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:53.690
 It is only that day and when it is this, the bus person who can not catch it is always 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:58.400
 I'm have a place also went to where relatively with Japan as Japan is so kind of meaning 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:01.620
 In America, how many kilometers of 2-axis waters have no tomorrow at all 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.340
 Right after that there are many places like heaven 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:09.550
 In Japan, it is not so and there is more there than here 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:15.310
 Now is looking to I water I is not most of Tteyuu zero 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:18.640
 Then, in the case of Japan, in the case of the United States, the technology to look for a bus is very important. 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:24.580
 However, in Japan, the fishing pressure is high 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:27.640
 Considering how to feed a place that is already being chased 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.060
 The boot is absolutely strong and interesting 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:34.170
 Everyone is a worm 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.560
 Not with rig k 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.810
 Decathus 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:44.350
 Because it is not Deca bus It is not this child bus aim 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:47.980
 When eating a Dekabasu is I say want to see at least be with I'm bad 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:51.620
 I really want to have a wackie 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:56.080
 Or become a regular Texas rig 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:59.910
 Or in stuck to the jig head and use Te anywhere in the type 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.910
 I think that often results 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.719
 But it is thin 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.700
 But it's this great attention worm ne good thing about transparency 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.250
