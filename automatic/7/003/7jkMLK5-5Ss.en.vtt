alright<00:00:38.190> well<00:00:38.610> first<00:00:39.120> off<00:00:39.300> let's<00:00:39.540> just<00:00:39.719> see<00:00:39.870> it

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
alright well first off let's just see it

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.560 
alright well first off let's just see it
opening<00:00:41.090> see<00:00:42.090> it's<00:00:42.239> very<00:00:42.600> very<00:00:42.990> fast<00:00:44.360> not<00:00:45.360> sure

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
opening see it's very very fast not sure

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.270 
opening see it's very very fast not sure
how<00:00:45.720> fast<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.200> opens<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.620> closes<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:47.340> here's

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
how fast it opens and closes but here's

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.720 
how fast it opens and closes but here's
and<00:00:51.200> over<00:00:52.200> here<00:00:52.560> is<00:00:52.800> actually<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.280> concept

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
and over here is actually the concept

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.030 
and over here is actually the concept
behind<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.060> double<00:00:54.300> extender<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.890> make

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
behind the double extender and to make

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.880 
behind the double extender and to make
it<00:00:56.070> smaller<00:00:56.430> we<00:00:57.090> had<00:00:57.239> two<00:00:57.530> uses<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.680> same

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
it smaller we had two uses the same

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.210 
it smaller we had two uses the same
double<00:00:59.610> extender<00:00:59.790> is<00:01:00.149> here<00:01:00.470> but<00:01:01.470> obviously

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
double extender is here but obviously

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.229 
double extender is here but obviously
going<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.489> use<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:02.790> double<00:01:03.059> extender

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
going to use this double extender

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.119 
going to use this double extender
because<00:01:03.720> if<00:01:03.989> we<00:01:04.110> wanted<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.439> input<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.070> into

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
because if we wanted to input it into

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.899 
because if we wanted to input it into
the<00:01:05.369> door<00:01:05.489> we'd<00:01:05.820> have<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.030> go<00:01:06.119> down<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.570> block

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
the door we'd have to go down the block

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.170 
the door we'd have to go down the block
that<00:01:08.909> would<00:01:09.090> just<00:01:09.270> not<00:01:09.420> work<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.790> so<00:01:11.790> we<00:01:11.939> I

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
that would just not work and so we I

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.450 
that would just not work and so we I
came<00:01:12.570> up<00:01:12.689> with<00:01:12.719> this<00:01:13.049> little<00:01:13.350> thing<00:01:13.590> or<00:01:14.040> here

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
came up with this little thing or here

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.190 
came up with this little thing or here
it<00:01:14.970> works<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.720> same<00:01:15.810> way<00:01:17.600> and<00:01:18.600> this

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
it works just the same way and this

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.530 
it works just the same way and this
redstone<00:01:19.590> dust<00:01:19.860> right<00:01:20.130> here<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.670> simply<00:01:21.120> just

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
redstone dust right here is simply just

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.830 
redstone dust right here is simply just
to<00:01:21.750> redirect<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.590> redstone<00:01:23.040> exactly<00:01:23.840> they

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
to redirect the redstone exactly they

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.719 
to redirect the redstone exactly they
repeater<00:01:25.260> what<00:01:25.530> whatnot<00:01:26.130> which<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.460> had<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.700> use

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
repeater what whatnot which I had to use

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.950 
repeater what whatnot which I had to use
them<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:28.170> bus<00:01:28.290> tree<00:01:28.470> itself<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.310> guess

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
them on the bus tree itself so I guess

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.850 
them on the bus tree itself so I guess
start<00:01:30.960> with<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.140> tutorial<00:01:33.020> all<00:01:34.020> right<00:01:34.260> this
