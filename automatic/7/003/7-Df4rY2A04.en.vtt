00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:23.800
 How is the situation? I ask me 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.400
 Can you still remember the beginning of the journey? 

00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:43.000
 I prayed for the correctness of the chosen path 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:55.200
 I heard various types of footsteps 

00:00:55.201 --> 00:01:02.900
 Many piles of piles overlap again 

00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:10.900
 If it is loneliness you will forget it will repeat 

00:01:10.901 --> 00:01:18.500
 No matter how you spend the night, the day you rise will be the same 

00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:26.300
 A map of a handcrafted map that has been broken 

00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:35.000
 A compass that doesn't move I put my eyes in one hand, I'm staring 

00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:42.800
 I lost you In this world I keep asking what 

00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:55.000
 I felt that I was lost and I did not notice it 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:06.000
 How is the situation Asking you not present 

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:13.900
 Can we swim in our distance? 

00:02:13.901 --> 00:02:21.600
 I forgot the warmth I got cold little by little 

00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:29.300
 How do you remember if you spend the night 

00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:37.200
 I shook my hand and cried my goodbye on your back 

00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:46.100
 And where is the plan of the present dream What kind of face when opening 

00:02:46.101 --> 00:02:54.000
 This is the world I wanted and I will keep walking 

00:02:54.001 --> 00:03:07.000
 Praying for correctness at the end of a clumsy journey 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.900
 Time has been stopped since that day and it's gone away and it's gone back 

00:03:24.901 --> 00:03:34.101
 Oh Lostman I noticed that the name of the picture that we carefully cut off is a memory 

00:03:34.101 --> 00:03:42.300
 Strongly waving Goodbye on the back of that day 

00:03:42.301 --> 00:03:50.000
 Current location to tell you Come on moving compass Let's go or lost man 

00:03:50.101 --> 00:03:58.400
 Broken map Handcrafted map Add Sirsi 

00:03:58.401 --> 00:04:07.000
 Here is the starting point The foot to take off is always the first step 

00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:15.000
 When I love this world I forgot you, I will go to see you 

00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:27.500
 Praying for correctness at the end of the wrong journey 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.600
 Praying again
