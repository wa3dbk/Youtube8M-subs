00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.230
 set up any 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.550
 and even if the computer is 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:40.420
 people pay 5 10 reais to get there 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:45.070
 make the TV audio output on the 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:47.290
 is some already know how to do more 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.300
 others not just like me 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.960
 so if you do not know how to configure 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.520
 computer earphone is the 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.260
 any other headset that 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.650
 you like 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:04.659
 O look at that first tip you will 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:08.830
 here in configuration settings and 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:11.800
 Let's go, I'm on the screen and we're going to 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.630
 setting audio output we go 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.230
 here in this output option for headset 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.290
 heard 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.380
 you may notice that this option is 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.780
 disabled do not be a little more 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.540
 compared to other options 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.080
 This is because in control I do not 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.360
 I have no headset is adapted 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.000
 currently in the cash input 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:38.340
 down here as you well know you have 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.340
 Good earphone I got 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:47.690
 he is very hobo 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:50.119
 if someone says that I paid $ 5 this 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:54.890
 here is going to laugh 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:57.860
 good is a very simple headset 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.820
 I really think one was 5 reais that 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.910
 earphone 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:06.520
 What I'm going to do I'm going to get the best 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:09.590
 you will get the output and two in the case 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.900
 the traditional input is from the 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.090
 heard 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.620
 detail as of computer usually 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:22.970
 have the microphone output which is the pink 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.220
 audio output which is green then the 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.810
 people will fit green at the entrance to the 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:33.170
 control you have done. 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.880
 repair there on the ground that enabled exit 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:40.120
 for headphones 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.120
 I'm going to take control disabled 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:46.190
 I put it on Billiton it's just that the big 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.989
 such breach trick right here is 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.400
 You notice the audio of the game is still 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.579
 going out on tv 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.769
 so I click on this option and enable 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.660
 all audios you will notice that 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:00.019
 When I click here, the TV will stay. 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:03.340
 soon changes dumb 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:06.320
 now the sound of the game is coming out here 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.010
 there is an adapter that I think 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.380
 any computer store that you 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.360
 will put here at the entrance p2 of 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:21.049
 control is it enters 1 and 2 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:25.130
 the male and his exit 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:27.350
 are 2 p2 that fm 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.820
 it serves to that is for you to connect 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:34.209
 both the microphone while the audio 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.120
 for example here I can not use the 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.890
 Oops if I want to talk to someone. 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.380
 Good, but this is another matter 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.930
 important is that the audio of the 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.570
 playstation 3 still on this phone here 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.670
 r $ 5 nÃ© this is good for the break when the 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:53.020
 People want to play at dawn a game of 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:57.090
 shooting or a good game of terror 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:59.350
 No, what is it for? 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.470
 good for mainly those who live 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.260
 with other people, who can not 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.370
 afford to leave the TV on 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.620
 high volume 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.670
 this was the tip and playstation 4 as 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.490
 set up a $ 5 headset on playstation 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:18.150
 and I hope you liked it then you said 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.150
