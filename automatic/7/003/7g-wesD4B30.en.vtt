00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.319
 material does not have to be wasted can be completely recycled 

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:18.529
 The main reasons that justify this activity are the reduction of 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.210
 volume of waste, energy saving and preservation of resources 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.480
 natural 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.920

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.480
 with this paper so elaborate lamps and different works of art besides the 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.420
 Natural cider helps preserve and protect the environment as it is 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.280
 It elaborates with raw materials from recoverable non-woody plants within the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.550
 six months 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.830
 the workshop where they carry out the elaboration processes is located in the utpl no 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.470
 harm the environment 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.510
 then he picks you plants 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.310
 that are disused 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.590
 all material that is no longer 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.970
 They have made paper with plants such as yucca guatemala in xela arboreal toilet 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.950
 banana kabul coconut bark basile inba gasoil and palm trees 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.320
 I recently did a supe investigation 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.140
 and important heras reveal photograph in paper envelopes 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.660
 then all parts the mace candando 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.210
 we used in the first tests to choose the treacherous photography 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.990
 in the preparation of cake sensitization 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.350

 they were the same percent students 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.939
 we are 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:11.829
 the standard for works here 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:15.409
 This paper is of great artistic value thanks to its characteristics as 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.759
 texture transparency finished natural colors and the raw material with which 

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:21.159
 is to elaborate 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.540
 all this differentiates it and makes it a work of art
