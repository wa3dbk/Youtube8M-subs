00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 so today I make a homemade 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.150
 bauer pot there is also of 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.910
 maggi this fix chlorine I'm bags 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.910
 Without bags just think it's delicious 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.910
 I took six potatoes 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.340
 I have already peeled them 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.859
 three onions then I have three red 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.890
 cut paprika ever so small and 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.289
 gutted then I have here 500 grams 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.300
 Now you can only eat minced meat 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.920
 take minced meat or pigs 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.530
 mixed as you like 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.030
 i have taken mixed then 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.829
 I have prepared here before 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:44.040
 units of liter of water then run 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:47.280
 spices such as salt paprika and peppers 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:58.039
 so now I give something first 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:01:00.840
 olive oil in a pot the plate and 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:05.329
 be the very first level that 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.329
 saute minced meat in the pot and 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.119
 then I give the water and the 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.549
 Potatoes to the potatoes I will 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.340
 I can also roll the dice now 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.810
 already start directly and the whole thing 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.990
 is now first as a good half 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.630
 hour after cooking everything 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.460
 just admitted that 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.570
 potatoes nice cooking with soft 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.790
 be so are edible since and the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.380
 Chili peppers are pretty good 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.780
 conclusion rather compatible with you hold still 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.820
 I am now bissfest 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:44.990
 is the top 4 as far as it is heated and 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.990
 then let you continue to participate 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.010
 Here is a painting day meat in 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:56.720
 freeing his head that he is now 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:58.670
 Neat equipment is through 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.160
 his time is really the same 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:06.290
 make time 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:08.440
 just because it says easy can see so I 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.780
 as I said I need it now 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.240
 and then I add the potato 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.930
 us but the onions then you are 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.760
 one has come again as or perhaps 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.170
 now durchgebraten I have the lid 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.050
 just made it so that 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.730
 bellow is not too loud and me 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.040
 about BÃ¼nder with whom I just better 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.270
 understands therefore perhaps as I said 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.950
 is durchgebraten I give now the 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.420
 For the first time the sauce finished that way and that 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.760
 like i said i have 500 here 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.830
 milliliters of water quite normally lukewarm 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:46.160
 water I give something now 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:51.650
 add paprika powder if that with one 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:54.070
 fork earlier, I think it is now a 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.790
 good tablespoon paprika powder sweet 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:04.010
 not sharp then I have her normal 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:07.250
 Jotzeit I give that a pinch 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.200
 I would say I give as well as again 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.760
 with the fork just compared that with it 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.310
 the powder is not really 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:21.980
 faded away so he sounds beautiful now 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:23.750
 I'll get some pepper in it 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:29.600
 personally prefer with more pepper 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:32.769
 taste pepper aruba turn but twelve 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.769
 years under side 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.140
 I now give the Hartz IV to 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.970
 in complete then come the six 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.310
 potatoes which I think I said 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:04:02.920
 admits the diced washed the 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:05.580
 also come directly to it and too good 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.930
 last the three onions 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.819
 I have not diced her yet 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.230
 this has to be done quickly 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.190
 I did not think about that at the time 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:19.329
 in very rough dice so I like it that way 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.310
 can you see that just so fourth yes 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.950
 so you can easily see it in quarters 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.389
 one also holds what this firm mother 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:30.190
 that does not have to sell 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:32.970
 that's part of the vegetable I call it 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.220
 doing now ready quickly for him to 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:40.900
 then got directly into the 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:43.590
 water to the rat meat and the 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.590
 potatoes 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.410
 that was already now we have the 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.070
 whole but something that I determined that 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.070
 mixed 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.310
 I'll keep it clean for you 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.680
 ever ago 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.419
 that's what the whole thing looks like now 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.940
 now put the lid on it and then 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.340
 I'll be around 20 to 30 this way 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.930
 to cook for a few minutes 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.910
 in between stops so every five minutes 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.120
 Just stir that down 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:29.000
 does not turn on and just let cook 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.560
 so that the potatoes soften the 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.590
 Be on the go and get all the time 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.020
 mixed together a bit yes 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.199
 So the farmer's pot the cook's about 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.729
 20 minutes 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:44.510
 I have been regularly like I said 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:45.949
 and now I give the paprika 3 here 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.020
 are they again that he will see again 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:51.370
 I can give that now with and 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.440
 which is then again a good ten minutes 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.150
 sell each other 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.630
 that the part does not soften a bit 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:03.289
 but not too mushy you will then 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:06.139
 even so and then I'll show you right away 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:10.130
 the result yes, here love the design 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:12.349
 pot is farmer in the pot is finished here 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.760
 might even have a look in the pot 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:15.560
 I have to throw the stove plate now 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:21.260
 forget about it 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:22.909
 he is ready is bite and is 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.130
 actually a delicious meal for 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:27.320
 very cold days truth like such a way 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:30.110
 stew is building authority whether said also the 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.610
 name a bit yes, look at it 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.229
 try it myself i have it like 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.840
 said in medium heat I have it 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:38.210
