00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.910
 and here is an impressive story 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.250
 it's a story above all a guy 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.540
 of a feature that is missing 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.920
 and many human beings are loyal to the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.390
 mistress right? 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:26.099
 the dog owners a family and this 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:29.670
 family died in a collapse 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:35.239
 the dog was completely lost 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:38.250
 Do you know who I am with the doggie? 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.160
 discovered or been taken I will not know 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.090
 now that he has just arrived he was taken 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:49.200
 to the cemetery and he lives next door 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:54.329
 of the tomb of the gifts and does not leave there 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.059
 see if it's possible puts us up in the air until today 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.840
 camilo could not accept the loss of 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.879
 owners 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.010
 two years ago this family died 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.769
 buried after heavy rain and a 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.260
 day there and since then dog did not leave 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.140
 plus this graveyard next to the old 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.479
 comrades a sad face the way 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.030
 quietly take care of the place at the time of 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.960
 close the turn gave three taken and went up 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.000
 back here again 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.909
 since the priest was below the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.890
 45 days a week there we started to 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.810
 to treat him the way he never abandoned 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.420
 owners of it even on the day of burial 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.549
 It's hidden in the car of relatives. 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.350
 of the victims of burial they only 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.630
 realized that the dog came together 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.210
 when they arrived here in the cemetery and 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.280
 Since then camilo visits the tomb of the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.409
 owners of it almost every day 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.509
 the dog's loyalty touched his 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.729
 rubens that do not detach from it 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.409
 camilo has won many employees 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.880
 hence you always find a way to 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.390
 continue with the animal 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.210
 we are also faithful all of us then I 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.829
 did a little buying the feed 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.049
 another recipient who receives the same 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.689
 care is a giant that appeared a 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.180
 day in the cemetery here he stayed he is the 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.759
 companion number one of the way the two 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.250
 follow their rubens wherever they receive 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.200
 love and even some cookies 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.180
 this was the day the new owners 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.430
 received the news that the two 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.060
 puppies could no longer stay in the 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.250
 cemetery we received a request is from 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.530
 sanitary surveillance that would not be a 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.959
 appropriate place to have animals is because 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.790
 there in the wake is all part of the ml 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.320
 back then we would have to withdraw the 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.160
 animals because they could not stay 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.750
 on site 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.340
 the dogs were brought to the 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.800
 health and wellness coordination 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.470
 where they stayed in this kennel for 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.510
 about a month your rubens do not like 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.870
 to remember the sadness that has passed 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:49.620
 rather lacking enough that my state 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:51.450
 he came sick tick trail them 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.510
 They were made to cover a term of 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.370
 adoption as everyone who makes two 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.709
 employees to adopt the animals and 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.709
 They blamed by the guard 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.390
 charge of them friends again but 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.170
 to be able to continue here without 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.760
 problems 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.040
 the graveyard officials will 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.080
 need to add even more money to 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.120
 build a kennel what for your 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.860
 antone does not seem a problem later 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.769
 The most important thing he's already got 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.209
 have the company of the way and the giant 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.739
 every day 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.739
 joy and took him out of the jason family 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.739
 family
