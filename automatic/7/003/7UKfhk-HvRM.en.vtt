just<00:04:32.620> turns<00:04:33.060> about<00:04:34.060> as<00:04:34.150> simple<00:04:34.420> as<00:04:34.510> that<00:04:35.730> so<00:04:36.730> I

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
just turns about as simple as that so I

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.190 
just turns about as simple as that so I
filled<00:04:37.030> my<00:04:37.180> my<00:04:38.020> washer<00:04:38.980> up<00:04:39.160> with<00:04:39.400> water<00:04:40.200> this

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
filled my my washer up with water this

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.230 
filled my my washer up with water this
was<00:04:41.440> the<00:04:41.560> problem<00:04:41.770> so<00:04:42.250> I<00:04:42.280> as<00:04:42.700> I<00:04:42.880> explained

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
was the problem so I as I explained

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.900 
was the problem so I as I explained
earlier<00:04:43.360> in<00:04:43.510> the<00:04:43.630> video<00:04:43.720> I<00:04:43.900> would<00:04:44.550> wash<00:04:45.550> a<00:04:45.580> load

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
earlier in the video I would wash a load

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.000 
earlier in the video I would wash a load
and<00:04:46.330> then<00:04:46.900> would<00:04:47.080> go<00:04:47.260> so<00:04:47.500> what<00:04:47.620> I'm<00:04:47.710> gonna<00:04:47.800> do

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
and then would go so what I'm gonna do

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.410 
and then would go so what I'm gonna do
is<00:04:48.220> and<00:04:48.520> I<00:04:48.610> don't<00:04:48.760> have<00:04:48.850> any<00:04:48.970> clothes<00:04:49.150> in<00:04:49.180> here

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
I'm gonna run to my main and see if it

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:05.310 
I'm gonna run to my main and see if it
backs<00:04:53.890> up<00:04:54.900> check<00:04:55.900> it<00:04:55.990> out<00:05:01.650> all<00:05:02.650> right<00:05:02.710> so<00:05:04.170> if<00:05:05.170> I

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
and that's an awful lot of water I have

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.380 
and that's an awful lot of water I have
an<00:05:38.910> extra<00:05:39.210> large<00:05:39.710> washer<00:05:40.710> you<00:05:41.550> can<00:05:41.790> see<00:05:42.060> I<00:05:42.090> am

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
an extra large washer you can see I am

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:48.490

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.870 
I'm gonna have to live with that I think
that's<00:05:52.440> a<00:05:52.590> heck<00:05:52.740> of<00:05:52.830> a<00:05:52.920> lot<00:05:53.010> better<00:05:53.640> than

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
that's a heck of a lot better than

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.610 
that's a heck of a lot better than
having<00:05:54.780> a<00:05:54.990> back<00:05:55.200> up<00:05:55.380> into<00:05:55.590> my<00:05:56.990> into<00:05:57.990> my<00:05:58.020> bathtub

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
having a back up into my into my bathtub

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.760 
having a back up into my into my bathtub
which<00:05:59.190> is<00:05:59.900> probably<00:06:00.900> about<00:06:01.080> another<00:06:01.230> foot<00:06:01.740> and

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
which is probably about another foot and

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.740 
which is probably about another foot and
a<00:06:01.890> half<00:06:01.980> in<00:06:02.160> elevation<00:06:02.700> so<00:06:02.970> there<00:06:03.270> was<00:06:03.420> a<00:06:03.450> major

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
a half in elevation so there was a major

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.440 
a half in elevation so there was a major
blockage<00:06:04.290> there<00:06:04.640> again<00:06:05.640> this<00:06:05.820> house<00:06:05.970> is<00:06:06.150> 60

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
blockage there again this house is 60

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.260 
blockage there again this house is 60
years<00:06:06.480> old<00:06:07.160> I've<00:06:08.160> staked<00:06:08.430> it<00:06:08.580> twice<00:06:08.820> I'm

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
years old I've staked it twice I'm

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.110 
years old I've staked it twice I'm
satisfied<00:06:09.870> it's<00:06:10.440> not<00:06:10.620> exactly<00:06:11.430> perfect<00:06:11.700> but

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
satisfied it's not exactly perfect but

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.110 
satisfied it's not exactly perfect but
it'll<00:06:12.630> do<00:06:12.780> and<00:06:13.250> this<00:06:14.250> is<00:06:14.400> the<00:06:14.430> overall<00:06:14.760> mess

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
it'll do and this is the overall mess

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.110 
it'll do and this is the overall mess
that<00:06:15.300> I<00:06:15.330> made<00:06:16.430> like<00:06:17.430> I<00:06:17.550> said<00:06:17.760> I<00:06:17.790> did<00:06:18.000> this

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
that I made like I said I did this

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.750 
that I made like I said I did this
probably<00:06:18.630> seven<00:06:18.900> years<00:06:19.080> ago<00:06:19.230> and<00:06:20.130> it<00:06:20.640> was<00:06:20.730> a

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:20.760 
probably seven years ago and it was a

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.660 
probably seven years ago and it was a
lot<00:06:21.240> worse<00:06:21.600> my<00:06:22.230> gloves<00:06:22.530> took<00:06:22.830> the<00:06:23.010> the<00:06:23.400> brunt

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:23.670 
lot worse my gloves took the the brunt

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:24.860 
lot worse my gloves took the the brunt
