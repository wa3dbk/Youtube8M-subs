00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
hand overlay just vote for voltage these

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.450 
hand overlay just vote for voltage these
two<00:01:30.479> last<00:01:30.659> ones<00:01:31.079> were<00:01:31.320> made<00:01:31.470> from<00:01:31.770> my<00:01:31.950> last<00:01:32.159> two

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
two last ones were made from my last two

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.249 
two last ones were made from my last two
rulers<00:01:33.829> this<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:35.420> sort<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.479> just<00:01:36.659> squeeze<00:01:37.049> and

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
rulers this I sort of just squeeze and

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.530 
rulers this I sort of just squeeze and
really<00:01:37.590> tight<00:01:37.829> together<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.490> handle<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.390> end

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
really tight together the handle the end

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:48.789 
really tight together the handle the end
of<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.720> handle<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.939> yeah<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:46.110> longer<00:01:46.680> part<00:01:46.950> I

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
of the handle and yeah the longer part I

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.910 
of the handle and yeah the longer part I
just<00:01:49.799> wrapped<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.369> around<00:01:50.490> really<00:01:50.909> hard

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
just wrapped it around really hard

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.929 
just wrapped it around really hard
definitely<00:01:52.920> worth<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.280> really<00:01:53.399> can't<00:01:53.759> really

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
definitely worth it really can't really

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.130 
definitely worth it really can't really
do<00:01:54.060> something<00:01:54.990> like<00:01:55.049> this<00:01:56.840> starts<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.960> roll

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
do something like this starts to roll

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.499 
do something like this starts to roll
around<00:01:58.259> them<00:01:58.619> tangle<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.250> it's<00:02:00.119> falling

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
around them tangle and it's falling

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.980 
around them tangle and it's falling
apart<00:02:00.570> here<00:02:01.219> and<00:02:02.219> then<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.790> end<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.420> just<00:02:03.780> took

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
apart here and then the end I just took

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.770 
apart here and then the end I just took
one<00:02:04.680> set<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.040> three<00:02:05.250> right<00:02:05.670> here<00:02:05.820> folded<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.450> in

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
one set of three right here folded it in

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.320 
one set of three right here folded it in
half<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.399> fold<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.060> in<00:02:09.149> half<00:02:09.179> again

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
half and I fold it in half again

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.620 
half and I fold it in half again
attached<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.229> one<00:02:10.410> side

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630

versatility<00:02:14.810> with<00:02:14.930> handle<00:02:15.260> because<00:02:15.350> it<00:02:15.560> took

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
versatility with handle because it took

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.270 
versatility with handle because it took
the<00:02:15.890> last<00:02:16.100> three<00:02:16.400> COAS<00:02:17.090> 2013<00:02:18.020> rap<00:02:18.230> rap<00:02:18.590> twice

this<00:02:24.950> is<00:02:25.160> my<00:02:25.340> best<00:02:25.780> interpretation<00:02:26.780> of<00:02:27.020> that

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
this is my best interpretation of that

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.700 
this is my best interpretation of that
that<00:02:29.450> was<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.870> picture<00:02:30.080> that<00:02:30.320> it's<00:02:30.440> going

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
that was the picture that it's going

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.340 
that was the picture that it's going
around<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.070> internet<00:02:31.130> I<00:02:31.750> don't<00:02:32.750> know<00:02:33.080> how<00:02:33.290> the

around the internet I don't know how the
minute<00:02:33.830> I<00:02:34.040> can't<00:02:34.970> find<00:02:35.270> instructions<00:02:36.110> but

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
minute I can't find instructions but

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:45.550 
minute I can't find instructions but
this<00:02:37.820> is<00:02:37.970> my<00:02:38.090> best<00:02:39.040> interpretation<00:02:40.040> of<00:02:44.290> so<00:02:45.290> for

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
this is my best interpretation of so for

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.490 
this is my best interpretation of so for
these<00:02:45.680> two<00:02:45.920> gift<00:02:46.580> if<00:02:46.880> not<00:02:47.150> this<00:02:47.360> one<00:02:47.600> it's<00:02:48.200> not

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
these two gift if not this one it's not

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.270 
these two gift if not this one it's not
that<00:02:48.560> one<00:02:49.040> too<00:02:49.310> just<00:02:49.610> so<00:02:50.120> just<00:02:50.360> ballpark<00:02:51.280> rates

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
that one too just so just ballpark rates

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.680 
that one too just so just ballpark rates
very<00:02:53.150> next<00:02:53.330> very<00:02:53.960> thin<00:02:54.290> very<00:02:54.650> nicely<00:02:54.950> Braden

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.190 
very next very thin very nicely Braden
I'm<00:02:56.690> just<00:02:57.080> very<00:02:57.560> very<00:02:57.830> nice<00:02:58.490> click<00:02:59.110> hold<00:03:00.110> it

I'm just very very nice click hold it
like<00:03:00.320> this

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
like this

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:09.370 
like this
hook<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:01.430> like<00:03:01.520> this<00:03:06.160> that's<00:03:07.160> my<00:03:08.140> my<00:03:09.140> weight

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
hook it like this that's my my weight

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.350 
hook it like this that's my my weight

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
making this I don't know this probably

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.340 
making this I don't know this probably
easier<00:03:12.050> better<00:03:12.380> ways<00:03:12.710> of<00:03:12.950> making<00:03:13.340> that<00:03:14.140> if<00:03:15.140> you

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
easier better ways of making that if you

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.080 
easier better ways of making that if you
actually<00:03:15.590> know<00:03:15.950> how<00:03:15.980> to<00:03:16.190> make<00:03:16.430> a<00:03:16.460> real<00:03:16.730> world

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
actually know how to make a real world

actually know how to make a real world
you<00:03:17.570> probably<00:03:17.840> just<00:03:18.290> put<00:03:18.440> admit<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:18.740> real

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
you probably just put admit the real

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.770 
you probably just put admit the real
thing<00:03:19.100> this<00:03:19.580> is<00:03:19.700> my<00:03:19.820> best<00:03:20.030> interpretation<00:03:20.540> of
