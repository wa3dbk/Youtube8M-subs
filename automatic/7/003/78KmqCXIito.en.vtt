this<00:00:46.469> cord<00:00:46.770> here<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:48.440> user<00:00:49.440> interface<00:00:50.160> the

this cord here is the user interface the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.000 
this cord here is the user interface the
it<00:00:51.420> looks<00:00:51.600> like<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.960> send<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.559> hangout

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
it looks like the send and hangout

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.939 
it looks like the send and hangout
buttons<00:00:53.989> you<00:00:54.989> can<00:00:55.140> see<00:00:55.350> how<00:00:55.530> big<00:00:55.770> they<00:00:55.920> are

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
buttons you can see how big they are

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
kind of gives you an idea

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.240 
kind of gives you an idea
thumb<00:00:59.640> size<00:00:59.879> there<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.680> cord<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.010> connect

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
thumb size there and the cord to connect

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.390 
thumb size there and the cord to connect
to<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.460> ECU<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:04.369> then<00:01:05.390> this<00:01:06.390> cord<00:01:07.070> looks<00:01:08.070> like

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
to the ECU and then this cord looks like

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.530 
to the ECU and then this cord looks like
a<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.990> fuse<00:01:10.439> power<00:01:10.830> lines<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:15.090> RCA

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
a the fuse power lines and the RCA

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.770 
a the fuse power lines and the RCA
outputs<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.409> run<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:17.009> your<00:01:17.280> stereo<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.180> I'm

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
outputs to run to your stereo and I'm

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.870 
outputs to run to your stereo and I'm
guessing<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.500> other<00:01:19.860> jack<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
guessing that other jack is the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.840 
guessing that other jack is the
headphone<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.750> Jack<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:23.490> still

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
headphone in Jack so that you can still

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.510 
headphone in Jack so that you can still
keep<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.240> functionality<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.200> adding<00:01:25.650> an<00:01:25.890> mp3

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
keep the functionality of adding an mp3

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.420 
keep the functionality of adding an mp3
player<00:01:26.729> using<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.390> headphone<00:01:27.720> jack<00:01:28.280> I'll<00:01:29.280> show

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
player using a headphone jack I'll show

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.740 
player using a headphone jack I'll show
you<00:01:29.520> my<00:01:29.640> install<00:01:30.000> later

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
you my install later

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.810 
you my install later
so<00:01:31.140> if<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.619> don't<00:01:32.250> really<00:01:32.340> understand<00:01:32.700> what

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.470 
somewhere this is the external speaker
it's<00:02:24.500> kind<00:02:24.890> of<00:02:25.069> bulky<00:02:25.489> I'd<00:02:25.640> hope<00:02:25.879> for<00:02:25.910> a<00:02:26.150> little

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
it's kind of bulky I'd hope for a little

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.199 
it's kind of bulky I'd hope for a little
bit<00:02:26.629> smaller<00:02:27.019> speaker<00:02:27.769> but<00:02:27.980> I'm<00:02:28.760> not<00:02:28.940> really

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
bit smaller speaker but I'm not really

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.110 
bit smaller speaker but I'm not really
sure<00:02:29.569> what<00:02:29.720> I'm<00:02:29.810> gonna<00:02:30.019> mount<00:02:30.230> it<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:31.760> cable

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
sure what I'm gonna mount it the cable

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.100 
sure what I'm gonna mount it the cable
is<00:02:32.180> there<00:02:32.330> on<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.569> bottom

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
is there on the bottom

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.750 
is there on the bottom
it<00:02:33.440> looks<00:02:33.650> pretty<00:02:33.799> long<00:02:34.069> also<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:35.769> then<00:02:36.769> this

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
it looks pretty long also and then this

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.100 
it looks pretty long also and then this
is<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.180> actual<00:02:38.650> ECU<00:02:40.630> with<00:02:41.630> all<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.930> different

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
is the actual ECU with all the different

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.830 
is the actual ECU with all the different
plugs<00:02:42.470> on<00:02:42.680> it<00:02:42.829> and<00:02:43.010> it's<00:02:43.970> pretty<00:02:44.269> small<00:02:44.810> I

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
plugs on it and it's pretty small I

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.979 
plugs on it and it's pretty small I
think<00:02:45.319> it's<00:02:45.440> gonna<00:02:45.560> be<00:02:45.739> pretty<00:02:45.920> easy<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.989> get

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
think it's gonna be pretty easy to get

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.559 
think it's gonna be pretty easy to get
this<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.349> fit<00:02:48.620> somewhere<00:02:49.040> I'm<00:02:49.849> not<00:02:50.090> sure<00:02:50.390> if

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
this to fit somewhere I'm not sure if

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.259 
this to fit somewhere I'm not sure if
I'm<00:02:50.720> going<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:51.110> plug<00:02:51.319> it<00:02:51.470> into<00:02:51.620> my<00:02:52.160> or<00:02:52.849> if<00:02:53.120> I'm

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
I'm going to plug it into my or if I'm

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.910 
I'm going to plug it into my or if I'm
going<00:02:53.510> to<00:02:53.629> put<00:02:53.930> it<00:02:53.989> under<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.260> seat<00:02:54.470> or<00:02:54.709> under

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
going to put it under the seat or under

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.190 
going to put it under the seat or under
the<00:02:55.010> dash<00:02:55.220> yet<00:02:55.579> but<00:02:55.879> I'll<00:02:56.660> kind<00:02:56.870> of<00:02:56.959> figure

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
the dash yet but I'll kind of figure

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.170 
the dash yet but I'll kind of figure
that<00:02:57.290> out<00:02:57.470> as<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:57.709> go<00:02:57.860> and<00:02:58.099> each<00:02:58.940> of<00:02:59.120> the

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
that out as you go and each of the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.809 
that out as you go and each of the
connections<00:02:59.450> there<00:02:59.900> and<00:03:00.310> then<00:03:01.310> it's<00:03:01.670> like

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
connections there and then it's like

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.850 
connections there and then it's like
comes<00:03:02.060> with<00:03:02.239> the<00:03:02.450> instruction<00:03:03.110> manual<00:03:03.440> still

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
comes with the instruction manual still

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.789 
comes with the instruction manual still
in<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.010> plastic<00:03:04.220> here<00:03:05.049> with<00:03:06.049> the<00:03:06.200> probably

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
in the plastic here with the probably

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.680 
in the plastic here with the probably
the<00:03:06.890> inspiration<00:03:07.549> the<00:03:07.849> installation

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
the inspiration the installation

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.240 
the inspiration the installation
instructions<00:03:09.260> also<00:03:09.819> so<00:03:10.819> that's<00:03:11.150> it<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:12.440> like

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
instructions also so that's it and like

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.500 
instructions also so that's it and like
I<00:03:13.370> said<00:03:13.430> I'll<00:03:13.730> try<00:03:13.880> to<00:03:13.970> put<00:03:14.180> up<00:03:14.269> some<00:03:14.420> more

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
I said I'll try to put up some more
