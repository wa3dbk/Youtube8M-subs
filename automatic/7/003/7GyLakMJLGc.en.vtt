the chief from the market is currently

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.160 
the chief from the market is currently
one<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.030> half<00:01:42.060> thousand<00:01:42.720> coins<00:01:42.840> there's

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
one and a half thousand coins there's

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.139 
one and a half thousand coins there's
only<00:01:43.290> one<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.680> there<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.579> on<00:01:44.729> average<00:01:44.850> it

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
only one on there but on average it

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.160

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
how you do it is just you you don't even

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.059 
how you do it is just you you don't even
have<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.750> have<00:02:22.900> many<00:02:23.080> coins<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.590> I'm<00:02:23.830> using

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.100 
have to have many coins and I'm using
this<00:02:24.220> method<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:24.730> I<00:02:24.790> have<00:02:24.940> an<00:02:25.569> awful<00:02:25.930> lot<00:02:25.959> of

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
this method and I have an awful lot of

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.600 
this method and I have an awful lot of
coins<00:02:26.380> on<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.680> trend<00:02:26.920> will<00:02:27.190> meant<00:02:27.370> an<00:02:27.550> awful

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
coins on the trend will meant an awful

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.610

lot<00:02:27.910> but<00:02:28.120> a<00:02:28.330> lot<00:02:28.690> more<00:02:28.840> coins<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.380> you<00:02:29.440> should

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
lot but a lot more coins and you should

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.339 
lot but a lot more coins and you should
have<00:02:29.769> when<00:02:29.950> you're<00:02:30.040> doing<00:02:30.250> this<00:02:30.340> method<00:02:30.760> and

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
have when you're doing this method and

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.500 
have when you're doing this method and

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
this method works really well Thea you

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.729 
this method works really well Thea you
can<00:02:36.580> just<00:02:36.790> mass<00:02:37.000> bid<00:02:37.300> all<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.660> time<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:38.200> just
