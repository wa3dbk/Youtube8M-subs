easily<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:02.670> only<00:03:02.970> other<00:03:03.150> thing<00:03:03.450> we<00:03:03.480> don't

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
easily the only other thing we don't

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.759 
easily the only other thing we don't
like<00:03:03.959> is<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.470> price<00:03:04.620> it's<00:03:05.519> expensive<00:03:05.970> at

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
like is the price it's expensive at

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.550 
like is the price it's expensive at
22,000<00:03:07.769> Taiwan<00:03:08.130> dollars<00:03:08.459> or<00:03:08.900> 730<00:03:09.900> US<00:03:10.230> dollars

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.380 
22,000 Taiwan dollars or 730 US dollars
which<00:03:11.099> is<00:03:11.310> more<00:03:11.489> expensive<00:03:11.849> than<00:03:12.090> its

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
which is more expensive than its

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.530 
which is more expensive than its
competitors<00:03:12.900> but<00:03:13.769> it's<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.880> same<00:03:15.090> price<00:03:15.330> as

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
competitors but it's the same price as

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.569 
competitors but it's the same price as
the<00:03:15.630> HTC<00:03:16.019> One<00:03:16.410> when<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.769> was<00:03:16.920> first<00:03:17.250> release

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
the HTC One when it was first release

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.210 
the HTC One when it was first release
the<00:03:17.880> price<00:03:18.750> on<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.019> one<00:03:19.230> has<00:03:19.500> since<00:03:19.739> come<00:03:19.980> down

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
the price on the one has since come down

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.949 
the price on the one has since come down
so<00:03:20.609> we<00:03:20.730> don't<00:03:20.970> expect<00:03:21.090> this<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.660> be<00:03:21.690> an<00:03:21.840> issue

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
so we don't expect this to be an issue

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.229 
so we don't expect this to be an issue
for<00:03:22.109> very<00:03:22.470> long<00:03:22.709> right<00:03:23.519> now<00:03:23.670> we<00:03:23.730> have<00:03:23.850> limited

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
for very long right now we have limited

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.330 
for very long right now we have limited
release<00:03:24.540> in<00:03:24.570> Asia<00:03:24.959> but<00:03:25.620> we're<00:03:25.769> expecting<00:03:26.280> a

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
release in Asia but we're expecting a

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.250 
release in Asia but we're expecting a
rebrand<00:03:26.820> similar<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.510> what<00:03:27.660> we<00:03:27.780> seen<00:03:27.989> with<00:03:28.140> the

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
rebrand similar to what we seen with the

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.050 
rebrand similar to what we seen with the
butterfly<00:03:28.650> turning<00:03:29.280> it<00:03:29.340> into<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.640> Droid<00:03:29.910> DNA

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
butterfly turning it into the Droid DNA

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:37.009 
butterfly turning it into the Droid DNA
maybe<00:03:30.989> something<00:03:31.440> like<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:32.130> Droid<00:03:32.430> DNA<00:03:32.609> s<00:03:36.019> so

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
maybe something like the Droid DNA s so

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.770 
maybe something like the Droid DNA s so
the<00:03:37.109> HTC<00:03:37.530> butterfly<00:03:37.650> asks<00:03:38.340> year<00:03:38.549> neg<00:03:38.880> totally

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
the HTC butterfly asks year neg totally

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.640 
the HTC butterfly asks year neg totally
yay

I absolutely love it five inches is the

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.090 
I absolutely love it five inches is the

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
biggest that I can really use with my

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.979 
biggest that I can really use with my
hand<00:03:44.370> size<00:03:44.579> it<00:03:44.819> totally<00:03:45.209> fits<00:03:45.450> like<00:03:45.569> a<00:03:45.630> recent

only downside for me is I have to

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.430 
only downside for me is I have to
install<00:03:50.519> Nova<00:03:50.850> Launcher<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.660> cover<00:03:51.930> up<00:03:52.139> sense

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
install Nova Launcher to cover up sense

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.190

back end when you have to go up and down

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.640 
back end when you have to go up and down
to<00:03:57.299> look<00:03:57.420> at<00:03:57.540> what's<00:03:57.690> installed<00:03:58.139> that's<00:03:58.410> so

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650
