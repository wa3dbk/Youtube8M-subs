 certainly from his state of abandonment 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.320
 the finding is that his rehabilitation 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.470
 can open to a track 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.960
 as to relocate some ufr and

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:12.799
 pleasure at the dock the Prime Minister has 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.860

 departments of 7 after six schools 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.489
 the university of abobo-adjamé meanwhile 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.709
 the total ruin lives only by his 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.140
 research center in ecology based in 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.239

 6000 students 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:39.409
 the government wants to be active that's 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:44.030
 why we asked each of 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:47.420
 ministers from the findings of us 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:52.340
 did an inventory of fixtures 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:58.159
 accurate bills to make us a 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:00.680
 precise inventory of fixtures and relations 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:02.000
 with the budget that has just been adopted 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.540
 the Ministry of Economy and 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.169
 finances to propose us in two 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.079
 weeks I mean a two weeks 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:15.230
 communications a council of 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:18.709
 ministers to deal with the issue 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:23.930
 they will proceed either to the 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:25.939
 rehabilitation to the renovation or to the 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.180
 new construction 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:32.439

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.709
 needs of the world of education 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:40.250
 then in this same communication 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:43.569
 we want to have a precise cost so 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.599
 work that will be done 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:49.970
 but we are not going to settle for 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.389
 find the funds to achieve these 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.090
 works 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:56.750
 but it is necessary that the communication of 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.540
 militias could tell him how these works 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.750
 can be realized and in what time 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.879
 now I want the government 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.259
