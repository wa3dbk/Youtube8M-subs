00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
kind of smaller body that most hollow

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.350 
kind of smaller body that most hollow
bodies<00:01:04.589> are<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.979> they<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.850> tone<00:01:06.060> block

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.570 
bodies are and they have a tone block
inside<00:01:06.810> as<00:01:06.960> well<00:01:07.110> which<00:01:07.740> gives<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.189> kind<00:01:08.430> of

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
inside as well which gives it a kind of

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.690 
inside as well which gives it a kind of
more<00:01:08.729> modern<00:01:09.060> sound<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:10.250> more<00:01:11.250> feedback

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
more modern sound and more feedback

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.679 
more modern sound and more feedback
resistance<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:15.000> an<00:01:15.150> on-stage

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
resistance so so in an on-stage

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.280 
resistance so so in an on-stage
situation<00:01:16.619> lots<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.070> hollow<00:01:17.490> bodies<00:01:17.909> well<00:01:18.780> you

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
situation lots of hollow bodies well you

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.440 
situation lots of hollow bodies well you
know<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:19.650> feedback<00:01:20.130> crazy<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.270> won't

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
know just feedback crazy and you won't

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.210 
know just feedback crazy and you won't
be<00:01:21.600> able<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.900> really<00:01:22.140> hear<00:01:22.409> what<00:01:23.040> you're

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
be able to really hear what you're

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
be able to really hear what you're
playing<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:25.220> you<00:01:26.220> know<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.909> thing<00:01:27.090> it's

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
playing and you know on this thing it's

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.880 
playing and you know on this thing it's
a<00:01:27.330> lot<00:01:27.450> better<00:01:27.630> won't<00:01:28.140> pick<00:01:28.320> up<00:01:28.439> everything

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
a lot better won't pick up everything

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.740 
a lot better won't pick up everything
but<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.280> still<00:01:29.549> get<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.729> really<00:01:29.939> nice<00:01:30.390> rich

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
but you still get that really nice rich

00:01:30.750 --> 00:02:15.420 
but you still get that really nice rich
hollow<00:01:31.049> body

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.130 

and<00:02:16.430> then<00:02:16.550> of<00:02:16.640> course<00:02:16.730> if<00:02:17.330> you<00:02:17.480> turn<00:02:17.690> down<00:02:17.930> one

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
and then of course if you turn down one

00:02:18.140 --> 00:03:42.390 
and then of course if you turn down one
pickup

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:04:00.949 

you

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.920 

so<00:04:01.959> that's<00:04:02.769> basically<00:04:03.340> it<00:04:03.640> you<00:04:03.939> know<00:04:04.569> you<00:04:04.629> can

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
so that's basically it you know you can

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.110 
so that's basically it you know you can
always<00:04:05.620> change<00:04:06.129> your<00:04:06.280> settings<00:04:06.730> on<00:04:06.849> your<00:04:07.000> app

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
always change your settings on your app

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.179 
always change your settings on your app
get<00:04:07.420> lots<00:04:07.629> of<00:04:07.780> distortion<00:04:08.349> and<00:04:08.530> stuff<00:04:08.739> and

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:09.189 
get lots of distortion and stuff and

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:11.280 
get lots of distortion and stuff and
with<00:04:09.489> again<00:04:09.909> the<00:04:10.239> smaller<00:04:10.480> body<00:04:10.780> size<00:04:10.900> you

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
with again the smaller body size you

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.750 
with again the smaller body size you
won't<00:04:11.470> get<00:04:11.620> as<00:04:11.709> much<00:04:11.799> feedback<00:04:12.099> as<00:04:12.310> you<00:04:12.549> would

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
won't get as much feedback as you would

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.819 
won't get as much feedback as you would
with<00:04:12.909> a<00:04:12.939> normal<00:04:13.480> home<00:04:13.629> what<00:04:13.930> are<00:04:14.019> you<00:04:14.140> trying

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
with a normal home what are you trying

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.189 
with a normal home what are you trying
to<00:04:14.890> pump<00:04:15.129> distortion<00:04:15.730> through<00:04:16.060> it<00:04:16.150> so<00:04:16.750> this<00:04:17.019> is

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
to pump distortion through it so this is

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:18.960 
to pump distortion through it so this is
a<00:04:17.229> lot<00:04:17.530> more<00:04:17.709> versatile<00:04:18.190> than<00:04:18.489> most<00:04:18.669> hollow

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
a lot more versatile than most hollow

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.370 
a lot more versatile than most hollow
bodies<00:04:19.329> but<00:04:19.479> you<00:04:19.539> still<00:04:19.810> get<00:04:19.989> that<00:04:20.019> really

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
bodies but you still get that really

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.870 
bodies but you still get that really
nice<00:04:21.210> nice<00:04:22.240> almost<00:04:22.990> acoustic<00:04:23.620> sound<00:04:23.919> lots<00:04:24.639> of

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
nice nice almost acoustic sound lots of

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.860 
nice nice almost acoustic sound lots of
richness<00:04:25.360> and<00:04:26.400> lots<00:04:27.400> of<00:04:27.610> nice<00:04:28.030> overtones<00:04:28.600> in

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
richness and lots of nice overtones in

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.469 
richness and lots of nice overtones in
there<00:04:30.389> so<00:04:31.979> you<00:04:32.979> know<00:04:33.100> this<00:04:33.250> was<00:04:33.460> more<00:04:34.240> of<00:04:34.270> the

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
there so you know this was more of the

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.480 
there so you know this was more of the
favorite<00:04:34.840> of<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.020> Beatles<00:04:35.350> they<00:04:35.710> liked<00:04:35.979> their

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
favorite of the Beatles they liked their

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.469 
favorite of the Beatles they liked their
offers<00:04:37.060> the<00:04:38.580> violin<00:04:39.580> bass<00:04:39.760> and<00:04:40.120> their<00:04:40.240> club
