read<00:00:14.990> about<00:00:15.110> it<00:00:15.349> but<00:00:15.559> it<00:00:16.070> takes<00:00:16.309> rust<00:00:16.610> out<00:00:16.850> I

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090

all these little grooves inside the
holes<00:00:21.440> and<00:00:21.860> and<00:00:22.460> I<00:00:22.520> just<00:00:22.550> didn't<00:00:22.910> feel<00:00:23.060> like

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:23.120 
holes and and I just didn't feel like

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.330 
holes and and I just didn't feel like
grinding<00:00:23.720> and<00:00:23.900> sandblasting<00:00:24.890> and<00:00:24.980> trying<00:00:25.250> to

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
grinding and sandblasting and trying to

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.130

by twelves and just screw them down

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.659 
by twelves and just screw them down
it'll<00:01:57.560> be<00:01:57.649> a<00:01:57.679> little<00:01:57.829> heavy<00:01:58.069> but<00:01:58.189> at<00:01:58.369> least<00:01:58.459> so

00:01:58.659 --> 00:01:58.669 
it'll be a little heavy but at least so

00:01:58.669 --> 00:02:01.359 
it'll be a little heavy but at least so
be<00:01:58.819> durable<00:01:59.119> but<00:01:59.929> that's<00:02:00.529> what<00:02:00.679> it<00:02:00.770> is<00:02:00.799> this

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
be durable but that's what it is this

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.510 
be durable but that's what it is this
inside<00:02:01.909> dimension<00:02:02.569> is<00:02:03.139> thirty<00:02:03.590> inches<00:02:04.039> length

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
inside dimension is thirty inches length

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.139 
inside dimension is thirty inches length
okay<00:02:05.640> by<00:02:06.090> 22<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.600> 3/4<00:02:07.459> across<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.060> you

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
okay by 22 and 3/4 across and that you

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.250 
okay by 22 and 3/4 across and that you
can<00:02:09.269> see<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.569> just<00:02:10.190> just<00:02:11.190> fits<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.700> scene<00:02:12.260> and

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
can see it just just fits the scene and

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.559 
can see it just just fits the scene and
the<00:02:14.040> top<00:02:14.250> part<00:02:14.459> of<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.580> seat<00:02:14.730> will<00:02:14.819> fit<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.209> so

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
the top part of the seat will fit to so

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.259 
the top part of the seat will fit to so
this<00:02:16.080> really<00:02:16.319> is<00:02:16.560> specific<00:02:17.099> to<00:02:17.129> the<00:02:17.519> seat<00:02:17.970> and

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
this really is specific to the seat and

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.110 
this really is specific to the seat and
I<00:02:18.780> didn't<00:02:18.959> want<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.170> get<00:02:19.290> into<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:20.120> situation

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
I didn't want to get into the situation

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.509 
I didn't want to get into the situation
where<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.629> built<00:02:21.989> one<00:02:22.379> Universal<00:02:23.040> box<00:02:23.220> for<00:02:23.459> a

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
where I built one Universal box for a

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:24.259 
where I built one Universal box for a
bunch<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.849> parts

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
bunch of parts

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.240 
bunch of parts
I<00:02:24.299> built<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.049> cheap<00:02:25.349> just<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.739> do<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.980> seats

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
I built it cheap just to do the seats

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.210 
I built it cheap just to do the seats
and<00:02:26.629> if<00:02:27.629> it<00:02:28.049> works<00:02:28.290> I'll<00:02:28.470> maybe<00:02:28.590> save<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.010> box

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
and if it works I'll maybe save the box

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.710 
and if it works I'll maybe save the box
otherwise<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.790> can<00:02:29.940> just<00:02:30.120> take<00:02:30.269> some<00:02:30.450> screws

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
otherwise I can just take some screws

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.170 
otherwise I can just take some screws
screw<00:02:31.049> it<00:02:31.140> apart<00:02:31.410> chuck<00:02:31.769> it<00:02:31.920> in<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.180> garbage

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
screw it apart chuck it in the garbage

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.220 
screw it apart chuck it in the garbage
and<00:02:33.510> I'm<00:02:34.049> on<00:02:34.260> my<00:02:34.410> way<00:02:34.610> but<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:36.810> other<00:02:36.989> reason

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
and I'm on my way but the other reason

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.949 
and I'm on my way but the other reason
why<00:02:37.319> I<00:02:37.349> wanted<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.650> do<00:02:37.739> two<00:02:38.010> by<00:02:38.220> twelves<00:02:38.670> was<00:02:39.239> if

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
why I wanted to do two by twelves was if

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.180 
why I wanted to do two by twelves was if
I<00:02:40.440> do<00:02:40.500> my<00:02:40.860> rear<00:02:41.190> end<00:02:41.220> my<00:02:41.970> differential<00:02:42.890> if<00:02:43.890> this

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
I do my rear end my differential if this

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.630 
I do my rear end my differential if this
does<00:02:44.519> work<00:02:44.549> I<00:02:45.180> can<00:02:46.110> make<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.530> really<00:02:46.950> long<00:02:47.280> box

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
does work I can make a really long box

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.259 
does work I can make a really long box
skinny<00:02:48.599> put<00:02:49.380> my<00:02:49.500> put<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.280> entire<00:02:50.610> rear<00:02:50.880> end<00:02:51.090> in

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
skinny put my put the entire rear end in

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.569 
skinny put my put the entire rear end in
it<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.569> soak<00:02:52.049> it<00:02:52.230> in<00:02:52.319> vinegar<00:02:52.349> or<00:02:52.799> molasses<00:02:53.340> so

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
it and soak it in vinegar or molasses so

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.430 
it and soak it in vinegar or molasses so
this<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.239> really<00:02:54.390> just<00:02:54.510> sort<00:02:54.780> of<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.989> test<00:02:55.200> bet

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
this is really just sort of a test bet

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.059 
this is really just sort of a test bet
on<00:02:56.840> removal<00:02:57.840> of<00:02:57.959> rust<00:02:58.200> so<00:02:58.650> we'll<00:02:58.799> see<00:02:58.920> how<00:02:59.040> it

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
on removal of rust so we'll see how it

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.470 
on removal of rust so we'll see how it
goes<00:02:59.310> I'm<00:02:59.549> gonna<00:02:59.640> start<00:02:59.819> building<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.299> bottom

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
goes I'm gonna start building the bottom

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.059 
goes I'm gonna start building the bottom
on<00:03:00.810> this<00:03:00.959> thing<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.380> take<00:03:01.769> it<00:03:01.799> from<00:03:01.980> there

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
on this thing and take it from there

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.940 
on this thing and take it from there
