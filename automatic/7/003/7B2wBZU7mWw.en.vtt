00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.879
 he should go through here and here you see 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.370
 an mp3 gameplay and a free for 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.139
 all on the parquet with the mp 7 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.550
 and yes this is a 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.740
 really old gameplay probably 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.750
 still from the end of 2011 and I have to be honest 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.609
 said no idea how the gameplay so 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.880
 I just played until the end 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.289
 the goal is good this one is good but how 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.810
 I have no idea if I'm there 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.150
 somehow just played or so 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.650
 that would be said as the gameplay is 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.170
 pretty old then the game was too 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.000
 pretty new and therefore I apologize 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.320
 me for any things that you 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.300
 maybe you could not like it 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.719
 whatever the gameplay is about 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.520
 not at all, but an interview from 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.800
 gaijin entertainment these are the 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.570
 Developer of an airplane action game 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.039
 called wanda that on every pc already 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.719
 The team is buying but I think so 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.469
 the game is still in the beta phase and 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.090
 50 to release 4 should also like the game 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.609
 the ps4 appear 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.010
 and yes, by the way, this is about 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.010
 a free to play title so free to play 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.570
 you play it for free or you 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.520
 pays nothing for the game but 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.060
 probably you have any content 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.890
 with real money then buy it 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.000
 We do not always have others around that 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.080
 play it goes can I do that 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.479
 I'm really interested in it 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.729
 little but as I said about this 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.380
 interview of to do with 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.060
 a British if I am not 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.729
 Mistaken magazine called and in it they have 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.990
 said that the ps4's graphics chip so 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:37.770
 the gpu is about 40 percent stronger 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.979
 as the xbox of gpu and the ddr five 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.530
 RAM of the psp should be around 50 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.970
 percent stronger than the ddr3 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.009
 memory of the xbox when but with it 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.799
 not only bad about the xbox one 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.399
 But then they said that for talking 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:00.030
 that the ddr3 memory for others 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.579
 advantages brings the ddr5 memory 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.040
 just does not bring with it now 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:09.080
 purely in terms of performance is the 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.780
 ps4 stronger in terms of graphics and 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.230
 the reason that meant why 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.140
 game 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.700
 just for the ps4 next to the pc appear 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.080
 and not for the xbox 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.659
 that is that the 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.330
 terms of business of sony more appropriate 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:30.030
 for online titles are as the of 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.879
 microsoft because they said that sony im 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.629
 contrary to microsoft cross platform 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:39.510
 So gaming permits that eg pc player 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:42.750
 and ps4 players play with each other 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.410
 can and simultaneous patches so for 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.180
 for the pc and for the ps4 and yes 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.579
 of course it is for a developer 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.310
 a huge advantage if only one 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:57.829
 patch must bring instead of three patches 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:02.760
 and that's why it's for some developers 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:04.829
 very attractive what makes sony and yes 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.319
 As I said the game will be released on 29 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.489
 november but i think so many will 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.980
 that does not interest now is now 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.780
 no must have at least that was not 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.459
 so announced and i honestly 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.920
 said nothing of it until today 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.290
 but maybe for those who have it 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.130
 interested purely in performance is 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.349
 the graphics of the ps4 is stronger now 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.010
 but the question that it was pendant 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:32.099
 ps3 also had the stronger ps3 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.440
 graphics as the xbox 360 finally 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:38.459
 but you could not notice anything because 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.400
 to my opinion there was the xbox 360 already 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:44.280
 half a year before 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:48.389
 wilson a year and a half ago exactly 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:52.440
 something like that appeared in autumn 2005 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:54.540
 and the ps3 in spring 2007 and by 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.879
 most developers have already 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.919
 the xbox 360 as main 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.859
 Development platform had that is 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:06.120
 the ps3 could not use your graphics 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:07.859
 because they because the developers yes one 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.079
 scale and the scale was 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.819
 of course the 260 otherwise they would have 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.079
 develop two different games 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.510
 you just have to have it for that 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:18.060
 developed xbox 360 and then for the ps3 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.780
 converted as exclusive title has wrapped 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.539
 it's a bit different, of course 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.460
 but now the question is whether 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:25.140
 maybe the one about the same time 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.880
 release an advantage with it 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.640
 that brings the developers for the 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.310
 ps 41 will develop or become like that again 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:36.690
 be that graphically weaker 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.730
 console again the preference at the 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.370
 development will get the result 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.900
 Developers have an easier job 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.460
 you can maybe in the 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.900
 Comments write something about it 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.900
 think and see you next time
