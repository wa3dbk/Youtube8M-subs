00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
size-wise you can see as I'm grabbing it

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.350 
size-wise you can see as I'm grabbing it
how<00:01:16.770> small<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.340> item<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.060> actually

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
how small this item is this is actually

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.800 
how small this item is this is actually
my<00:01:18.450> laptop<00:01:18.840> right<00:01:19.080> here<00:01:19.640> it<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:21.180> actually

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
my laptop right here it is actually

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.070 
my laptop right here it is actually
smaller<00:01:22.170> than<00:01:22.439> my<00:01:22.619> 15-inch<00:01:23.400> MacBook<00:01:23.780> Pro<00:01:24.780> here

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
smaller than my 15-inch MacBook Pro here

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.929 
smaller than my 15-inch MacBook Pro here
so<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.320> can<00:01:25.530> kind<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.310> get<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> sense<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
so you can kind of get a sense of the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.050 
so you can kind of get a sense of the
scale<00:01:27.320> in<00:01:28.320> terms<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.680> thinness<00:01:29.100> slides

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
into a backpack really nicely one of the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.810 
into a backpack really nicely one of the
coolest<00:01:34.380> things<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:34.920> nano<00:01:35.130> key<00:01:35.400> -<00:01:35.610> is

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
coolest things on this nano key - is

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.620 
coolest things on this nano key - is
just<00:01:36.090> how<00:01:36.390> they<00:01:36.689> have<00:01:36.930> redesigned<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.710> keys

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
just how they have redesigned the keys

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.710 
just how they have redesigned the keys
as<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.840> can<00:01:39.990> see<00:01:40.310> they<00:01:41.310> are<00:01:41.340> raised<00:01:42.210> from<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
as you can see they are raised from the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.170 
as you can see they are raised from the
surface<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.350> one<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.909> probably<00:01:44.909> one<00:01:45.149> of

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
surface but one of the probably one of

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.609 
surface but one of the probably one of
the<00:01:45.299> biggest<00:01:45.570> complaints<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.170> Nano<00:01:46.380> key

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
the biggest complaints of the Nano key

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.639 
the biggest complaints of the Nano key
one<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.250> original<00:01:49.430> was<00:01:50.430> these<00:01:50.610> keys<00:01:51.119> which

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
one the original was these keys which

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.020 
one the original was these keys which
may<00:01:52.649> be<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.829> little<00:01:53.070> hard<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.340> see<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.759> video

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
may be a little hard to see in the video

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.380 
may be a little hard to see in the video
here<00:01:54.060> but<00:01:54.360> these<00:01:54.509> are<00:01:54.570> essentially<00:01:55.229> just<00:01:55.439> like

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
here but these are essentially just like

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.670 
here but these are essentially just like
computer<00:01:57.390> keys<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.020> might<00:01:58.200> like<00:01:58.380> find

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
computer keys that you might like find

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.160 
computer keys that you might like find
on<00:01:58.860> your<00:01:58.979> your<00:01:59.640> laptop<00:02:00.119> keyboard<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.020> they

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
on your your laptop keyboard and so they

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.690 
on your your laptop keyboard and so they
tend<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.469> be<00:02:01.560> really<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:03.649> little<00:02:04.649> um<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.369> don't

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
tend to be really a little um I don't

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.419 
tend to be really a little um I don't
know<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.880> little<00:02:06.030> cheap<00:02:06.450> or<00:02:06.719> they<00:02:06.840> can<00:02:07.280> you<00:02:08.280> can

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
know a little cheap or they can you can

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.520 
know a little cheap or they can you can
see<00:02:08.640> on<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.879> edge<00:02:09.030> like<00:02:09.420> as<00:02:09.599> you're<00:02:09.810> maybe

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
see on the edge like as you're maybe

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.630 
see on the edge like as you're maybe
pulling<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.069> out<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.280> your<00:02:11.430> bag

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
pulling it out of your bag

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.890 
pulling it out of your bag
these<00:02:13.980> these<00:02:14.980> keys<00:02:15.400> can<00:02:15.850> they<00:02:16.060> can<00:02:16.210> catch<00:02:16.510> you

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
these these keys can they can catch you

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.600 
these these keys can they can catch you
know<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.410> you<00:02:17.770> know<00:02:17.890> like<00:02:18.040> these<00:02:18.190> things<00:02:18.430> have

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
know and you know like these things have

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.170 
know and you know like these things have
been<00:02:18.850> known<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.780> come<00:02:20.110> off

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
been known to come off

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.350 
been known to come off
they<00:02:22.840> are<00:02:22.960> velocity<00:02:23.500> sensitive<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:25.000> you<00:02:25.270> know

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
they are velocity sensitive to you know

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.900 
they are velocity sensitive to you know
to<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.570> degree<00:02:25.750> this<00:02:26.050> is<00:02:26.110> not<00:02:26.350> exactly<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:26.910> super

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
to a degree this is not exactly a super

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.660 
to a degree this is not exactly a super
high-end<00:02:28.090> keyboard<00:02:28.720> but<00:02:28.960> um<00:02:29.460> anyways<00:02:30.460> I<00:02:30.610> guess

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
high-end keyboard but um anyways I guess

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.750 
high-end keyboard but um anyways I guess
the<00:02:30.880> point<00:02:31.090> is<00:02:31.240> that<00:02:31.360> this<00:02:31.480> nano<00:02:31.690> key<00:02:31.960> to<00:02:32.760> these

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
the point is that this nano key to these

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.290 
the point is that this nano key to these
keys<00:02:34.060> are<00:02:34.090> much<00:02:34.660> more<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.940> know<00:02:37.030> they<00:02:37.150> are

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
keys are much more you know they are

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.570 
keys are much more you know they are
still<00:02:37.560> kind<00:02:38.560> of<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.709> same<00:02:38.740> design<00:02:39.340> they're

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
still kind of the same design they're

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.600 
still kind of the same design they're
still<00:02:39.790> plastic<00:02:42.000> but<00:02:43.000> there<00:02:43.270> have<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.990> much<00:02:44.610> much

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
still plastic but there have a much much

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.910 
still plastic but there have a much much
more<00:02:45.790> elegant<00:02:46.270> feel<00:02:46.510> they're<00:02:46.810> not<00:02:46.920> they

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
more elegant feel they're not they

00:02:47.920 --> 00:03:02.670 
more elegant feel they're not they
definitely<00:02:48.160> feel<00:02:48.510> better<00:02:49.510> made<00:03:01.650> here<00:03:02.650> a

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
definitely feel better made here a

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.040 
definitely feel better made here a
little<00:03:02.830> bit<00:03:02.950> of<00:03:03.070> velocity<00:03:03.580> sensitivity<00:03:04.060> I've

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
little bit of velocity sensitivity I've

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.199 
little bit of velocity sensitivity I've
got<00:03:05.230> an<00:03:05.320> octave<00:03:05.680> up<00:03:05.830> and<00:03:06.160> down<00:03:06.520> button<00:03:06.940> here<00:03:07.180> so

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
got an octave up and down button here so

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.420 
got an octave up and down button here so
if<00:03:07.750> I<00:03:07.870> go<00:03:08.020> up<00:03:08.320> a<00:03:08.440> couple<00:03:08.650> octaves<00:03:08.860> we'll<00:03:09.310> be

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
if I go up a couple octaves we'll be

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:17.699 
if I go up a couple octaves we'll be
back<00:03:09.610> in<00:03:09.790> our<00:03:09.910> tenor<00:03:15.270> octave<00:03:16.270> a<00:03:16.989> couple<00:03:17.560> other

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
back in our tenor octave a couple other

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.340 
back in our tenor octave a couple other
things<00:03:18.340> in<00:03:18.940> here<00:03:19.060> they've<00:03:19.239> got<00:03:19.269> a<00:03:19.390> sustain

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
things in here they've got a sustain

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.220 
things in here they've got a sustain
pedal<00:03:20.380> which<00:03:21.070> is<00:03:21.190> actually<00:03:21.519> really<00:03:22.510> nice<00:03:22.840> if

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
pedal which is actually really nice if

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.789 
pedal which is actually really nice if
we<00:03:23.530> load<00:03:23.920> in<00:03:24.070> one<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.370> our<00:03:24.580> virtual<00:03:24.970> drum<00:03:25.209> line

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
we load in one of our virtual drum line

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.370 
we load in one of our virtual drum line
sustain<00:03:26.799> instruments<00:03:27.610> which<00:03:28.019> let's<00:03:29.019> just<00:03:29.230> go

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
sustain instruments which let's just go

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.560 
sustain instruments which let's just go
to<00:03:29.440> like<00:03:29.590> a<00:03:29.650> vibraphone<00:03:30.340> with<00:03:30.610> sustain<00:03:31.120> pedal

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
to like a vibraphone with sustain pedal

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:39.020 
to like a vibraphone with sustain pedal
control<00:03:35.549> that<00:03:36.549> will<00:03:37.390> allow<00:03:38.019> us<00:03:38.049> to<00:03:38.260> actually

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
control that will allow us to actually

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.220 
control that will allow us to actually
hear<00:03:40.030> what<00:03:40.209> would<00:03:40.299> happen<00:03:40.600> is<00:03:40.720> if<00:03:40.870> we<00:03:40.900> had<00:03:41.200> a

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
hear what would happen is if we had a

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.330 
hear what would happen is if we had a
actual<00:03:41.680> sustain<00:03:42.299> pedal<00:03:43.620> on<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.860> instrument

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
actual sustain pedal on the instrument

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.160 
actual sustain pedal on the instrument
so<00:03:47.070> regularly<00:03:48.660> without<00:03:49.660> a<00:03:49.690> sustain<00:03:50.140> pedal

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
so regularly without a sustain pedal

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.090 
so regularly without a sustain pedal
down<00:03:52.019> you're<00:03:53.019> going<00:03:53.110> to<00:03:53.200> hear<00:03:53.410> it<00:03:53.530> as<00:03:53.739> if<00:03:53.920> the

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
down you're going to hear it as if the

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.190 
down you're going to hear it as if the
the<00:03:54.340> vibraphone<00:03:54.640> is<00:03:54.880> being<00:03:55.090> muted<00:03:55.450> with<00:03:56.080> the

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
the vibraphone is being muted with the

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.250 
the vibraphone is being muted with the
sustain<00:03:56.590> pedal<00:03:56.620> being<00:03:57.430> held

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
sustain pedal being held

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.720 
sustain pedal being held
and<00:04:00.360> it's<00:04:01.360> going<00:04:01.480> to<00:04:01.540> actually<00:04:02.459> ring<00:04:03.459> as<00:04:03.640> if

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
and it's going to actually ring as if

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.589 
and it's going to actually ring as if
I've<00:04:03.879> got<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.120> pedal<00:04:04.420> down<00:04:05.940> I'm<00:04:06.940> holding<00:04:07.510> the

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
I've got the pedal down I'm holding the

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.330 
I've got the pedal down I'm holding the
camera<00:04:07.629> with<00:04:07.989> my<00:04:08.230> other<00:04:08.379> hand<00:04:08.470> so<00:04:08.980> I'm<00:04:09.129> not

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
camera with my other hand so I'm not

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.220 
camera with my other hand so I'm not
able<00:04:09.610> to<00:04:09.849> really<00:04:10.150> give<00:04:10.659> a<00:04:10.690> good<00:04:10.780> demonstration

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
able to really give a good demonstration

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.850 
able to really give a good demonstration
of<00:04:11.680> this<00:04:11.890> but<00:04:12.129> you'll<00:04:12.790> notice<00:04:13.000> as<00:04:13.269> I<00:04:13.299> let<00:04:13.569> go

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
of this but you'll notice as I let go

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.699 
of this but you'll notice as I let go
the<00:04:14.860> sustain<00:04:15.280> pedal<00:04:15.930> that<00:04:16.930> all<00:04:17.109> stops<00:04:17.410> ringing

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
the sustain pedal that all stops ringing

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.530 
the sustain pedal that all stops ringing
so<00:04:18.430> that's<00:04:18.549> kind<00:04:18.729> of<00:04:18.760> cool

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
so that's kind of cool

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
so that's kind of cool
may<00:04:20.500> not<00:04:20.650> be<00:04:21.690> super<00:04:22.690> important<00:04:23.139> to<00:04:23.199> a<00:04:23.290> lot<00:04:23.530> of

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
may not be super important to a lot of

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.110 
may not be super important to a lot of
you<00:04:23.740> who<00:04:23.889> are<00:04:23.949> using<00:04:24.100> virtual<00:04:24.400> drum<00:04:24.669> line<00:04:24.880> but

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
you who are using virtual drum line but

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.620 
you who are using virtual drum line but
it<00:04:26.050> isn't<00:04:26.320> nice<00:04:26.440> a<00:04:26.740> nice<00:04:27.250> new<00:04:27.460> feature<00:04:27.490> but<00:04:28.120> you

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
it isn't nice a nice new feature but you

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.450 
it isn't nice a nice new feature but you
do<00:04:28.750> a<00:04:28.780> full<00:04:29.080> access<00:04:29.410> to<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.830> range<00:04:30.040> by<00:04:30.280> hitting

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
do a full access to the range by hitting

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.279 
do a full access to the range by hitting
these<00:04:30.610> octave<00:04:31.030> up<00:04:31.210> and<00:04:31.360> down<00:04:31.510> buttons<00:04:32.020> and<00:04:32.229> you

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
these octave up and down buttons and you

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:36.000 
these octave up and down buttons and you
can<00:04:32.470> see<00:04:32.650> as<00:04:32.830> I<00:04:32.949> hit<00:04:33.160> it<00:04:33.190> again<00:04:34.289> the<00:04:35.289> color<00:04:35.830> of

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
can see as I hit it again the color of

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.129 
can see as I hit it again the color of
the<00:04:36.100> button<00:04:36.220> changes<00:04:36.880> that's<00:04:37.600> I<00:04:37.750> think<00:04:37.810> at<00:04:38.050> the

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
the button changes that's I think at the

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.469 
the button changes that's I think at the
highest<00:04:38.550> level<00:04:39.550> there<00:04:39.760> you'll<00:04:39.940> see<00:04:40.120> I<00:04:40.150> start

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
highest level there you'll see I start

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.750
