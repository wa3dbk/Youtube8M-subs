and<00:00:39.800> this<00:00:41.109> liquid-fueled<00:00:42.109> one<00:00:42.289> uses<00:00:42.739> some

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
and this liquid-fueled one uses some

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.689 
and this liquid-fueled one uses some
liquid<00:00:43.309> fuels<00:00:43.640> to<00:00:44.030> do<00:00:44.149> that<00:00:44.390> so<00:00:45.460> that's<00:00:46.460> the

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
liquid fuels to do that so that's the

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.599 
liquid fuels to do that so that's the
block<00:00:46.940> as<00:00:47.239> is<00:00:47.539> you<00:00:48.469> don't<00:00:48.649> actually<00:00:48.859> see<00:00:49.159> the

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
block as is you don't actually see the

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:52.719 
block as is you don't actually see the
interface<00:00:50.030> for<00:00:50.210> it<00:00:50.390> until<00:00:50.600> we<00:00:51.019> get<00:00:51.170> a<00:00:51.729> boiler

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:52.729 
interface for it until we get a boiler

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:58.349 
interface for it until we get a boiler
on<00:00:53.359> top<00:00:55.539> like<00:00:56.539> so<00:00:56.589> so<00:00:57.589> now<00:00:57.769> if<00:00:57.859> we<00:00:57.920> have<00:00:58.100> a<00:00:58.129> look

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
on top like so so now if we have a look

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.450 
on top like so so now if we have a look
what<00:00:59.359> we<00:00:59.479> can<00:00:59.629> see<00:00:59.780> is<00:00:59.960> this<00:01:00.109> is<00:01:00.319> a<00:01:00.460> steam

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
what we can see is this is a steam

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.439 
what we can see is this is a steam
output<00:01:03.159> the<00:01:04.159> temperature<00:01:04.580> gauge<00:01:04.790> is<00:01:05.150> right

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
output the temperature gauge is right

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.980 
output the temperature gauge is right
here<00:01:05.860> this<00:01:06.860> is<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:07.610> progress<00:01:07.940> on<00:01:08.479> burning<00:01:08.930> up

with<00:01:32.300> is<00:01:32.510> the<00:01:32.540> fact<00:01:32.810> that<00:01:32.960> we<00:01:33.770> can<00:01:33.950> put<00:01:34.130> liquid

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
with is the fact that we can put liquid

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.150 
with is the fact that we can put liquid
in<00:01:34.580> instead<00:01:35.180> of<00:01:35.240> a<00:01:35.480> solid<00:01:36.110> fuel<00:01:36.380> now<00:01:36.620> this<00:01:36.830> on

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
in instead of a solid fuel now this on

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.010 
in instead of a solid fuel now this on
the<00:01:37.480> fuel<00:01:38.480> fired<00:01:39.080> solid<00:01:39.680> fuel<00:01:39.890> box<00:01:40.810> we<00:01:41.810> had

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
the fuel fired solid fuel box we had

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.050 
the fuel fired solid fuel box we had
four<00:01:42.320> slots<00:01:42.650> so<00:01:42.920> there's<00:01:43.100> three<00:01:43.370> here<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:43.850> one

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
four slots so there's three here and one

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.530 
four slots so there's three here and one
main<00:01:44.300> slot<00:01:44.600> here<00:01:44.930> where<00:01:45.920> we<00:01:46.040> could<00:01:46.280> put<00:01:47.240> in<00:01:47.390> our

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
main slot here where we could put in our

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.270 
main slot here where we could put in our
coal<00:01:47.870> charcoal<00:01:48.590> or<00:01:48.890> coal<00:01:49.340> coke<00:01:50.050> I<00:01:51.050> think<00:01:52.040> blaze

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
coal charcoal or coal coke I think blaze

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.120 
coal charcoal or coal coke I think blaze

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.220 
we have here the creosote biofuel and
the<00:02:24.840> fuel<00:02:25.970> so<00:02:26.970> if<00:02:27.180> we<00:02:27.360> go<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.660> have<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.810> look<00:02:27.989> I

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
the fuel so if we go and have a look I

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.559 
the fuel so if we go and have a look I
will<00:02:28.440> drop<00:02:28.910> one<00:02:29.910> capsule<00:02:30.360> of<00:02:30.510> each<00:02:34.280> in<00:02:35.280> each

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
will drop one capsule of each in each

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.080 
will drop one capsule of each in each
firebox<00:02:36.569> so<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.900> we<00:02:36.989> can<00:02:37.170> see<00:02:37.470> how<00:02:38.190> warm<00:02:38.519> they

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
firebox so that we can see how warm they

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:46.190 
firebox so that we can see how warm they
get<00:02:40.190> off<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.670> one<00:02:42.799> off<00:02:43.799> of<00:02:44.160> one<00:02:44.459> unit<00:02:45.209> fuel<00:02:45.480> and

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
get off of one off of one unit fuel and

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.460 
get off of one off of one unit fuel and
as<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.470> can<00:02:46.590> see<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:47.310> creosote<00:02:48.290> seems<00:02:49.290> to

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
as you can see the creosote seems to

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.069 
as you can see the creosote seems to
begin<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:49.860> burn<00:02:50.010> up<00:02:50.040> extremely<00:02:50.670> quickly

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
begin and burn up extremely quickly

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:56.780 
begin and burn up extremely quickly
we're<00:02:52.079> up<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:54.739> 114<00:02:55.739> degrees<00:02:56.220> before<00:02:56.640> that

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
we're up to 114 degrees before that

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.339 
we're up to 114 degrees before that
cools<00:02:57.090> down<00:02:59.329> which<00:03:00.329> is<00:03:00.480> just<00:03:00.690> enough<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.079> start

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
cools down which is just enough to start

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.850 
cools down which is just enough to start
steam<00:03:01.799> production<00:03:02.099> off<00:03:02.549> of<00:03:02.760> one<00:03:03.680> well<00:03:04.680> let's

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
steam production off of one well let's

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.050 
steam production off of one well let's
call<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.160> camp<00:03:05.370> shop<00:03:05.579> where<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:05.760> could<00:03:05.940> be<00:03:05.970> a

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
call it camp shop where it could be a

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.800 
call it camp shop where it could be a
bucket<00:03:07.340> now<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:10.700> this<00:03:11.700> one<00:03:11.940> was<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.090> biofuel

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
bucket now the this one was the biofuel

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.110 
bucket now the this one was the biofuel
as<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:13.620> can<00:03:13.709> see<00:03:13.860> this<00:03:14.010> is<00:03:14.190> still<00:03:14.430> burning<00:03:14.700> and

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
as you can see this is still burning and

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.300 
as you can see this is still burning and
it's<00:03:15.599> still<00:03:15.810> going<00:03:16.049> up<00:03:16.170> so<00:03:16.410> biofuel<00:03:16.860> is<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.010> lot

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
it's still going up so biofuel is a lot

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.440 
it's still going up so biofuel is a lot
more<00:03:17.519> efficient<00:03:17.910> than<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.180> creosote<00:03:18.950> which

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
more efficient than the creosote which

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.039 
more efficient than the creosote which
has<00:03:21.450> already<00:03:21.780> done<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:22.739> dusted<00:03:22.950> so<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:24.810> fuel

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
has already done and dusted so the fuel

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.340 
has already done and dusted so the fuel
you<00:03:25.200> use<00:03:25.470> does<00:03:25.799> make<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.040> difference<00:03:26.480> now<00:03:27.480> this

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
you use does make a difference now this

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.449 
you use does make a difference now this
is<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.560> regular<00:03:29.549> fuel<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.329> this<00:03:30.450> looks<00:03:30.959> like<00:03:31.459> it

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
is a regular fuel and this looks like it

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.180 
is a regular fuel and this looks like it
might<00:03:32.639> actually<00:03:32.940> be<00:03:33.480> lasting<00:03:34.410> even<00:03:34.920> longer

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
might actually be lasting even longer

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.170 
might actually be lasting even longer
than<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:36.139> biofuel<00:03:37.139> but<00:03:38.069> I<00:03:38.310> would<00:03:38.519> expect<00:03:38.609> them

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
than the biofuel but I would expect them

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.229 
than the biofuel but I would expect them
under<00:03:39.780> normal<00:03:40.019> situations<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:41.489> last<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.060> same

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
under normal situations to last the same

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.650 
under normal situations to last the same
amount<00:03:42.480> of<00:03:42.510> time<00:03:43.069> so<00:03:44.069> I'm<00:03:44.549> going<00:03:44.849> to<00:03:44.910> leave

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
amount of time so I'm going to leave

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.000 
amount of time so I'm going to leave
this<00:03:45.840> this<00:03:46.079> looks<00:03:46.349> like<00:03:46.470> it's<00:03:46.650> going<00:03:46.769> to<00:03:46.859> take

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
this this looks like it's going to take

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.289 
this this looks like it's going to take
quite<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.280> bit<00:03:47.459> of<00:03:47.549> time<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:47.880> you<00:03:47.970> don't<00:03:48.120> want

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
quite a bit of time and you don't want

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.349 
quite a bit of time and you don't want
to<00:03:48.359> be<00:03:48.450> watching<00:03:48.569> it<00:03:49.790> so<00:03:50.790> we'll<00:03:50.970> leave<00:03:51.120> this

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
to be watching it so we'll leave this

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.300 
to be watching it so we'll leave this
and<00:03:51.690> come<00:03:51.930> back<00:03:52.049> to<00:03:52.200> it<00:03:52.230> in<00:03:52.349> a<00:03:52.410> moment<00:03:52.560> all

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
and come back to it in a moment all

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.970 
and come back to it in a moment all
right<00:03:53.430> okay<00:03:53.910> we're<00:03:54.209> back<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.900> as<00:03:55.470> you<00:03:55.560> can<00:03:55.739> see

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
right okay we're back and as you can see

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.339 
right okay we're back and as you can see
this<00:03:56.220> biofuel<00:03:56.970> one<00:03:57.180> is<00:03:57.359> almost<00:03:57.630> one<00:03:57.959> out<00:03:58.109> and

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
this biofuel one is almost one out and

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.949 
this biofuel one is almost one out and
this<00:03:59.310> steam<00:03:59.700> boiler<00:03:59.940> is<00:04:00.120> actually<00:04:00.480> almost<00:04:00.630> our

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
this steam boiler is actually almost our

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.390 
this steam boiler is actually almost our
maximum<00:04:01.380> temperature<00:04:01.829> now<00:04:01.980> these<00:04:02.130> are

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
maximum temperature now these are

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.289 
maximum temperature now these are
high-pressure<00:04:03.859> boilers<00:04:04.859> on<00:04:05.010> top<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:06.060> he<00:04:06.180> is

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
high-pressure boilers on top and he is

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.530 
high-pressure boilers on top and he is
only<00:04:06.450> a<00:04:06.540> single<00:04:06.870> one<00:04:07.489> maybe<00:04:08.489> I<00:04:08.669> should<00:04:09.000> have

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
only a single one maybe I should have

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.690 
only a single one maybe I should have
picked<00:04:09.870> something<00:04:10.139> a<00:04:10.410> little<00:04:10.950> bit<00:04:11.069> bigger<00:04:11.310> to

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
picked something a little bit bigger to

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.830 
picked something a little bit bigger to
show<00:04:12.859> and<00:04:13.940> actually<00:04:14.940> as<00:04:15.090> you<00:04:15.269> can<00:04:15.329> see<00:04:15.599> this

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
show and actually as you can see this

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.680 
show and actually as you can see this
one<00:04:16.169> is<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:17.160> fuel<00:04:17.519> and<00:04:18.859> it<00:04:19.859> still<00:04:20.430> got<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.239> lot

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
one is the fuel and it still got a lot

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.930 
one is the fuel and it still got a lot
of<00:04:22.160> oil<00:04:24.169> the<00:04:25.169> fuel<00:04:25.500> lasts<00:04:26.099> an<00:04:26.460> awful<00:04:26.789> lot

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
of oil the fuel lasts an awful lot

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.649 
of oil the fuel lasts an awful lot
longer<00:04:27.120> than<00:04:27.630> the<00:04:27.750> biofuel<00:04:28.409> which<00:04:29.570> lasts<00:04:30.570> an

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:30.659 
longer than the biofuel which lasts an

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:31.920 
longer than the biofuel which lasts an
awful<00:04:30.930> lot<00:04:31.050> longer<00:04:31.169> than<00:04:31.469> the<00:04:31.590> queer

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
awful lot longer than the queer

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.900 
awful lot longer than the queer
so<00:04:32.280> so<00:04:33.280> it<00:04:33.520> looks<00:04:33.759> like<00:04:35.280> this<00:04:36.280> gives<00:04:36.639> a

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
so so it looks like this gives a

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.400 
so so it looks like this gives a
legitimate<00:04:37.810> use<00:04:38.050> for<00:04:38.080> fuel<00:04:38.789> because<00:04:39.789> that<00:04:40.410> is

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
legitimate use for fuel because that is

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.640 
legitimate use for fuel because that is
last<00:04:41.710> in<00:04:41.889> an<00:04:42.009> awful<00:04:42.310> long<00:04:42.490> time<00:04:42.930> that's<00:04:43.930> very

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
last in an awful long time that's very

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.920 
last in an awful long time that's very
interesting<00:04:45.100> to<00:04:45.340> note<00:04:45.610> so<00:04:45.880> if<00:04:46.030> you<00:04:46.240> are<00:04:46.449> a<00:04:46.479> fan

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
interesting to note so if you are a fan

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.990 
interesting to note so if you are a fan
of<00:04:46.960> of<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:47.800> old<00:04:47.979> bill<00:04:48.190> craft<00:04:48.490> fuel

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
of of the old bill craft fuel

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.590 
of of the old bill craft fuel
it's<00:04:49.930> gonna<00:04:50.289> last<00:04:50.620> a<00:04:50.860> long<00:04:51.220> time<00:04:51.250> in<00:04:52.000> a<00:04:52.180> boiler

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
it's gonna last a long time in a boiler

it's gonna last a long time in a boiler
a<00:04:54.090> long<00:04:55.090> long<00:04:55.330> time<00:04:56.520> so<00:04:57.520> there<00:04:57.669> we<00:04:57.759> go<00:04:58.259> the

the biofuel and biomass it kind of

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.570 
the biofuel and biomass it kind of
killed<00:05:15.340> off<00:05:15.960> fuel<00:05:16.960> usage<00:05:17.169> because<00:05:17.830> combustion

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
killed off fuel usage because combustion

killed off fuel usage because combustion
