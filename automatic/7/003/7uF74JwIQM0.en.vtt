carotid space and just to quickly talk
about<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.030> contents<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.660> carotid<00:00:52.020> space

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
about the contents of the carotid space

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.990 
about the contents of the carotid space
carotid<00:00:52.980> space<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.340> basically<00:00:53.730> along<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
carotid space is basically along the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.549 
carotid space is basically along the
carotid<00:00:54.360> sheath<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.629> runs<00:00:54.989> from<00:00:55.050> skull<00:00:55.410> base

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
carotid sheath that runs from skull base

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.529 
carotid sheath that runs from skull base
into<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.949> root<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> neck<00:00:56.489> its<00:00:56.760> contents

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
into the root of the neck its contents

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.180 
into the root of the neck its contents
are<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.750> common<00:00:58.079> carotid<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.559> internal

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
are the common carotid the internal

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.619 
are the common carotid the internal
carotid<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.730> internal<00:01:00.120> jugular<00:01:00.329> vein

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629

sympathetic plexus so what happens when
you<00:01:05.220> get<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.369> tumor<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.880> carotid<00:01:06.150> space

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
you get a tumor in the carotid space

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.710 
you get a tumor in the carotid space
well<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.500> know<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:08.610> because<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.510> see

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
well you know you because you see

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.719 
well you know you because you see
there's<00:01:09.960> nerves<00:01:10.490> where<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.640> get

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
there's nerves where you can get

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.899 
there's nerves where you can get
paraganglioma<00:01:12.390> schwannomas<00:01:12.840> nor<00:01:12.960> fibromas

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909

out so now we're going back to the
original<00:01:40.950> case<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.570> axial<00:01:42.570> t1<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.229> can<00:01:43.380> see

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
original case on axial t1 you can see

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.050 
original case on axial t1 you can see
that<00:01:43.560> it's<00:01:43.799> fairly<00:01:44.040> well<00:01:44.280> enhancing<00:01:44.759> but<00:01:44.909> has

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
that it's fairly well enhancing but has

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.210 
that it's fairly well enhancing but has
some<00:01:45.210> areas<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.750> homogeneity<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.890> really

tumors<00:02:18.379> are<00:02:18.500> very<00:02:18.800> asymptomatic<00:02:19.370> so<00:02:19.760> they

tumors are very asymptomatic so they

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.670 
tumors are very asymptomatic so they
generally<00:02:20.269> get<00:02:20.420> very<00:02:20.690> big<00:02:20.959> before<00:02:21.230> they<00:02:21.379> are

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
generally get very big before they are

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.309 
generally get very big before they are

what's<00:02:24.620> very<00:02:24.739> important<00:02:25.370> is<00:02:25.550> no<00:02:25.640> matter<00:02:25.819> how

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
what's very important is no matter how

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
how some heterogeneity that's what helps

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.990 
how some heterogeneity that's what helps
you<00:02:39.680> differentiate<00:02:39.980> a<00:02:40.160> schwannoma<00:02:40.519> from<00:02:40.910> a

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
you differentiate a schwannoma from a

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.759 
you differentiate a schwannoma from a
neurofibroma<00:02:41.629> because<00:02:41.810> neurofibromas<00:02:42.530> tend

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
neurofibroma because neurofibromas tend

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.070

to<00:02:42.830> be<00:02:42.950> more<00:02:43.160> homogeneous<00:02:43.549> and<00:02:44.000> that<00:02:44.870> was<00:02:45.049> a

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
to be more homogeneous and that was a

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.729 
to be more homogeneous and that was a
giveaway<00:02:45.410> on<00:02:45.560> this<00:02:45.860> case<00:02:46.099> now<00:02:46.880> shwa<00:02:47.599> nomas<00:02:47.989> can

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
giveaway on this case now shwa nomas can

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.210 
giveaway on this case now shwa nomas can
enhance<00:02:49.579> with<00:02:49.910> CT<00:02:50.239> contrast<00:02:51.010> sometimes<00:02:52.010> they

enhance with CT contrast sometimes they

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.949 
enhance with CT contrast sometimes they
don't<00:02:52.340> enhance<00:02:52.730> very<00:02:52.940> well<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.510> sometimes

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
don't enhance very well and sometimes

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.080 
don't enhance very well and sometimes
intermediately<00:02:54.739> this<00:02:55.280> one<00:02:55.519> happened<00:02:55.880> to<00:02:55.910> not

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
intermediately this one happened to not

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.670 
intermediately this one happened to not
enhance<00:02:56.450> farewell<00:02:56.870> this<00:02:57.019> is<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.230> same<00:02:57.440> case

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
enhance farewell this is the same case

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.289 
enhance farewell this is the same case
but<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.280> can<00:02:58.430> still<00:02:58.610> appreciate<00:02:58.760> the

but you can still appreciate the

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.589 
but you can still appreciate the
heterogeneity<00:03:00.610> so<00:03:01.610> why<00:03:02.120> did<00:03:02.299> I<00:03:02.360> share<00:03:02.569> that

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
heterogeneity so why did I share that

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:03.940 
heterogeneity so why did I share that

imaging<00:03:33.859> sequences<00:03:34.359> the<00:03:35.359> flow<00:03:35.750> voids<00:03:36.019> and<00:03:36.349> I

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
imaging sequences the flow voids and I

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.129 
imaging sequences the flow voids and I
can<00:03:36.739> show<00:03:36.859> you<00:03:36.920> here<00:03:37.190> on<00:03:37.430> the<00:03:38.590> coronal<00:03:39.590> as<00:03:39.709> well

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
can show you here on the coronal as well

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.080 
can show you here on the coronal as well
now<00:03:42.139> on<00:03:42.410> CT<00:03:42.950> because<00:03:43.370> they're<00:03:43.549> so<00:03:43.700> vascular

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
now on CT because they're so vascular

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.370 
now on CT because they're so vascular
there<00:03:44.209> really<00:03:44.630> this<00:03:44.780> is<00:03:44.900> a<00:03:44.930> different<00:03:45.260> case

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
there really this is a different case

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.229 
there really this is a different case
but<00:03:45.650> it's<00:03:45.769> still<00:03:45.889> a<00:03:45.950> pair<00:03:46.190> of<00:03:46.250> gangly<00:03:46.549> OMA<00:03:46.700> look

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
but it's still a pair of gangly OMA look

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.059 
but it's still a pair of gangly OMA look
how<00:03:47.419> incredibly<00:03:47.870> densely<00:03:48.410> enhancing<00:03:48.889> this

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
how incredibly densely enhancing this

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.129 
how incredibly densely enhancing this
lesion<00:03:49.340> is<00:03:49.639> so<00:03:50.150> keep<00:03:50.359> that<00:03:50.389> in<00:03:50.540> mind<00:03:50.870> because

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139 
lesion is so keep that in mind because

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:52.930 
lesion is so keep that in mind because
say<00:03:51.889> you<00:03:51.950> have<00:03:52.190> a<00:03:52.220> lesion<00:03:52.489> that<00:03:52.639> you're<00:03:52.849> not

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
say you have a lesion that you're not

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.610 
say you have a lesion that you're not
quite<00:03:53.209> sure<00:03:53.239> bc<00:03:53.569> flow<00:03:53.870> voids<00:03:54.139> are<00:03:54.230> non<00:03:54.380> it's

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
quite sure bc flow voids are non it's

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.050 
quite sure bc flow voids are non it's
less<00:03:54.829> than<00:03:54.859> two<00:03:55.099> centimeters<00:03:55.579> in<00:03:55.669> size<00:03:55.700> you're

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
less than two centimeters in size you're

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.970 
less than two centimeters in size you're
not<00:03:56.209> quite<00:03:56.419> sure<00:03:56.450> what<00:03:56.720> to<00:03:56.840> do<00:03:56.989> sometimes<00:03:57.829> if

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
not quite sure what to do sometimes if

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.420 
not quite sure what to do sometimes if
you<00:03:58.069> get<00:03:58.220> a<00:03:58.250> CT<00:03:59.049> you'll<00:04:00.049> see<00:04:00.380> a<00:04:00.560> very<00:04:00.980> enhancing

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
you get a CT you'll see a very enhancing

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.680 
you get a CT you'll see a very enhancing
lesion<00:04:01.609> or<00:04:01.910> you'll<00:04:02.180> see<00:04:02.359> something<00:04:02.540> that's

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
lesion or you'll see something that's

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.990 
lesion or you'll see something that's
enhancing<00:04:03.260> or<00:04:03.470> not<00:04:03.739> so<00:04:03.919> enhancing<00:04:04.430> and<00:04:04.609> the

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
enhancing or not so enhancing and the

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.759 
enhancing or not so enhancing and the
very<00:04:05.180> enhancing<00:04:05.660> lesion<00:04:05.810> is<00:04:06.049> more<00:04:06.230> likely<00:04:06.470> the

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
very enhancing lesion is more likely the

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:13.030 
very enhancing lesion is more likely the
paraganglioma<00:04:08.079> okay<00:04:09.079> last<00:04:09.470> case<00:04:09.910> we<00:04:10.910> have
