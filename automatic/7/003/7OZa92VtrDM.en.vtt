00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.210
 between the chemical energy of hydrogen 

00:00:01.999 --> 00:00:07.069
 in electrical energy and hydrogen is 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.800
 an abundant fuel source that 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.900
 It can be extracted from the water allowing 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.560
 that almost any country can feel it 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.560
 domestically 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.010
 since hydrogen batteries may not see 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.380
 vehicles or run generators 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.300
 of memory in large operations 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.660
 computers create electrical energy without 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.039
 produce emissions 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.509
 Oh 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.270
 with fuel corners of 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.369
 they introduced very thin 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.440
 the engine fan and enter from 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.050
 air the fuel tank is 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.640
 hydrogen gas feeds this reacts 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.640
 with oxygen to create electricity 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.520
 each fuel cell has 5 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.350
 at each end 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.180
 I mainly carbon a material 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.220
 that conducts electricity 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.290
 the hydrogen between the pile through the 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.210
 first dish that channels it by the 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.700
 next component a role 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.740
 typically treated that leads both the 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.720
 gas as electricity 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.970
 then hydrogen enters this 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.250
 membrane where protons divide and 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.650
 electrons 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.830
 and protons react with oxygen 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.630
 producing water 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.640
 through another paper to the plate 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.160
 outside of the pile where a pump 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.840
 he expels it while the electrons 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.590
 they travel to the end of the pile of 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.950
 rows to some electric cables 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.230
 after assembling the moment the technicians 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.360
 they include batteries 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.430
 a hydraulic press the compression 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.040
 helps the stream to flow smoothly 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.960
 from one row to another also presses the 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.030
 rubber gasket around each plate to 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.440
 the one that tries to seal the pile for 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.440
 that hydrogen can not escape 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.850
 the technicians perform a control of 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.700
 quality with nitrogen gas to verify 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.590
 the seal before releasing the press 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.750
 they install high steel bars 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.460
 resistance to tie together the batteries 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.680
 compressed 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.190
 for this size apply a pressure of 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.190
 3 tons 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.689
 of the press hook a circuit 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.909
 electric that controls the voltage of 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.649
 fuel character 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.720
 after securing the connectors with a 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.550
 adhesive strip is just a matter of 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.550
 connect a fuel cell 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.790
 they secure that connection with a guy 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.240
 special epoxy containing silver 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.460
 to drive electricity 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.390
 then they assemble the circuit in a cover 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.340
 of plastic to protect it 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.770
 the pile of fuel cells be 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.819
 fully assembled now go to the 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.650
 tests the technician mounts it in a bank 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.080
 of tests and connects the line of 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.230
 hydrogen the air line and the line of 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.450
 water to cool them 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.140
 an automatic performance test 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.140
 three hours 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.500
 the technicians put the amount 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.000
 in the structural framework of the engine and 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.310
 and installed in the recirculation pump 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.349
 of hydrogen 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.540
 then fit the water pump that 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.060
 cools the fuel cell by pumping 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.069
 cold water after installing the 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.319
 components that supply hydrogen 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.720
 stored at high pressure in a tank 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.370
 of fuel is that pressure that 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.519
 pushes the gas through lines of 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.560
 stainless steel fuel then 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:24.410
 the fan puts external air into the 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.780
 pile to react with hydrogen 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.640
 This filter removes dust and other 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.520
 contaminants attracted by the fan 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.590
 towards the fuel meanwhile the 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.540
 technicians have assembled the computer that 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.640
 control the engine 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.530
 connecting the fan wires 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.549
 pumps and the other engine components 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.549
 to the computer 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.250
 of fuel cell output that 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.050
 are the cables that carry the current 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.490
 which creates the cell and sends it 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.240
 device that the engine is 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.240
 feeding 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.570
 the proportion of the production of the 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.620
 pile feeds the pumps and others 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.620
 engine components 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.439
 is mounted the motor goes through a 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.799
 extensive operation and tests 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:12.799
 of security 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.230
 what happens the tests the technicians 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:22.550
 perform a final visual inspection and 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.550
 install on the metal lid 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.190
 fuel cells and hydrogen 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.960
 is ready to be sent to the client and 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.560
 installed on the machine is going to do 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.560
 function 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.780
 like this forklift or in 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.000
 computer servers 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.580
 the only byproducts that it produces is 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.199
 uneven heat and water that's why the 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.319
 hydrogen energy is an energy 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:54.680
 clean it 's that simple you'll be full of 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:54.680
 Energy
