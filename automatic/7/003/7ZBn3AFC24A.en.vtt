okay<00:00:03.920> this<00:00:04.220> is<00:00:04.430> a<00:00:04.460> little<00:00:04.670> trick<00:00:05.150> we<00:00:05.420> used<00:00:05.600> to

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:05.750 
okay this is a little trick we used to

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.900 
okay this is a little trick we used to
do<00:00:05.960> and<00:00:06.109> I<00:00:06.200> was<00:00:06.319> a<00:00:06.380> kid<00:00:06.770> never<00:00:07.549> really

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910 
do and I was a kid never really

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.840 
do and I was a kid never really
understood<00:00:08.570> why<00:00:08.630> I'm<00:00:09.080> work<00:00:09.380> what<00:00:10.190> we're<00:00:10.370> doing

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:10.850 
understood why I'm work what we're doing

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.580 
understood why I'm work what we're doing
is<00:00:11.090> we're<00:00:11.539> heating<00:00:11.809> up<00:00:12.110> a<00:00:13.570> one<00:00:14.570> gallon<00:00:15.199> metal

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
is we're heating up a one gallon metal

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.160 
is we're heating up a one gallon metal
container<00:00:16.129> that<00:00:17.060> has<00:00:17.240> about<00:00:17.510> an<00:00:17.660> inch<00:00:17.960> of

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
container that has about an inch of

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.760 
container that has about an inch of
water<00:00:18.440> to<00:00:18.740> bottom<00:00:19.990> after<00:00:20.990> it<00:00:21.110> has<00:00:21.230> run<00:00:21.500> some

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
water to bottom after it has run some

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.750 
water to bottom after it has run some
steam<00:00:22.160> out<00:00:22.990> we<00:00:23.990> go<00:00:24.230> ahead<00:00:24.650> and<00:00:24.950> we're<00:00:25.550> coming

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
steam out we go ahead and we're coming

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.790 
steam out we go ahead and we're coming
along<00:00:25.880> gonna<00:00:26.240> come<00:00:26.510> along<00:00:26.630> and<00:00:26.840> take<00:00:27.350> the<00:00:27.530> heat

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
along gonna come along and take the heat

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.109 
along gonna come along and take the heat
off<00:00:27.830> of<00:00:28.040> it<00:00:28.400> and<00:00:28.580> put<00:00:28.640> a<00:00:29.630> cap<00:00:30.020> on<00:00:30.320> it<00:00:30.850> now<00:00:31.850> that's

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
off of it and put a cap on it now that's

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.040 
off of it and put a cap on it now that's
gonna<00:00:32.300> mean<00:00:32.570> inside<00:00:33.289> there<00:00:33.710> there's<00:00:34.010> only

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
gonna mean inside there there's only

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.520 
gonna mean inside there there's only
steam<00:00:36.050> and<00:00:36.440> water<00:00:37.690> now<00:00:38.690> it's<00:00:38.929> gonna<00:00:39.140> almost

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
steam and water now it's gonna almost

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.319 
steam and water now it's gonna almost
immediately<00:00:40.429> begin<00:00:41.350> cooling<00:00:42.350> and<00:00:42.949> that

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
immediately begin cooling and that

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.880 
immediately begin cooling and that
water's<00:00:44.329> gonna<00:00:44.449> start<00:00:45.140> condensing<00:00:46.269> and<00:00:47.679> as<00:00:48.679> it

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
water's gonna start condensing and as it

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.160 
water's gonna start condensing and as it
condenses<00:00:49.609> and<00:00:49.850> comes<00:00:50.030> back<00:00:50.329> to<00:00:50.359> water<00:00:50.870> it

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
condenses and comes back to water it

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.250 
condenses and comes back to water it
takes<00:00:51.409> up<00:00:51.589> a<00:00:51.679> lot<00:00:51.949> less<00:00:51.979> space<00:00:52.899> than<00:00:53.899> it<00:00:54.079> did

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
takes up a lot less space than it did

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.750 
takes up a lot less space than it did
before

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
before

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.559 
before
water<00:00:56.389> when<00:00:56.719> it<00:00:56.839> turns<00:00:57.079> to<00:00:57.350> steam<00:00:58.239> is<00:00:59.239> about

00:00:59.559 --> 00:00:59.569 
water when it turns to steam is about

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:03.849 
water when it turns to steam is about
1200<00:01:00.289> times<00:01:00.710> the<00:01:01.190> volume<00:01:01.760> as<00:01:01.999> it<00:01:02.289> is<00:01:03.289> as<00:01:03.530> water

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 
1200 times the volume as it is as water

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:09.450 
1200 times the volume as it is as water
so<00:01:04.760> is<00:01:04.879> this<00:01:05.059> water<00:01:05.390> starts<00:01:05.990> to<00:01:07.660> condense

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
so is this water starts to condense

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.220 
so is this water starts to condense
we're<00:01:10.460> going<00:01:10.760> to<00:01:10.940> see<00:01:11.590> the<00:01:13.450> pressure<00:01:14.450> gets

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
we're going to see the pressure gets

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.840 
we're going to see the pressure gets
smaller<00:01:16.030> less<00:01:17.030> and<00:01:17.270> less<00:01:17.470> inside<00:01:18.850> this

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
smaller less and less inside this

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.590 
smaller less and less inside this
container<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:21.020> if<00:01:21.710> you<00:01:21.890> look<00:01:22.210> you'll<00:01:23.210> start

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
container and if you look you'll start

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.730 
container and if you look you'll start
to<00:01:23.810> see<00:01:23.840> this<00:01:24.320> thing<00:01:24.850> start<00:01:25.850> to<00:01:26.000> collapse<00:01:26.740> it's

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
to see this thing start to collapse it's

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.630 
to see this thing start to collapse it's
not<00:01:27.980> actually<00:01:28.490> collapsing<00:01:29.650> because<00:01:32.920> of<00:01:33.920> a

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
not actually collapsing because of a

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.260 
not actually collapsing because of a
vacuum<00:01:35.210> inside<00:01:35.450> is<00:01:36.430> collapsing<00:01:37.430> because<00:01:37.940> of

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
vacuum inside is collapsing because of

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.080 
vacuum inside is collapsing because of
the<00:01:38.360> pressure<00:01:38.720> outside<00:01:39.490> pressure<00:01:40.490> around<00:01:40.850> us

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
the pressure outside pressure around us

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.630 
the pressure outside pressure around us
at<00:01:41.240> sea<00:01:41.510> level<00:01:41.720> is<00:01:41.990> about<00:01:42.260> 15<00:01:42.980> pounds<00:01:43.370> per

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
at sea level is about 15 pounds per

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.150 
at sea level is about 15 pounds per
square<00:01:43.820> inch<00:01:44.290> that<00:01:45.290> means<00:01:45.620> you<00:01:45.740> have<00:01:45.860> to<00:01:46.010> add

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
square inch that means you have to add

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.940 
square inch that means you have to add
up<00:01:46.310> all<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.640> square<00:01:46.940> inches<00:01:47.440> as<00:01:48.440> you<00:01:48.500> watch

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
up all the square inches as you watch

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.430 
up all the square inches as you watch
this<00:01:49.220> thing<00:01:49.490> it<00:01:49.760> slowly<00:01:50.150> starts<00:01:50.810> to<00:01:50.930> crumble

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
this thing it slowly starts to crumble

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.010 
this thing it slowly starts to crumble
and<00:01:53.230> suck<00:01:54.230> in<00:01:55.150> it's<00:01:56.150> what<00:01:56.540> we<00:01:56.720> call<00:01:56.990> a

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
and suck in it's what we call a

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.060 
and suck in it's what we call a
saturated<00:01:57.860> mix<00:01:58.370> inside<00:01:59.270> that's<00:02:00.080> where<00:02:00.440> you

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
saturated mix inside that's where you

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.899 
saturated mix inside that's where you
have<00:02:01.159> one<00:02:01.430> type<00:02:01.880> of<00:02:03.130> substance<00:02:04.130> usually<00:02:04.700> a

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
have one type of substance usually a

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.070 
have one type of substance usually a
liquid<00:02:05.360> or<00:02:05.480> gas<00:02:05.770> and<00:02:06.880> it's<00:02:07.880> part<00:02:08.360> liquid<00:02:08.899> and

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
liquid or gas and it's part liquid and

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.950 
liquid or gas and it's part liquid and
it's<00:02:09.200> part<00:02:09.530> gas<00:02:09.979> there's<00:02:10.729> both<00:02:11.090> in<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.690> same

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
it's part gas there's both in the same

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.270 
it's part gas there's both in the same
container<00:02:12.470> and<00:02:12.950> they're<00:02:13.940> going<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.650> go<00:02:15.650> to

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
container and they're going to go to

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.250 
container and they're going to go to
they're<00:02:16.430> saturated<00:02:17.330> temperature<00:02:17.870> pressure

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
they're saturated temperature pressure

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.880 
they're saturated temperature pressure
and<00:02:19.040> that's<00:02:20.030> what<00:02:20.270> is<00:02:20.570> actually<00:02:21.410> happening

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
and that's what is actually happening

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.430 
and that's what is actually happening
with<00:02:22.070> this<00:02:22.250> thing<00:02:22.660> we're<00:02:23.660> taking<00:02:23.960> up<00:02:24.050> a<00:02:24.170> lot

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
with this thing we're taking up a lot

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.430 
with this thing we're taking up a lot
less<00:02:24.740> space<00:02:26.740> than<00:02:27.740> we<00:02:27.920> were<00:02:28.250> when<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:29.440> steam

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
less space than we were when the steam

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.770 
less space than we were when the steam
was<00:02:30.680> coming<00:02:31.040> off<00:02:31.250> which<00:02:31.610> it<00:02:32.060> was<00:02:32.240> over<00:02:32.540> two

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
was coming off which it was over two

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.180 
was coming off which it was over two
hundred<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:33.080> twelve<00:02:33.290> degrees<00:02:33.440> Fahrenheit

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
hundred and twelve degrees Fahrenheit

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.780 
hundred and twelve degrees Fahrenheit
and<00:02:34.940> we<00:02:35.209> pretty<00:02:35.540> much<00:02:35.600> crumbled<00:02:36.410> this<00:02:36.790> this

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
and we pretty much crumbled this this

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.540 
and we pretty much crumbled this this
can<00:02:38.200> probably<00:02:39.200> not<00:02:39.500> good<00:02:39.770> for<00:02:39.800> much<00:02:40.190> anything

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
can probably not good for much anything

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.760 
can probably not good for much anything
anymore<00:02:41.380> but<00:02:42.380> cute<00:02:42.800> little<00:02:42.980> demonstration<00:02:43.370> of

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
anymore but cute little demonstration of

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.490 
anymore but cute little demonstration of
saturated<00:02:45.770> mixes
