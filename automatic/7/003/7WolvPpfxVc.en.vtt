00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
give him the horns funny story is that I

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.260 
give him the horns funny story is that I
was<00:00:34.320> actually<00:00:34.500> going<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.910> originally<00:00:35.910> use

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
was actually going to originally use

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.119 
was actually going to originally use
these<00:00:36.510> horns<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:37.079> make<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> Lego<00:00:37.500> Maleficent

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
these horns to make a Lego Maleficent

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.369 
these horns to make a Lego Maleficent
but<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.850> never<00:00:39.090> got<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.230> just

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
but I never got to that so I just

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.610 
but I never got to that so I just
decided<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.980> turn<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.340> into<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.670> minion<00:00:42.180> and

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
decided to turn it into a minion and

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.380 
decided to turn it into a minion and
he's<00:00:43.620> got<00:00:43.800> completely<00:00:44.489> blue<00:00:44.640> torso<00:00:45.149> and

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
he's got completely blue torso and

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.510 
he's got completely blue torso and
brick-built<00:00:46.379> wings<00:00:47.600> so<00:00:48.600> there's<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.989> minion

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
brick-built wings so there's the minion

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.760 
brick-built wings so there's the minion
and<00:00:50.520> here<00:00:51.449> we<00:00:51.629> have<00:00:51.899> one<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.500> greatest

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
and here we have one of the greatest

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.650 
and here we have one of the greatest
troops<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.309> my<00:00:53.430> opinion<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> hog

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
troops in my opinion and this is the hog

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.189 
troops in my opinion and this is the hog
rider<00:00:54.930> now<00:00:55.500> originally<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.670> thought<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.750> I

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
rider now originally I thought that I

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.830 
rider now originally I thought that I
might<00:00:58.379> use<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.430> pig<00:00:59.789> right<00:00:59.910> here<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.359> mean

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
might use this pig right here I mean

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.560 
might use this pig right here I mean
that's<00:01:00.960> what<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> lot<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.469> other<00:01:02.030> youtubers<00:01:03.030> do

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
that's what a lot of other youtubers do

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.810 
that's what a lot of other youtubers do
when<00:01:03.809> they<00:01:03.930> make<00:01:04.110> their<00:01:04.439> hog<00:01:04.680> riders<00:01:05.040> they<00:01:05.580> use

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
when they make their hog riders they use

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.820 
when they make their hog riders they use
that<00:01:06.060> pig<00:01:06.270> but<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.720> thought<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.080> would<00:01:07.320> be<00:01:07.530> too

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
that pig but I thought it would be too

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.969 
that pig but I thought it would be too
small<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:09.229> since<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.380> pig<00:01:10.590> doesn't<00:01:10.770> have

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
small and since this pig doesn't have

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.500 
small and since this pig doesn't have
horns<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.549> wouldn't<00:01:11.760> be<00:01:11.820> accurate<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.330> just

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
horns it wouldn't be accurate so I just

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.440 
horns it wouldn't be accurate so I just
decided<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.869> make<00:01:12.990> my<00:01:13.200> own<00:01:13.280> I<00:01:14.280> might<00:01:14.610> do<00:01:15.420> a

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
decided to make my own I might do a

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.600 
decided to make my own I might do a
tutorial<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.500> how<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.770> build<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.159> pig<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.520> a

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.219 
was in the 200 subscriber special back
in<00:02:00.780> April<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.710> believe<00:02:01.979> he<00:02:02.820> lent<00:02:03.119> me<00:02:03.329> one<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.049> his

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
in April I believe he lent me one of his

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.800 
in April I believe he lent me one of his
Lego<00:02:04.680> torsos<00:02:05.250> for<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.790> Valkyrie<00:02:06.210> which<00:02:06.630> was

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
Lego torsos for the Valkyrie which was

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.089 
Lego torsos for the Valkyrie which was
actually<00:02:07.200> from<00:02:07.380> Star<00:02:07.740> Wars<00:02:07.770> set<00:02:08.270> and<00:02:09.950> so<00:02:10.950> he

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
actually from Star Wars set and so he

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.300 
actually from Star Wars set and so he
lent<00:02:11.280> me<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.459> torso<00:02:11.849> he<00:02:12.030> also<00:02:12.450> has<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.720> battle

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
lent me the torso he also has a battle

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.800 
lent me the torso he also has a battle
and<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.930> there's<00:02:15.080> a<00:02:15.140> Valkyrie<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:16.569> last<00:02:17.569> but

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
and so there's a Valkyrie and last but

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.630 
and so there's a Valkyrie and last but
certainly<00:02:17.840> not<00:02:18.260> least<00:02:18.470> we<00:02:18.830> have<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.370> dark

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
certainly not least we have the dark

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.390 
certainly not least we have the dark
barracks<00:02:20.090> itself<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:21.260> I'll<00:02:22.010> show<00:02:22.160> you<00:02:22.220> the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
barracks itself and I'll show you the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.570 
barracks itself and I'll show you the
top<00:02:22.580> part<00:02:22.850> later<00:02:23.420> but<00:02:24.140> right<00:02:24.620> here<00:02:24.680> we<00:02:25.250> have

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
top part later but right here we have

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.330 
top part later but right here we have
the<00:02:25.940> target<00:02:26.240> that<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.569> Valkyrie<00:02:26.990> will<00:02:27.440> use<00:02:27.980> to

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
the target that the Valkyrie will use to

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.640 
the target that the Valkyrie will use to
practice<00:02:28.819> throwing<00:02:29.720> her<00:02:30.020> axe<00:02:30.230> even<00:02:30.590> though

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
practice throwing her axe even though

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.890 
practice throwing her axe even though
she<00:02:30.770> doesn't<00:02:31.010> really<00:02:31.220> do<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:31.520> in<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.700> game

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
she doesn't really do that in the game

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.540 
she doesn't really do that in the game
which<00:02:32.900> is<00:02:33.020> kind<00:02:33.200> of<00:02:33.350> weird<00:02:33.530> I<00:02:33.770> have<00:02:34.100> a<00:02:34.160> question

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
which is kind of weird I have a question

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.330 
which is kind of weird I have a question
about<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:35.140> but<00:02:36.140> move<00:02:36.470> this<00:02:36.620> aside<00:02:36.739> and<00:02:37.160> take

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
about that but move this aside and take

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.210 
about that but move this aside and take
a<00:02:37.370> look<00:02:37.610> at<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.819> interior<00:02:38.239> details<00:02:39.220> can't

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
a look at the interior details can't

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.100 
a look at the interior details can't
really<00:02:40.430> see<00:02:40.760> much<00:02:41.000> but<00:02:41.209> you<00:02:41.660> know<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:41.989> get

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
really see much but you know you get

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.720 
really see much but you know you get
some<00:02:42.230> light<00:02:42.440> in<00:02:42.470> there<00:02:42.739> see<00:02:43.250> we<00:02:43.370> have<00:02:43.520> some

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
some light in there see we have some

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.720 
some light in there see we have some
potions<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:44.480> some<00:02:45.020> weapons<00:02:45.650> back<00:02:46.310> in<00:02:46.519> there

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
potions and some weapons back in there

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.370 
potions and some weapons back in there
and<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:48.160> little<00:02:49.160> cauldron<00:02:49.760> too<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.300> in<00:02:51.290> the

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
and a little cauldron too and in the

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.530 
and a little cauldron too and in the
roof<00:02:51.590> we<00:02:52.250> actually<00:02:52.700> I'll<00:02:52.910> show<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.269> how<00:02:53.420> this

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
roof we actually I'll show you how this

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.930 
roof we actually I'll show you how this
works<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:53.989> made<00:02:54.650> this<00:02:54.920> piece<00:02:55.220> and<00:02:55.519> actually

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
works I made this piece and actually

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.380 
works I made this piece and actually
literally<00:02:56.480> just<00:02:56.900> sits<00:02:57.590> in<00:02:57.860> there<00:02:58.610> because<00:02:59.120> it

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
literally just sits in there because it

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.360 
literally just sits in there because it
was<00:02:59.450> hard<00:02:59.690> to<00:02:59.810> make<00:02:59.930> it<00:03:00.080> connect<00:03:00.470> to<00:03:00.590> this

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
was hard to make it connect to this

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.800 
was hard to make it connect to this
piece<00:03:01.640> right<00:03:01.880> here<00:03:02.180> which<00:03:02.300> is<00:03:02.420> kind<00:03:02.630> of<00:03:02.660> like<00:03:02.720> a

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
piece right here which is kind of like a

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.600 
piece right here which is kind of like a
mining<00:03:04.300> piece<00:03:05.530> that<00:03:06.530> it<00:03:07.100> was<00:03:07.190> kind<00:03:07.400> of<00:03:07.459> hard<00:03:07.580> to

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
mining piece that it was kind of hard to

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.280 
mining piece that it was kind of hard to
do<00:03:07.730> that<00:03:07.850> so<00:03:07.970> I<00:03:08.000> just<00:03:08.209> decided<00:03:08.540> to<00:03:08.630> make<00:03:08.780> it<00:03:08.930> sit

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
do that so I just decided to make it sit

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.500 
do that so I just decided to make it sit
in<00:03:09.470> there<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:09.890> it<00:03:09.950> kind<00:03:10.069> of<00:03:10.160> works<00:03:10.370> so<00:03:10.970> I'm

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
in there and it kind of works so I'm

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.350 
in there and it kind of works so I'm
glad<00:03:11.900> it<00:03:12.080> worked<00:03:12.200> out<00:03:12.500> give<00:03:13.370> you<00:03:13.459> a<00:03:13.580> 360<00:03:13.880> look
