00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
everything so yeah we're doing these on

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.240 
everything so yeah we're doing these on
the<00:01:06.420> high<00:01:06.600> power<00:01:06.960> setting<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.470> low<00:01:07.680> power<00:01:07.920> is

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
the high power setting the low power is

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.760 
the high power setting the low power is
about<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.549> same<00:01:08.700> tone<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.330> just<00:01:09.770> quieter

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
about the same tone it's just quieter

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.130 
about the same tone it's just quieter
obviously<00:01:13.340> so<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.090> volume<00:01:15.299> cranked

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
obviously so this is the volume cranked

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.679 
obviously so this is the volume cranked
I<00:01:16.350> keep<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.070> tone<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> real<00:01:17.939> busy<00:01:18.299> amp

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
I keep the tone this is a real busy amp

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.420 
I keep the tone this is a real busy amp
so<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.020> just<00:01:19.229> keep<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.619> tone<00:01:19.830> at<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.189> two

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
so I just keep the tone at like two

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.590 
so I just keep the tone at like two
o'clock<00:01:21.110> and<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:23.189> leave<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.509> it's<00:01:24.509> a

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600

happen with any tube amp but this is a
cranked<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.119> it's<00:01:39.420> really<00:01:39.689> not<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:39.930> loud<00:01:40.259> I

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
cranked and it's really not that loud I

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.440 
cranked and it's really not that loud I
have<00:01:40.619> solid<00:01:40.860> state<00:01:41.250> amps<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.790> are<00:01:41.939> fiber<00:01:42.210> and

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
have solid state amps that are fiber and

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.569 
have solid state amps that are fiber and
this<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> Class<00:01:42.990> eight<00:01:43.259> tube<00:01:43.560> amp<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.130> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
this is a Class eight tube amp so the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.880 
this is a Class eight tube amp so the
hand<00:01:45.060> wired<00:01:45.299> point-to-point<00:01:45.930> probably<00:01:46.680> helps

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
hand wired point-to-point probably helps

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.030 
hand wired point-to-point probably helps
them<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.360> bridge<00:01:48.960> pickup<00:01:49.500> cranked

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
them this is a bridge pickup cranked

00:01:50.040 --> 00:02:12.660 
them this is a bridge pickup cranked
time<00:01:50.369> crank<00:01:50.729> down<00:01:50.909> there

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.430 

so<00:02:13.670> it's<00:02:14.210> not<00:02:14.330> that<00:02:14.390> loud<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:15.080> know<00:02:15.200> that's

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
so it's not that loud you know that's

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.050 
so it's not that loud you know that's
that's<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.890> loudest<00:02:16.040> I<00:02:16.370> am<00:02:16.520> screaming<00:02:16.820> Wow

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
that's the loudest I am screaming Wow

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:39.600 
that's the loudest I am screaming Wow
there's<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.810> boost<00:02:36.070> its<00:02:37.070> adding<00:02:37.370> gain<00:02:38.020> so

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
there's a boost its adding gain so

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.740 
there's a boost its adding gain so
really<00:02:40.610> ever<00:02:40.730> use<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.150> boost<00:02:41.330> I<00:02:41.480> think<00:02:41.660> I'd

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
really ever use the boost I think I'd

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.130 
really ever use the boost I think I'd
use<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.900> pedal<00:02:42.320> to<00:02:42.440> add<00:02:42.590> a<00:02:42.620> game<00:02:43.810> which<00:02:44.810> me<00:02:45.080> it

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
use a pedal to add a game which me it

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.660 
use a pedal to add a game which me it
sounds<00:02:45.410> good<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:45.709> think<00:02:45.830> that's<00:02:46.190> a<00:02:46.340> good<00:02:46.459> amount

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
sounds good I think that's a good amount

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.949 
sounds good I think that's a good amount
of<00:02:46.790> distortion<00:02:47.120> I<00:02:48.040> think<00:02:49.040> it<00:02:49.130> sounds<00:02:49.280> sweet

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
of distortion I think it sounds sweet

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.420 
of distortion I think it sounds sweet
but<00:02:50.959> you<00:02:51.230> know<00:02:51.320> obviously<00:02:51.470> you<00:02:51.800> can<00:02:51.920> add<00:02:51.950> like

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
but you know obviously you can add like

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:01.960 
but you know obviously you can add like
there's<00:02:52.730> a<00:02:52.790> metal<00:02:53.090> panel

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:05:02.870 

Oh

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.360 

that's<00:05:03.880> the<00:05:04.000> thing<00:05:04.180> with<00:05:04.330> a<00:05:04.389> hand<00:05:04.690> wired

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
that's the thing with a hand wired

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.020 
that's the thing with a hand wired
point-to-point<00:05:07.080> you're<00:05:08.080> just<00:05:08.259> getting<00:05:09.030> your

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
point-to-point you're just getting your

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.850 
point-to-point you're just getting your
tone<00:05:10.389> out<00:05:10.660> of<00:05:10.690> this<00:05:10.930> you<00:05:11.110> have<00:05:11.259> to<00:05:11.289> have<00:05:11.560> a<00:05:11.620> good

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
tone out of this you have to have a good

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.920 
tone out of this you have to have a good
behind<00:05:12.190> you<00:05:12.340> have<00:05:12.460> to<00:05:12.490> be<00:05:12.789> a<00:05:13.060> good<00:05:13.599> guitar

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
behind you have to be a good guitar

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:23.010 
behind you have to be a good guitar
player<00:05:20.849> so<00:05:21.849> I<00:05:21.880> think<00:05:22.120> the<00:05:22.389> tone<00:05:22.599> of<00:05:22.630> this<00:05:22.810> thing

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
player so I think the tone of this thing

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.600 
player so I think the tone of this thing
stock<00:05:23.320> is<00:05:23.530> pretty<00:05:23.800> good<00:05:24.009> I<00:05:25.979> can't<00:05:26.979> wait<00:05:27.070> to<00:05:27.460> try

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
stock is pretty good I can't wait to try

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.820 
stock is pretty good I can't wait to try
it<00:05:27.699> with<00:05:27.909> the<00:05:27.940> new<00:05:28.150> tubes<00:05:28.419> though<00:05:28.750> because<00:05:29.080> it

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
it with the new tubes though because it

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.560 
it with the new tubes though because it
really<00:05:30.370> I<00:05:30.729> think<00:05:30.940> it's<00:05:31.270> really<00:05:31.539> gonna<00:05:31.659> shine

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
really I think it's really gonna shine

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.730 
really I think it's really gonna shine
so<00:05:34.570> the<00:05:35.289> volume<00:05:35.740> you<00:05:36.009> know<00:05:37.259> it's<00:05:38.259> hard<00:05:38.470> to<00:05:38.560> tell

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
so the volume you know it's hard to tell

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.490 
so the volume you know it's hard to tell
on<00:05:38.919> a<00:05:38.949> camera<00:05:39.220> I'm<00:05:39.460> sure<00:05:39.729> but<00:05:40.060> the<00:05:40.180> volume

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
on a camera I'm sure but the volume

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.850 
on a camera I'm sure but the volume
isn't<00:05:41.500> the<00:05:42.009> best<00:05:42.400> I<00:05:43.169> think<00:05:44.169> it'd<00:05:44.500> be<00:05:44.530> loud

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
isn't the best I think it'd be loud

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.689 
isn't the best I think it'd be loud
enough<00:05:45.389> might<00:05:46.389> for<00:05:46.780> sure<00:05:47.050> so<00:05:48.039> they're<00:05:48.250> like

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
enough might for sure so they're like

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:50.219 
enough might for sure so they're like
BAM<00:05:49.030> practice<00:05:49.599> I<00:05:49.720> don't<00:05:49.870> know<00:05:49.930> if<00:05:50.050> it<00:05:50.139> would

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
BAM practice I don't know if it would

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:51.870 
BAM practice I don't know if it would
cut<00:05:50.470> through<00:05:50.710> a<00:05:50.830> drummer<00:05:51.220> or<00:05:51.430> not<00:05:51.610> but<00:05:51.789> that's

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
cut through a drummer or not but that's

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.120 
cut through a drummer or not but that's
not<00:05:52.060> really<00:05:52.270> why<00:05:52.389> I<00:05:52.840> got<00:05:53.199> it<00:05:53.409> I<00:05:53.530> have<00:05:53.740> a<00:05:53.770> drummer

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
not really why I got it I have a drummer

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.560 
not really why I got it I have a drummer

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
being in a band at some point and I

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 
might want some more power and I might

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.990 
might want some more power and I might
do<00:06:13.419> something<00:06:13.690> to<00:06:14.020> it<00:06:14.199> to<00:06:14.680> get<00:06:14.889> that<00:06:15.130> but<00:06:15.370> as

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
do something to it to get that but as

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.939 
do something to it to get that but as
for<00:06:16.240> right<00:06:16.449> now<00:06:16.479> the<00:06:17.050> way<00:06:17.169> it<00:06:17.320> is<00:06:17.440> and<00:06:17.770> what<00:06:17.919> I

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:17.949 
for right now the way it is and what I

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:19.020 
for right now the way it is and what I
bought<00:06:18.219> it<00:06:18.400> for

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
bought it for

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.420 
bought it for
I<00:06:19.060> think<00:06:19.480> it's<00:06:19.630> great<00:06:19.930> so<00:06:20.170> I<00:06:20.440> recommend<00:06:21.310> them

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
I think it's great so I recommend them

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.880 
I think it's great so I recommend them
they're<00:06:21.640> kind<00:06:21.820> of<00:06:21.940> hard<00:06:22.120> to<00:06:22.210> find<00:06:22.830> you<00:06:23.830> know

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:23.890 
they're kind of hard to find you know

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.980 
they're kind of hard to find you know
they<00:06:24.010> don't<00:06:24.070> have<00:06:24.190> a<00:06:24.400> Guitar<00:06:24.760> Center<00:06:24.790> I<00:06:25.390> had<00:06:25.900> to

they don't have a Guitar Center I had to

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.160 
they don't have a Guitar Center I had to

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.170 
buy it without playing it which is

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.290 
buy it without playing it which is
always<00:06:29.320> a<00:06:29.440> gamble<00:06:29.830> but<00:06:30.070> I<00:06:30.280> it's<00:06:30.820> a<00:06:30.940> gamble<00:06:31.240> that

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 
always a gamble but I it's a gamble that

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.730 
always a gamble but I it's a gamble that
paid<00:06:31.390> off<00:06:31.570> because<00:06:31.900> I'm<00:06:32.080> really<00:06:32.380> happy<00:06:32.530> with
