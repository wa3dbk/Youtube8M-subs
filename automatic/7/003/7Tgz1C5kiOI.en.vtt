00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:02.470
 that an evaluation 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.580
 to make decisions that explained to science declared disaster zone 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.740
 and apparently one option is to do 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:17.149
 they have offered us 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:27.409
 a wall that was lifted 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.220
 blond who is going to be able 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.520
 a waters 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.860
 They do not know if in January 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.510
 pons declared as miner no lawns lavÃ¡ndula pierre hantzpergue is 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.030
 constantly running through that part of the water then they decided to do the 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.720
 wall is kind 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.460
 Monday 10 at the bottom 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.350
 but with so much 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.100
 with so much water they say 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.810
 under the 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.810
 the modern that grow in the water of which stands out with him on this side 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.220
 it also has a lot to do with the position it has 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.650
 the current that carries the water at the time that is too much water 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.510
 comes knocks against that group 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.850
 I think that is why they have put the sea and you as a neighbor 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.580
 their houses active 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.130
 not us what we want is that this part is csif and sae side of the hotel 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.650
 caribbean when they expanded that part that lane 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.760
 always the lane and yes then all that despite being still recovered 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.430
 most partner were defeated 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.670
 they did more by bridge too 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.869
 I hope that the smaller channel and the bridge machito all that water is recharged 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:35.570
 our 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.380
 before this colony what is it that makes you eating more and more if this 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.170
 will be to manage it from this tree 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.590
 and has highlighted that this bridge this before we had the land and it went 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.100
 putting but that's why 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.200
 because they made the street wider 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.840
 narrower support and everything was close to us and how they moderated 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.840
 that part 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.390
 we take out because it has been spoken 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.190
 according to the rating 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.340
 and to us it is not really a location because we are not 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.290
 support them for their arrest 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.290
 to us what has to be done for us 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.999
 and I think the other two are grown 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:17.379
 so that we can get out of here because what I wanted is to harm 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.289
 script of these lands for business for all that 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:22.299
 because this guy as a publication
