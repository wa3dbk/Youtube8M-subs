00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359 
you feel the location is I don't know

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:42.039 
you feel the location is I don't know
where<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.600> farmer<00:02:38.930> lives<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.970> know<00:02:41.090> it's<00:02:41.780> aw

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
I don't want to see here in the second

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.229 
I don't want to see here in the second
guess<00:02:44.150> myself<00:02:44.329> over<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:45.320> over<00:02:45.440> I<00:02:46.180> didn't<00:02:47.180> want

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
guess myself over and over I didn't want

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.819 
guess myself over and over I didn't want
to<00:02:47.359> rush<00:02:47.480> through<00:02:47.660> it<00:02:47.750> now<00:02:48.230> that<00:02:48.410> skunk<00:02:48.739> it

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
to rush through it now that skunk it

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.080 
to rush through it now that skunk it
seems<00:02:49.100> like<00:02:49.220> he's<00:02:49.340> seen<00:02:49.519> it<00:02:49.579> stronger<00:02:49.910> I<00:02:49.970> don't

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
seems like he's seen it stronger I don't

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.800 
seems like he's seen it stronger I don't
know<00:02:50.150> if<00:02:50.209> I<00:02:50.269> got<00:02:50.450> hit<00:02:50.660> or<00:02:52.120> what<00:02:55.660> this<00:02:56.660> is

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
know if I got hit or what this is

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.370 
know if I got hit or what this is
definitely<00:02:57.109> a<00:02:57.410> very<00:02:57.440> old<00:02:57.890> location<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:59.380> mean

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
definitely a very old location I mean

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.690 
definitely a very old location I mean
it's<00:03:00.530> likely<00:03:00.829> this<00:03:00.950> house<00:03:01.160> has<00:03:01.340> been<00:03:01.459> here<00:03:01.670> for

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
it's likely this house has been here for

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.020 
it's likely this house has been here for
probably<00:03:02.000> 100<00:03:02.450> plus<00:03:02.660> years<00:03:03.250> screening<00:03:04.250> 2013

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
probably 100 plus years screening 2013

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.880 
probably 100 plus years screening 2013
now<00:03:05.150> probably<00:03:05.450> built<00:03:05.750> in<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:05.870> early<00:03:06.019> 13<00:03:06.709> off

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
now probably built in the early 13 off

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.840 
now probably built in the early 13 off
early<00:03:07.250> 1300s<00:03:07.790> early<00:03:08.630> 1900s<00:03:09.489> so<00:03:10.489> now<00:03:10.609> you<00:03:10.670> can

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
early 1300s early 1900s so now you can

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.190 
early 1300s early 1900s so now you can
see<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:11.120> combination<00:03:11.660> of<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.810> cold<00:03:12.049> weather

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
see the combination of the cold weather

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.770 
see the combination of the cold weather
or<00:03:12.470> not<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:13.790> sheriff<00:03:14.120> driving<00:03:14.450> about<00:03:14.630> the

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
or not the sheriff driving about the

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.710 
or not the sheriff driving about the
opportune<00:03:15.290> time<00:03:15.590> is<00:03:15.950> uh<00:03:16.790> I<00:03:19.329> guess<00:03:20.329> doing<00:03:20.600> that

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
opportune time is uh I guess doing that

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.340 
opportune time is uh I guess doing that
for<00:03:20.900> me

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.340 

but<00:03:24.920> then<00:03:25.100> again<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:26.450> nice<00:03:26.630> thing<00:03:26.660> is<00:03:26.960> that

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
but then again the nice thing is that

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.530 
but then again the nice thing is that
was<00:03:27.740> almost<00:03:27.860> some<00:03:28.130> proof<00:03:28.340> for<00:03:28.520> myself<00:03:28.910> because

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
was almost some proof for myself because

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.650 
was almost some proof for myself because
the<00:03:29.840> sheriff<00:03:30.170> drove<00:03:30.290> by<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:31.300> didn't<00:03:32.300> look

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
the sheriff drove by and didn't look

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.270 
the sheriff drove by and didn't look
twice<00:03:32.990> I<00:03:33.520> think<00:03:34.520> it's<00:03:34.640> really<00:03:35.030> interesting

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
twice I think it's really interesting

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.200 
twice I think it's really interesting
there's<00:03:37.280> another<00:03:37.520> old<00:03:37.760> abandoned<00:03:38.120> house

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
there's another old abandoned house

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.420 
there's another old abandoned house
right<00:03:38.540> down<00:03:38.570> there<00:03:38.960> but<00:03:39.860> I'm<00:03:40.040> getting<00:03:40.310> out<00:03:40.400> of

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
right down there but I'm getting out of

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:50.350

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.129 

guess<00:04:47.099> it<00:04:47.190> was<00:04:47.310> pretty<00:04:47.370> intense<00:04:47.789> but<00:04:48.150> I<00:04:48.389> wish<00:04:49.080> I

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
guess it was pretty intense but I wish I

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.210 
guess it was pretty intense but I wish I
could<00:04:49.259> have<00:04:49.319> spent<00:04:49.560> a<00:04:49.590> little<00:04:49.710> longer<00:04:49.979> look

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
could have spent a little longer look

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.139 
could have spent a little longer look
into<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.460> house<00:04:50.690> that's<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:51.810> way<00:04:51.930> it<00:04:52.050> is
