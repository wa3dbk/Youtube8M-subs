cents from the bank I didn't find out
much<00:00:18.000> weed<00:00:18.390> cents<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:19.109> that's<00:00:19.140> really<00:00:19.529> not<00:00:19.800> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
much weed cents so that's really not the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.450 
much weed cents so that's really not the
the<00:00:20.430> key<00:00:20.640> thing<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.000> point<00:00:21.869> out<00:00:22.220> but<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.250> did

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
the key thing to point out but I did

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.320 
the key thing to point out but I did
find<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.850> mm<00:00:24.689> wide<00:00:24.900> am<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.849> I'm<00:00:26.849> here<00:00:27.119> on<00:00:27.240> the

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
find a mm wide am and I'm here on the

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.919 
find a mm wide am and I'm here on the
west<00:00:27.539> coast<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:28.109> these<00:00:28.260> are<00:00:28.500> hard<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.980> find<00:00:29.220> I

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
west coast so these are hard to find I

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.560 
west coast so these are hard to find I
find<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.080> lot<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.260> mm<00:00:32.009> DS<00:00:32.309> but<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.210> know<00:00:33.329> there's

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
find a lot of mm DS but you know there's

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.900 
find a lot of mm DS but you know there's
nothing<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:34.140> those<00:00:34.430> let's<00:00:35.430> see<00:00:35.579> if<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.760> could

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
nothing in those let's see if I could

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.330 
nothing in those let's see if I could
get<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.149> close<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.660> can<00:00:36.809> see<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.260> wideness<00:00:38.010> in

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
get in close you can see the wideness in

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.250 
get in close you can see the wideness in
the<00:00:38.460> A&amp;M<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.420> America<00:00:40.200> uh<00:00:41.180> the<00:00:42.180> mm<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> more

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
the A&amp;M in America uh the mm is the more

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.000 
the A&amp;M in America uh the mm is the more
common<00:00:43.620> date<00:00:45.590> to<00:00:46.590> find<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:48.770> 98<00:00:49.770> would

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
common date to find in this the 98 would

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.209 
common date to find in this the 98 would
be<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.280> second<00:00:50.760> rarest<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.870> then<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> 99<00:00:52.890> is

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
be the second rarest and then the 99 is

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.970 
be the second rarest and then the 99 is
the<00:00:54.090> one<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.780> really<00:00:54.960> want<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.350> find<00:00:55.559> if

it's the seventh variety of double die
for<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:26.939> date<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.479> think<00:01:28.350> all<00:01:28.619> together<00:01:28.770> is

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
for this date I think all together is

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.679 
for this date I think all together is
like<00:01:29.369> 13<00:01:29.820> or<00:01:29.970> 14<00:01:31.159> all<00:01:32.159> ranging<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:33.000> difficulty

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
like 13 or 14 all ranging in difficulty

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.440 
like 13 or 14 all ranging in difficulty
as<00:01:33.900> far<00:01:34.110> as<00:01:34.229> rarity<00:01:34.909> you're<00:01:35.909> going<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.090> see<00:01:36.240> the

as far as rarity you're going to see the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.120 
as far as rarity you're going to see the
doubling<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.170> I'm<00:01:37.439> not<00:01:37.650> going<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.829> be<00:01:37.890> able<00:01:37.950> to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
doubling and I'm not going to be able to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.280

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.950 
depending on the double die version
number<00:02:12.090> one<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.530> most

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
number one is the the most

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.030 
number one is the the most
maduk<00:02:14.350> double-die<00:02:15.480> for<00:02:16.480> this<00:02:16.600> date<00:02:16.870> so<00:02:17.710> if<00:02:17.920> you

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
maduk double-die for this date so if you

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.920 
maduk double-die for this date so if you
did<00:02:18.220> find<00:02:18.250> one<00:02:18.700> in<00:02:18.850> circulation<00:02:19.390> you'll<00:02:19.720> know

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
did find one in circulation you'll know

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.200 
did find one in circulation you'll know
exactly<00:02:20.080> what<00:02:20.620> it<00:02:20.740> is<00:02:20.820> because<00:02:21.820> it's

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
exactly what it is because it's

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.690 
exactly what it is because it's
crazy-looking<00:02:23.050> it's<00:02:23.290> as<00:02:23.590> crazy-looking<00:02:24.520> as

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
crazy-looking it's as crazy-looking as

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.220 
crazy-looking it's as crazy-looking as
the<00:02:24.850> 1955<00:02:26.760> all<00:02:27.760> right<00:02:28.030> so<00:02:28.270> there<00:02:28.720> we<00:02:28.840> go

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.680

so as part of the Q&amp;A for the last video
of<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.680> day<00:02:36.570> there's<00:02:37.570> been<00:02:37.810> some<00:02:38.080> questions

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
of the day there's been some questions

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.990 
of the day there's been some questions
about<00:02:38.620> what<00:02:39.070> are<00:02:39.190> some<00:02:39.220> of<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.610> dates<00:02:39.820> I

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
about what are some of the dates I

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.170 
about what are some of the dates I
should<00:02:40.210> be<00:02:40.300> looking<00:02:40.450> out<00:02:40.750> for<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:41.290> are

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
should be looking out for that are

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.390 
should be looking out for that are
flippable<00:02:43.180> for<00:02:43.630> money<00:02:43.840> online<00:02:44.140> or<00:02:44.860> you<00:02:45.250> know

more money even you know over the 55
there<00:03:05.710> are<00:03:05.800> some<00:03:05.980> proof<00:03:06.220> sets<00:03:06.490> like<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.880> 70s

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
there are some proof sets like the 70s

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.980 
there are some proof sets like the 70s
and<00:03:07.810> 71<00:03:08.350> as<00:03:08.640> proofs<00:03:09.640> that<00:03:09.970> have<00:03:10.360> a<00:03:10.390> really<00:03:10.840> nice

money I think there's a business strike
1970's<00:03:17.230> as<00:03:17.470> well<00:03:18.270> in<00:03:19.270> a<00:03:19.720> larger<00:03:20.140> small<00:03:20.410> date

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
1970's as well in a larger small date

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.930 
1970's as well in a larger small date
that's<00:03:21.490> double<00:03:21.910> die<00:03:22.800> so<00:03:23.800> when<00:03:24.520> you<00:03:24.640> go<00:03:24.760> through

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
that's double die so when you go through

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:25.910 
that's double die so when you go through
your<00:03:25.030> pennies
