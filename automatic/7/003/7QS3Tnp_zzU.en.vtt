and<00:00:19.350> 1200<00:00:19.710> millimeter<00:00:20.539> lenses<00:00:21.859> this<00:00:22.859> one<00:00:23.039> was

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
and 1200 millimeter lenses this one was

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.140 
and 1200 millimeter lenses this one was
50<00:00:23.490> bucks

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
50 bucks

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.890 
50 bucks
normally<00:00:24.869> new<00:00:25.080> they're<00:00:25.769> anywhere<00:00:26.340> from<00:00:26.900> 100

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
normally new they're anywhere from 100

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.410 
normally new they're anywhere from 100
to<00:00:27.930> 150<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.070> one<00:00:29.279> /<00:00:29.580> Betar<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.029> think<00:00:30.300> it's

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
to 150 this one / Betar I think it's

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.680 
to 150 this one / Betar I think it's
just<00:00:30.510> an<00:00:30.750> older<00:00:31.170> model<00:00:31.759> there's<00:00:32.759> also<00:00:33.149> broken

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
just an older model there's also broken

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.310 
just an older model there's also broken
on<00:00:33.960> samyang<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:35.090> I'll<00:00:36.090> tech<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.450> think<00:00:36.840> next

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
on samyang and I'll tech I think next

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.020 
on samyang and I'll tech I think next
one<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.739> well<00:00:38.600> but<00:00:39.600> they're<00:00:39.809> really<00:00:39.960> neat<00:00:41.030> to

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
one is well but they're really neat to

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.819 
one is well but they're really neat to
play<00:00:42.210> around<00:00:42.420> with<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.899> can<00:00:43.050> get<00:00:43.230> birds<00:00:43.559> from

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
play around with you can get birds from

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.979 
play around with you can get birds from
way<00:00:44.040> way<00:00:44.190> far<00:00:44.579> away<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:47.760> aperture<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.629> fixed

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
way way far away the aperture is fixed

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.040 
way way far away the aperture is fixed
in<00:00:49.079> here<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.680> not<00:00:50.039> only<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> fixed<00:00:51.090> 500

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
in here so not only is it a fixed 500

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.049 
in here so not only is it a fixed 500
millimeters<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.219> fixed<00:00:54.000> at<00:00:55.610> f/8<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
millimeters this is fixed at f/8 is the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.930 
millimeters this is fixed at f/8 is the
aperture<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.690> one<00:00:57.840> I've<00:00:57.960> seen<00:00:58.140> them<00:00:58.320> at<00:00:58.440> F

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
aperture on this one I've seen them at F

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.750 
aperture on this one I've seen them at F
6.3<00:01:03.019> the<00:01:04.019> other<00:01:04.229> thing<00:01:04.530> about<00:01:04.680> them<00:01:05.010> is

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
6.3 the other thing about them is

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.359 
6.3 the other thing about them is
they're<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.090> believe<00:01:06.600> all<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:07.049> them<00:01:07.170> are<00:01:07.369> manual

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
they're I believe all of them are manual

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.609 
they're I believe all of them are manual
focus<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.030> I'll<00:01:09.360> take<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.720> off<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.439> see

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
focus so I'll take this off you see

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.330 
focus so I'll take this off you see
there's<00:01:10.830> no<00:01:11.180> electronics<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> back<00:01:12.570> here

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
there's no electronics on the back here

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.399 
there's no electronics on the back here
chip<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.640> you'll<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.150> do<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> manual<00:01:15.780> focus

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
chip so you'll have to do a manual focus

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.100 
chip so you'll have to do a manual focus
so<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:17.100> makes<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.460> quite<00:01:17.580> difficult<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:18.330> get

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
so it makes it quite difficult to get

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.440 
so it makes it quite difficult to get
that<00:01:19.290> focus<00:01:19.740> just<00:01:19.950> right<00:01:20.280> when<00:01:20.970> you're<00:01:21.119> five

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
that focus just right when you're five

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.429 
that focus just right when you're five
hundred<00:01:21.869> years<00:01:22.110> away<00:01:23.930> so<00:01:24.930> I've<00:01:25.020> had<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.229> for

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
hundred years away so I've had this for

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.560 
hundred years away so I've had this for
a<00:01:25.470> few<00:01:25.680> days<00:01:25.830> I'll<00:01:26.070> kind<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.790> explain<00:01:26.909> what<00:01:27.360> how

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
a few days I'll kind of explain what how

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.420 
a few days I'll kind of explain what how
I<00:01:27.600> shot<00:01:28.049> stuff<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.890> I'll<00:01:28.950> show<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.250> some

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
I shot stuff and I'll show you some

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.870 
I shot stuff and I'll show you some
sample<00:01:29.820> images<00:01:31.430> obviously<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.670> need<00:01:32.850> a

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
sample images obviously you need a

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.179 
sample images obviously you need a
tripod<00:01:33.509> at<00:01:33.930> 500<00:01:34.409> millimetres<00:01:34.799> it's<00:01:34.979> going<00:01:35.130> to

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
tripod at 500 millimetres it's going to

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.499 
tripod at 500 millimetres it's going to
be<00:01:35.310> all<00:01:35.490> shaky<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.000> it's<00:01:36.119> going<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.299> be<00:01:36.360> hard

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
be all shaky and it's going to be hard

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.910 
be all shaky and it's going to be hard
to<00:01:36.600> get<00:01:36.720> get<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.890> shot<00:01:38.189> just<00:01:38.400> right<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:39.920> tripod

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
to get get that shot just right a tripod

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.730 
to get get that shot just right a tripod
or<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.220> monopod<00:01:42.110> there's<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.170> little<00:01:43.350> tip<00:01:43.470> if<00:01:43.500> you

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
or a monopod there's a little tip if you

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.859 
or a monopod there's a little tip if you
you<00:01:44.610> don't<00:01:44.759> have<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.909> monopod<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.479> don't<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:45.840> a

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
you don't have a monopod I don't have a

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.130 
you don't have a monopod I don't have a
monopod<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.920> can<00:01:47.070> just<00:01:47.570> take<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.720> legs<00:01:48.930> up

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
monopod you can just take the legs up

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.380 
monopod you can just take the legs up
and<00:01:49.439> you'll<00:01:49.590> have<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> monopod<00:01:50.220> like<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.729> on

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
and you'll have a monopod like that on

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.850 
and you'll have a monopod like that on
your<00:01:51.540> tripod<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.670> so<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.700> went<00:01:54.240> around<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.860> shot

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
your tripod so so I went around and shot

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.370 
your tripod so so I went around and shot
kind<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.430> monopod<00:01:56.939> style<00:01:57.420> last<00:01:58.079> couple<00:01:58.350> of

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
kind of monopod style last couple of

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.770 
kind of monopod style last couple of
days<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.850> really<00:02:00.180> have<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.390> have<00:02:00.630> that

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
days and you really have to have that

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.940 
days and you really have to have that
shutter<00:02:01.140> speed<00:02:01.439> way<00:02:01.649> up<00:02:01.920> there<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:03.320> even<00:02:04.320> if

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
shutter speed way up there so even if

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.499 
shutter speed way up there so even if
you've<00:02:05.189> got<00:02:05.369> on<00:02:05.520> something<00:02:05.759> stable<00:02:06.030> like<00:02:06.329> that

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
you've got on something stable like that

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.499 
you've got on something stable like that
because<00:02:06.750> if<00:02:06.899> any<00:02:07.380> movement<00:02:08.009> even<00:02:08.190> at<00:02:08.509> 500

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
because if any movement even at 500

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.810 
because if any movement even at 500
millimetres<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.140> mean

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
millimetres I mean

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.820 
millimetres I mean
it's<00:02:11.820> just<00:02:12.090> any<00:02:12.630> movement<00:02:13.050> will<00:02:13.170> just<00:02:13.470> make<00:02:13.650> it

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
it's just any movement will just make it

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.080 
it's just any movement will just make it
out<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.760> focus<00:02:14.970> so<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:16.070> put<00:02:17.070> my<00:02:17.370> shutter<00:02:18.000> speed

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
out of focus so I put my shutter speed

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.360 
out of focus so I put my shutter speed
I've<00:02:18.570> recommend<00:02:18.990> even<00:02:19.170> on<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.500> monopod<00:02:20.040> at

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
I've recommend even on the monopod at

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.840 
I've recommend even on the monopod at
least<00:02:20.640> fifteen<00:02:21.060> hundred<00:02:22.550> you<00:02:23.550> can<00:02:23.700> use<00:02:23.820> a

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
least fifteen hundred you can use a

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.720 
least fifteen hundred you can use a
cable<00:02:24.090> release<00:02:24.540> on<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.780> tripod<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.470> know

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
cable release on a tripod and you know

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.090 
cable release on a tripod and you know
of<00:02:26.730> course<00:02:26.850> but<00:02:27.270> it<00:02:28.110> could<00:02:28.290> run<00:02:28.709> it<00:02:28.830> around

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
of course but it could run it around

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.740 
of course but it could run it around
trying<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.370> get<00:02:29.490> some<00:02:29.670> shots<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:30.120> birds<00:02:30.360> to

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
trying to get some shots of birds to

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.600 
trying to get some shots of birds to
have<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.140> share<00:02:31.650> speed<00:02:31.950> way<00:02:32.160> up<00:02:32.370> there<00:02:32.580> so

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
have that share speed way up there so

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.380 
have that share speed way up there so
what<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.570> do<00:02:33.660> is<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.980> aperture<00:02:35.550> is<00:02:35.850> like<00:02:36.360> I

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
what I do is the the aperture is like I

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.199 
what I do is the the aperture is like I
said<00:02:36.510> before<00:02:36.660> it's<00:02:37.110> fixed<00:02:37.680> at<00:02:37.770> f/8<00:02:38.190> so<00:02:38.940> if<00:02:39.060> it's

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
said before it's fixed at f/8 so if it's

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.140 
said before it's fixed at f/8 so if it's
already<00:02:39.390> fixed<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:40.160> switch<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.970> know<00:02:42.120> my

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
already fixed I switch it and I know my

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.090 
already fixed I switch it and I know my
shutter<00:02:42.989> speed<00:02:43.050> has<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.470> be<00:02:43.590> way<00:02:43.800> up<00:02:44.070> there

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
shutter speed has to be way up there

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.690 
shutter speed has to be way up there
I'll<00:02:44.670> switch<00:02:45.000> my<00:02:45.209> camera<00:02:45.510> here<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.470> TV<00:02:46.890> mode<00:02:47.100> on

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
I'll switch my camera here to TV mode on

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.810 
I'll switch my camera here to TV mode on
the<00:02:47.910> Canon<00:02:48.090> that's<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.890> shutter<00:02:49.890> priority<00:02:50.100> so

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
the Canon that's a shutter priority so

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.300 
the Canon that's a shutter priority so
I'll<00:02:51.150> put<00:02:51.600> it<00:02:51.660> on<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.230> then<00:02:52.350> all<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.770> crank

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
I'll put it on that and then all I crank

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.750 
I'll put it on that and then all I crank
the<00:02:54.920> shutter<00:02:55.920> up<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.840> 2,000<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.220> put<00:02:59.220> my<00:02:59.310> ISO

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
the shutter up to 2,000 and put my ISO

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:07.370 
the shutter up to 2,000 and put my ISO
on<00:02:59.940> auto<00:03:00.709> so<00:03:01.709> since<00:03:02.190> your<00:03:04.550> your<00:03:05.870> aperture<00:03:06.870> set

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
on auto so since your your aperture set

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.960 
on auto so since your your aperture set
at<00:03:07.530> f/8<00:03:07.890> your<00:03:08.520> shutter<00:03:09.330> speed<00:03:09.420> is<00:03:09.870> now<00:03:10.290> set<00:03:10.709> at

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
at f/8 your shutter speed is now set at

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.970 
at f/8 your shutter speed is now set at
2,000<00:03:11.970> your<00:03:12.510> ISO<00:03:12.870> will<00:03:13.020> adjust<00:03:13.350> according<00:03:13.860> to

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
2,000 your ISO will adjust according to

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.890 
2,000 your ISO will adjust according to
the<00:03:14.070> shot<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:15.299> you<00:03:15.360> really<00:03:15.630> got<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:15.810> be

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
the shot and you really got to be

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.949 
the shot and you really got to be
careful<00:03:16.110> about<00:03:16.410> this<00:03:16.730> especially<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:18.540> want

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
careful about this especially you want

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.199 
careful about this especially you want
to<00:03:19.170> be<00:03:19.290> very<00:03:19.560> sunny<00:03:19.860> outside<00:03:20.070> because<00:03:20.580> at<00:03:20.730> that

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
to be very sunny outside because at that

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.509 
to be very sunny outside because at that
high<00:03:21.390> shutter<00:03:21.930> speed<00:03:22.019> your<00:03:22.920> ISO<00:03:23.250> is<00:03:23.310> going<00:03:23.459> to

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
high shutter speed your ISO is going to

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.539 
high shutter speed your ISO is going to
go<00:03:23.640> way<00:03:23.910> up<00:03:24.049> put<00:03:25.049> your<00:03:25.170> own<00:03:25.380> so<00:03:25.890> just<00:03:26.190> be<00:03:26.519> aware

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
go way up put your own so just be aware

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.320 
go way up put your own so just be aware
of<00:03:26.790> what<00:03:27.000> your<00:03:27.180> camera<00:03:28.130> how<00:03:29.130> bad<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:30.000> is<00:03:30.120> at

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
of what your camera how bad it is at

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.090 
of what your camera how bad it is at
high<00:03:30.510> ISOs<00:03:31.610> the<00:03:33.110> other<00:03:34.110> thing<00:03:34.500> that<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:34.739> didn't

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
high ISOs the other thing that I didn't

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.850 
high ISOs the other thing that I didn't
mention<00:03:35.130> is<00:03:36.290> these<00:03:37.290> lenses<00:03:37.680> are<00:03:37.890> all<00:03:39.860> manual

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
mention is these lenses are all manual

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.400 
mention is these lenses are all manual
focus<00:03:41.190> only<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:42.209> you<00:03:42.660> see<00:03:42.840> there<00:03:43.049> there's<00:03:43.260> no

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
focus only so you see there there's no

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.839 
focus only so you see there there's no
sensors<00:03:43.950> on<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.220> back

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.539 

so<00:03:47.450> it's<00:03:47.659> really<00:03:47.870> hard<00:03:48.140> to<00:03:48.319> narrow<00:03:48.530> nail<00:03:49.370> down

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
so it's really hard to narrow nail down

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.039 
so it's really hard to narrow nail down
that<00:03:49.609> focus<00:03:50.239> if<00:03:50.420> there's<00:03:50.629> a<00:03:50.689> couple<00:03:50.900> of

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
that focus if there's a couple of

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.970 
that focus if there's a couple of
methods<00:03:51.260> that<00:03:51.620> I<00:03:52.340> use<00:03:52.579> to<00:03:52.760> try<00:03:52.939> to<00:03:52.999> get<00:03:53.180> it

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
methods that I use to try to get it

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.539 
methods that I use to try to get it
perfect<00:03:56.290> first<00:03:57.290> thing<00:03:57.530> you<00:03:57.620> want<00:03:57.799> to<00:03:57.859> do<00:03:58.010> is<00:03:58.400> I

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
perfect first thing you want to do is I

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.160 
perfect first thing you want to do is I
took<00:03:58.730> a<00:03:58.760> couple<00:03:59.239> shots<00:03:59.540> that<00:03:59.719> came<00:03:59.840> out<00:03:59.959> blurry

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
took a couple shots that came out blurry

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.319 
took a couple shots that came out blurry
on<00:04:00.349> some<00:04:00.469> that<00:04:00.620> just<00:04:01.249> make<00:04:01.489> sure<00:04:01.670> they're<00:04:02.060> in

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
on some that just make sure they're in

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.679 
on some that just make sure they're in
the<00:04:02.480> viewfinder<00:04:02.719> that<00:04:03.349> your<00:04:04.069> little<00:04:04.689> focus

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:05.689 
the viewfinder that your little focus

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:07.720 
the viewfinder that your little focus
for<00:04:06.019> the<00:04:06.139> viewfinder<00:04:06.319> is<00:04:06.980> dead<00:04:07.370> in<00:04:07.489> the<00:04:07.579> middle

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
for the viewfinder is dead in the middle

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.599 
for the viewfinder is dead in the middle
so<00:04:08.689> you'll<00:04:08.900> be<00:04:09.079> actually<00:04:09.920> focusing<00:04:10.430> through

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
so you'll be actually focusing through

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.520 
so you'll be actually focusing through
the<00:04:10.700> viewfinder<00:04:10.909> right<00:04:11.389> that's<00:04:11.930> one<00:04:12.230> things

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
the viewfinder right that's one things

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.849 
the viewfinder right that's one things
you<00:04:12.709> can<00:04:12.829> check<00:04:13.040> also<00:04:14.200> it's<00:04:15.200> really<00:04:15.290> hard<00:04:15.739> to

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
you can check also it's really hard to

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.819 
you can check also it's really hard to
get<00:04:16.009> focus<00:04:16.820> just<00:04:17.329> pinpoint<00:04:17.780> when<00:04:18.709> you're

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
get focus just pinpoint when you're

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.129 
get focus just pinpoint when you're
doing<00:04:19.039> when<00:04:19.220> you're<00:04:19.310> going<00:04:19.669> with<00:04:19.970> a<00:04:20.139> manual

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
doing when you're going with a manual

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.629 
doing when you're going with a manual
focus<00:04:21.560> like<00:04:21.709> that<00:04:21.919> way<00:04:22.520> I<00:04:22.720> try<00:04:23.720> to<00:04:23.780> do<00:04:24.020> it<00:04:24.110> as<00:04:25.009> I

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
focus like that way I try to do it as I

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.029 
focus like that way I try to do it as I
use<00:04:25.789> the<00:04:25.940> LCD<00:04:26.289> flip<00:04:27.289> it<00:04:27.410> over<00:04:27.470> to<00:04:27.620> live<00:04:27.800> view

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
use the LCD flip it over to live view

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.670 
use the LCD flip it over to live view
and<00:04:28.310> then<00:04:29.030> I'll<00:04:29.150> use<00:04:29.389> the<00:04:29.419> little<00:04:30.380> button

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
and then I'll use the little button

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.400 
and then I'll use the little button
there<00:04:30.860> that<00:04:30.889> is<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:32.330> magnifying<00:04:32.810> glass<00:04:33.110> and

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
there that is the magnifying glass and

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.219 
there that is the magnifying glass and
that<00:04:33.620> zooms<00:04:34.370> in<00:04:34.639> just<00:04:34.910> so<00:04:35.030> you<00:04:35.060> can<00:04:35.300> fine-tune

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
that zooms in just so you can fine-tune

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.210 
that zooms in just so you can fine-tune
that<00:04:36.620> focus<00:04:37.070> just<00:04:37.340> right<00:04:37.550> or<00:04:37.910> take<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.300> shot

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
that focus just right or take the shot

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.249 
that focus just right or take the shot
it's<00:04:40.220> not<00:04:40.400> super<00:04:40.789> quick<00:04:41.000> but<00:04:41.330> if<00:04:41.780> you<00:04:42.020> want

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
it's not super quick but if you want

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:46.810 
it's not super quick but if you want
something<00:04:42.740> be<00:04:42.979> super<00:04:43.910> and<00:04:44.840> sharp<00:04:45.699> for<00:04:46.699> this

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
something be super and sharp for this

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.520 
something be super and sharp for this
lens<00:04:47.060> that's<00:04:47.389> the<00:04:47.599> way<00:04:47.690> you'll<00:04:47.870> have<00:04:47.900> to<00:04:48.110> do<00:04:48.380> it

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
lens that's the way you'll have to do it

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.879 
lens that's the way you'll have to do it
so<00:04:49.370> here's<00:04:49.669> a<00:04:49.729> few<00:04:49.970> examples<00:04:50.599> of<00:04:50.870> stuff<00:04:51.620> I<00:04:51.740> was

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
so here's a few examples of stuff I was

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.170 
so here's a few examples of stuff I was
running<00:04:52.099> around<00:04:52.159> in<00:04:52.430> the<00:04:52.580> yard<00:04:52.759> and<00:04:53.030> shot<00:04:53.300> over

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
running around in the yard and shot over

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.140 
running around in the yard and shot over
the<00:04:56.180> last<00:04:56.330> couple<00:04:56.750> of<00:04:56.840> days<00:04:57.789> so<00:04:58.789> you<00:04:58.849> can<00:04:58.909> see

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
the last couple of days so you can see

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.060 
the last couple of days so you can see
that<00:04:59.360> like<00:04:59.509> I<00:04:59.539> said<00:04:59.659> said<00:05:00.229> earlier<00:05:00.590> this<00:05:00.800> lens

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
that like I said said earlier this lens

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.100 
that like I said said earlier this lens
isn't<00:05:01.280> exactly<00:05:02.000> sharp<00:05:02.360> you<00:05:02.659> want<00:05:02.840> to<00:05:02.930> have

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
isn't exactly sharp you want to have

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.990 
isn't exactly sharp you want to have
your<00:05:03.830> subject<00:05:05.680> straight<00:05:06.680> in<00:05:06.800> the<00:05:06.860> middle<00:05:07.099> of

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
your subject straight in the middle of

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.360 
your subject straight in the middle of
your<00:05:08.180> frame<00:05:08.930> there<00:05:09.229> you<00:05:09.830> can't<00:05:10.039> really<00:05:10.190> do

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
your frame there you can't really do

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.480 
your frame there you can't really do
that<00:05:10.400> the<00:05:11.120> rule<00:05:11.509> of<00:05:11.630> thirds<00:05:11.840> here<00:05:12.229> because<00:05:12.500> on

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
that the rule of thirds here because on

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.610 
that the rule of thirds here because on
the<00:05:13.610> edges<00:05:13.940> it's<00:05:14.090> extremely<00:05:14.750> bad<00:05:14.960> as<00:05:15.259> far<00:05:15.500> as

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
the edges it's extremely bad as far as

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.820 
the edges it's extremely bad as far as
sharpness<00:05:16.099> so<00:05:16.310> here's<00:05:17.300> here's<00:05:17.659> the<00:05:17.780> the<00:05:18.620> best

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
sharpness so here's here's the the best

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.920 
sharpness so here's here's the the best
one<00:05:19.099> I've<00:05:19.250> got<00:05:19.280> over<00:05:20.000> the<00:05:20.150> last<00:05:20.570> couple<00:05:20.900> of

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
one I've got over the last couple of

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.430 
one I've got over the last couple of
days<00:05:21.050> is<00:05:21.320> this<00:05:21.470> chipmunk<00:05:22.159> about<00:05:23.080> about<00:05:24.080> twelve

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
days is this chipmunk about about twelve

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.589 
days is this chipmunk about about twelve
feet<00:05:24.620> away<00:05:24.740> on<00:05:24.860> this<00:05:25.250> and<00:05:25.820> he<00:05:26.030> actually<00:05:26.330> stood

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599 
feet away on this and he actually stood

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:28.719 
feet away on this and he actually stood
there<00:05:26.810> for<00:05:26.990> a<00:05:27.080> little<00:05:27.199> bit<00:05:27.380> and<00:05:27.590> I<00:05:28.039> was<00:05:28.460> able<00:05:28.550> to

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
there for a little bit and I was able to

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.430 
there for a little bit and I was able to
get<00:05:29.229> about<00:05:31.330> twelve<00:05:32.330> fifteen<00:05:32.750> shots<00:05:33.020> out<00:05:33.349> of

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
get about twelve fifteen shots out of

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.469 
get about twelve fifteen shots out of
this<00:05:33.590> and<00:05:33.800> this<00:05:34.310> was<00:05:34.520> the<00:05:34.699> one<00:05:34.880> that<00:05:35.030> was<00:05:35.270> the

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
this and this was the one that was the

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:38.080 
this and this was the one that was the
sharpest<00:05:36.229> so<00:05:36.380> this<00:05:36.560> is<00:05:36.710> what<00:05:37.580> this<00:05:37.789> particular

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
sharpest so this is what this particular

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.760 
sharpest so this is what this particular
lens<00:05:38.419> this<00:05:38.599> is<00:05:38.659> about<00:05:38.990> a<00:05:39.020> sharp<00:05:39.380> edge<00:05:39.530> you'll

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
lens this is about a sharp edge you'll

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.709 
lens this is about a sharp edge you'll
you'll<00:05:40.219> get<00:05:40.520> some<00:05:41.180> of<00:05:41.210> the<00:05:41.300> other<00:05:41.419> lenses

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:41.719 
you'll get some of the other lenses

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:44.830 
you'll get some of the other lenses
might<00:05:41.930> be<00:05:42.080> a<00:05:42.110> little<00:05:42.320> bit<00:05:42.440> sharper<00:05:42.889> but<00:05:43.840> that's

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
might be a little bit sharper but that's

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.760 
might be a little bit sharper but that's
