for the life of this brake pad and then
through<00:01:11.670> here<00:01:11.700> for<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.420> life<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.810> other

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
through here for the life of the other

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.080 
through here for the life of the other
brake<00:01:13.140> pad<00:01:15.229> now<00:01:16.229> remove<00:01:16.619> these<00:01:17.159> two<00:01:17.549> 12

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090

millimeter<00:01:18.540> bolts<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:20.700> we'll<00:01:21.000> fast<00:01:21.240> forward

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
millimeter bolts and we'll fast forward

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:30.030 
millimeter bolts and we'll fast forward
as<00:01:21.720> Don<00:01:21.900> does<00:01:22.140> that

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.720 

now<00:01:30.820> use<00:01:31.030> a<00:01:31.060> large<00:01:31.390> c-clamp<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:33.130> just<00:01:33.370> put<00:01:33.640> it

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
now use a large c-clamp you just put it

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.250 
now use a large c-clamp you just put it
on<00:01:33.820> this<00:01:34.060> end<00:01:34.120> on<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:34.750> back<00:01:34.870> of<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.110> caliper

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
on this end on the back of the caliper

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.890 
on this end on the back of the caliper
and<00:01:35.770> on<00:01:36.280> this<00:01:36.520> brake<00:01:36.730> pad<00:01:36.970> and<00:01:37.210> just<00:01:37.480> twist<00:01:37.690> it

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
and on this brake pad and just twist it

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.500 
and on this brake pad and just twist it
in<00:01:38.080> and<00:01:38.620> this<00:01:38.980> is<00:01:39.040> going<00:01:39.220> to<00:01:39.280> push<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:40.030> caliper

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
in and this is going to push the caliper

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.570 
in and this is going to push the caliper
piston<00:01:40.660> in<00:01:41.140> and<00:01:41.560> make<00:01:41.890> it<00:01:41.920> easier<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.400> pull<00:01:42.550> the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
piston in and make it easier to pull the

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:53.130 
piston in and make it easier to pull the
caliper<00:01:43.060> up<00:01:43.210> and<00:01:43.360> off

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.039 

and<00:01:53.620> then<00:01:53.710> remove<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.100> large<00:01:54.280> c-clamp

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:07.699 

hold<00:01:59.049> the<00:01:59.170> caliper<00:01:59.590> free<00:01:59.829> and<00:02:00.369> set<00:02:00.939> it<00:02:01.060> aside

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:21.940 

now<00:02:08.709> pry<00:02:09.039> out<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.220> brake<00:02:09.610> pads
