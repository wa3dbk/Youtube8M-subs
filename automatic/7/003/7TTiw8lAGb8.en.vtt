00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.650
 so hey people gets to a new one 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.300
 video thanks for turning my name 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.099
 is at places today I have one 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.820
 new weapons guide for you and 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.820
 that 's the 160 with the label strike 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.010
 dlc was added the weapon became 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.099
 from the Italian manufacturer Petrova 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.189
 knight presented in 2008 is so 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.230
 a not so old weapon as already 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.570
 Before that the weapon came here 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.390
 with the label strike dlc added that is 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.120
 that esc is a prerequisite for 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.590
 unlock the weapon after that needs 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.180
 but only very simple 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.129
 things to do and that would be 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.410
 three lives with storm rifles too 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.020
 and then 20 more 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.860
 headshots again with storm rifles 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.079
 to achieve 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.090
 The whole can be in several rounds 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.610
 So it does not have to be split up 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.059
 cramp in a single round done 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.520
 become 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.190
 the damage to the weapon is quite 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.140
 normal 25 percent at a distance of 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.299
 eight meters and then falls to one 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.060
 minimum damage of 18 on one 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.680
 distance of 55 meters or more from that 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.479
 means one has here again completely 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.610
 normal assault rifle 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.500
 in plain language, it also means that one 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.900
 two to five hits on short 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.790
 distances need an opponent of 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.049
 still 100 percent live left 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.439
 has to do it 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.990
 for longer distances, 55 or more 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.729
 then you need just three to meters 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.560
 six hits but that's what it actually is 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.180
 should not be so hard because the 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.570
 weapon is really incredible here 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.040
 exactly the moderate fire rate of 700 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.960
 shot per minute threatened that already 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.299
 a little bit to the weapon here he is 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.520
 on medium to long distances too 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.420
 Use as a real one 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.920
 incredible monastery beast is called 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.380
 where the fire are disposal of 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.420
 Fully automatic and the influence mode 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.159
 being the fully automatic actually 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.170
 the mode is the one most of the time 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.020
 or even exclusively 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.729
 will use if you are on shorter 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.530
 distance is on the way or sometimes the 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.180
 one or the other opponent then hits 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.049
 Maybe you have to leave the 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.970
 shoot hip 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.069
 even if I have the hip scattering here with 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.000
 this is classified moderately 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.700
 sometimes a little more than 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.820
 that means she is a little worse than 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.290
 the other storm rifles or long the 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.750
 most storm rifles 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.190
 But let's get back to the standard then 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.140
 that's really crucial thing 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.550
 the choice of weapon is pretty hip 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.430
 and that's why we have one here too 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.440
 standard magazine size of 30 plus one 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.810
 and one of course is in the 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.870
 Chamber also in the standard direction 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.150
 proceeds after a long time with two or 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.580
 3.15 seconds and that's really one 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.100
 cool time the recoil is in turn 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.110
 a thing that I find particularly good 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.150
 because he is relatively strong in the 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.610
 vertical pronounced but for that 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.010
 not so much horizontal that is 3 2 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.080
 quite easy to control how to 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.030
 here at the test on the wall looks 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.120
 So she pulls up quite far though 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.050
 not so far to the right or left me 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.610
 I already have something 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.470
 addressed and that is this weapon 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.540
 really good on middle to here 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.160
 long distances the ball 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.840
 speed is what you do here as well 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.020
 best to work a bit too 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.910
 should be with 650 meters per second 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.500
 your projectile really not too 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.590
 long around in the air 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.540
 it is then your goal we will meet 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.489
 time to setup my favorite weather 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.620
 Of course there are four things optics 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.500
 to run and then a part 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.810
 under the run as optics I have here 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.420
 a red dot sight while I prefer 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.000
 personally the coyote red dot visor 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.580
 everyone else is looking for a stronger one 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.579
 so magnifica zion have a stronger one 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.650
 zoom levels are not that good 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.329
 if you could say that of course 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.370
 the better on longer distances are 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.519
 However, you will be the recoil too 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.019
 really extreme and then if you remember 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.910
 really a bit shorter 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.890
 distances or short to medium 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.170
 Distances on the way it was sometimes 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.930
 you can happen with that 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.610
 red dot sight is best on the way and 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.220
 it works on longer distances 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.170
 still good as an accessory there 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.760
 it's the green laser with me, but they are 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.769
 actually just because nothing 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.269
 other good thing about it and with that 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.620
 at least you have a laser visor 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.750
 again the advantage that the scatter 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.359
 when shooting from the hip something 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.640
 is improved on the run one finds 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.039
 then the mouth then slows down the 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.900
 Vertical recoil slightly reduce that 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.400
 means when shooting is applied now 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.590
 directly out 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.530
 especially that the vertical recoil 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.030
 something has been reduced is negative here 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.280
 only that one scatter now something more 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.590
 Of course, that's not the case 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.060
 I am also super alternative 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.669
 the muzzle-fire was pretty cool 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.800
 because it has no disadvantage but 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.630
 also holds fewer benefits and that is 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.120
 relatively logical and that will be 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.740
 muzzle fire no longer displayed below 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.870
 The run are usually working out 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.020
 and angled grabbed quite popular 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.270
 in this case the 160 really 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.620
 if you have the low kik 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.430
 firing a weapon that's the first one 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.139
 Shot has relatively little recoil 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.919
 that with the club and bent handle 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.990
 not as much 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:10.020
 that's why i find it here round or short 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.970
 So, better handle yourself for that 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.949
 the brake has decided the 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.770
 really good but has the disadvantage 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.330
 the slightly worse or 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.550
 deteriorated accuracy with it 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.380
 which can be with the round or short 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.240
 then handle this effect as well 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.860
 then she gets better again 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.990
 does not come to the same level 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.860
 back where she was in the beginning but you have 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.389
 So that's a good compromise he's 160 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.520
 So really a good weapon 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:37.349
 medium to longer distances 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.720
 short distances is the then, however 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:42.780
 not so good at a rate anymore 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.270
 you will get only 700 shots per minute 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.949
 often simply outbid with weapons 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.849
 as akf 2000 eg even after ace 23 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:53.699
 and many others 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:56.490
 who, however, many mode conquest 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:57.900
 is traveling with the 160 well 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.849
 have a lot of fun 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.380
 It was fun for me too 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:03.240
 to produce video here that is me 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.639
 Of course, hope you enjoy this, too 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.050
 did while watching if that's you 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:08.639
 I liked the video here then 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.220
 me a thumbs up 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.199
 friend and if you have more weapons 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.690
 want to see guide then separates an abo 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:18.680
 do not guarantee thanks for seeing and 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.680
 Until next time
