products we've gone for our new reef
tank<00:00:08.250> so<00:00:09.000> first<00:00:09.269> we<00:00:09.510> got<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:10.139> coralife<00:00:10.769> aqua

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
tank so first we got this coralife aqua

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.580 
tank so first we got this coralife aqua
light<00:00:11.490> which<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.150> power<00:00:12.570> compact<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.349> it<00:00:13.469> only

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
light which is power compact and it only

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.279 
light which is power compact and it only
carries<00:00:14.070> one<00:00:14.429> power<00:00:14.670> compact<00:00:15.179> bulb<00:00:15.570> it's<00:00:16.109> a

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
carries one power compact bulb it's a

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.670 
carries one power compact bulb it's a
50-50<00:00:17.070> bulb<00:00:17.310> it's<00:00:17.580> 96<00:00:18.119> wats<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:18.600> 5050<00:00:19.230> means

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
50-50 bulb it's 96 wats so 5050 means

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.390 
50-50 bulb it's 96 wats so 5050 means
that<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.730> blue<00:00:20.970> part<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.390> actinic<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.400> the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
that the blue part is actinic and the

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.599 
that the blue part is actinic and the
white<00:00:23.850> part<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.390> 10,000<00:00:25.199> k<00:00:25.350> for<00:00:26.189> those<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.550> you

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
white part is 10,000 k for those of you

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.670 
white part is 10,000 k for those of you
who<00:00:26.789> don't<00:00:26.820> know<00:00:27.119> about<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:28.050> 10,000

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
case basically a very bluish white and

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.530 
case basically a very bluish white and
the<00:00:31.560> blues<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.399> clinic<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:32.940> just<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.300> blue

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
the blues and I clinic is just a blue

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.280 
the blues and I clinic is just a blue
okay<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.440> that's<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.160> light<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.899> I've<00:00:36.899> bought

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
okay so that's the light and I've bought

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.619 
okay so that's the light and I've bought
an<00:00:37.440> leg<00:00:37.710> score<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.340> at<00:00:38.520> big<00:00:38.760> al's<00:00:38.969> for

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
an leg score of that at big al's for

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.900 
an leg score of that at big al's for
ninety<00:00:39.930> nine<00:00:40.110> dollars<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.950> sale<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.850> think

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
ninety nine dollars on sale and I think

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.639 
ninety nine dollars on sale and I think
the<00:00:42.300> regular<00:00:42.690> price<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.350> Canada<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.149> 146<00:00:45.149> 99<00:00:45.780> so

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
the regular price in Canada is 146 99 so

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.830 
the regular price in Canada is 146 99 so
that's<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.070> lighting<00:00:47.399> we've<00:00:47.550> chosen<00:00:47.850> just

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
that's the lighting we've chosen just

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.490 
that's the lighting we've chosen just
put<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.020> aside<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:50.360> then<00:00:51.360> we<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.260> power

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
put that aside and then we the power

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.150 
put that aside and then we the power
heads<00:00:52.829> we've<00:00:53.039> gone<00:00:53.280> our<00:00:53.989> aqueon<00:00:55.160> circulation

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
heads we've gone our aqueon circulation

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.900 
heads we've gone our aqueon circulation
pumps<00:00:56.550> they're<00:00:57.090> 500<00:00:57.809> gallons<00:00:58.140> per<00:00:58.289> hour<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.910> I

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
pumps they're 500 gallons per hour and I

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.369 
pumps they're 500 gallons per hour and I
got<00:01:00.120> two<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.449> these<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.280> I<00:01:02.280> put<00:01:02.789> um<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.629> put<00:01:04.049> one

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
got two of these and I put um I put one

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.289 
got two of these and I put um I put one
on<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.680> back<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.159> then<00:01:05.280> one<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.760> side<00:01:05.939> and

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
on the back and then one on the side and

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.760 
on the back and then one on the side and
that<00:01:06.840> should<00:01:07.110> provide<00:01:07.409> me<00:01:07.619> with<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
that should provide me with the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.969 
that should provide me with the
circulation<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.580> need<00:01:08.760> for<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> coral<00:01:09.479> reef<00:01:09.540> and

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
circulation I need for a coral reef and

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:16.100 
circulation I need for a coral reef and
then<00:01:12.439> for<00:01:13.439> filtration<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.549> got<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.840> my

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
then for filtration I got this is my

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.670 
then for filtration I got this is my
favorite<00:01:16.590> thing<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:17.070> all<00:01:17.369> it's<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:18.540> Tom<00:01:18.990> Rapids

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
favorite thing of all it's a Tom Rapids

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.179 
favorite thing of all it's a Tom Rapids
profilter<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:21.320> it's<00:01:22.320> not<00:01:22.560> like<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.950> see<00:01:23.159> on

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
profilter and it's not like you see on

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.070 
profilter and it's not like you see on
all<00:01:23.700> those<00:01:24.030> other<00:01:24.270> reef<00:01:24.540> tanks<00:01:24.930> it's

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
all those other reef tanks it's

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.219 
all those other reef tanks it's
basically<00:01:26.000> it's<00:01:27.000> like<00:01:27.119> basically<00:01:27.630> like<00:01:28.200> a

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
basically it's like basically like a

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.160 
basically it's like basically like a
canister<00:01:28.890> filter<00:01:29.340> but<00:01:29.909> its<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.299> mix<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.990> wet

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
canister filter but its a mix of a wet

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.260 
canister filter but its a mix of a wet
and<00:01:31.320> dry<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.770> canister<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.909> can<00:01:33.090> see

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
and dry in a canister so you can see

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.600 
and dry in a canister so you can see
here<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.600> has<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.780> skimmer<00:01:34.229> built<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.040> how

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
here it has a skimmer built in and how

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.069 
here it has a skimmer built in and how
it<00:01:35.700> works<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.150> instead<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.509> having<00:01:36.630> an

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
it works is instead of having an

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.069 
it works is instead of having an
internal<00:01:37.650> overflow<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.430> has<00:01:38.880> an<00:01:39.180> external

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
internal overflow it has an external

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.899 
internal overflow it has an external
overflow<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.590> think<00:01:40.920> it's<00:01:41.070> called<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.520> that

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
overflow I think it's called and that

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.420 
overflow I think it's called and that
just<00:01:42.150> hangs<00:01:42.299> on<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.630> back<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.740> tank<00:01:44.159> and

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
just hangs on the back of the tank and

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.789 
just hangs on the back of the tank and
it<00:01:45.030> takes<00:01:45.270> water<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.020> then<00:01:46.110> as<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.590> water

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
it takes water in and then as the water

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.300 
it takes water in and then as the water
shoots<00:01:47.189> out<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.549> siphons<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.390> water<00:01:49.229> from<00:01:50.189> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
shoots out it siphons in water from the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.550 
shoots out it siphons in water from the
pressure<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.880> then<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.689> goes<00:01:51.840> down<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.320> there

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
pressure and then it goes down in there

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.380 
pressure and then it goes down in there
and<00:01:52.590> then<00:01:52.950> goes<00:01:53.310> through<00:01:53.610> here<00:01:53.850> down<00:01:54.119> through

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
and then goes through here down through

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.310 
and then goes through here down through
all<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.570> all<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:56.390> filtration<00:01:57.390> things<00:01:58.049> and

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
all of all the filtration things and

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.160 
all of all the filtration things and
then<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.799> comes<00:01:58.950> up<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.909> goes<00:02:00.240> out<00:02:00.479> through

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
then it comes up and goes out through

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.590 
then it comes up and goes out through
the<00:02:01.320> pump<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:02.100> has<00:02:02.280> two<00:02:02.579> pumps<00:02:02.969> one<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.329> for

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
the pump and it has two pumps one is for

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.260 
the pump and it has two pumps one is for
the<00:02:03.630> filter<00:02:04.259> which<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:04.979> 700<00:02:05.700> gallons<00:02:05.850> per<00:02:06.149> hour

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
the filter which is 700 gallons per hour

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.089 
the filter which is 700 gallons per hour
and<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.630> other<00:02:06.780> ones<00:02:07.049> just<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.350> small<00:02:07.619> pump<00:02:07.860> for

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
and the other ones just a small pump for

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.620 
and the other ones just a small pump for
the<00:02:08.129> protein<00:02:08.640> skimmer

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
the protein skimmer

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.160 
the protein skimmer
and<00:02:10.220> when<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.250> installed<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.120> put<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.450> took

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
and when I installed this I put I took

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.520 
and when I installed this I put I took
out<00:02:13.350> some<00:02:13.590> bio<00:02:13.800> balls<00:02:14.130> because<00:02:14.550> Oh<00:02:14.700> in<00:02:15.690> that

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
out some bio balls because Oh in that

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.790 
out some bio balls because Oh in that
they're<00:02:16.860> here<00:02:17.160> there's<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:18.110> like<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.140> micro

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
they're here there's a like a micro

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.500 
they're here there's a like a micro
cloth<00:02:20.070> to<00:02:20.310> filter<00:02:20.820> out<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.180> smaller

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
cloth to filter out the smaller

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.530 
cloth to filter out the smaller
particles<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:23.700> then<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.060> next<00:02:24.090> one<00:02:24.480> is

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
particles and then the next one is

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.260 
particles and then the next one is
filled<00:02:24.930> with<00:02:25.020> bio<00:02:25.290> balls<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.950> then<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.120> last

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
filled with bio balls and then the last

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.690 
filled with bio balls and then the last
one<00:02:27.590> has<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.620> think<00:02:29.720> another<00:02:30.890> it's<00:02:31.890> called<00:02:32.190> glad

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
one has I think another it's called glad

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.330 
one has I think another it's called glad
something<00:02:33.270> glass<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.140> then<00:02:34.590> on<00:02:34.740> top<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.190> is

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
something glass and then on top of it is

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.450 
something glass and then on top of it is
just<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.610> carbon<00:02:36.060> pillow<00:02:36.540> cloth<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.290> then<00:02:38.160> I

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
just a carbon pillow cloth and then I

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.610 
just a carbon pillow cloth and then I
took<00:02:38.700> some<00:02:39.060> bio<00:02:39.300> balls<00:02:39.660> out<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:39.990> there's<00:02:40.530> this

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
took some bio balls out and there's this

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.980 
took some bio balls out and there's this
new<00:02:40.830> thing<00:02:40.860> called<00:02:41.100> chemic<00:02:41.730> pure<00:02:42.060> which<00:02:42.780> is

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
new thing called chemic pure which is

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.260 
new thing called chemic pure which is
basically<00:02:43.620> just<00:02:43.740> a<00:02:44.040> carbon<00:02:44.490> bag<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.120> has

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
basically just a carbon bag and it has

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.110 
basically just a carbon bag and it has
bacteria<00:02:45.990> in<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.350> so<00:02:46.890> which<00:02:47.040> mix<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.490> carbon<00:02:48.030> in

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
bacteria in it so which mix of carbon in

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.420 
bacteria in it so which mix of carbon in
some<00:02:48.360> bacteria<00:02:48.900> which<00:02:49.530> helps<00:02:49.890> start<00:02:50.130> off<00:02:50.280> the

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
some bacteria which helps start off the

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.060 
some bacteria which helps start off the
new<00:02:50.580> tank<00:02:50.880> so<00:02:51.320> that's<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.470> things<00:02:52.740> I<00:02:52.860> bought

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
once a week it's called reef accelerator

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.970 
once a week it's called reef accelerator
it<00:03:13.550> it<00:03:14.550> helps<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.510> growth<00:03:16.020> in<00:03:16.320> corals<00:03:16.770> and

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
it it helps the growth in corals and

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.440 
it it helps the growth in corals and
promotes<00:03:17.550> purple<00:03:18.150> algae<00:03:18.570> and<00:03:20.060> then<00:03:21.060> just<00:03:21.270> for

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
promotes purple algae and then just for

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.910 
promotes purple algae and then just for
