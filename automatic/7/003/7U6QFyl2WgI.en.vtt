I'm throwing some stone into it it's
just<00:03:44.620> going<00:03:44.889> to<00:03:45.569> go<00:03:46.569> straight<00:03:46.629> in<00:03:47.049> and<00:03:47.229> it's

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
just going to go straight in and it's

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:49.710 
just going to go straight in and it's
not<00:03:48.129> going<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:48.579> move<00:03:48.729> on<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.269> next<00:03:49.419> one

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
not going to move on to the next one

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.140 
not going to move on to the next one
that's<00:03:50.440> because<00:03:50.889> I<00:03:50.979> am<00:03:51.010> a<00:03:51.129> lever<00:03:51.400> activated<00:03:52.030> to

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
that's because I am a lever activated to

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.110 
that's because I am a lever activated to
it<00:03:52.530> so<00:03:53.530> if<00:03:53.680> I<00:03:53.769> take<00:03:53.949> the<00:03:54.129> left<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.729> lever<00:03:54.970> off

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.190 

it's<00:04:02.140> going<00:04:02.349> to<00:04:02.410> go<00:04:02.500> into<00:04:02.739> this<00:04:02.890> one<00:04:03.239> okay<00:04:04.450> now

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
it's going to go into this one okay now

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.780 
it's going to go into this one okay now
it's<00:04:05.349> not<00:04:05.680> moving<00:04:05.860> it<00:04:06.069> to<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.190> chest<00:04:06.520> yet

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
it's not moving it to the chest yet

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.780 
it's not moving it to the chest yet
because<00:04:07.599> didn't<00:04:08.500> activate<00:04:08.860> it<00:04:09.040> so<00:04:09.220> now<00:04:09.459> to<00:04:09.550> the

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
because didn't activate it so now to the

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.250 
because didn't activate it so now to the
chest<00:04:10.140> so<00:04:11.140> altogether<00:04:11.800> be<00:04:12.370> sourcing<00:04:12.849> in<00:04:12.970> there

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
chest so altogether be sourcing in there

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.740 
chest so altogether be sourcing in there
it's<00:04:14.260> going<00:04:14.440> to<00:04:14.500> move<00:04:14.620> it<00:04:14.800> all<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.220> way<00:04:15.750> until

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
it's going to move it all the way until

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.390 
it's going to move it all the way until
it<00:04:17.079> reaches<00:04:17.410> a<00:04:17.440> chest<00:04:17.769> or<00:04:18.010> the<00:04:18.040> end<00:04:18.220> of<00:04:18.310> the

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
it reaches a chest or the end of the

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.250 
it reaches a chest or the end of the
line<00:04:18.549> so<00:04:19.209> I<00:04:19.239> think<00:04:19.329> that's<00:04:19.600> pretty<00:04:19.840> cool<00:04:20.019> I

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
line so I think that's pretty cool I

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.920 
line so I think that's pretty cool I
like<00:04:20.650> it<00:04:20.680> I<00:04:21.070> could<00:04:21.850> definitely<00:04:22.150> use<00:04:22.389> it<00:04:22.540> when<00:04:22.900> I

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
like it I could definitely use it when I

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.190 
like it I could definitely use it when I
play<00:04:23.020> survival<00:04:23.590> different<00:04:24.190> things<00:04:25.169> now<00:04:26.169> uh

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
play survival different things now uh

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.140 
play survival different things now uh
the<00:04:27.070> next<00:04:27.310> thing<00:04:27.460> we're<00:04:27.550> going<00:04:27.639> to<00:04:27.730> do<00:04:27.850> is<00:04:28.090> a

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
the next thing we're going to do is a

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.740 
the next thing we're going to do is a
let<00:04:28.570> is<00:04:28.780> a<00:04:28.900> redstone<00:04:29.410> comparator<00:04:30.450> now<00:04:31.450> what<00:04:31.630> it

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
let is a redstone comparator now what it

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.159 
let is a redstone comparator now what it
does<00:04:31.780> is<00:04:32.110> it<00:04:32.410> basically<00:04:32.680> uh<00:04:33.300> excuse<00:04:34.300> me<00:04:34.330> kapow

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
does is it basically uh excuse me kapow

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.260 
does is it basically uh excuse me kapow
rates<00:04:35.470> compares<00:04:37.139> how<00:04:38.139> much<00:04:38.290> an<00:04:38.440> item<00:04:38.710> is<00:04:38.800> worth

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
rates compares how much an item is worth

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.360 
rates compares how much an item is worth
so<00:04:40.270> if<00:04:41.169> we<00:04:41.350> want<00:04:41.530> this<00:04:41.650> thing<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:42.070> be<00:04:42.100> able<00:04:42.250> to

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
so if we want this thing to be able to

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.040 
so if we want this thing to be able to
power<00:04:42.550> it<00:04:42.729> so<00:04:42.910> fully<00:04:43.150> we<00:04:43.450> switch<00:04:43.660> it<00:04:43.690> on<00:04:43.900> by

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
power it so fully we switch it on by

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.340 
power it so fully we switch it on by
right-clicking<00:04:44.530> it<00:04:44.830> and<00:04:45.990> let's<00:04:46.990> we're<00:04:47.169> going

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
right-clicking it and let's we're going

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.570 
right-clicking it and let's we're going
to<00:04:47.410> put<00:04:47.560> in<00:04:47.650> a<00:04:47.710> diamond<00:04:47.889> so<00:04:48.130> which<00:04:48.280> is<00:04:48.430> worth

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
to put in a diamond so which is worth

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.850 
to put in a diamond so which is worth
quite<00:04:48.880> a<00:04:48.970> bit<00:04:49.000> in<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.300> chest<00:04:49.570> so<00:04:50.440> now<00:04:50.590> those

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
quite a bit in the chest so now those

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.420 
quite a bit in the chest so now those
lights<00:04:51.130> are<00:04:51.280> on<00:04:51.960> technically<00:04:52.960> that's

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
lights are on technically that's

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.390 
lights are on technically that's
basically<00:04:54.430> how<00:04:54.700> the<00:04:55.210> comparator<00:04:55.930> works<00:04:56.400> just

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
basically how the comparator works just

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.820 
basically how the comparator works just
extracts<00:04:58.240> the<00:04:58.330> energy<00:04:58.690> from<00:04:59.020> it<00:04:59.169> from<00:04:59.710> each

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
extracts the energy from it from each

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.650 
extracts the energy from it from each
other<00:05:00.040> from<00:05:00.970> the<00:05:01.270> object<00:05:01.570> blah<00:05:01.810> all<00:05:02.410> right<00:05:02.530> so

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
other from the object blah all right so

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.320 
other from the object blah all right so
now<00:05:04.660> last<00:05:05.260> but<00:05:05.500> not<00:05:05.620> least<00:05:05.950> this<00:05:06.669> is<00:05:06.729> the<00:05:07.060> best

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
now last but not least this is the best

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.570 
now last but not least this is the best
bit<00:05:07.750> a<00:05:09.060> Minecraft<00:05:10.060> a<00:05:10.950> Minecraft<00:05:11.950> cart<00:05:12.280> with

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
bit a Minecraft a Minecraft cart with

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.690 
bit a Minecraft a Minecraft cart with
TNT<00:05:13.320> probably<00:05:14.320> one<00:05:14.440> of<00:05:14.470> my<00:05:14.620> favorites<00:05:15.070> now

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
TNT probably one of my favorites now

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.100 
TNT probably one of my favorites now
there's<00:05:15.970> two<00:05:16.240> different<00:05:16.270> things<00:05:16.810> you<00:05:16.960> could

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
there's two different things you could

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.890 
there's two different things you could
do<00:05:17.289> with<00:05:17.440> them<00:05:17.820> first<00:05:18.820> thing<00:05:19.120> if<00:05:19.330> you<00:05:19.479> want<00:05:19.690> a

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
do with them first thing if you want a

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.940 
do with them first thing if you want a
slow<00:05:20.590> one<00:05:20.890> like<00:05:21.130> a<00:05:21.160> slow<00:05:21.610> explosion<00:05:22.740> you<00:05:23.740> just

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
slow one like a slow explosion you just

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.170 
slow one like a slow explosion you just
got<00:05:24.130> to<00:05:24.160> basically<00:05:25.979> have<00:05:26.979> one<00:05:27.010> activator<00:05:27.910> rail

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
got to basically have one activator rail

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.070 
got to basically have one activator rail
and<00:05:28.390> one<00:05:28.750> activator<00:05:29.410> rail<00:05:30.810> activator<00:05:31.810> rail

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
and one activator rail activator rail

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.840 
and one activator rail activator rail
basically<00:05:32.620> just<00:05:32.770> activates<00:05:33.370> it<00:05:33.550> for<00:05:33.729> you

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
basically just activates it for you

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.250 
basically just activates it for you
which<00:05:34.000> is<00:05:34.150> this<00:05:34.330> thing<00:05:34.570> and<00:05:34.780> it's<00:05:34.930> already

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
which is this thing and it's already

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.370 
which is this thing and it's already
powered<00:05:35.620> on<00:05:35.710> by<00:05:35.860> one<00:05:36.070> redstone<00:05:36.780> so<00:05:37.780> I'm<00:05:38.080> going

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
powered on by one redstone so I'm going

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.590 
powered on by one redstone so I'm going
to<00:05:38.470> put<00:05:38.650> one<00:05:38.830> mine<00:05:39.010> Crump<00:05:39.280> minecart<00:05:39.940> in<00:05:40.150> T<00:05:40.360> here

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
to put one mine Crump minecart in T here

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.900 
to put one mine Crump minecart in T here
and<00:05:40.780> it's<00:05:41.260> going<00:05:41.440> to<00:05:41.590> blow<00:05:41.800> up<00:05:42.419> once<00:05:43.419> it<00:05:43.570> goes

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
and it's going to blow up once it goes

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:50.810 
and it's going to blow up once it goes
I'll<00:05:45.910> just<00:05:46.120> give<00:05:46.360> it<00:05:46.450> a<00:05:46.510> bit<00:05:46.660> of<00:05:46.690> a<00:05:46.810> boost<00:05:47.050> you

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.379 

see<00:05:51.820> you<00:05:51.910> guys

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389 
see you guys

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:55.370 
see you guys
it<00:05:52.479> blows<00:05:52.870> up<00:05:53.139> pretty<00:05:54.070> cool<00:05:54.310> right

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
it blows up pretty cool right

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.920 
it blows up pretty cool right
as<00:05:55.500> for<00:05:55.980> this<00:05:56.070> one<00:05:56.130> obviously<00:05:57.090> I'm<00:05:57.900> just

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
as for this one obviously I'm just

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.990 
as for this one obviously I'm just
showing<00:05:58.740> you<00:05:58.770> that's<00:05:59.250> obviously<00:05:59.640> a<00:05:59.700> slower

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
showing you that's obviously a slower

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.520 
showing you that's obviously a slower
one<00:06:00.300> if<00:06:00.540> you<00:06:00.630> want<00:06:00.780> to<00:06:00.810> make<00:06:00.960> it<00:06:01.080> creep<00:06:01.290> up<00:06:01.440> on

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
one if you want to make it creep up on

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.410 
one if you want to make it creep up on
these<00:06:01.680> things<00:06:01.830> this<00:06:02.400> is<00:06:02.460> obviously<00:06:02.910> a<00:06:02.970> faster

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.420 
these things this is obviously a faster

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:09.020 
these things this is obviously a faster
one<00:06:04.340> by<00:06:05.340> just<00:06:05.580> putting<00:06:05.760> a<00:06:06.060> redstone<00:06:08.030> redstone

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
one by just putting a redstone redstone

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.770 
one by just putting a redstone redstone
booster<00:06:09.660> thing<00:06:09.900> and<00:06:10.200> it<00:06:10.680> blows<00:06:10.830> up<00:06:11.040> faster<00:06:11.780> so

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
booster thing and it blows up faster so

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.310 
booster thing and it blows up faster so
uh<00:06:13.490> yeah<00:06:14.490> that's<00:06:14.610> pretty<00:06:14.910> much<00:06:15.030> it<00:06:15.240> guys<00:06:15.320> hope

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
uh yeah that's pretty much it guys hope

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.590 
uh yeah that's pretty much it guys hope
