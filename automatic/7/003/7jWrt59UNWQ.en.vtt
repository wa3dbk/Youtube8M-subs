well here we can see as we zoom in on

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.579 
well here we can see as we zoom in on
this<00:00:42.089> photograph<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:43.019> there's<00:00:43.229> a<00:00:43.319> lot<00:00:43.469> of

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 
this photograph that there's a lot of

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:45.559 
this photograph that there's a lot of
noise<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:43.979> background<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.729> that<00:00:45.389> this

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:45.569 
noise in the background in that this

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:46.879 
noise in the background in that this
image<00:00:45.749> is<00:00:45.960> going<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.139> need<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> little<00:00:46.709> bit<00:00:46.799> of

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:46.889 
image is going to need a little bit of

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:48.889 
image is going to need a little bit of
work<00:00:47.159> so<00:00:47.699> let's<00:00:47.879> say<00:00:48.059> we<00:00:48.239> go<00:00:48.420> ahead<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.719> we

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
work so let's say we go ahead and we

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.689 
work so let's say we go ahead and we
reduce<00:00:49.289> some<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.499> the<00:00:49.649> luminance<00:00:50.100> noise<00:00:50.159> here

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
reduce some of the luminance noise here

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.090 
reduce some of the luminance noise here
and<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.030> maintain<00:00:51.510> some<00:00:51.809> details<00:00:52.469> by<00:00:52.709> bringing

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
and we maintain some details by bringing

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.279 
and we maintain some details by bringing
that<00:00:53.219> detail<00:00:53.579> slider<00:00:53.879> up<00:00:54.149> there<00:00:54.719> nice<00:00:55.019> amount

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
that detail slider up there nice amount

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.109 
that detail slider up there nice amount
of<00:00:55.379> contrast<00:00:55.979> a<00:00:56.219> little<00:00:56.459> bit<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.670> color<00:00:56.879> noise

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:57.119 
of contrast a little bit of color noise

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:59.539 
of contrast a little bit of color noise
reduction<00:00:57.479> and<00:00:58.170> now<00:00:58.469> our<00:00:58.589> noise<00:00:58.829> reduction<00:00:59.100> is

00:00:59.539 --> 00:00:59.549 
reduction and now our noise reduction is

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:02.389 
reduction and now our noise reduction is
set<00:00:59.999> yet<00:01:00.659> we<00:01:00.809> need<00:01:00.959> to<00:01:01.170> sharpen<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> image<00:01:02.219> as

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
set yet we need to sharpen the image as

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.030 
set yet we need to sharpen the image as
well<00:01:02.579> because<00:01:03.329> if<00:01:03.449> we<00:01:03.569> press<00:01:03.839> the<00:01:04.019> P<00:01:04.260> key<00:01:04.290> here

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
well because if we press the P key here

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.090 
well because if we press the P key here
we<00:01:05.190> can<00:01:05.339> see<00:01:05.489> our<00:01:05.580> before<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.270> then<00:01:06.359> our<00:01:06.899> after

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
we can see our before and then our after

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.069 
we can see our before and then our after
the<00:01:08.100> image<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.700> little<00:01:09.119> bit<00:01:09.270> soft<00:01:09.570> let<00:01:09.960> me

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
the image is a little bit soft let me

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:11.569 
the image is a little bit soft let me
zoom<00:01:10.289> in<00:01:10.439> even<00:01:10.530> further<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.219> you<00:01:11.310> can<00:01:11.430> really

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579 
zoom in even further so you can really

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.520 
zoom in even further so you can really
see<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.030> here<00:01:12.479> we<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.719> our<00:01:12.869> before<00:01:13.049> and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
see this here we have our before and

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.029 
see this here we have our before and
then<00:01:13.619> now<00:01:14.430> our<00:01:14.640> after<00:01:15.509> now<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.350> can<00:01:16.500> zoom<00:01:16.770> in

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
then now our after now you can zoom in

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.370 
then now our after now you can zoom in
and<00:01:17.100> out<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.520> your<00:01:17.880> photos<00:01:18.270> by<00:01:18.899> pressing

the right this really helps us identify

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.169 
the right this really helps us identify
what's<00:01:52.950> happening<00:01:53.399> when<00:01:53.579> we<00:01:53.700> sharpen<00:01:54.090> the

what's happening when we sharpen the

what's happening when we sharpen the
image<00:01:54.479> now<00:01:55.079> let's<00:01:55.259> exaggerate<00:01:55.679> the

image now let's exaggerate the
sharpening<00:01:56.460> for<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.729> moment<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.240> we'll<00:01:57.359> leave

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
sharpening for a moment so we'll leave

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.270 
sharpening for a moment so we'll leave
this<00:01:57.840> really<00:01:58.170> high<00:01:58.380> here<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.859> then<00:01:58.979> make<00:01:59.100> our

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
this really high here and then make our

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.550 
this really high here and then make our
way<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.460> radius<00:01:59.999> now<00:02:00.810> if<00:02:00.899> we<00:02:01.020> do<00:02:01.139> the<00:02:01.289> same

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
way to radius now if we do the same

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.429 
way to radius now if we do the same
thing<00:02:01.950> hold<00:02:02.429> down<00:02:02.670> option<00:02:02.999> or<00:02:03.450> alt<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.049> then

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
click and drag radius what we're going

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.190 
click and drag radius what we're going
to<00:02:05.969> see<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.479> sharpening<00:02:06.929> is<00:02:07.049> going

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
to see is that the sharpening is going

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.169 
to see is that the sharpening is going
to<00:02:07.259> extend<00:02:07.859> out<00:02:08.130> from<00:02:08.280> those<00:02:08.520> edges<00:02:09.030> now

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
to extend out from those edges now

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.240 
to extend out from those edges now
they're<00:02:09.390> almost<00:02:09.569> glowing<00:02:10.140> if<00:02:10.860> we<00:02:11.039> want<00:02:11.220> to

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
they're almost glowing if we want to

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.160 
they're almost glowing if we want to
tighten<00:02:11.670> this<00:02:11.760> up<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.299> radius<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.840> really

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
tighten this up so the radius is really

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.559 
tighten this up so the radius is really
close<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.769> edges<00:02:14.129> we<00:02:14.610> can<00:02:14.640> have<00:02:14.909> a<00:02:14.940> really

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
close to the edges we can have a really

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.589 
close to the edges we can have a really
or<00:02:15.930> low<00:02:16.469> amount<00:02:16.799> regards<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.489> our<00:02:17.579> radius<00:02:17.939> okay

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
or low amount regards to our radius okay

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.990 
or low amount regards to our radius okay
well<00:02:18.930> how<00:02:19.079> then<00:02:19.290> does<00:02:19.439> detail<00:02:19.920> work<00:02:20.129> well<00:02:20.849> we

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
well how then does detail work well we

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.759 
well how then does detail work well we
already<00:02:21.120> know<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.359> little<00:02:21.569> bit<00:02:21.750> about<00:02:21.989> this<00:02:22.260> if

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
already know a little bit about this if

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.770 
already know a little bit about this if
we<00:02:22.890> hold<00:02:23.099> down<00:02:23.189> option<00:02:23.519> or<00:02:23.909> alt<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.420> click<00:02:24.629> and

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
we hold down option or alt and click and

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.209 
we hold down option or alt and click and
drag<00:02:24.840> here<00:02:25.079> we're<00:02:25.409> going<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.560> see<00:02:25.680> all<00:02:25.890> the

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.219 
drag here we're going to see all the

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:28.250 
drag here we're going to see all the
little<00:02:26.519> teeny<00:02:26.819> details<00:02:27.359> are<00:02:27.569> now<00:02:27.689> sharp<00:02:28.049> and

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
little teeny details are now sharp and

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.649 
little teeny details are now sharp and
if<00:02:28.890> we<00:02:29.040> drag<00:02:29.219> to<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.459> left<00:02:29.519> those<00:02:30.269> little

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
if we drag to the left those little

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.080 
if we drag to the left those little
details<00:02:30.810> aren't<00:02:31.319> sharp<00:02:31.739> okay<00:02:32.400> but<00:02:32.909> what<00:02:33.060> about

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
details aren't sharp okay but what about

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.509 
details aren't sharp okay but what about
masking<00:02:33.750> well<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.620> may<00:02:34.739> remember<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.250> what

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
masking well you may remember that what

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.250 
masking well you may remember that what
I<00:02:35.549> said<00:02:35.640> about<00:02:35.879> masking<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:36.629> that<00:02:36.840> as<00:02:36.989> you

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
I said about masking is that as you

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.339 
I said about masking is that as you
increase<00:02:37.290> this<00:02:38.129> it<00:02:38.400> focuses<00:02:39.090> in<00:02:39.299> on<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.810> edges

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
increase this it focuses in on the edges

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.440 
increase this it focuses in on the edges
more<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:40.829> more<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.280> if<00:02:41.939> you've<00:02:42.090> worked<00:02:42.299> with

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
more and more and if you've worked with

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.750 
more and more and if you've worked with
Photoshop<00:02:43.049> before<00:02:43.439> you<00:02:43.709> know<00:02:43.829> that<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.159> mask<00:02:44.489> in

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760

see that what's happening is it's going
to<00:02:56.189> limit<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.849> sharpening<00:02:57.359> to<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.569> particular

is concealing the sharpening effect from

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.509 
is concealing the sharpening effect from
the<00:03:03.299> sky<00:03:03.569> now<00:03:04.439> that's<00:03:04.620> really<00:03:04.919> helpful

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
the sky now that's really helpful

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.520 
the sky now that's really helpful
because<00:03:05.700> we<00:03:06.419> typically<00:03:06.900> don't<00:03:07.200> want<00:03:07.349> to

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
because we typically don't want to

because we typically don't want to
sharpen<00:03:07.799> skies<00:03:08.220> skies<00:03:09.120> are<00:03:09.299> one<00:03:09.450> of<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.599> most

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
sharpen skies skies are one of the most

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.710 
sharpen skies skies are one of the most
problematic<00:03:10.139> areas<00:03:10.950> in<00:03:11.159> digital<00:03:11.489> photography

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
problematic areas in digital photography

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.360 
problematic areas in digital photography
just<00:03:12.720> because<00:03:13.049> of<00:03:13.169> the<00:03:13.260> color<00:03:13.500> variation<00:03:14.189> the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
just because of the color variation the

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.460 
just because of the color variation the
gradation<00:03:15.120> so<00:03:15.659> therefore<00:03:15.989> we<00:03:16.109> don't<00:03:16.200> want<00:03:16.409> to

gradation so therefore we don't want to

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.500 
gradation so therefore we don't want to
exaggerate<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:17.220> for<00:03:17.790> that<00:03:17.909> matter<00:03:18.090> soft

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
exaggerate that for that matter soft

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.170 
exaggerate that for that matter soft
skies<00:03:18.870> or<00:03:19.200> soft<00:03:19.530> clouds<00:03:19.889> typically<00:03:20.639> look<00:03:20.940> best

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
skies or soft clouds typically look best

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.689 
skies or soft clouds typically look best
so<00:03:22.109> in<00:03:22.229> this<00:03:22.379> case<00:03:22.650> I'm<00:03:22.859> now<00:03:23.040> limiting<00:03:23.609> the

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:23.699 
so in this case I'm now limiting the

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.300 
so in this case I'm now limiting the
sharpening<00:03:24.180> just<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.139> areas<00:03:25.680> where<00:03:25.919> it's

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
sharpening just to the areas where it's

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.339 
sharpening just to the areas where it's
white<00:03:26.579> now<00:03:27.359> if<00:03:27.449> there's<00:03:27.629> an<00:03:27.750> area<00:03:28.049> where<00:03:28.229> it's

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
white now if there's an area where it's

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.020 
white now if there's an area where it's
gray<00:03:28.680> like<00:03:28.979> on<00:03:29.159> some<00:03:29.430> portions<00:03:29.849> of<00:03:29.940> the

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
gray like on some portions of the

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.849 
gray like on some portions of the
motorcycle<00:03:30.780> then<00:03:31.319> it's<00:03:31.500> going<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.709> be<00:03:31.829> a

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
motorcycle then it's going to be a

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.800 
motorcycle then it's going to be a
little<00:03:32.250> bit<00:03:32.459> less<00:03:32.849> sharpening<00:03:33.359> amount<00:03:33.659> in

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
little bit less sharpening amount in

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.259 
little bit less sharpening amount in
those<00:03:33.989> areas<00:03:34.470> so<00:03:35.190> again<00:03:35.459> we<00:03:35.609> have<00:03:35.760> this<00:03:35.879> really

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
those areas so again we have this really

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.270 
those areas so again we have this really
nice<00:03:36.569> mask<00:03:37.049> which<00:03:37.560> is<00:03:37.739> limiting<00:03:38.250> the

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
nice mask which is limiting the

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.879 
nice mask which is limiting the
sharpening<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:39.000> particular<00:03:39.540> areas<00:03:40.019> now<00:03:40.709> my

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
sharpening to particular areas now my

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.800 
sharpening to particular areas now my
sharpening<00:03:41.370> amount<00:03:41.699> is<00:03:41.849> way<00:03:42.299> over

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
sharpening amount is way over

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.890 
sharpening amount is way over
exaggerated<00:03:43.590> but<00:03:44.190> by<00:03:44.370> increasing<00:03:45.150> my<00:03:45.299> masking

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
exaggerated but by increasing my masking

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.930 
exaggerated but by increasing my masking
amount<00:03:46.229> it's<00:03:46.709> now<00:03:46.919> limiting<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:47.519> sharpening

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
amount it's now limiting that sharpening

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.180 
amount it's now limiting that sharpening
just<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.359> the<00:03:48.479> cyclists<00:03:49.049> here<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.769> it's<00:03:49.949> not

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
just to the cyclists here and it's not

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.640 
just to the cyclists here and it's not
that<00:03:50.459> bad<00:03:50.790> well<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:51.780> course<00:03:51.810> we<00:03:52.199> need<00:03:52.319> to<00:03:52.409> bring

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
that bad well of course we need to bring

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.979 
that bad well of course we need to bring
our<00:03:52.799> amount<00:03:53.129> back<00:03:53.430> down<00:03:53.699> but<00:03:54.120> this<00:03:54.569> just<00:03:54.810> kind

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
our amount back down but this just kind

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.809 
our amount back down but this just kind
of<00:03:55.049> illustrates<00:03:55.590> really<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:56.069> power<00:03:56.340> of<00:03:56.549> this

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
of illustrates really the power of this

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.849 
of illustrates really the power of this
last<00:03:57.090> slider<00:03:57.449> it's<00:03:57.690> incredibly<00:03:58.319> strong

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
last slider it's incredibly strong

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.619 
last slider it's incredibly strong
all<00:03:59.489> right<00:03:59.669> well<00:03:59.819> go<00:04:00.000> ahead<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.180> bring<00:04:00.449> my

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
all right well go ahead and bring my

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.140 
all right well go ahead and bring my
amount<00:04:00.959> down<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.319> touch<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:01.979> then<00:04:02.549> my<00:04:02.699> detail

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
amount down a touch and then my detail

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.330 
amount down a touch and then my detail
I'm<00:04:03.299> also<00:04:03.540> going<00:04:03.810> to<00:04:03.870> bring<00:04:04.079> down<00:04:04.109> as<00:04:04.620> well<00:04:05.159> I

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
I'm also going to bring down as well I

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.490 
I'm also going to bring down as well I
don't<00:04:05.519> want<00:04:05.639> to<00:04:05.699> go<00:04:05.849> too<00:04:05.909> far<00:04:06.449> with<00:04:07.079> that<00:04:07.109> one

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
don't want to go too far with that one

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.460 
don't want to go too far with that one
now<00:04:08.280> let's<00:04:08.549> press<00:04:08.729> the<00:04:08.939> P<00:04:09.150> key<00:04:09.180> when<00:04:09.930> we<00:04:10.049> do<00:04:10.260> so

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
now let's press the P key when we do so

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.679 
now let's press the P key when we do so
we<00:04:10.500> can<00:04:10.799> see<00:04:10.979> the<00:04:11.099> before<00:04:11.519> and<00:04:11.819> then<00:04:12.419> now<00:04:12.629> the

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:12.689 
we can see the before and then now the

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:15.530 
we can see the before and then now the
after<00:04:13.379> really<00:04:13.739> adding<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.340> lot<00:04:14.669> of<00:04:14.849> snap<00:04:15.209> back

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
after really adding a lot of snap back

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.110 
after really adding a lot of snap back
to<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:15.930> cyclist<00:04:16.530> there<00:04:16.769> now<00:04:17.549> if<00:04:17.669> ever<00:04:17.849> we've

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
to that cyclist there now if ever we've

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.819 
to that cyclist there now if ever we've
gone<00:04:18.299> too<00:04:18.599> far<00:04:18.900> or<00:04:19.199> if<00:04:19.289> we<00:04:19.380> feel<00:04:19.590> like<00:04:19.620> our

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
gone too far or if we feel like our

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.409 
gone too far or if we feel like our
radius<00:04:20.220> is<00:04:20.400> too<00:04:20.549> high<00:04:20.699> well<00:04:20.940> we<00:04:21.030> can<00:04:21.209> lower

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
radius is too high well we can lower

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.850 
radius is too high well we can lower
that<00:04:21.659> of<00:04:21.870> course<00:04:22.049> and<00:04:22.289> we<00:04:22.380> can<00:04:22.560> lower<00:04:22.770> our

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
that of course and we can lower our

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.190 
that of course and we can lower our
mount<00:04:23.250> until<00:04:23.580> we<00:04:23.969> find<00:04:24.210> just<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.630> right<00:04:24.659> sweet

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
mount until we find just the right sweet

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.200 
mount until we find just the right sweet
spot<00:04:25.500> just<00:04:26.070> the<00:04:26.190> right<00:04:26.430> mixture<00:04:26.969> or

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
spot just the right mixture or

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.660 
spot just the right mixture or
combination<00:04:28.080> of<00:04:28.260> these

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
combination of these

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.730 
combination of these
different<00:04:28.880> controls<00:04:29.300> and<00:04:30.140> I<00:04:30.260> think<00:04:30.500> right

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
different controls and I think right

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.850 
different controls and I think right
here<00:04:31.100> looks<00:04:31.450> incredibly<00:04:32.450> good<00:04:32.690> and<00:04:33.380> why<00:04:33.590> I<00:04:33.620> can

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
here looks incredibly good and why I can

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.320 
here looks incredibly good and why I can
say<00:04:34.100> that<00:04:34.310> is<00:04:34.430> because<00:04:34.640> I'm<00:04:34.760> really<00:04:34.790> looking

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
say that is because I'm really looking

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.660 
say that is because I'm really looking
at<00:04:35.450> my<00:04:35.600> edges<00:04:36.080> I<00:04:36.230> don't<00:04:36.470> want<00:04:36.680> any<00:04:36.860> glowing

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
at my edges I don't want any glowing

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.300 
at my edges I don't want any glowing
edges<00:04:37.910> I<00:04:38.390> want<00:04:39.020> to<00:04:39.080> have<00:04:39.200> nice<00:04:39.410> detail<00:04:40.010> across

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
edges I want to have nice detail across

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.610 
edges I want to have nice detail across
the<00:04:40.670> image<00:04:40.850> I<00:04:41.210> want<00:04:41.750> to<00:04:41.780> have<00:04:41.900> the<00:04:42.020> sky<00:04:42.320> nice

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
the image I want to have the sky nice

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.040 
the image I want to have the sky nice
and<00:04:42.830> smooth<00:04:43.220> in<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:43.520> background<00:04:44.120> so<00:04:44.810> in<00:04:44.930> this

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
and smooth in the background so in this

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.510 
and smooth in the background so in this
case<00:04:45.260> I<00:04:45.410> might<00:04:45.590> even<00:04:45.770> go<00:04:46.010> ahead<00:04:46.130> and<00:04:46.250> just

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
case I might even go ahead and just

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.460 
case I might even go ahead and just
lower<00:04:46.820> a<00:04:46.940> little<00:04:47.180> bit<00:04:47.360> of<00:04:47.510> that<00:04:47.630> detail<00:04:48.020> there

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
lower a little bit of that detail there

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.830 
lower a little bit of that detail there
in<00:04:48.680> this<00:04:49.130> case<00:04:49.370> to<00:04:49.610> bring<00:04:49.790> just<00:04:50.360> a<00:04:50.450> little<00:04:50.720> bit

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
in this case to bring just a little bit

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.480 
in this case to bring just a little bit
more<00:04:51.020> noise<00:04:51.290> reduction<00:04:51.560> in<00:04:51.860> the<00:04:51.920> background

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
more noise reduction in the background

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.340 
more noise reduction in the background
and<00:04:53.210> a<00:04:53.330> lot<00:04:53.510> of<00:04:53.540> times<00:04:53.750> you'll<00:04:53.930> bounce<00:04:54.170> back

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
and a lot of times you'll bounce back

megapixel cameras 100 percent is even

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.760 
megapixel cameras 100 percent is even
too<00:06:37.880> much<00:06:37.960> so<00:06:38.960> again<00:06:39.290> you're<00:06:39.440> going<00:06:39.530> to<00:06:39.620> have

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
too much so again you're going to have

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.990 
too much so again you're going to have
to<00:06:39.950> do<00:06:40.100> a<00:06:40.130> little<00:06:40.430> bit<00:06:40.580> of<00:06:40.610> a<00:06:40.760> give-and-take

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
to do a little bit of a give-and-take

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.450 
to do a little bit of a give-and-take
zooming<00:06:42.360> in<00:06:42.540> and<00:06:42.810> out<00:06:42.930> right<00:06:43.410> around<00:06:43.650> 100<00:06:44.310> and

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
zooming in and out right around 100 and

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.970 
zooming in and out right around 100 and
typically<00:06:45.330> what<00:06:45.480> I<00:06:45.510> do<00:06:45.660> is<00:06:46.020> I<00:06:46.590> look<00:06:46.800> at<00:06:46.920> the

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:46.980 
typically what I do is I look at the

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.550 
typically what I do is I look at the
image<00:06:47.190> at<00:06:47.490> 50<00:06:47.820> percent<00:06:48.000> at<00:06:48.450> 100<00:06:49.080> percent<00:06:49.200> at

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 
image at 50 percent at 100 percent at

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.430 
image at 50 percent at 100 percent at
150<00:06:50.430> and<00:06:50.910> I<00:06:50.970> go<00:06:51.180> back<00:06:51.420> and<00:06:51.690> forth<00:06:51.960> between<00:06:52.110> the

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
150 and I go back and forth between the

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.590 
150 and I go back and forth between the
zoom<00:06:52.800> rates<00:06:53.040> just<00:06:53.700> to<00:06:53.850> take<00:06:54.030> a<00:06:54.060> look<00:06:54.330> at<00:06:54.450> how

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600 
zoom rates just to take a look at how

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.360 
zoom rates just to take a look at how
the<00:06:54.660> detail<00:06:55.140> looks<00:06:55.410> in<00:06:55.830> those<00:06:55.950> different

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.370 
the detail looks in those different

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.850 
the detail looks in those different
rates<00:06:56.550> and<00:06:56.820> I<00:06:57.360> also<00:06:57.600> think<00:06:58.050> about<00:06:58.170> the<00:06:58.440> final

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
rates and I also think about the final

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.220 
rates and I also think about the final
intent<00:06:59.370> of<00:06:59.580> the<00:06:59.670> photograph<00:07:00.120> because<00:07:00.990> what

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.230 
intent of the photograph because what

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.470 
intent of the photograph because what
we're<00:07:01.380> doing<00:07:01.710> here<00:07:01.980> is<00:07:02.160> input<00:07:02.700> sharpening<00:07:03.270> and

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:03.480 
we're doing here is input sharpening and

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.240 
we're doing here is input sharpening and
noise<00:07:03.510> reduction<00:07:04.200> yet<00:07:04.800> I<00:07:04.860> need<00:07:04.950> to<00:07:05.100> think

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.250 
noise reduction yet I need to think

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.130 
noise reduction yet I need to think
about<00:07:05.550> okay<00:07:05.790> how<00:07:06.270> am<00:07:06.300> I<00:07:06.450> going<00:07:06.600> to<00:07:06.690> print<00:07:06.990> this

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:07.140 
about okay how am I going to print this

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.720 
about okay how am I going to print this
image<00:07:07.350> where<00:07:07.740> is<00:07:07.830> it<00:07:07.920> going<00:07:08.040> to<00:07:08.100> be<00:07:08.250> displayed

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:08.730 
image where is it going to be displayed

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.940 
image where is it going to be displayed
what<00:07:09.360> type<00:07:09.510> of<00:07:09.690> paper<00:07:09.960> will<00:07:10.320> it<00:07:10.410> be<00:07:10.500> printed<00:07:10.830> on

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:10.950 
what type of paper will it be printed on

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.920 
what type of paper will it be printed on
what<00:07:11.400> type<00:07:11.580> of<00:07:11.730> magazine<00:07:11.970> will<00:07:12.360> be<00:07:12.390> printed<00:07:12.840> in

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:12.930 
what type of magazine will be printed in

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.450 
what type of magazine will be printed in
and<00:07:13.380> I<00:07:13.440> think<00:07:13.650> of<00:07:13.770> all<00:07:13.920> those<00:07:14.130> different

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:14.460 
and I think of all those different

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.670 
and I think of all those different
factors<00:07:14.940> and<00:07:15.210> then<00:07:15.540> that<00:07:15.690> helps<00:07:15.990> me<00:07:16.140> dial<00:07:16.440> in

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 
factors and then that helps me dial in

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.260 
factors and then that helps me dial in
the<00:07:17.040> most<00:07:17.250> appropriate<00:07:17.430> amount<00:07:18.090> of

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.270 
the most appropriate amount of

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.680 
the most appropriate amount of
sharpening<00:07:18.570> and<00:07:18.960> noise<00:07:18.990> reduction
