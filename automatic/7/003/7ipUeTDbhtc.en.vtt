00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.210
Ex-salesman of barbecue skewers
becomes the "owner" of the Rio beaches

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.000
The commerce at the beaches
of Rio de Janeiro has an owner.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
A single company manages 309 sales stands
and 27 lifesaving stations

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.500
in the main pedestrian zones
by the beaches of the city.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.000
It's a concession that began in 1999,
but government of the Rio de Janeiro department

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
questions the new additives to the contract,
which would allow another half a decade of exploration,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and the installation of ATMs,
that weren't in the original contract.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This controversy is about a business
that profits 24 millions of Reais each year.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.100
The owner of the beach

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The idea that the salesman of the stand
is a guy that comes to beach

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and romantically earns a living
selling his products ended in Rio.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
When you are ruled by a process that isn't democratic,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.160
but authoritarian, 
the company is calling all the shots,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.000
you either follow the rules or no deal, 
it's very tough.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We manage 309 sales stands, placed from Leme to Prainha,
and 27 lifesaving stations, from Flamengo to Pontal.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
That gives the company a invoice of 24 millions Reais,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
according to the report of João Barreto 
to the Federal Justice.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The concession itself is not a bad thing,
but the company not sticking to its obligations is,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.900
in fact, the big problem.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
João Barreto is a business man
that started selling barbecue skewers downtown,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
hot-dogs at the Barra da Tijuca,
and saw his business expand.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
My father, João Barreto, 
created the Rio Shore Associated

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
to represent the sellers of the stands

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and the industries before the city government.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000
In 1998 the Conde government released a public
notice, and we were selected in all 4 sectors.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.119
Today, they also have the concession 
of 27 lifesaving stations,

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.859
they explore the publicity in all the beaches of Rio,

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:11.690
and can also install ATMs.
There will be 40 of them until 2030,

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.300
when the company's concession ends.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
The original contract is from 1999.
What we impugn is this new extension,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
which doesn't predict a deadline to the conclusion

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
of all the new stands 
at the beaches from Leme to Prainha.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It expands for another 5 years the concession,
with no counterpart predicted,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and it also expands the concession 
in an inappropriate way.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Meaning that it allows the company
to explore banking services,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.690
that have no relation to the stands business.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The concession was created as a measure to organize

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
the commerce at the beaches, 
a way to make it more rational.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Today, it is much easier 
to the government to only collect

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
then having a business more open, 
managing people,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.500
which is a very hard thing to do, 
everyone thinks different,

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.000
people come from different social classes...

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So, the idea itself is good,
but it needs to bring benefits to the society,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
to the city of Rio de Janeiro,
not only financial benefits to the company.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
It is harmful to the sales person because
when he goes to bed,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
he doesn't know if he will have a job the next day.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
If you have only one company,
the diversity of ideas disappears,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and those who don't incorporate that idea are out.
