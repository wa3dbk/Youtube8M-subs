00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
I start here I show this slide now how

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.310 
I start here I show this slide now how
did<00:00:32.150> it<00:00:32.450> get<00:00:32.630> from<00:00:33.170> this<00:00:33.620> side<00:00:34.010> to<00:00:34.489> this<00:00:34.520> slide

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
did it get from this side to this slide

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.970 
did it get from this side to this slide
or<00:00:36.320> we<00:00:36.739> have<00:00:37.090> various

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.319 

a<00:00:41.040> lot<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.880> options

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.049

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
chose one one look and then applied it

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.680 
chose one one look and then applied it
to<00:01:03.829> all<00:01:04.100> slides<00:01:05.950> so<00:01:06.950> i'm<00:01:07.280> going<00:01:07.490> to<00:01:07.580> choose<00:01:07.909> box

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.660 

make<00:01:34.160> it<00:01:34.370> go<00:01:34.640> for<00:01:34.970> all<00:01:35.090> slides<00:01:36.220> but<00:01:37.220> I'm<00:01:37.400> not

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
make it go for all slides but I'm not

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.330 
make it go for all slides but I'm not
sure<00:01:37.700> that<00:01:38.000> it<00:01:38.330> will

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340

yes<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:46.290> seems<00:01:46.620> to<00:01:46.950> have<00:01:47.040> chosen<00:01:47.400> all<00:01:47.670> slides

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
yes it seems to have chosen all slides

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.450 
yes it seems to have chosen all slides
their<00:01:50.360> boxing<00:01:51.360> all<00:01:51.600> slides<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.770> seem<00:01:53.190> to<00:01:53.370> be

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
their boxing all slides that seem to be

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.380 
their boxing all slides that seem to be
too<00:01:53.670> fast<00:01:54.000> let's<00:01:54.600> make<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:55.020> slow<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:56.390> then

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
too fast let's make that slow and then

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.320 
too fast let's make that slow and then
save<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.430> and<00:01:59.430> if<00:02:00.270> i<00:02:00.420> go<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.700> down<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.970> here

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
save that and if i go to down to here

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.559 
save that and if i go to down to here
and<00:02:03.510> play<00:02:03.900> it

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.030 

that's<00:02:09.170> playing<00:02:10.870> from<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:12.079> end<00:02:12.230> so<00:02:12.620> let's<00:02:12.829> see

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
that's playing from the end so let's see

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.440 
that's playing from the end so let's see
if<00:02:13.099> I<00:02:13.219> can<00:02:13.249> get<00:02:13.579> it<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:13.909> play<00:02:14.060> from<00:02:14.420> the

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
if I can get it to play from the

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.480 
if I can get it to play from the
beginning<00:02:14.689> here<00:02:15.290> we<00:02:15.409> go

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
beginning here we go

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.010 
beginning here we go
so<00:02:18.210> you<00:02:18.270> see<00:02:18.720> here<00:02:18.990> we<00:02:19.170> have<00:02:19.320> custom<00:02:19.800> animation

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
so you see here we have custom animation

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
so you see here we have custom animation
then

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.270 

we<00:02:24.610> have<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.969> next<00:02:25.329> slide<00:02:25.390> coming<00:02:26.200> on

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.050 

the<00:02:31.819> next<00:02:32.270> slide<00:02:32.569> coming<00:02:33.020> on<00:02:33.319> and<00:02:34.060> the

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
the next slide coming on and the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.130 
the next slide coming on and the
transition<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.560> leg<00:02:36.709> next<00:02:37.220> one<00:02:37.959> now<00:02:38.959> what

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
transition to the leg next one now what

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.020 
transition to the leg next one now what
we<00:02:39.319> see<00:02:39.709> then<00:02:40.040> is<00:02:41.440> that<00:02:42.440> our<00:02:42.740> slide<00:02:43.160> transition

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
we see then is that our slide transition

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.220 
we see then is that our slide transition
works<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:46.430> might<00:02:46.790> have<00:02:46.940> been<00:02:47.120> better<00:02:47.390> if<00:02:47.780> we'd

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
works it might have been better if we'd

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.570 
works it might have been better if we'd
had<00:02:48.440> it<00:02:48.640> cut<00:02:49.640> through<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:50.239> through<00:02:50.780> black

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
had it cut through the through black

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.980 
had it cut through the through black
then<00:02:52.580> if<00:02:52.760> I'd<00:02:52.970> apply<00:02:53.870> that<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.500> all<00:02:54.620> slides

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.780 

gone<00:02:58.590> down<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.310> cut<00:03:00.150> through<00:03:00.660> black<00:03:01.310> can<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.490> see

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
gone down to cut through black can I see

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.710 
gone down to cut through black can I see
it<00:03:02.910> then<00:03:03.210> and<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.600> don't<00:03:03.810> seem<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.200> see<00:03:04.260> that

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
it then and I don't seem to see that

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:12.200 
it then and I don't seem to see that
there<00:03:06.720> it<00:03:06.900> is<00:03:07.910> now<00:03:08.910> let's<00:03:10.220> save<00:03:11.220> that<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.880> see

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
there it is now let's save that and see

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.110 
there it is now let's save that and see
how<00:03:12.240> we<00:03:12.450> get<00:03:12.720> on<00:03:12.780> this<00:03:13.170> time<00:03:13.820> there's<00:03:14.820> our
