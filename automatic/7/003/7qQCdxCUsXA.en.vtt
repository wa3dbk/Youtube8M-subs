now the loops on these swings will also

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.200 
now the loops on these swings will also
adjust<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.930> positioning<00:00:49.470> of<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.620> patient

lower the patient safely on the pad once

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:17.780 
lower the patient safely on the pad once
our<00:02:16.560> patient<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:16.980> down<00:02:17.129> on<00:02:17.159> the<00:02:17.310> BET<00:02:17.549> we're

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
our patient is down on the BET we're

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.949

going to remove the sling from the

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.770 
going to remove the sling from the
patient<00:02:19.849> so<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:20.939> patient<00:02:20.969> won't<00:02:21.359> have<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.599> sit

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
so once our sling bar is down low enough

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.229 
so once our sling bar is down low enough
that<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.010> loops<00:02:29.220> are<00:02:29.400> loose<00:02:31.970> we'll<00:02:32.970> remove

the sling under the patient bring the
patient<00:02:54.720> back<00:02:54.750> over<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:56.250> now<00:02:56.819> we've<00:02:57.000> removed

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
patient back over and now we've removed

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.080 
patient back over and now we've removed
the<00:02:57.389> sling<00:02:57.689> to<00:02:58.430> transfer<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.459> patient<00:02:59.849> from<00:02:59.909> the

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
the sling to transfer a patient from the

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.690 
the sling to transfer a patient from the
bed<00:03:00.269> to<00:03:00.659> the<00:03:00.689> chair<00:03:01.049> we<00:03:02.040> simply<00:03:02.370> pull<00:03:02.579> the

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
bed to the chair we simply pull the

device up to the patient lower the
spreader<00:03:05.459> bar<00:03:05.639> down<00:03:05.849> so<00:03:06.090> it's<00:03:06.239> easy<00:03:06.389> for<00:03:06.629> us<00:03:06.689> to

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
spreader bar down so it's easy for us to

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.429 
spreader bar down so it's easy for us to
connect<00:03:07.139> the<00:03:07.230> hoops<00:03:07.439> to<00:03:08.189> the<00:03:08.280> hooks<00:03:09.290> we<00:03:10.290> use

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
connect the hoops to the hooks we use

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.099 
connect the hoops to the hooks we use
the<00:03:10.590> shorter<00:03:10.980> loops<00:03:11.250> in<00:03:11.669> the<00:03:12.480> shoulder<00:03:12.900> and

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
the shorter loops in the shoulder and

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.960 
the shorter loops in the shoulder and
middle<00:03:13.709> area<00:03:16.010> and<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.129> longer<00:03:17.459> loops<00:03:17.699> in<00:03:17.909> the

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
middle area and the longer loops in the

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.300 
middle area and the longer loops in the
legs<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:19.290> way<00:03:19.500> when<00:03:19.709> we<00:03:19.799> transfer<00:03:20.190> the

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
legs that way when we transfer the

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.599 
legs that way when we transfer the
patient<00:03:20.459> they're<00:03:21.419> in<00:03:21.540> an<00:03:21.629> upright<00:03:21.930> position

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
patient they're in an upright position

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.710 
patient they're in an upright position
we'll<00:03:23.609> make<00:03:23.729> it<00:03:23.760> easier<00:03:24.120> for<00:03:24.150> us<00:03:24.359> to<00:03:24.479> put<00:03:24.629> the

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
we'll make it easier for us to put the

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.290 
we'll make it easier for us to put the
patient<00:03:25.049> in<00:03:25.109> the<00:03:25.199> chair

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.850 

so<00:03:30.900> now<00:03:31.050> that<00:03:31.140> all<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.320> our<00:03:31.470> loops<00:03:31.710> are

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
so now that all of our loops are

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.840 
so now that all of our loops are
connected<00:03:33.740> and<00:03:34.740> raised<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.130> patient<00:03:35.520> up<00:03:35.610> by

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
connected and raised the patient up by

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
can see the patient is gently raising

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.940 
can see the patient is gently raising
into<00:03:42.360> a<00:03:42.390> sitting<00:03:42.660> position<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:43.710> make<00:03:43.830> it

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
into a sitting position to make it

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.230
