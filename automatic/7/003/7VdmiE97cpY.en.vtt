started um I highly suggest the using

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.720 
started um I highly suggest the using
index<00:04:10.180> cards<00:04:10.600> idea<00:04:10.990> I<00:04:11.260> lost<00:04:12.070> mine<00:04:12.310> so<00:04:12.550> I<00:04:12.580> have

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
index cards idea I lost mine so I have

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.530 
index cards idea I lost mine so I have
to<00:04:12.850> make<00:04:13.210> no<00:04:13.420> one's<00:04:13.770> but<00:04:14.770> um<00:04:15.120> because<00:04:16.120> you<00:04:16.360> can

to make no one's but um because you can

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.250 
to make no one's but um because you can
get<00:04:16.720> a<00:04:16.780> more<00:04:17.140> random<00:04:17.820> outcome<00:04:18.820> of<00:04:19.110> what<00:04:20.110> you're

going<00:04:20.410> to<00:04:20.470> put<00:04:20.680> together<00:04:21.000> it's<00:04:22.000> great<00:04:22.450> to<00:04:22.630> work

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
going to put together it's great to work

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.440 
going to put together it's great to work
on<00:04:23.050> your<00:04:23.730> sight<00:04:24.730> reading<00:04:25.030> in<00:04:25.750> a<00:04:26.350> way<00:04:27.270> test<00:04:28.270> your

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:09.429 

00:05:09.429 --> 00:05:17.799 

seven<00:05:10.429> backwards<00:05:10.969> paradiddle<00:05:14.829> and<00:05:16.689> you<00:05:17.689> know

00:05:17.799 --> 00:05:17.809 
seven backwards paradiddle and you know

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:22.079 
seven backwards paradiddle and you know
along<00:05:18.259> those<00:05:18.469> lines<00:05:18.799> um<00:05:20.049> another<00:05:21.049> thing

00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:22.089 
along those lines um another thing

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:27.209 
along those lines um another thing
practicing<00:05:23.559> between<00:05:25.269> right<00:05:26.269> would<00:05:26.539> be<00:05:26.689> your

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:27.219 
practicing between right would be your

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:31.029 
practicing between right would be your
foot<00:05:28.239> left<00:05:29.239> would<00:05:29.629> be<00:05:29.659> your<00:05:30.110> right<00:05:30.319> hand<00:05:30.679> on

00:05:37.329 --> 00:05:37.339 
would practice it that way like okay

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:57.020 
would practice it that way like okay
well<00:05:37.669> do<00:05:37.939> number<00:05:41.919> 16<00:05:43.389> which<00:05:44.389> is

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.489 

and<00:05:58.030> then<00:05:58.150> practice<00:05:58.620> your<00:05:59.620> left<00:05:59.889> side<00:06:00.219> only

00:06:01.489 --> 00:06:01.499 
and then practice your left side only

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:08.820 
and then practice your left side only
just<00:06:02.499> pads<00:06:03.120> are<00:06:04.289> at<00:06:05.289> with<00:06:05.499> your<00:06:05.620> feet<00:06:07.710> if<00:06:08.710> you

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
just pads are at with your feet if you

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:15.239 
just pads are at with your feet if you
have<00:06:08.949> a<00:06:08.979> double<00:06:09.159> pedal<00:06:09.749> or<00:06:10.749> both<00:06:12.840> um<00:06:14.129> you<00:06:15.129> could

00:06:15.239 --> 00:06:15.249 
have a double pedal or both um you could

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:19.200 
have a double pedal or both um you could
also<00:06:15.430> do<00:06:16.029> left<00:06:16.689> foot<00:06:16.990> right<00:06:17.169> hand<00:06:17.939> left<00:06:18.939> hand

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
also do left foot right hand left hand

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.769 
also do left foot right hand left hand
right<00:06:19.509> foot<00:06:20.520> both<00:06:21.520> hands<00:06:21.879> and<00:06:22.419> both<00:06:22.719> feet

00:06:22.769 --> 00:06:22.779 
right foot both hands and both feet

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:27.230 
right foot both hands and both feet
together<00:06:23.289> so<00:06:24.219> all<00:06:24.460> the<00:06:24.610> rights<00:06:24.879> would<00:06:25.150> be<00:06:25.560> less

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
together so all the rights would be less

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:39.190 
together so all the rights would be less
left<00:06:28.240> lamps<00:06:28.599> and<00:06:29.759> pans

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.200 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.080 

so<00:06:40.280> that's<00:06:41.280> just<00:06:41.400> a<00:06:41.700> few<00:06:42.090> ideas<00:06:42.470> how<00:06:43.470> to<00:06:43.500> use

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
so that's just a few ideas how to use

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:49.610 
so that's just a few ideas how to use
