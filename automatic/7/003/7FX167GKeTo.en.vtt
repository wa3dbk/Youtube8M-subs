00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:10.650
 so the second day of torment 14 but 7 2013 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:16.440
 protagonists he me yes for 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:18.300
 yesterday we did what we took apart 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.420
 completely the whole approach 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.099
 gear boxes on top removed air 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:29.550
 filter completely with all covers 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:32.579
 disconnected a bunch of sensors but so far so far 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.399
 it is not clear then they had to 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.670
 disconnect or not first of all 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.320
 these two sensors this sensor and 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.510
 anyway you need to disconnect disconnect 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:54.379
 jet thrust removed 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:54.379
 clutch cable fork removed starter 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.460
 so this is what he did on top yet 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.760
 write that you need to shoot the throttle 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.520
 do not know the valve yet, but I think 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:12.700
 that in the process of removing the gearbox we 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:16.390
 this we learn next was the case 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:22.760
 long tormented could not understand how 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:26.690
 pull the drive out of the gear box here 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:30.800
 hole which includes a glass with a drive 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:35.690
 year he drive himself climbed on the other 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:42.100
 side packs to pull out 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:46.300
 we had to unscrew the alarm 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:50.890
 transverse thrust 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:55.190
 we do not touch the steering rod and 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.280
 as correctly indicated in one report 1 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:02.300
 good man 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:07.030
 unscrew the bolt on the steering knuckle 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:12.340
 with the help of a hard-nosed fist jack 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:15.670
 Hammer and montazhki we knocked the lower thrust 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:21.020
 that was the most 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:23.270
 so laborious you can say rub + how 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.990
 would have removed the muffler with the muffler special 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.990
 no problems 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:41.849
 so here they look like a drive 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:49.290
 shot here muffler connected flanges 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:52.040
 from two sides that is basically below 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.319
 however much de forehead is left 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.739
 but at the end of the day I will spend another 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.579
 video report about what we did for 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.579
 present day
