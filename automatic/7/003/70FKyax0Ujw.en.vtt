00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.729
 obama during his defense convention 

00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:10.799
 not to mention a few days 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.369
 the mayor initiative 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.519
 upon arrival at the White House 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.310
 listen to hacking disturbs me 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.890
 we have televisions that has undergone the obstacle course 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.820
 to be allowed to see his renewed authorization that fits 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.039
 in a legal framework 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.039
 and as long as I have always supported the process 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.300
 in regards to 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.750
 to the possibility of releasing one day nothing to say it is a step 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.390
 desirable is commendable but it is part of a process of piracy 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.910
 seems to me highly detrimental 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.540
 simply because once again julien carraud the exercise that has to 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.300
 to be the same for all we do the same job under the same conditions 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.260
 so what is needed asking everything to impose on others what we have 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.420
 today vis-Ã -vis the csa of obligations we can not broadcast 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.120
 what we want when we want it and from that moment on it is 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.380
 abnormal that others may allow to do so 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.620
 when one is well entered manceau who will be able 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.700
 in this long time 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.820
 but I believe that today it is a call to piracy is widespread 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.530
 and in the end I think will be detrimental to the quality of the programs that are 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.530
 available for martinique viewers 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.000
 this materiality 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.250
 I am against anyone 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.010
 kif-kif this is not my responsibility my responsibility 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.530
 again in relation to a request 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.420
 of a channel that wants to transmit radio even if we can 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.510
 consider that it is a competitor despite everything in the dwelling of plurality 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.600
 it is the company but as soon as it comes out of the frame it intervenes 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.600
 in a hacking environment I can not be satisfied with this 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.190
 he is not addressing a stereotype to issue a guardian 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.609
 so again we are at another level 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:51.009
 whether in the case of a call for 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.579
 number of cases that one is detained to the detriment of the other is 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.349
 the law of the kind now nothing prevents that there is a movement of substance 

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:01.099
 the population who actually support there the move of de 

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:04.469
 mister granier and at this tournament we inspire ourselves too and I 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.899
 had even said that I was ready to participate for myself at 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.899
 support of this approach but if it is to be pirate the deal has changed 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:13.859
 he supports us 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:17.699
 I read that serge letchimy torture support who he wants me I'm at 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:20.879
 hackers hit divide in this setting I do not support hackers
