hello<00:00:01.800> there<00:00:02.610> two<00:00:03.120> types<00:00:03.480> of<00:00:03.689> water<00:00:04.140> caller

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:05.029 
hello there two types of water caller

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.150 
hello there two types of water caller
sensor<00:00:06.109> the<00:00:07.109> sensor<00:00:07.220> also<00:00:08.220> talks<00:00:08.700> at<00:00:08.880> ECU<00:00:09.300> so

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 
sensor the sensor also talks at ECU so

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.410 
sensor the sensor also talks at ECU so
in<00:00:11.160> our<00:00:11.340> case<00:00:11.670> number<00:00:12.059> along<00:00:12.150> with<00:00:12.210> the

temperature the car but it kept stalling
you<00:00:17.100> have<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.340> make<00:00:17.520> sure<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:18.420> get<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.690> right

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
you have to make sure you get the right

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.700 
you have to make sure you get the right
type<00:00:19.199> of<00:00:20.390> some<00:00:21.390> reason<00:00:21.779> it's<00:00:22.289> called<00:00:22.590> an

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
type of some reason it's called an

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.279 
type of some reason it's called an
overstock<00:00:23.300> I've<00:00:24.300> got<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.539> have<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.720> green<00:00:24.930> one

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
overstock I've got to have a green one

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.650 
overstock I've got to have a green one
it<00:00:25.740> should<00:00:25.859> have<00:00:25.980> been<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.130> blue<00:00:26.369> one<00:00:29.660> well

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
it should have been a blue one well

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.770 
it should have been a blue one well
there<00:00:30.960> goes<00:00:32.270> there<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:35.239> so<00:00:36.239> make<00:00:36.420> sure<00:00:36.450> it's

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
there goes there it is so make sure it's

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.940 
there goes there it is so make sure it's
a<00:00:36.809> right<00:00:36.989> type<00:00:37.290> before<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.680> buy<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:42.800> and<00:00:43.800> if

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
a right type before you buy it and if

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.720 
a right type before you buy it and if
you<00:00:44.100> look<00:00:44.309> top<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> air<00:00:45.090> filter<00:00:45.510> off<00:00:46.579> as<00:00:47.579> you

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
you look top the air filter off as you

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.560 
you look top the air filter off as you
can<00:00:47.879> see

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
can see

00:00:49.570 --> 00:01:00.290 
can see
head<00:00:50.570> out<00:00:50.690> of<00:00:50.780> the<00:00:50.870> way

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.830 

the<00:01:00.870> water<00:01:01.080> sensor<00:01:02.690> temperature<00:01:03.690> water

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the water sensor temperature water

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.120 
the water sensor temperature water
sensor<00:01:05.030> which<00:01:06.030> does<00:01:06.300> have<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:07.260> code<00:01:07.620> when<00:01:08.010> it

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
sensor which does have the code when it

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:20.660 
sensor which does have the code when it
plays<00:01:08.340> up<00:01:14.570> there's<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.690> baby

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.780 

as<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.390> can<00:01:21.510> see<00:01:21.750> it's<00:01:21.930> not<00:01:22.050> square<00:01:22.380> one<00:01:22.790> it's

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
as you can see it's not square one it's

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.490 
as you can see it's not square one it's
like<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.940> rounded<00:01:24.450> one<00:01:24.510> there's<00:01:25.050> just<00:01:25.290> two

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
like a rounded one there's just two

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:35.200 
like a rounded one there's just two
types<00:01:27.590> covers<00:01:28.590> serious<00:01:29.100> amount<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.460> TDI's

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:44.929 

this<00:01:36.210> just<00:01:36.510> plugs<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:38.330> just<00:01:39.330> doing<00:01:39.570> it

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:02:00.410 

are<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.960> awkward

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:16.240 

so

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.190 

there's<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.030> little<00:02:17.240> clip<00:02:17.480> it<00:02:17.840> goes<00:02:17.990> on<00:02:18.110> the

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
there's a little clip it goes on the

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.020 
there's a little clip it goes on the
bottom<00:02:18.350> that<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:18.620> pull<00:02:18.950> off<00:02:19.070> you<00:02:19.760> pull

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
bottom that you pull off you pull

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.330 
bottom that you pull off you pull
downwards<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:20.780> that<00:02:21.590> releases<00:02:22.480> all<00:02:23.480> of<00:02:23.750> this

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
downwards and that releases all of this

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.490 
downwards and that releases all of this
okay<00:02:25.340> just<00:02:26.710> trying<00:02:27.710> to<00:02:27.800> find<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.310> there
