sqlite that stuff basically because in a
board<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.220> get<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.520> worry<00:02:08.789> about<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:10.190> the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
board and get on to worry about that the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.930 
board and get on to worry about that the
only<00:02:11.400> things<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.879> can<00:02:12.090> edit

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
only things that you can edit

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.280 
only things that you can edit
first<00:02:13.060> or<00:02:13.210> you<00:02:13.360> would<00:02:13.510> really<00:02:13.690> want<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:14.140> edit

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
first or you would really want to edit

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.430 
first or you would really want to edit
would<00:02:14.650> be<00:02:14.800> corridors<00:02:15.430> limit<00:02:15.910> v2<00:02:16.270> or<00:02:16.600> magnet<00:02:19.440> so

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
would be corridors limit v2 or magnet so

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.800 
would be corridors limit v2 or magnet so
here<00:02:20.980> are<00:02:21.070> some<00:02:21.100> stuff<00:02:21.430> in<00:02:21.550> here<00:02:21.760> now<00:02:22.270> if<00:02:22.630> you

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
here are some stuff in here now if you

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.020 
here are some stuff in here now if you
want<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.110> have<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.230> database<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:23.860> can<00:02:24.100> I<00:02:24.370> will

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
want to have a database you can I will

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.980 
want to have a database you can I will
make<00:02:25.210> a<00:02:25.240> tutorial<00:02:25.780> for<00:02:25.960> that<00:02:26.200> later<00:02:26.350> but

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
make a tutorial for that later but

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.450 
make a tutorial for that later but
database<00:02:28.990> is<00:02:29.140> really<00:02:29.440> easy<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.830> do<00:02:30.010> so<00:02:30.400> you

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
database is really easy to do so you

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.780 
database is really easy to do so you
just<00:02:30.700> go<00:02:30.880> ahead<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.120> insert<00:02:31.660> your<00:02:31.870> path<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.140> it

just go ahead and insert your path to it

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.100 
just go ahead and insert your path to it
you<00:02:33.790> know<00:02:33.910> your<00:02:34.060> host<00:02:34.240> name<00:02:34.510> your<00:02:34.720> data<00:02:34.870> best

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
you know your host name your data best

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.070 
you know your host name your data best
name<00:02:35.670> username<00:02:36.670> password<00:02:37.270> and<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.630> prefix<00:02:38.020> that

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
name username password and a prefix that

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.720 
name username password and a prefix that

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:48.270 
could do LD bc admin which I think this

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.980 
could do LD bc admin which I think this
command<00:07:48.690> is<00:07:48.720> really<00:07:48.990> cool

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:49.990

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:55.150 
inventories and stuff like that so

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.180
