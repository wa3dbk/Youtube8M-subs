00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:43.389 
from stains because there's such a big

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:46.080 
from stains because there's such a big
commitment<00:01:43.810> I<00:01:44.799> like<00:01:45.219> to<00:01:45.459> mix<00:01:45.789> my<00:01:46.060> own

little pink dots all over and you cannot
scrub<00:04:05.150> it<00:04:05.270> out<00:04:05.680> so<00:04:06.680> what<00:04:07.430> I<00:04:07.459> recommend<00:04:07.610> is

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
scrub it out so what I recommend is

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.059 
scrub it out so what I recommend is
grabbing<00:04:08.510> a<00:04:08.720> tissue<00:04:08.959> and<00:04:09.410> kind<00:04:09.590> of<00:04:09.709> putting<00:04:09.920> it

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
grabbing a tissue and kind of putting it

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.310 
grabbing a tissue and kind of putting it
around<00:04:10.160> it<00:04:10.520> and<00:04:10.670> just<00:04:11.420> opening<00:04:11.989> it<00:04:12.080> because

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
around it and just opening it because

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.159 
around it and just opening it because
it's<00:04:12.470> a<00:04:12.560> sponge<00:04:12.920> tip<00:04:13.250> type<00:04:13.519> applicator<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:15.260> UM

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
it's a sponge tip type applicator the UM

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.500 
it's a sponge tip type applicator the UM
so<00:04:18.169> it<00:04:18.260> doesn't<00:04:18.380> square<00:04:18.890> it<00:04:19.010> all<00:04:19.100> over<00:04:19.370> so<00:04:20.030> what

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
so it doesn't square it all over so what

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.659 
so it doesn't square it all over so what
you<00:04:20.600> want<00:04:20.750> to<00:04:20.840> do<00:04:20.989> is<00:04:21.410> kind<00:04:21.769> of<00:04:21.919> DAB<00:04:22.220> the
