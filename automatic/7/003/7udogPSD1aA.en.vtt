00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
we use these small LED

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.850 
we use these small LED
I<00:02:04.520> made<00:02:04.909> it<00:02:05.060> into<00:02:05.299> the<00:02:05.390> cell<00:02:05.720> that<00:02:06.500> are<00:02:06.650> less

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
I made it into the cell that are less

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.190 
I made it into the cell that are less
than<00:02:06.890> 1/16<00:02:07.700> of<00:02:07.940> an<00:02:08.060> inch<00:02:08.179> high<00:02:08.450> so<00:02:08.869> they<00:02:08.990> don't

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
than 1/16 of an inch high so they don't

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.010 
than 1/16 of an inch high so they don't
interfere<00:02:09.319> with<00:02:10.009> this<00:02:10.610> town<00:02:10.940> or<00:02:11.360> how<00:02:11.690> any<00:02:11.870> of
