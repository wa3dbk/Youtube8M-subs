00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.630

 game was being called assassins 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.329
 creed victory a reference 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.879
 possibly the Victorian era of london 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.610
 local period where the game is played but 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.300
 it seems that he changed his subtitle the 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.250
 name of this now is assassin's creed 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.340
 syndicate the name of the protagonist too 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.260
 leaked it should be called fry hint 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.550
 but nothing else about it is 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.890
 mentioned in the material 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.930

 during the industrial revolution where they 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.070
 find a huge world that will have to 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.810

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.600
