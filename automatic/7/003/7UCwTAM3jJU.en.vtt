everywhere this is actually a prototype
vehicle<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.570> is<00:02:45.720> number<00:02:45.930> 14<00:02:46.290> so<00:02:47.250> this<00:02:47.580> is

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
vehicle this is number 14 so this is

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.460 
vehicle this is number 14 so this is
unique<00:02:48.090> compared<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.660> all<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:49.050> others<00:02:49.290> that

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
are out there but this is close to

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.460 
are out there but this is close to
production<00:02:51.120> as<00:02:51.360> possible<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.020> this<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.290> what

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
production as possible so this is what

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.740 
production as possible so this is what
you<00:02:52.590> would<00:02:52.680> normally<00:02:52.860> see<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.550> vehicle<00:02:54.540> has
