I'd like to clean out all the years of

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.209 
I'd like to clean out all the years of
toxic<00:01:59.939> lifestyle<00:02:00.719> choices<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.380> made<00:02:01.680> and

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
toxic lifestyle choices that I made and

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.310 
toxic lifestyle choices that I made and
I<00:02:02.579> really<00:02:02.820> think<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.180> water<00:02:03.420> fast<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
I really think that a water fast is the

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.620 
I really think that a water fast is the
the<00:02:04.710> most<00:02:05.100> efficient<00:02:05.729> way<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.060> do<00:02:06.509> it

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
the most efficient way to do it

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.969 
the most efficient way to do it
completely<00:02:07.190> also<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.310> been<00:02:08.459> very<00:02:08.640> busy

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
completely also it's been very busy

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.740 
completely also it's been very busy
with<00:02:09.129> work<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.670> juice<00:02:09.849> bar<00:02:10.119> and<00:02:10.149> even

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
with work and the juice bar and even

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.449 
with work and the juice bar and even
just<00:02:10.899> launching<00:02:11.290> my<00:02:11.379> practice<00:02:11.830> so<00:02:12.069> I<00:02:12.099> really

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
just launching my practice so I really

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:13.860 
just launching my practice so I really
do<00:02:12.670> want<00:02:12.819> to<00:02:12.849> take<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.060> bit<00:02:13.239> of<00:02:13.269> time<00:02:13.510> for<00:02:13.540> myself

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
do want to take a bit of time for myself

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.170 
do want to take a bit of time for myself
which<00:02:14.680> is<00:02:14.709> something<00:02:15.220> that<00:02:15.370> I<00:02:15.400> don't<00:02:15.489> do<00:02:15.849> in<00:02:16.090> a

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
which is something that I don't do in a

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.229 
which is something that I don't do in a
very<00:02:16.360> balanced<00:02:16.870> way<00:02:17.019> often<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:19.030> I'm<00:02:19.120> going

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
very balanced way often so so I'm going

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.119 
very balanced way often so so I'm going
to<00:02:19.269> take<00:02:19.450> care<00:02:19.599> of<00:02:19.629> me<00:02:19.840> for<00:02:20.019> a<00:02:20.050> bit<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:21.099> think

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
to take care of me for a bit and I think

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.040 
to take care of me for a bit and I think
it'll<00:02:21.400> be<00:02:21.550> really<00:02:21.730> nice<00:02:21.910> so<00:02:22.599> that's<00:02:22.750> why<00:02:22.900> I'm

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
it'll be really nice so that's why I'm

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.320 
it'll be really nice so that's why I'm
doing<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.980> benefits<00:02:24.430> of<00:02:24.580> water<00:02:24.760> fasting

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
doing it the benefits of water fasting

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.630 
doing it the benefits of water fasting
are<00:02:25.599> incredible<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.800> do<00:02:27.069> not<00:02:27.280> think<00:02:27.459> it's

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
are incredible I do not think it's

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.550 
are incredible I do not think it's
suitable<00:02:27.819> for<00:02:28.060> everybody<00:02:28.690> so<00:02:29.110> don't<00:02:29.290> just

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
suitable for everybody so don't just

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.050 
suitable for everybody so don't just
start<00:02:29.890> drinking<00:02:30.250> water<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.610> stop<00:02:30.819> eating

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
start drinking water and stop eating

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.490 
start drinking water and stop eating
definitely<00:02:31.690> there's<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:31.930> lot<00:02:32.050> of<00:02:32.140> research

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
definitely there's a lot of research

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.430 
definitely there's a lot of research
involved<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:33.700> lot<00:02:33.730> of<00:02:34.090> information<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:35.230> be

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
involved and a lot of information to be

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.080 
involved and a lot of information to be
considered<00:02:35.980> before<00:02:36.400> you<00:02:36.489> decide<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:36.790> make<00:02:37.060> a

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
considered before you decide to make a

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.600 
considered before you decide to make a
decision<00:02:37.450> like<00:02:37.750> this<00:02:37.989> but<00:02:38.650> fasting<00:02:39.129> is<00:02:39.250> really

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
decision like this but fasting is really

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.820 
decision like this but fasting is really
a<00:02:39.640> very<00:02:39.940> ancient<00:02:40.330> technique<00:02:40.840> for<00:02:41.440> healing

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
a very ancient technique for healing

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.130 
a very ancient technique for healing
it's<00:02:42.069> something<00:02:42.790> that<00:02:42.940> every<00:02:43.150> animal<00:02:43.330> in<00:02:43.810> in

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
it's something that every animal in in

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.199 
it's something that every animal in in
every<00:02:44.739> animal<00:02:45.069> kingdom<00:02:45.519> does<00:02:45.790> when<00:02:46.090> they're

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
every animal kingdom does when they're

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.809 
every animal kingdom does when they're
unwell<00:02:46.599> is<00:02:46.959> they<00:02:47.170> fast<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:48.190> allows<00:02:48.459> your<00:02:48.640> body

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
unwell is they fast it allows your body

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.110 
unwell is they fast it allows your body
to<00:02:49.000> focus<00:02:49.510> completely<00:02:49.720> on<00:02:50.549> self<00:02:51.549> cleansing

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
to focus completely on self cleansing

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.120 
to focus completely on self cleansing
and<00:02:52.269> self<00:02:52.540> healing<00:02:52.840> so<00:02:53.319> you<00:02:53.920> don't<00:02:54.069> have

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
and self healing so you don't have

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.009 
and self healing so you don't have
seventy<00:02:54.489> percent<00:02:54.670> of<00:02:54.849> your<00:02:54.910> energy<00:02:54.970> going<00:02:55.630> all

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
had a bit of a hard time but I'm really

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.990 
had a bit of a hard time but I'm really
looking<00:03:25.840> forward<00:03:26.319> to<00:03:26.440> it<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:27.459> first<00:03:27.700> three

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
looking forward to it the first three

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.229 
looking forward to it the first three
days<00:03:28.239> of<00:03:28.389> the<00:03:28.480> water<00:03:28.690> fast<00:03:28.989> what<00:03:29.380> happens<00:03:29.769> is

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
days of the water fast what happens is

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.210 
days of the water fast what happens is
your<00:03:31.239> body<00:03:31.450> starts<00:03:31.989> to<00:03:32.079> eat<00:03:32.470> up<00:03:32.650> glycogen

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
your body starts to eat up glycogen

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.280 
your body starts to eat up glycogen
stores<00:03:33.459> in<00:03:33.670> your<00:03:33.730> liver<00:03:33.970> and<00:03:34.090> any<00:03:34.569> left<00:03:34.840> over

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
stores in your liver and any left over

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.470 
stores in your liver and any left over
food<00:03:35.739> that<00:03:36.370> you<00:03:36.459> have<00:03:36.489> in<00:03:36.850> your<00:03:36.940> intestines

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
food that you have in your intestines

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.479 
food that you have in your intestines
from<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:38.049> last<00:03:38.230> few<00:03:38.440> days<00:03:38.650> or<00:03:38.950> months<00:03:39.370> or

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
from the last few days or months or

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.120 
from the last few days or months or
years<00:03:39.549> of<00:03:40.000> eating<00:03:40.389> then<00:03:41.290> it<00:03:41.410> starts<00:03:41.739> to<00:03:41.829> scour

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
years of eating then it starts to scour

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.340 
years of eating then it starts to scour
the<00:03:42.280> body<00:03:42.549> and<00:03:42.940> eat<00:03:43.239> everything<00:03:43.690> that<00:03:43.959> isn't

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
the body and eat everything that isn't

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.830 
the body and eat everything that isn't
vital<00:03:45.040> tissue<00:03:45.340> so<00:03:45.880> that<00:03:45.910> means<00:03:46.299> that<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.630> body

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
vital tissue so that means that the body

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.319 
vital tissue so that means that the body
starts<00:03:47.260> eating<00:03:47.590> up<00:03:47.739> candida<00:03:48.489> and<00:03:48.730> parasites
