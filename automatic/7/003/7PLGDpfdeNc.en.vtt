fresh eppendorf tubes now I'm going to

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:31.830

add<00:03:22.340> 250<00:03:23.240> microliters<00:03:23.840> of<00:03:23.870> lysis<00:03:24.500> buffer<00:03:30.010> and

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
add 250 microliters of lysis buffer and

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.630 
add 250 microliters of lysis buffer and
mix<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.990> solution<00:03:33.170> by<00:03:33.620> gently<00:03:34.070> flipping<00:03:34.459> over

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.809 

then<00:03:46.019> I<00:03:46.049> had<00:03:46.319> 350<00:03:47.069> microliters<00:03:47.790> of

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
then I had 350 microliters of

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.759 
then I had 350 microliters of
neutralization<00:03:48.569> buffer<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.379> each<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.650> the

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
neutralization buffer to each of the

00:03:49.769 --> 00:04:01.490 
neutralization buffer to each of the
Jews

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.449 

and<00:04:03.840> again<00:04:04.840> mix<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:05.349> solution<00:04:05.890> by<00:04:06.040> gently

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
and again mix the solution by gently

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.670 
and again mix the solution by gently
flipping<00:04:06.819> over<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.209> tubes<00:04:07.480> you<00:04:08.140> can<00:04:08.170> see<00:04:08.500> that

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
flipping over the tubes you can see that

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.620 
flipping over the tubes you can see that
there<00:04:08.800> is<00:04:08.890> a<00:04:08.920> cottage<00:04:09.220> cheese<00:04:09.670> like<00:04:09.910> formation

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
there is a cottage cheese like formation

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.110 
there is a cottage cheese like formation
in<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:10.930> tubes<00:04:11.230> which<00:04:12.010> we<00:04:12.670> are<00:04:12.760> going<00:04:12.940> to

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
in the tubes which we are going to

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.940 
in the tubes which we are going to
separate<00:04:13.540> by<00:04:13.750> spinning<00:04:14.110> the<00:04:14.230> tubes<00:04:14.530> for<00:04:14.650> ten

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
separate by spinning the tubes for ten

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:27.450 
separate by spinning the tubes for ten
minutes<00:04:15.310> in<00:04:15.459> the<00:04:15.489> micro<00:04:15.849> centrifuge<00:04:26.340> then<00:04:27.340> I

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
minutes in the micro centrifuge then I

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.010 
minutes in the micro centrifuge then I
transfer<00:04:27.850> the<00:04:27.970> supernatant<00:04:28.360> to<00:04:28.750> spin

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
transfer the supernatant to spin

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:40.469 
transfer the supernatant to spin
problems<00:04:29.470> I<00:04:38.669> spin<00:04:39.669> for<00:04:39.850> one<00:04:40.000> minute<00:04:40.300> in<00:04:40.360> the

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
problems I spin for one minute in the

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.900 
problems I spin for one minute in the
centrifuge<00:04:44.280> then<00:04:45.280> I<00:04:45.400> discard<00:04:45.760> the

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
centrifuge then I discard the

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.670 
centrifuge then I discard the
flow-through<00:04:46.030> and<00:04:46.660> end<00:04:46.840> a<00:04:46.960> wash<00:04:47.169> buffer<00:04:47.410> with

flow-through and end a wash buffer with

00:04:47.680 --> 00:05:06.570 
flow-through and end a wash buffer with
ethanol<00:04:48.160> to<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.400> columns<00:05:05.100> then<00:05:06.100> I<00:05:06.190> spin<00:05:06.460> in

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
ethanol to the columns then I spin in

ethanol to the columns then I spin in
the<00:05:06.669> centrifuge<00:05:06.820> again<00:05:10.680> then<00:05:11.680> I<00:05:11.770> discard<00:05:12.130> the

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
the centrifuge again then I discard the

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:20.969 
the centrifuge again then I discard the
ethanol<00:05:17.190> and<00:05:18.870> spin<00:05:19.870> one<00:05:20.080> more<00:05:20.260> time<00:05:20.500> to<00:05:20.830> get

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
rid of the leftovers of the ethanol then

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.490 
rid of the leftovers of the ethanol then
I<00:05:25.150> transfer<00:05:25.570> the<00:05:25.660> combs<00:05:25.930> into<00:05:26.289> fresh

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
I transfer the combs into fresh

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:34.390 
I transfer the combs into fresh
eppendorf<00:05:27.039> tubes
