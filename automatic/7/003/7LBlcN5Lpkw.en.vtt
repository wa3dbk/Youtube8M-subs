Matt<00:01:09.300> they're<00:01:10.300> sitting<00:01:10.600> on<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:10.750> water<00:01:10.900> it

Matt they're sitting on the water it

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.010 
Matt they're sitting on the water it
makes<00:01:11.290> me<00:01:11.650> think<00:01:11.950> that<00:01:12.100> probably<00:01:12.220> sea<00:01:12.490> birds

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
makes me think that probably sea birds

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.390 
makes me think that probably sea birds
might<00:01:14.020> being<00:01:14.290> also<00:01:14.470> that<00:01:14.800> there's<00:01:14.950> fish<00:01:15.130> there

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
might being also that there's fish there

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.040 
might being also that there's fish there
probably<00:01:15.910> not<00:01:16.000> probably<00:01:16.210> sea<00:01:16.690> birds<00:01:16.930> have

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
probably not probably sea birds have

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.960 
probably not probably sea birds have
eaten<00:01:17.140> at<00:01:17.320> all<00:01:17.410> so<00:01:18.100> we'll<00:01:18.190> just<00:01:18.520> keep<00:01:18.670> moving
