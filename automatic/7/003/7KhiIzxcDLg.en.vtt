how to enable motion detection on your

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.010 
how to enable motion detection on your
mydlink<00:00:16.289> camera<00:00:17.090> now<00:00:18.090> in<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.359> example<00:00:18.539> we're

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
mydlink camera now in this example we're

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.890 
mydlink camera now in this example we're
going<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.170> be<00:00:19.260> using<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.730> dcs-942l<00:00:20.900> however

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
going to be using the dcs-942l however

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.960 
going to be using the dcs-942l however
if<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.260> have<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.439> different<00:00:22.859> camera<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.640> setup

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
if you have a different camera the setup

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.259 
if you have a different camera the setup
steps<00:00:24.330> should<00:00:24.600> be<00:00:24.720> pretty<00:00:25.410> much<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.800> same<00:00:26.269> now

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269

wizard is actually specifying your
motion<00:01:00.449> detection<00:01:00.750> zones<00:01:01.140> or<00:01:01.410> what<00:01:01.800> areas<00:01:02.219> you

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
motion detection zones or what areas you

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.359 
motion detection zones or what areas you
want<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.609> scan<00:01:02.850> from<00:01:03.090> motion<00:01:03.270> detection<00:01:04.369> now

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
want to scan from motion detection now

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.670 
want to scan from motion detection now
right<00:01:05.640> above<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.060> live<00:01:06.600> image<00:01:06.960> you're<00:01:07.650> going

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
right above the live image you're going

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.320 
right above the live image you're going
to<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:07.950> two<00:01:08.130> different<00:01:08.159> options<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:09.210> have

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
to have two different options you have

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.350 
to have two different options you have
enable<00:01:09.720> video<00:01:09.990> motion<00:01:10.229> or<00:01:10.560> enable<00:01:11.100> PIR<00:01:11.670> now

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
enable video motion or enable PIR now

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.090 
enable video motion or enable PIR now
depending<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.020> camera<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.530> have<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.950> may

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
depending on the camera you have you may

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.240 
depending on the camera you have you may
not<00:01:14.280> have<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.610> PIR<00:01:15.090> option<00:01:15.650> however<00:01:16.650> most

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
not have the PIR option however most

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.550 
not have the PIR option however most
cameras<00:01:17.610> will<00:01:17.790> have<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.150> video<00:01:18.420> motion<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
cameras will have the video motion the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.380 
cameras will have the video motion the
difference<00:01:19.890> between<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.220> two<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.670> with

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
difference between the two is that with

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.480 
difference between the two is that with
video<00:01:21.720> motion<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.560> camera<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.009> able<00:01:23.159> to

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
video motion the camera is able to

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.380 
video motion the camera is able to
determine<00:01:24.030> motion<00:01:24.990> based<00:01:25.320> on<00:01:25.560> frame<00:01:25.920> changes

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
determine motion based on frame changes

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.090 
determine motion based on frame changes
there's<00:01:27.390> actual<00:01:27.780> someone<00:01:28.619> moving<00:01:28.829> between

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
there's actual someone moving between

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.270 
there's actual someone moving between
frames<00:01:29.900> whereas<00:01:30.900> with<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.229> PIR<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.950> camera

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
frames whereas with the PIR the camera

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.950 
frames whereas with the PIR the camera
is<00:01:32.340> able<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.670> determine<00:01:32.970> motion<00:01:33.479> based<00:01:33.750> on

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
is able to determine motion based on

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.929 
is able to determine motion based on
thermal<00:01:34.290> change<00:01:34.680> hail<00:01:35.220> or<00:01:35.400> temperature

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
thermal change hail or temperature

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.210 
thermal change hail or temperature
change<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.439> example<00:01:37.619> we're<00:01:38.040> going<00:01:38.159> to

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
change so in this example we're going to

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.760 
change so in this example we're going to
use<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.520> video<00:01:38.640> motion<00:01:39.409> so<00:01:40.409> I'm<00:01:40.530> just<00:01:40.650> going

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
use the video motion so I'm just going

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.190 
use the video motion so I'm just going
to<00:01:40.799> put<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> check<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.400> box<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.970> then<00:01:42.930> rape

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
to put a check in that box and then rape

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.690 
to put a check in that box and then rape
a<00:01:43.350> load<00:01:43.530> here<00:01:43.770> again<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.460> your<00:01:44.490> live

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
a load here again you have your live

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.980 
a load here again you have your live
feed<00:01:45.439> you<00:01:46.439> can<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:46.799> draw<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.009> box<00:01:47.399> around

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
feed you can just draw a box around

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.120 
feed you can just draw a box around
whatever<00:01:48.990> areas<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.649> want<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.920> scan

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
whatever areas that you want to scan

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.980 
whatever areas that you want to scan
from<00:01:50.340> motion<00:01:53.060> okay<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.119> can<00:01:54.479> do<00:01:54.600> as<00:01:54.720> many<00:01:54.840> as

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
from motion okay you can do as many as

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.590 
from motion okay you can do as many as
you<00:01:55.079> like<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.729> then<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.240> right<00:01:57.390> here

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
you like and then just to the right here

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.020 
you like and then just to the right here
you<00:01:57.719> have<00:01:57.750> sensitivity<00:01:58.590> okay<00:01:59.460> by<00:01:59.640> default

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
you have sensitivity okay by default

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.870 
you have sensitivity okay by default
it's<00:02:00.210> set<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.360> 90%<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.350> what<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.219> sensitivity

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
it's set to 90% and what the sensitivity

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.590 
it's set to 90% and what the sensitivity
is<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.250> sensitivity<00:02:05.250> level<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.729> how

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
is is it's the sensitivity level of how

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.529 
is is it's the sensitivity level of how
the<00:02:06.659> camera<00:02:07.229> determines<00:02:07.619> motion<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.729> for<00:02:09.420> at

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
the camera determines motion so for at

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.270 
the camera determines motion so for at
the<00:02:09.660> higher<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.050> sensitivity<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.800> more

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
the higher the sensitivity the more

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.360 
the higher the sensitivity the more
sensitive<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.849> is<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.209> any<00:02:12.480> type<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.750> movement

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
sensitive it is to any type of movement

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.530 
sensitive it is to any type of movement
so<00:02:14.370> I'm<00:02:14.489> just<00:02:14.609> going<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.790> leave<00:02:14.909> it<00:02:14.969> at<00:02:15.150> that

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
so I'm just going to leave it at that

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.270 
so I'm just going to leave it at that
however<00:02:16.049> you<00:02:16.290> may<00:02:16.469> need<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.799> change<00:02:17.010> this

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
however you may need to change this

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.610 
however you may need to change this
depending<00:02:17.519> on<00:02:17.969> your<00:02:18.540> environment<00:02:18.689> and<00:02:19.260> what

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
depending on your environment and what

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.879 
depending on your environment and what
kind<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:19.980> motion<00:02:20.280> you're<00:02:20.549> trying<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.849> capture

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:21.889 
kind of motion you're trying to capture

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:23.899 
kind of motion you're trying to capture
so<00:02:22.889> I'm<00:02:23.010> just<00:02:23.159> going<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.310> come<00:02:23.489> down<00:02:23.609> and<00:02:23.790> click

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
so I'm just going to come down and click

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:27.830 
so I'm just going to come down and click
on<00:02:24.030> next<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:25.579> the<00:02:26.579> next<00:02:26.609> step<00:02:27.060> here<00:02:27.329> is<00:02:27.480> to

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
on next and the next step here is to

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.339 
on next and the next step here is to
enable<00:02:28.499> snapshot<00:02:29.249> notifications

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
enable snapshot notifications

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.080 
enable snapshot notifications
okay<00:02:31.349> and<00:02:31.439> what<00:02:31.560> snapshots<00:02:32.069> notifications<00:02:32.909> is

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
okay and what snapshots notifications is

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.300 
okay and what snapshots notifications is
it's<00:02:33.530> notifications<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.680> are<00:02:34.829> sent<00:02:35.069> either

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
it's notifications that are sent either

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.319 
it's notifications that are sent either
to<00:02:35.639> an<00:02:35.760> email<00:02:36.150> or<00:02:36.650> FTP<00:02:37.650> server<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.909> are<00:02:39.060> just

to an email or FTP server that are just

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.069 
to an email or FTP server that are just
still<00:02:40.200> images<00:02:40.349> or<00:02:40.829> snapshots<00:02:41.459> so<00:02:42.359> you<00:02:42.540> can<00:02:42.870> set

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
still images or snapshots so you can set

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.099

motion is detected you can have to do

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.089 
motion is detected you can have to do
single<00:02:59.939> or<00:03:00.269> you<00:03:00.750> can<00:03:00.930> do<00:03:01.079> six<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.799> them<00:03:01.919> and

your FTP settings in order to do so

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:17.000 
your FTP settings in order to do so
however<00:03:15.719> in<00:03:15.930> this<00:03:16.049> example<00:03:16.469> I'm<00:03:16.709> just<00:03:16.739> going

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
however in this example I'm just going

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.969 
however in this example I'm just going
to<00:03:17.099> leave<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.370> disabled<00:03:21.109> the<00:03:22.109> next<00:03:22.379> one<00:03:22.530> is<00:03:22.709> for

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:22.979 
to leave it disabled the next one is for

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:25.879 
to leave it disabled the next one is for
specifying<00:03:23.729> video<00:03:24.359> clip<00:03:24.659> notifications<00:03:25.409> so

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
specifying video clip notifications so

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.469 
specifying video clip notifications so
pretty<00:03:26.340> much<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.639> exact<00:03:26.879> same<00:03:26.909> thing<00:03:27.299> as

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:27.479 
pretty much the exact same thing as

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:29.780 
pretty much the exact same thing as
these<00:03:27.629> snapshot<00:03:28.139> notifications<00:03:28.889> but<00:03:29.609> with

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
these snapshot notifications but with

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.030 
these snapshot notifications but with
video<00:03:30.090> clips<00:03:30.239> instead<00:03:30.750> so<00:03:31.560> you're<00:03:31.769> able<00:03:31.889> to

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
video clips instead so you're able to

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.030 
video clips instead so you're able to
send<00:03:32.430> video<00:03:33.329> to<00:03:33.419> your<00:03:33.810> email<00:03:34.169> or<00:03:34.409> upload<00:03:34.829> it<00:03:34.859> to
