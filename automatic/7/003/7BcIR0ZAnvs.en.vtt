will show you an explanation different
type<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.260> technology<00:00:56.250> as<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.430> has<00:00:57.140> and<00:00:58.250> a<00:00:59.250> quick

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
type of technology as it has and a quick

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.070 
type of technology as it has and a quick
installation<00:01:00.000> guide<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:01.340> don't<00:01:02.340> know<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:03.359> let's

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
installation guide I don't know so let's

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:18.640 
installation guide I don't know so let's
go<00:01:04.260> ahead<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:05.090> unbox<00:01:06.090> it

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:25.730 

one<00:01:19.650> box<00:01:19.890> here<00:01:21.230> to<00:01:22.230> box<00:01:22.640> and<00:01:23.930> an<00:01:24.930> instruction

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
one box here to box and an instruction

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.780 
one box here to box and an instruction
manual<00:01:27.620> it's<00:01:28.620> all<00:01:28.740> for<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:28.950> small<00:01:29.280> box<00:01:29.460> first

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
manual it's all for the small box first

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.150 
manual it's all for the small box first
I<00:01:30.090> think<00:01:30.780> that's<00:01:30.900> obviously<00:01:31.380> those<00:01:31.620> centuries

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
I think that's obviously those centuries

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:43.730 
I think that's obviously those centuries
we<00:01:34.550> have<00:01:35.550> a<00:01:35.760> AMD<00:01:36.800> socket<00:01:37.800> mouth<00:01:38.160> insert<00:01:42.740> some

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
we have a AMD socket mouth insert some

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.560 
we have a AMD socket mouth insert some
tile<00:01:43.980> just<00:01:44.160> drop<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.490> screw<00:01:44.730> there<00:01:47.390> you<00:01:48.390> are

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
tile just drop the screw there you are

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.420 
tile just drop the screw there you are
thermal<00:01:49.200> compound<00:01:49.440> I<00:01:51.800> will<00:01:52.800> read<00:01:53.010> a<00:01:53.040> lot<00:01:53.340> of

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
thermal compound I will read a lot of

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:04.170 
thermal compound I will read a lot of
good<00:01:53.640> reviews<00:01:53.670> about<00:01:54.210> this

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.740 

okay<00:02:05.190> they<00:02:06.190> go<00:02:06.400> down<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:06.790> shoes<00:02:09.270> all<00:02:10.270> right<00:02:10.390> we

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
okay they go down the shoes all right we

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.510 
okay they go down the shoes all right we
have<00:02:10.990> it<00:02:11.680> looks<00:02:11.860> like<00:02:12.040> retention<00:02:13.620> clips<00:02:14.620> or

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
have it looks like retention clips or

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.480 
have it looks like retention clips or
different<00:02:16.510> types<00:02:16.720> of<00:02:16.900> socket<00:02:19.890> now<00:02:20.890> what<00:02:21.190> these

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
different types of socket now what these

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.640 
different types of socket now what these
cables<00:02:22.120> are<00:02:22.360> I've<00:02:22.720> seen<00:02:22.990> them<00:02:23.170> because<00:02:23.500> I've

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
cables are I've seen them because I've

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.000 
cables are I've seen them because I've
got<00:02:23.830> other<00:02:23.980> not<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.520> or<00:02:24.700> fans<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.300> products

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
got other not to or fans and products

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.040 
got other not to or fans and products
these<00:02:28.020> are<00:02:29.020> fine<00:02:29.410> cables<00:02:30.570> but<00:02:31.570> they<00:02:31.870> have

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
these are fine cables but they have

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.350 
these are fine cables but they have
resistors<00:02:32.590> in<00:02:32.800> them<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.970> these

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
resistors in them so the these

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.310 
resistors in them so the these
connections<00:02:35.020> will<00:02:35.980> help<00:02:36.220> you<00:02:36.370> lower<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:38.080> fan

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
connections will help you lower the fan

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.440 
connections will help you lower the fan
speed<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:39.070> slower<00:02:39.900> noise<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:42.180> assume<00:02:43.180> comes

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
speed and slower noise and assume comes

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.270 
speed and slower noise and assume comes
in<00:02:43.630> three<00:02:44.110> different<00:02:44.140> speed<00:02:44.770> settings<00:02:44.800> you

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
in three different speed settings you

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.630 
in three different speed settings you
can<00:02:45.340> say<00:02:46.170> more<00:02:47.170> details<00:02:47.680> on<00:02:47.800> the<00:02:47.950> specs<00:02:48.280> and

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
can say more details on the specs and

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.160 
can say more details on the specs and
summary<00:02:49.450> at<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.690> end<00:02:49.810> of<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.310> review<00:02:52.170> right

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170

always do explain the size to you of
other<00:04:23.099> than<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.699> specs<00:04:24.060> if<00:04:24.990> I<00:04:25.229> compare<00:04:25.800> it

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
other than the specs if I compare it

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
with say for example a hard drive I take

with say for example a hard drive I take
that<00:04:31.889> back<00:04:32.240> just<00:04:33.240> to<00:04:33.330> give<00:04:33.479> you<00:04:33.599> a<00:04:33.630> rough

that back just to give you a rough

that back just to give you a rough

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
estimate of what size it would be there

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:44.170 
estimate of what size it would be there
will<00:04:36.870> be<00:04:36.990> a<00:04:37.020> hard<00:04:37.229> drive<00:04:39.199> will<00:04:40.199> be<00:04:40.289> the<00:04:40.410> size

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:50.600 

and<00:04:46.849> you<00:04:47.849> can<00:04:48.000> set<00:04:48.150> the<00:04:48.240> front<00:04:48.539> here<00:04:49.400> got<00:04:50.400> the

and you can set the front here got the
knocked<00:04:51.240> or<00:04:51.479> logo<00:04:53.300> and<00:04:54.300> the<00:04:54.330> knee<00:04:54.599> got<00:04:55.169> very

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.649 
knocked or logo and the knee got very
smooth<00:04:56.870> plate<00:04:58.280> now<00:04:59.280> you<00:04:59.370> just<00:04:59.490> go<00:04:59.729> one<00:05:00.210> two

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:00.659 
smooth plate now you just go one two

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:06.249 
smooth plate now you just go one two
three<00:05:01.490> four<00:05:02.490> and<00:05:03.620> formed<00:05:04.620> outside<00:05:04.860> 8ki<00:05:05.759> pipes
