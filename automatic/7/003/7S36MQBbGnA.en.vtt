00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
don't think there's a lot of the triple

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.510 
don't think there's a lot of the triple
changes<00:00:16.529> done<00:00:16.680> i<00:00:16.710> think<00:00:16.890> blitzwing's

it<00:01:32.670> will<00:01:32.820> cut<00:01:33.150> cut<00:01:34.020> gets<00:01:34.290> him<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.439> shoot<00:01:34.680> one<00:01:34.829> of

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
it will cut cut gets him to shoot one of

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.249 
it will cut cut gets him to shoot one of
the<00:01:35.100> insecticons<00:01:35.900> not<00:01:36.900> one<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.049> his<00:01:37.140> better

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
the insecticons not one of his better

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.240 
the insecticons not one of his better
strategies<00:01:37.950> but<00:01:38.100> there<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.340> go<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:40.040> he<00:01:41.040> also

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
strategies but there you go and he also

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.190 
strategies but there you go and he also
narrowly<00:01:41.939> avoids<00:01:42.299> getting<00:01:42.360> blasted<00:01:42.840> to

pieces by oxen was prayin and his death
from<00:01:45.060> which<00:01:45.479> he<00:01:45.600> does<00:01:45.750> later<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.500> and

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
from which he does later on in the and

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.889 
from which he does later on in the and
as<00:01:47.250> we<00:01:47.369> know<00:01:47.399> it's<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.820> final<00:01:48.360> run<00:01:48.570> Optimus

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
as we know it's a final run Optimus

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.310 
as we know it's a final run Optimus
Prime<00:01:49.140> if<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.350> does<00:01:49.500> till<00:01:49.680> he<00:01:49.860> returns<00:01:50.100> again

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
Prime if it does till he returns again

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.710 
Prime if it does till he returns again
so<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.649> was<00:01:52.770> pretty<00:01:52.920> good<00:01:53.270> then<00:01:54.270> he's<00:01:54.540> in

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
so that was pretty good then he's in

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.350 
so that was pretty good then he's in

as we saw earlier and there we go not a
bad-looking<00:05:43.580> jet<00:05:44.770> it's<00:05:45.770> not<00:05:45.919> brilliant<00:05:46.310> but

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
bad-looking jet it's not brilliant but

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.100 
bad-looking jet it's not brilliant but
considering<00:05:47.180> it's<00:05:47.300> done<00:05:47.479> through<00:05:47.660> modes<00:05:47.960> I

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
considering it's done through modes I

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.380 
considering it's done through modes I
think<00:05:48.320> that's<00:05:48.470> pretty<00:05:48.650> impressive<00:05:49.039> in<00:05:49.400> it<00:05:49.550> it

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.390 
think that's pretty impressive in it it

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.000 
think that's pretty impressive in it it
doesn't<00:05:50.539> look<00:05:50.690> too<00:05:50.900> far<00:05:51.110> from<00:05:51.289> the<00:05:51.440> sea<00:05:51.620> cadets

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
doesn't look too far from the sea cadets

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.810 
doesn't look too far from the sea cadets
so<00:05:52.700> there<00:05:52.850> we<00:05:53.000> go<00:05:53.030> Blitzwing<00:05:54.020> in<00:05:54.140> jet<00:05:54.320> mode<00:05:54.560> and

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
so there we go Blitzwing in jet mode and

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.490 
so there we go Blitzwing in jet mode and
excellent<00:05:55.820> little<00:05:56.090> toy<00:05:56.270> it's<00:05:56.539> so<00:05:56.810> neatly

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
excellent little toy it's so neatly

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.360 
excellent little toy it's so neatly
compact<00:05:58.190> and<00:05:58.570> the<00:05:59.570> free<00:05:59.780> molds<00:06:00.140> are<00:06:00.560> brilliant

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
compact and the free molds are brilliant

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.060 
compact and the free molds are brilliant
but<00:06:01.850> they're<00:06:02.000> not<00:06:02.090> bad<00:06:02.360> the<00:06:02.660> robot<00:06:03.020> mode<00:06:03.320> ok
