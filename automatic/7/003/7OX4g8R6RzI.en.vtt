was a bit of a problem when actually
taking<00:02:15.240> photos<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:15.930> then<00:02:16.230> if<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.620> had<00:02:16.770> it

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
taking photos and then if I had it

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.440 
taking photos and then if I had it
especially<00:02:17.160> on<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.550> monopod<00:02:17.970> after<00:02:18.210> sort<00:02:18.390> of

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
especially on that monopod after sort of

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.360 
especially on that monopod after sort of
bring<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:18.720> back<00:02:18.900> switches<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.680> video<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.220> then

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
bring it back switches to video and then

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.310 
bring it back switches to video and then
continue<00:02:20.880> what<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.090> was<00:02:21.240> doing<00:02:21.570> but<00:02:21.990> other<00:02:22.170> than

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
continue what I was doing but other than

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.290 
continue what I was doing but other than
that<00:02:22.410> build<00:02:22.860> quality<00:02:23.070> isn't<00:02:23.610> too<00:02:23.730> bad<00:02:23.970> for<00:02:24.240> a

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
that build quality isn't too bad for a

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.150 
that build quality isn't too bad for a
product<00:02:24.630> like<00:02:24.720> this<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:25.290> mean<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.740> could<00:02:25.920> be<00:02:26.130> a

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
product like this I mean it could be a

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.700 
product like this I mean it could be a
little<00:02:26.490> bit<00:02:26.670> more<00:02:26.820> sturdier<00:02:27.270> but<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:28.170> is<00:02:28.440> what

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
little bit more sturdier but it is what

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.680 
little bit more sturdier but it is what
it<00:02:28.740> is<00:02:28.860> so<00:02:29.580> if<00:02:29.850> you're<00:02:29.970> looking<00:02:30.120> for<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.450> show
