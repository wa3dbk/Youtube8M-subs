00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.290
 web video repair yourself in this 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.049
 case the video is dedicated to 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.509
 knowledge of the internal part and 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.509
 wiring of an electric boiler 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.920
 the model to show is a model 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.050
 pretty basic therefore you can 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.150
 see clearly what is each component 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.300
 we have the cable to enter the 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.300
 feeding 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.899
 said entry change consists of 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.750
 three wired the cable making 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.940
 earth in an electric thermos always 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.399
 always have to be 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.860
 connected is the protection that we have 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.350
 before a derivation in the resistances 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.240
 this grounding will protect us together 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.640
 with the differential of not being 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:57.350
 worry when we use our 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.810
 I have two belda 220 cables 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.100
 the same in hand 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.260
 the thermostat 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.330
 the thermostat is adjustable 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.870
 through a button that has in the part 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.540
 lower in this case is regulated 5 a 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.360
 the maximum temperature 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.390
 the thermostat in this case is a 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.120
 rod the same when heated in 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.380
 contact with the bony part with water 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.480
 hot jumps and would open the circuit 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.000
 stopping to feed the resistances 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:36.660
 of the thermos we have 220 input 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.670
 and 220 output because we have 4 cables 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.670
 to health we have 4 wires both 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.600
 Fine are the lamp 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.049
 and neon operating indicators 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.049
 of alternate 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.470
 these would go together 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.960
 the resistances 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:05.770
 having one of the 220 cables of the 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:10.179
 resistors bridge masters with the second 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:12.040
 resistance and the other 220 cable in 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.740
 another pole 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.650
 to the people of resistance and bridged 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.290
 to the first resistance therefore 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.630
 we have two resistors in parallel the 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.480
 configuration of this thermos is extremely 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.910
 simple to have only cable 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:35.230
 power input thermostat 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.720
 neon lamp and two resistors 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:42.700
 fed in series 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.300
 as you can see it's pretty simple 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.920
 in this model the thermos is removable 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.370
 keep screws 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.770
 and nuts removing the same standards 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.930
 and the entire base of the thermos and you could 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.290
 proceed to the disqualification of it 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.420
 in some we have modern ones in the 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.600
 bottom part is not removable being 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.420
 we have of use and tina we will not see 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.250
 nuts and bolts that hold the base 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.450
 one thing also to keep in mind 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.880
 our beautiful I did not go to the 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.860
 installation is the placement of 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.280
 electrical diaz sleeves the same 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:22.690
 They separate the upper metal part of the 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.910
 section of the metal part of the 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.780
 household pipes 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.880
 this is the cuff is direct and ccoo is 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.480
 detection separating them electrically 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.510
 one connection with the other so it does not 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.370
 no kind of effect of 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.480
 electrolysis or premature wear of the 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.099
 thermos 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.620
 anyway we have to have in 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:47.620
 mind that thermos have a life a 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.060
 both limited being able to be between 4 a 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.610
 5 years approximately 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.739
 We can extend the demountables a 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.700
 little more if we proceed to your 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.550
 disqualification 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.510
 and replacing the cloud that is in the 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:05.060
 inside but those of the last years already 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.310
 they are to be used and thrown 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.010
 well I hope the video can be 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.720
 of help when you clear some topic and 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.830
 especially that you continue visiting the web 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.830
 for yourself
