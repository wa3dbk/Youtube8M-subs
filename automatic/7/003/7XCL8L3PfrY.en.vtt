00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
ready-to-wear or so okay so where do we

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.760 
ready-to-wear or so okay so where do we
start<00:00:39.270> well<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.719> glass<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.140> available<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.710> a

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
start well the glass is available in a

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.490 
start well the glass is available in a
large<00:00:40.980> variety<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.489> forms<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:43.020> main<00:00:43.260> is

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
large variety of forms it's the main is

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.350 
large variety of forms it's the main is
going<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.710> be<00:00:43.800> rods<00:00:44.100> there's<00:00:44.640> noodles<00:00:45.090> and

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
going to be rods there's noodles and

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.090 
going to be rods there's noodles and
stringers<00:00:45.809> which<00:00:46.050> are<00:00:46.230> just<00:00:46.379> different<00:00:46.710> sizes

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
stringers which are just different sizes

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.560 
stringers which are just different sizes
of<00:00:47.129> glass<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.969> would<00:00:48.090> use<00:00:48.239> those<00:00:48.420> for

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
of glass you would use those for

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.450 
of glass you would use those for
decorating<00:00:49.200> absolutely<00:00:49.950> for<00:00:50.129> putting<00:00:50.370> your

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
decorating absolutely for putting your

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.819 
decorating absolutely for putting your
dots<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.000> your<00:00:51.120> real<00:00:51.300> fine<00:00:51.539> lines<00:00:51.829> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
dots and your real fine lines the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.709 
dots and your real fine lines the
different<00:00:53.219> types<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.670> glass<00:00:53.940> there<00:00:53.969> they<00:00:54.600> all

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
different types of glass there they all

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.410 
different types of glass there they all
have<00:00:54.989> their<00:00:55.260> own<00:00:55.320> specific<00:00:55.680> co<00:00:56.280> e<00:00:56.399> now<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.239> is

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
have their own specific co e now that is

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.959 
have their own specific co e now that is
the<00:00:57.449> coefficient<00:00:57.930> C<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.620> expansion<00:00:59.190> what<00:00:59.850> does

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
the coefficient C of expansion what does

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.430 
the coefficient C of expansion what does
that<00:01:00.000> mean<00:01:00.239> that's<00:01:00.539> going<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.050> rate<00:01:01.289> at

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
that mean that's going to be the rate at

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.799 
that mean that's going to be the rate at
which<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.770> glass<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.399> shrinking<00:01:03.120> as<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.539> cools

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
which the glass is shrinking as it cools

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.219 
which the glass is shrinking as it cools
so<00:01:04.619> if<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.920> mix<00:01:05.220> co<00:01:05.519> ease<00:01:05.850> yeah<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.840> beat<00:01:07.049> is

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
so if you mix co ease yeah the beat is

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.870 
so if you mix co ease yeah the beat is
eventually<00:01:07.740> going<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.189> crack<00:01:08.490> where<00:01:08.760> that

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
eventually going to crack where that

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.149 
eventually going to crack where that
glass<00:01:09.150> meets<00:01:09.479> ok<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.380> want<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.650> be<00:01:10.770> really

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
glass meets ok so you want to be really

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.590 
glass meets ok so you want to be really
clear<00:01:11.400> about<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.850> before<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.210> even<00:01:12.390> get

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
clear about that before you even get

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.330 
clear about that before you even get
started<00:01:12.659> absolutely<00:01:13.619> make<00:01:13.799> sure<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.130> keep<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
started absolutely make sure to keep the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.399 
started absolutely make sure to keep the
different<00:01:14.820> co<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.330> completely<00:01:15.990> separate<00:01:16.350> from

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
different co is completely separate from

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.810 
different co is completely separate from
each<00:01:16.650> other<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:16.950> what<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.130> love<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.610> color

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
you can really control the color of all

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.260 
you can really control the color of all
the<00:01:19.830> beads<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.159> your<00:01:20.189> work<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.610> way<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.090> sure

this does burn quite a bit hotter so

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.250 
this does burn quite a bit hotter so
it's<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:42.000> little<00:02:42.150> quicker<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.659> work<00:02:42.840> with<00:02:43.049> on

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
it's a little quicker to work with on

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.479 
it's a little quicker to work with on
this<00:02:43.379> and<00:02:43.590> this<00:02:43.650> will<00:02:43.889> allow<00:02:44.069> you<00:02:44.129> to<00:02:44.250> do

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
this and this will allow you to do

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.059 
this and this will allow you to do
larger<00:02:45.150> type<00:02:45.359> beads<00:02:45.659> probably<00:02:46.560> repeated

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
larger type beads probably repeated

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.099 
larger type beads probably repeated
beads<00:02:47.790> too<00:02:48.060> if<00:02:48.209> you<00:02:48.359> are<00:02:48.419> going<00:02:48.659> to<00:02:48.810> sit<00:02:49.079> down

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
beads too if you are going to sit down

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.589 
beads too if you are going to sit down
and<00:02:49.349> make<00:02:49.469> a<00:02:49.500> bunch<00:02:49.709> at<00:02:49.829> one<00:02:49.980> time<00:02:50.129> you

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
and make a bunch at one time you

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.000 
and make a bunch at one time you
absolutely<00:02:51.599> it<00:02:51.750> sure<00:02:51.930> will<00:02:52.169> so<00:02:52.799> what<00:02:52.919> I'm

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
absolutely it sure will so what I'm

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.830 
absolutely it sure will so what I'm
doing<00:02:53.040> now<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.699> am<00:02:53.819> warming<00:02:54.239> up<00:02:54.419> the<00:02:54.599> glass

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
doing now is I am warming up the glass

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.539 
doing now is I am warming up the glass
rod<00:02:55.169> you<00:02:55.530> don't<00:02:55.680> want<00:02:55.859> to<00:02:55.949> put<00:02:56.159> the<00:02:56.340> rod

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
rod you don't want to put the rod

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.369 
rod you don't want to put the rod
directly<00:02:57.030> into<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.359> flame<00:02:57.659> because<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:58.199> will

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
directly into the flame because it will

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.830 
directly into the flame because it will
shatter<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.980> while<00:02:59.969> i'm<00:03:00.120> warming<00:03:00.480> this<00:03:00.659> so

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
shatter and while i'm warming this so

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.530 
shatter and while i'm warming this so
i'm<00:03:01.049> going<00:03:01.379> to<00:03:01.590> put<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.310> mandrel<00:03:03.030> right

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
i'm going to put the mandrel right

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.939 
i'm going to put the mandrel right
behind<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.989> glass<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.500> i'm<00:03:04.590> just<00:03:04.739> going<00:03:04.919> to

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:04.949 
behind the glass and i'm just going to

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:07.099 
behind the glass and i'm just going to
start<00:03:05.219> warming<00:03:05.459> up<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:05.790> bead<00:03:06.239> release<00:03:06.359> okay

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
start warming up that bead release okay

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.860 
start warming up that bead release okay
when<00:03:07.769> you<00:03:07.889> go<00:03:08.129> to<00:03:08.189> apply<00:03:08.819> the<00:03:08.849> glass<00:03:09.269> rod<00:03:09.629> to

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
when you go to apply the glass rod to

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.420 
when you go to apply the glass rod to
the<00:03:09.989> mandrel<00:03:10.439> if<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:10.680> find<00:03:10.980> it's<00:03:11.189> not

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
the mandrel if you find it's not

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.429 
the mandrel if you find it's not
sticking<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.629> mandrel<00:03:13.019> it's<00:03:13.139> probably

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:13.439 
sticking to the mandrel it's probably

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.050 
sticking to the mandrel it's probably
because<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.889> bead<00:03:14.069> release<00:03:14.250> isn't<00:03:14.669> quite

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
because the bead release isn't quite

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.360 
because the bead release isn't quite
hard<00:03:15.299> enough<00:03:15.569> yeah<00:03:16.409> now<00:03:16.560> this<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:16.919> took<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.189> class

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
hard enough yeah now this I took a class

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.710 
hard enough yeah now this I took a class
in<00:03:17.459> this<00:03:17.759> and<00:03:17.970> I<00:03:18.030> thought<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.209> was<00:03:18.449> one<00:03:18.629> of

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
in this and I thought that was one of

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.149 
in this and I thought that was one of
the<00:03:18.810> hardest<00:03:18.900> parts<00:03:19.349> to<00:03:19.439> getting<00:03:19.650> started<00:03:20.009> was

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
the hardest parts to getting started was

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:21.860 
the hardest parts to getting started was
getting<00:03:20.639> coordinated<00:03:21.180> enough<00:03:21.299> to<00:03:21.569> use<00:03:21.689> both

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
getting coordinated enough to use both

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.629 
getting coordinated enough to use both
hands<00:03:22.139> actually<00:03:22.409> kind<00:03:23.129> of<00:03:23.159> keep<00:03:23.370> track<00:03:23.549> of

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
hands actually kind of keep track of

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.879 
hands actually kind of keep track of
what's<00:03:24.269> warming<00:03:24.689> where<00:03:24.870> yeah<00:03:25.319> it<00:03:25.439> does<00:03:25.650> take<00:03:25.859> a

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
what's warming where yeah it does take a

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.129 
what's warming where yeah it does take a
little<00:03:26.280> bit<00:03:26.549> of<00:03:26.609> skill<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.239> get<00:03:27.389> that<00:03:27.569> down<00:03:27.780> so

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
little bit of skill to get that down so

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.379 
little bit of skill to get that down so
now<00:03:28.319> I'm<00:03:28.439> just<00:03:28.620> going<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:29.009> apply<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.579> glass<00:03:30.090> to

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
now I'm just going to apply the glass to

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.960 
now I'm just going to apply the glass to
the<00:03:30.419> mandrel<00:03:30.840> look<00:03:31.079> at<00:03:31.229> that<00:03:31.439> and<00:03:31.799> once<00:03:32.729> the

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
the mandrel look at that and once the

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.210 
the mandrel look at that and once the
desired<00:03:33.449> amount<00:03:33.629> of<00:03:33.870> glass<00:03:34.139> is<00:03:34.439> put<00:03:34.709> on<00:03:34.859> to<00:03:35.099> the

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
desired amount of glass is put on to the

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.990 
desired amount of glass is put on to the
mandrel<00:03:37.159> you're<00:03:38.159> just<00:03:38.340> going<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.579> reintroduce

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
mandrel you're just going to reintroduce

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.240 
mandrel you're just going to reintroduce
that<00:03:39.479> beat<00:03:39.750> into<00:03:40.079> the<00:03:40.169> heat<00:03:40.409> and<00:03:40.620> you're<00:03:40.889> going

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
that beat into the heat and you're going

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.140 
that beat into the heat and you're going
to<00:03:41.459> keep<00:03:41.790> it<00:03:41.970> spinning<00:03:42.389> and<00:03:42.720> that's<00:03:43.019> going<00:03:43.379> to

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
to keep it spinning and that's going to

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.189 
to keep it spinning and that's going to
make<00:03:45.150> it<00:03:45.299> nice<00:03:45.449> and<00:03:45.479> even<00:03:45.840> right<00:03:45.989> absolutely

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:46.199 
make it nice and even right absolutely

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:48.499 
make it nice and even right absolutely
with<00:03:46.919> the<00:03:47.040> heat<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:47.459> gravity<00:03:47.669> it's<00:03:48.120> going<00:03:48.389> to

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:48.509 
with the heat and gravity it's going to

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:53.800 
with the heat and gravity it's going to
form<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.989> real<00:03:49.229> nice<00:03:49.560> bead

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.479 

I<00:03:53.900> think<00:03:54.590> this<00:03:54.650> whole<00:03:54.800> process<00:03:55.040> is<00:03:55.250> pretty

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
I think this whole process is pretty

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.270 
I think this whole process is pretty
amazing<00:03:55.819> it<00:03:56.480> is<00:03:56.770> I'm<00:03:57.770> going<00:03:57.890> to<00:03:57.950> blow<00:03:58.130> on<00:03:58.250> that

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
amazing it is I'm going to blow on that

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.510 
amazing it is I'm going to blow on that
just<00:03:58.610> a<00:03:58.730> little<00:03:58.970> bit<00:03:59.090> to<00:03:59.209> cool<00:03:59.420> it<00:03:59.540> down<00:04:00.520> and

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
just a little bit to cool it down and

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.860 
just a little bit to cool it down and
what<00:04:01.670> I'll<00:04:01.760> do<00:04:01.910> here<00:04:01.940> is<00:04:02.270> I'm<00:04:02.420> just<00:04:02.569> going<00:04:02.690> to

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
what I'll do here is I'm just going to

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.500 
what I'll do here is I'm just going to
apply<00:04:03.230> a<00:04:03.349> quick<00:04:03.739> dot<00:04:04.130> on<00:04:04.400> to<00:04:04.520> the<00:04:04.610> beam<00:04:04.819> you

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
apply a quick dot on to the beam you

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.479 
apply a quick dot on to the beam you
want<00:04:05.690> to<00:04:05.780> make<00:04:06.020> sure<00:04:06.050> the<00:04:06.590> core<00:04:06.890> bead<00:04:07.160> is

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
want to make sure the core bead is

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.220 
want to make sure the core bead is
cooled<00:04:08.000> down<00:04:08.180> a<00:04:08.239> little<00:04:08.480> bit<00:04:08.660> because<00:04:08.870> if<00:04:09.080> you

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
cooled down a little bit because if you

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.820 
cooled down a little bit because if you
apply<00:04:09.709> a<00:04:10.010> dot<00:04:10.819> to<00:04:11.209> a<00:04:11.540> super<00:04:12.200> hop<00:04:12.410> beat<00:04:12.650> it's

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
apply a dot to a super hop beat it's

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.940 
apply a dot to a super hop beat it's
going<00:04:12.980> to<00:04:13.040> miss<00:04:13.220> shape<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:13.640> bead<00:04:14.830> because<00:04:15.830> it

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
going to miss shape the bead because it

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.590 
going to miss shape the bead because it
just<00:04:16.040> melts<00:04:16.370> right<00:04:16.430> in<00:04:16.639> each<00:04:16.940> others<00:04:17.299> are<00:04:17.450> my

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
just melts right in each others are my

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.849 
just melts right in each others are my
anti<00:04:17.930> it's<00:04:18.139> going<00:04:18.290> to<00:04:18.350> melt<00:04:18.500> writing

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
anti it's going to melt writing

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.430 
anti it's going to melt writing
absolutely<00:04:19.579> so<00:04:20.480> here<00:04:20.750> I<00:04:20.780> can<00:04:21.049> just<00:04:21.260> go<00:04:21.410> ahead

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
absolutely so here I can just go ahead

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.720 
absolutely so here I can just go ahead
and<00:04:21.650> apply<00:04:21.829> this<00:04:23.680> pull<00:04:24.680> that<00:04:24.889> right<00:04:25.100> off<00:04:25.400> and

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
and apply this pull that right off and

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.330 
and apply this pull that right off and
there<00:04:25.880> you<00:04:26.030> would<00:04:26.180> have<00:04:26.360> a<00:04:26.389> nice<00:04:26.889> cool<00:04:27.889> don't

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
there you would have a nice cool don't

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.620 
there you would have a nice cool don't
on<00:04:28.460> top<00:04:28.669> of<00:04:28.790> your<00:04:28.880> beat<00:04:29.030> of<00:04:29.120> course<00:04:29.330> the<00:04:29.450> bead

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
on top of your beat of course the bead

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.360 
on top of your beat of course the bead
was<00:04:29.780> hot<00:04:29.990> so<00:04:30.260> it<00:04:30.350> kind<00:04:30.590> of<00:04:30.650> melted<00:04:31.040> in<00:04:31.160> there

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
was hot so it kind of melted in there

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.180 
was hot so it kind of melted in there
that's<00:04:31.940> okay<00:04:32.240> you<00:04:32.330> just<00:04:32.680> and<00:04:33.680> this<00:04:33.830> here<00:04:33.860> is<00:04:34.070> a

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
that's okay you just and this here is a

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.670 
that's okay you just and this here is a
fiber<00:04:34.550> blanket<00:04:35.120> so<00:04:35.330> this<00:04:35.510> just<00:04:35.780> insulates<00:04:36.440> the

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
fiber blanket so this just insulates the

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.340 
fiber blanket so this just insulates the
bead<00:04:36.860> and<00:04:37.270> allows<00:04:38.270> it<00:04:38.479> to<00:04:38.510> cool<00:04:38.840> down<00:04:38.900> without

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
bead and allows it to cool down without

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.490 
bead and allows it to cool down without
cracking<00:04:40.570> then<00:04:41.570> we<00:04:41.690> have<00:04:41.810> our<00:04:41.930> finished<00:04:42.139> piece

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
cracking then we have our finished piece

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.530 
cracking then we have our finished piece
and<00:04:42.770> that's<00:04:42.919> going<00:04:43.220> to<00:04:43.430> be<00:04:43.580> a<00:04:43.610> finished<00:04:44.240> bead

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
and that's going to be a finished bead

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.120 
and that's going to be a finished bead
right<00:04:44.750> there<00:04:44.990> alright<00:04:45.410> and<00:04:45.650> then<00:04:45.770> what<00:04:45.919> do<00:04:46.040> we

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
right there alright and then what do we

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.370 
right there alright and then what do we
do<00:04:46.250> with<00:04:46.400> this<00:04:46.580> this<00:04:47.540> hearon<00:04:47.780> a<00:04:48.020> light<00:04:48.200> right

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
do with this this hearon a light right

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.460 
do with this this hearon a light right
yes<00:04:48.979> it<00:04:49.190> needs<00:04:49.220> to<00:04:49.520> be<00:04:49.610> put<00:04:49.850> into<00:04:50.000> a<00:04:50.180> kiln<00:04:50.600> right

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
yes it needs to be put into a kiln right

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.469 
yes it needs to be put into a kiln right
here<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:52.040> count<00:04:52.310> can<00:04:52.520> be<00:04:52.639> used<00:04:52.850> for<00:04:52.970> a<00:04:53.120> couple

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
here the count can be used for a couple

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.360 
here the count can be used for a couple
of<00:04:53.570> things<00:04:53.600> one<00:04:53.900> it<00:04:54.169> can<00:04:54.320> preheat<00:04:54.710> your<00:04:54.950> glass

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
of things one it can preheat your glass

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.830 
of things one it can preheat your glass
rods<00:04:55.729> that<00:04:55.880> you're<00:04:56.060> going<00:04:56.180> to<00:04:56.240> be<00:04:56.360> using<00:04:56.540> in

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
rods that you're going to be using in

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.170 
rods that you're going to be using in
your<00:04:56.870> beam<00:04:57.110> all<00:04:57.380> right<00:04:57.650> another<00:04:58.490> is<00:04:58.729> you<00:04:58.970> can

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
your beam all right another is you can

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.120 
your beam all right another is you can
anneal<00:04:59.570> the<00:04:59.750> beads<00:04:59.990> either<00:05:00.350> on<00:05:00.560> the<00:05:00.710> mandrel

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
anneal the beads either on the mandrel

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.340 
anneal the beads either on the mandrel
or<00:05:01.310> you<00:05:01.610> can<00:05:01.760> batch<00:05:02.030> anew<00:05:02.360> them<00:05:02.479> an<00:05:03.020> annealing

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
or you can batch anew them an annealing

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.570 
or you can batch anew them an annealing
is<00:05:03.530> really<00:05:03.800> important<00:05:04.190> because<00:05:04.250> that's

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
is really important because that's

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.340 
is really important because that's
what's<00:05:04.820> going<00:05:05.150> to<00:05:05.240> prevent<00:05:05.600> your<00:05:05.780> bead<00:05:06.169> from

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
what's going to prevent your bead from

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.350 
what's going to prevent your bead from
cracking<00:05:06.620> yes<00:05:07.400> and<00:05:07.669> what<00:05:07.789> you<00:05:07.910> want<00:05:08.060> to<00:05:08.120> do<00:05:08.240> is

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
cracking yes and what you want to do is

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.580 
cracking yes and what you want to do is
you<00:05:08.510> want<00:05:08.539> to<00:05:08.780> take<00:05:08.930> the<00:05:09.110> bead<00:05:09.320> to<00:05:09.560> a

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
you want to take the bead to a

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.230 
you want to take the bead to a
temperature<00:05:10.010> of<00:05:10.130> nine<00:05:10.400> hundred<00:05:10.760> and<00:05:10.880> seventy

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
temperature of nine hundred and seventy

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.200 
temperature of nine hundred and seventy
degrees<00:05:11.440> allow<00:05:12.440> it<00:05:12.590> to<00:05:12.620> soak<00:05:13.039> for<00:05:13.370> about<00:05:13.430> 30

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
degrees allow it to soak for about 30

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.550 
degrees allow it to soak for about 30
minutes<00:05:14.479> and<00:05:14.750> then<00:05:14.810> you<00:05:14.960> want<00:05:15.110> to<00:05:15.169> just<00:05:15.289> let<00:05:15.470> it

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
minutes and then you want to just let it

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.900 
minutes and then you want to just let it
slowly<00:05:15.860> cool<00:05:16.220> back<00:05:16.400> down<00:05:16.430> to<00:05:16.760> room

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
slowly cool back down to room

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.020 
slowly cool back down to room
temperature<00:05:17.770> okay<00:05:18.770> so<00:05:19.340> if<00:05:19.610> we<00:05:19.700> wanted<00:05:19.970> to

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
temperature okay so if we wanted to

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.909 
temperature okay so if we wanted to
create<00:05:20.479> a<00:05:20.660> shape<00:05:20.930> with<00:05:21.169> our<00:05:21.289> bead<00:05:21.470> we<00:05:21.680> would<00:05:21.800> do

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
create a shape with our bead we would do

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.500 
create a shape with our bead we would do
that<00:05:22.070> before<00:05:22.250> annealing<00:05:22.729> and<00:05:23.000> while<00:05:23.210> the<00:05:23.360> beat

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
that before annealing and while the beat

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.760 
that before annealing and while the beat
is<00:05:23.660> still<00:05:23.870> hot<00:05:24.020> you<00:05:24.169> could<00:05:24.260> do<00:05:24.410> something<00:05:24.440> like

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
is still hot you could do something like

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.590 
is still hot you could do something like
this<00:05:25.100> to<00:05:25.160> mash<00:05:25.490> it<00:05:25.700> into<00:05:25.850> a<00:05:26.000> cube<00:05:26.389> shape

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
this to mash it into a cube shape

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.420 
this to mash it into a cube shape
absolutely<00:05:27.380> that<00:05:27.530> right<00:05:27.740> there<00:05:27.950> is<00:05:27.979> a<00:05:28.100> large

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
absolutely that right there is a large

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.879 
absolutely that right there is a large
scale<00:05:28.820> masher<00:05:29.270> you<00:05:29.600> can<00:05:29.780> see<00:05:30.110> it<00:05:30.320> just<00:05:30.560> um

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
scale masher you can see it just um

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:32.950 
scale masher you can see it just um
what's<00:05:31.639> going<00:05:31.820> to<00:05:31.880> do<00:05:32.060> is<00:05:32.180> smash<00:05:32.539> the<00:05:32.750> beads

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
what's going to do is smash the beads

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.620 
what's going to do is smash the beads
equally<00:05:33.500> on<00:05:33.620> both<00:05:33.650> sides<00:05:34.130> we<00:05:34.970> have<00:05:35.120> graphite
