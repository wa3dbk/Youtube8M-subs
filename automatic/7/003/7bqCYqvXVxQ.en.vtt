00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:39.480
 comes straight from karl home so relatively 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:42.660
 exhausted so sometimes underwent one more 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.320
 Round two days no leaf 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.210
 but no one came when you see that 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.800
 maybe already three days I know 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.320

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.520

 my fanbase a bit 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.049
 would enlarge if ever a few 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.720

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.020

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.530
 Settings found out that for 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.439
 not as strong as before for me 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.540
 you also not and then it runs and there 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.829
 will be a lot too wow 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.350
 but also a lot of league of legends 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.700

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.000
 leisure more league of legends like wow 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:45.540

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.040
 Online is actually only online binding 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.759
 to write it with my subscribers 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.130

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:27.129
 first 600 kw is the assassination runs 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:31.060
 but also something ambush out 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:34.959
 seems to be ambush but is running 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:38.249
 with us in any case my present 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:42.340
 theme is world of warcraft op classes 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:43.540
 and what classes ioc finds and which ones 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.579
 So do not class so just write 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.510
 my comments right now right now 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:51.760
 anything you have seen from the video 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.810
 which op which classes find that the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:59.859
 Op are my opinion is made 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:03.609
 opera kay and robby are the ones 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:07.569
 classes that are currently the strongest 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:09.310
 though must leave you at majors though 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.799
 you can play it well with medi 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.169
 you have to play them relatively well 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:17.229
 to start something at all et et 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:18.579
 cetera everything is relatively good and the sit 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:23.620
 burst anyway but then you are real 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:27.549
 every one of the fis can make you die 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:33.239
 anyway hurt from hell and there 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:33.239
 my mobile phone vibrates whatsapp groups like that 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:39.209
 not in such a hurry 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:54.819
 the opponents to networks I should 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.459
 make maybe behind at all 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.640
 the opponents touch him to change 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.640
 to be able to 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:08.380
 oh man I realize that here with 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.700

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:16.720
 comes the deep freeze and roof is coming 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:22.870

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.270
 joke about which game it runs like on 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.820

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.750

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:04.819
 people hardly harm now if something 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:08.629
 would tip over 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:10.610
 but of course it could not be my luck 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:14.479
 of course and they have four bases and 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:19.520
 only people i can not come to any topic if 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:22.819
