00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.020 

Julie<00:00:01.890> you've<00:00:02.070> been<00:00:02.220> growing<00:00:02.490> hops<00:00:02.700> for<00:00:02.970> a

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
Julie you've been growing hops for a

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.820 
Julie you've been growing hops for a
while<00:00:03.210> here<00:00:03.540> now<00:00:03.720> would<00:00:03.929> I<00:00:03.990> go<00:00:04.140> view<00:00:04.319> farm<00:00:04.620> what

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
while here now would I go view farm what

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:05.749 
while here now would I go view farm what
are<00:00:04.920> some<00:00:05.040> of<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.160> lessons<00:00:05.400> you've<00:00:05.730> learned

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
are some of the lessons you've learned

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.200 
are some of the lessons you've learned
well<00:00:06.680> we've<00:00:07.680> learned<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:08.099> lot<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:08.670> guess<00:00:08.970> the

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
well we've learned a lot I guess the

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.900 
well we've learned a lot I guess the
biggest<00:00:09.690> lesson<00:00:10.200> we<00:00:10.320> learned<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.950> that<00:00:10.980> it

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
biggest lesson we learned is that it

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.610 
biggest lesson we learned is that it
just<00:00:12.179> takes<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.540> whole<00:00:12.719> lot<00:00:12.750> more<00:00:13.080> work<00:00:13.320> than

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
just takes a whole lot more work than

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.980 
just takes a whole lot more work than
what<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.429> thought<00:00:14.549> even<00:00:15.059> though<00:00:15.420> everyone<00:00:15.870> I

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
what I thought even though everyone I

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.560 
what I thought even though everyone I
talked<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.500> when<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:16.890> got<00:00:17.279> this<00:00:17.699> idea<00:00:17.910> told<00:00:18.420> me

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
talked to when I got this idea told me

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.710 
talked to when I got this idea told me
that<00:00:18.779> hops<00:00:19.050> are<00:00:19.260> really<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.560> lot<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.920> work<00:00:20.720> we've

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
that hops are really a lot of work we've

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.080 
that hops are really a lot of work we've
been<00:00:21.960> growing<00:00:22.439> them<00:00:22.769> long<00:00:23.279> enough<00:00:23.460> now<00:00:24.060> to

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
been growing them long enough now to

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.929 
been growing them long enough now to
know<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:25.050> certain<00:00:25.560> varieties<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.340> hops<00:00:26.580> will

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
know that certain varieties of hops will

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.089 
know that certain varieties of hops will
work<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.420> Western<00:00:27.869> North<00:00:27.900> Carolina<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:30.740> we<00:00:31.740> we

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
work in Western North Carolina and we we

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.220 
work in Western North Carolina and we we
don't<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.730> looks<00:00:32.940> like<00:00:33.030> they're<00:00:33.329> some<00:00:33.630> that

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
don't it looks like they're some that

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.020 
don't it looks like they're some that
are<00:00:34.350> just<00:00:34.710> not<00:00:34.890> going<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.160> work<00:00:35.219> for<00:00:35.370> us<00:00:35.730> and

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
are just not going to work for us and

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.290 
are just not going to work for us and
we'll<00:00:36.600> have<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:37.640> continue<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.820> experiment

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
we'll have to continue to experiment

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.860 
we'll have to continue to experiment
with<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:40.620> we've<00:00:41.460> tried<00:00:41.820> lots<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.450> ways<00:00:42.629> of

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
with that we've tried lots of ways of

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.869 
with that we've tried lots of ways of
keeping<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.350> weeds<00:00:43.530> down<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.430> we<00:00:44.670> think

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
keeping the weeds down and we think

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.459 
keeping the weeds down and we think
we've<00:00:45.149> learned<00:00:47.390> how<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.450> manage<00:00:48.899> those<00:00:49.140> better

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
we've learned how to manage those better

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.439 
we've learned how to manage those better
we<00:00:49.770> use<00:00:49.890> some<00:00:50.160> really<00:00:50.489> old<00:00:50.640> fashioned<00:00:51.180> things

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
we use some really old fashioned things

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.389 
we use some really old fashioned things
like<00:00:51.719> at<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.050> end<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.440> season<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:53.100> burn

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
like at the end of the season we burn

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.720 
like at the end of the season we burn
the<00:00:53.640> weeds<00:00:53.850> because<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:55.050> takes<00:00:55.260> care<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.730> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
the weeds because that takes care of the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.110 
the weeds because that takes care of the
weed<00:00:56.940> seeds<00:00:57.559> better<00:00:58.559> than<00:00:59.039> any<00:00:59.219> chemical<00:00:59.850> can

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
weed seeds better than any chemical can

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.020 
weed seeds better than any chemical can
and<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:01.050> also<00:01:01.260> puts<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.890> little<00:01:02.039> bit<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.550> stuff

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
and it also puts a little bit of stuff

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.750 
and it also puts a little bit of stuff
back<00:01:03.329> into<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.750> ground<00:01:03.989> not<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.260> whole<00:01:04.500> lot<00:01:04.760> but

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
back into the ground not a whole lot but

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.240 
back into the ground not a whole lot but
it<00:01:05.939> will<00:01:06.060> give<00:01:06.240> our<00:01:06.420> white<00:01:06.869> clover<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.439> better

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
it will give our white clover a better

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.120 
it will give our white clover a better
chance<00:01:08.990> next<00:01:09.990> spring<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:12.350> we'll<00:01:13.350> continue<00:01:13.650> to

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
chance next spring so we'll continue to

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.499 
chance next spring so we'll continue to
do<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.280> we're<00:01:14.790> working<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> new

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
do that we're working on a new

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.440 
do that we're working on a new
irrigation<00:01:15.869> system<00:01:16.650> because<00:01:17.270> every<00:01:18.270> year

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
irrigation system because every year

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.649 
irrigation system because every year
we've<00:01:18.630> grown<00:01:19.130> hops<00:01:20.130> here<00:01:20.460> even<00:01:21.299> though<00:01:21.450> this

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
we've grown hops here even though this

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.410 
we've grown hops here even though this
is<00:01:21.900> normally<00:01:22.740> an<00:01:23.549> area<00:01:23.939> where<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.150> have<00:01:24.330> to

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
is normally an area where you have to

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.940 
is normally an area where you have to
worry<00:01:24.600> about<00:01:24.689> too<00:01:25.020> much<00:01:25.170> rain<00:01:25.439> he<00:01:25.619> knew<00:01:25.770> and

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
worry about too much rain he knew and

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.899 
worry about too much rain he knew and
humidity<00:01:26.939> we<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.780> had<00:01:28.049> long<00:01:28.950> periods<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.700> no

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
humidity we have had long periods of no

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.450 
humidity we have had long periods of no
rain<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:31.049> we<00:01:31.079> know<00:01:31.409> we<00:01:31.590> need<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.860> put<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.310> an

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
rain so we know we need to put in an

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.130 
rain so we know we need to put in an
irrigation<00:01:32.939> system<00:01:33.119> as<00:01:33.659> well<00:01:34.070> but<00:01:35.119> we<00:01:36.140> we've

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
irrigation system as well but we we've

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.929 
irrigation system as well but we we've
just<00:01:37.470> learned<00:01:37.710> how<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.950> trim<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.400> hops<00:01:38.610> and

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
just learned how to trim the hops and

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.060 
just learned how to trim the hops and
all<00:01:39.119> kinds<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.659> things<00:01:39.780> we<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.409> totally

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
all kinds of things we have a totally

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.010 
all kinds of things we have a totally
different<00:01:41.430> trellising<00:01:41.970> system<00:01:42.390> now<00:01:42.570> than<00:01:42.840> we

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
different trellising system now than we

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.639 
different trellising system now than we
did<00:01:43.049> when<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.409> first<00:01:43.560> started<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:45.439> we've<00:01:46.439> also

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
did when we first started and we've also

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.999 
did when we first started and we've also
made<00:01:47.189> some<00:01:47.750> advances<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:49.020> making<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.649> actual

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
made some advances in making the actual

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.490 
made some advances in making the actual
harvesting<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.149> hops<00:01:51.329> safer<00:01:51.899> we<00:01:52.049> think<00:01:52.320> we

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
harvesting of the hops safer we think we

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.469 
harvesting of the hops safer we think we
used<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.829> get<00:01:53.130> up<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.460> ladder<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.880> climb<00:01:54.270> up

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
used to get up on a ladder and climb up

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.730 
used to get up on a ladder and climb up
to<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.689> hops<00:01:54.960> we<00:01:55.290> now<00:01:55.470> have<00:01:56.479> a<00:01:57.479> wire<00:01:58.380> at<00:01:58.680> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
to the hops we now have a wire at the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.160 
to the hops we now have a wire at the
top<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.070> our<00:01:59.369> trellises<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.210> we<00:02:00.329> let<00:02:00.540> down<00:02:00.570> so

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
top of our trellises that we let down so

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.060 
top of our trellises that we let down so
that<00:02:01.200> we<00:02:01.680> can<00:02:01.979> pick<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:03.320> hot<00:02:04.320> combs<00:02:04.680> while

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
that we can pick the hot combs while

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.880 
that we can pick the hot combs while
we're<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.490> ground

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
we're on the ground

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.730 
we're on the ground
so<00:02:06.610> when<00:02:07.150> I'm<00:02:07.659> sure<00:02:07.990> each<00:02:08.170> year<00:02:08.440> we'll<00:02:08.649> learn

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
so when I'm sure each year we'll learn

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.090 
so when I'm sure each year we'll learn
more<00:02:08.800> and<00:02:10.290> next<00:02:11.290> year<00:02:11.470> we're<00:02:11.620> looking<00:02:11.860> forward

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
more and next year we're looking forward

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.600 
more and next year we're looking forward
to<00:02:12.280> trying<00:02:12.610> some<00:02:12.940> new<00:02:12.970> varieties
