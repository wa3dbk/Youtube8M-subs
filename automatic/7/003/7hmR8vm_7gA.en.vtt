00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.360
 attention the images that will follow 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.520
 can hurt sensitive people 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.400
 want to ward off infants 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.589
 cardiac people ohl 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.609
 and that she's his friends ie 360 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:27.460
 we find ourselves today for a 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.899
 little video to tell you about a fake 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.029
 new info end not news 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:34.180
 but in any case family photos 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.920
 kill the torre 15 so I'm coming home from 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.970
 job just now I discovered on 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.870
 twitter that just had 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.980
 new photos that appeared 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.430
 on the official site of farming 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.079
 simulator 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.979
 so I was seeing here are the four 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.750
 new photos I'm going to 

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:45.430
 present and test detail briefly 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.409
 good I'm trying to make it quick by a 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.489
 short way because I do not think so 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:53.350
 I will be more like the most expert here 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.879
 in there but well so I start 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.939
 directly so it's with this picture 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.820
 if reached 91.8 with a nice big 

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:02.439
 so I think at the tractor level 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.239
 we can see that there are ideas from 

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:06.400
 effects of details that have been improved 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.130
 compared to the old farming version 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.380
 senators so we can see that the 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.210
 details it's about the tires of the 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.030
 legs bolts on the people who have 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.799
 summer was reworked see at I 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.630
 think that the grille also of the famous 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.570
 no it's not with a handicap skin of 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.590
 tractor was well worked too so 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.020
 we can also look at the level of 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.690
 details on the chassis there is still 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.090
 had efforts that we can not deny 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.590
 also to note that it is of course the thing 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.750
 is flagrant elsewhere it's at the level 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.820
 light and color effects 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.200
 must have been improved compared 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.100
 to 2000 signatures braids end 2013 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.630
 what can I linger too 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.000
 where we can see on the designs of 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.520
 tires from the ba of the dumpster we see when 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.260
 same as it is they rejected like 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.650
 the elected at their limits I think we 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.660
 can say it I think the 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.270
 the dumpster in question I think that's 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.070
 a new model 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.840
 simply because I knew here 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.460
 it is a bucket not with a jack 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.220
 to which stand up but here it is a 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.230
 carpet so this is a new model I 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.080
 think maybe we can also note if 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.490
 we look on top of the on 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.310
 the roof so tractor I think it 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.450
 y enough to own annual gps system 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.870
 year that was installed is what there is 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.020
 will have a feature in the game in 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.970
 report hopefully hope of the month I 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.320
 think that at the level of the good limoges I 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.600
 think there is nothing else to say I 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.240
 will pass the next picture so here we 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.980
 sees four newland tractors so there are 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.900
 a theme of which I speak beyond the left 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.820
 right up there we first have a tea 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.920
 9 when i will answer will see later 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.310
 there are two feet and 8 and to finish 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.690
 a t5 so 500 general a + the most 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.970
 small range c the least powerful so 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.410
 in my opinion and up to 120 horses I 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.800
 think a good I do not advance figures 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.450
 officials 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.900
 of course they were eight so that's 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.470
 in the ranges of 250 to 350 horses and 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.550
 the t9 good this is in the 400 I think 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.350
 we can also note we cover a 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.510
 forest in the lot what is still a 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.890
 reminder about the forestry equipment and we 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.150
 in the middle so the two machines jones 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.750
 and machines because I already have 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.630
 spoken in the teaser ensures my video on 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.820
 the teasers so of if one has a 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:16.200
 feller and nuts and pick up at the 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.410
 calais ronda I did not give the term 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.640
 exact but it does not matter 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.590
 in the photo I think there is not big 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.420
 thing whose textures look good that 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.739
 I think I may have been 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.260
 reworked compared to v6 method 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.209
 farming simulator 2013 but do not know 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.730
 no more on me let's go to the picture 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.100
 next so here is the famous t9 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.540
 that I was talking to you just before so 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.299
 see us again here that the 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.519
 the wheels and the level of detail on the 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.720
 tractor has been improved anyway 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.799
 is a job compared to others 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.130
 actors that we had two passes in the 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.660
 novelty game for whom it is confirmed 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.980
 the wheels that get dirty and the 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.420
 tractor that gets dirty we can see on 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.049
 the bar at the front of the tractor the bar 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.800
 and the rooms 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.030
 the tires are dirty 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.130
 I find that there is a job that was 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.450
 also at the path level the path is 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.450
 still no longer work there is 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.489
 more texture there are more colors 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.020
 the barley seeder behind it is a 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.239
 material and material that I think is 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.530
 unpublished because there was not finally 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.790
 less in the basic game it's not there 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.959
 and on time these people I am 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.950
 passionate I do not think I have already 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:16.570
 seen by cons machine that is that which 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.280
 was in the dlc who was in a dlc 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.200
 so so titanium pack I think it's 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.400
 the harvest of ska behind I think 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.680
 that there is besides and a comment there 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.090
 it in in one of my videos 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.840
 farming simulator kalinski ask me 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.850
 yes this is that there would be 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.290
 scalde harvesters I do yes I 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.080
 suppose rooms will definitely be more 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:35.440
 go up and here they are so we can see 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.330
 here in the background we see deciles 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.460
 stormy at the two silos of seal or 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.660
 at least two grain silos can be seen 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.419
 forests again but what 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.000
 it sucks me more decor is not at 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.260
 I 'm not going to dwell on it 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.990
 think that on this image there is little 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.590
 near last picture I heard 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.229
 it's the last 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:57.820
 so this is once again the du 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:05:03.820
 material box so a harvester and a 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:05.590
 trailer and we can also see at the level 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.850
 light effects that it was 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.760
 improved we go reflections on 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.310
 tires and on the chassis there my daughter and 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.500
 me and in the background we can see 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.030
 that there is a farm with the equipment 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.000
 who was already present in twenty thousand 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.669
 simulator 13 13 so the surroundings of the 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.419
 feeders accuse him go for the 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.479
 milking machine 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.530
 we see some farm buildings 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.070
 but I will not be saying much more 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.080
 details 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.280
 good at the field level if we analyze 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.900
 we see that it is a little hilly 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.930
 certainly we see that it is ground 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.430
 nordic them I think that's pretty much 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.990
 close everything so we'll try to do 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.539
 a pretty short video here I think that 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.370
 that's about all so that is to say 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:44.050
 360 I tell you next time for a 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.220
 next video is hard to wear 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.220
 you well hi hi 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.600
 me
