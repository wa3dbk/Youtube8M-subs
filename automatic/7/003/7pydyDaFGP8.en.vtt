 religious and electronic music and that makes a real 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.569
 cardboard in 1991 but the character remains to come 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:15.859
 the engineer in fact it's huge what happened it's amazing what 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:17.289
 something that can not even be imagined 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.289
 that's what i tell them asia what i mean 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.849
 it was done in 15 minutes 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.849
 put yourself in their shoes 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.800
 I thought I was in the top 50 of all of Christendom and even 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.620
 beyond that we speak only of his Gregorian chants the fountain 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.570
 you remember 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.470
 in 1991 benhima of number one apple in this country the icon 14 million of his 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.510
 first album dubbed mcnn fixed to degrade in speaks it's in figures 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.510
 Roman 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.730
 surprise the success of a brand is not quite 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.570
 behind this erotic project hides a maker of him 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.980
 already well known to the European public some mickaël crépeau this individual 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.880
 strange that boast of being the most listened Romanian musician in the world 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.620
 thanks to the one that has been singing since the mid-80s to the city 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.620
 that's for sure but j times at the scene it's just sandra 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.400
 and yes it's nickel creates everything but for the matou begins at the end 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.180
 80s sandra's popularity is going on a bit and mikel to avoid a 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.000
 new project 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.870
 this time it is about burning the places of memory and to simmer a 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.440
 unpublished recipe 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.440
 no stars put forward next week strange 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.470
 and inside the booklet we vote 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.940
 non-defects 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.810
 look at it is ironic even though this forecast at 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.740
 background music card and for that nothing better than a music of inspiration 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.840
 religious benhima fertilizer that means disney 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.610
 musically the climate cocktail it's a dancing rhythm of pretty tablecloths 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.609
 synths an exotic touch with this Peruvian flute 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:28.730
 and the famous Gregorian chant to the fact that she all apply them in a 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:30.439
 German religious choir 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.439
 a trial that wins but it's true that it's theft demonstration 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:41.499
 she now knows the original of the cup dominique challenge 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:46.339
 little damage 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:48.970
 it's the same thing 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.500
 following this case in any case any purchase on anonymity everyone knows 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.610
 that mickaël Cretan head and mid-market guess that it's also about 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.729
 on the record in French it's for now without drama 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:00.999
 here in one of his movies 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:03.369
 very bright in December at six banks but only to accelerate 

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:04.779
 in 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:08.209
 on arrival the song samuel denis made me big noise razak or the 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.419
 music because of the text 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:12.609
 inspired by the writings of the Marquis de Sade the most pollution author of the 18th 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:13.389
 century 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:16.389
 it must be put in jail 

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:24.089
 in other words elima uses religious music to be sulphurous 

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:27.519
 trend largely confirmed on another excerpt from the first album but a 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.519
 comfort 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:44.959
 it goes far enough and it's obviously his relationship with the real 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.369
 Gregorian chant is in montreal 

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:49.020
 I can not do anything anymore 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.899
 Trial of the end of the trial 

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:53.899
 this is not the mule variety of the liturgy 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.949
 worship 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.929
 so it's very different 

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:04.389
 but what is certain is that it is at the exit of the first minor marg3 11 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:06.839
 the general public also get bought in mass of music discs 

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:07.869
 religious 

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:11.169
 only three modern musicians interest rate who does he have so juicy in 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:13.799
 the Gregorian vein 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:14.880
 other countries in the eu 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.809
 universal pictures 

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:20.749
 anyone in the world can understand I can nothing more than at big 

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:21.969
 public m 

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:25.129
 but also I think we must not forget it because it is rare 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.809
 a spiritual density site 

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:31.769
 and if so it is possible the event despite its success it does not miss 

00:04:31.769 --> 00:04:35.219
 to stir up fashion soon after the release of his mother intruders resume at the 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:36.870
 letter the musical recipe 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.990
 listen to the flute 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.639
 this time it's not to talk about sex but to stigmatize the synthesis 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.639
 power of the hidden son 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:49.360
 4 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.099
 sign of the times the charter 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.599
 in reverse the music of the minima also inspired disciples 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:59.819
 we will see for example 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.000
 you probably remember this theme that served as his band's profile 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 low 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.380
 as for riddles despite the waves that are idling it's still a 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.279
 rolling case 

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:18.499
 already four albums on the counter for mickaël always creates the evening a little 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:21.680
 evolved after the Gregorian he appropriated some music of the world 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:25.349
 here the indian people 

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:32.999
 good it has still been worth to him for lawsuit for plagiarism the routine what 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:36.669
 but he keeps on course judge the unima number 5 which is being 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.879
 recording in the qg of the weird master 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:40.960
 he leaves at the beginning of 2003 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.700
 she is not beautiful life
