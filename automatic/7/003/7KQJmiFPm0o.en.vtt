00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
hi guys this is bacon smoothie and this

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.470 
hi guys this is bacon smoothie and this
is<00:00:04.080> my<00:00:04.230> first<00:00:04.529> minecraft<00:00:04.770> video<00:00:05.100> I'm<00:00:06.089> going<00:00:06.390> to

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
is my first minecraft video I'm going to

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.910 
is my first minecraft video I'm going to
be<00:00:06.569> showing<00:00:07.049> you<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:07.710> compact<00:00:08.490> piston<00:00:09.300> elevator

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 
be showing you a compact piston elevator

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.709 
be showing you a compact piston elevator
designed<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.190> built<00:00:11.340> in<00:00:12.380> SMP<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:14.480> design<00:00:15.480> for

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
designed and built in SMP and design for

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:25.430 
designed and built in SMP and design for
SMP<00:00:16.400> let's<00:00:17.400> have<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:17.699> give<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.270> go

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.440 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.010 

and<00:00:26.440> that's<00:00:26.620> it<00:00:26.830> and<00:00:27.340> when<00:00:28.090> you're<00:00:28.210> done<00:00:28.360> up

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
and that's it and when you're done up

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:36.680 
and that's it and when you're done up
here<00:00:29.080> you<00:00:29.530> can<00:00:29.560> just<00:00:29.860> drop<00:00:30.040> down<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:34.000> this<00:00:34.540> is<00:00:34.750> a

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
here you can just drop down so this is a

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.080 
here you can just drop down so this is a
six<00:00:37.690> by<00:00:37.870> six<00:00:37.930> elevator<00:00:38.680> if<00:00:39.430> you<00:00:39.580> wanted<00:00:39.820> to<00:00:39.910> put

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
six by six elevator if you wanted to put

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.320 
six by six elevator if you wanted to put
a<00:00:40.360> wall<00:00:41.050> around<00:00:41.080> the<00:00:41.530> outside<00:00:41.920> be<00:00:42.250> eight<00:00:43.090> by

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
a wall around the outside be eight by

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.460 
a wall around the outside be eight by
seven<00:00:43.750> so<00:00:44.650> the<00:00:44.830> glass<00:00:45.070> so<00:00:45.850> it's<00:00:45.970> based<00:00:46.180> off

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
seven so the glass so it's based off

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.100 
seven so the glass so it's based off
browse<00:00:47.470> of<00:00:47.739> Steel's<00:00:48.040> design<00:00:48.550> and<00:00:49.360> with<00:00:49.900> a<00:00:49.930> few

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
browse of Steel's design and with a few

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.600 
browse of Steel's design and with a few
modifications<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.640> I<00:00:51.670> wanted<00:00:51.910> to<00:00:52.030> have<00:00:52.239> a

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
modifications so I wanted to have a

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.770 
modifications so I wanted to have a
emphasis<00:00:54.610> on<00:00:54.870> safety<00:00:55.870> which<00:00:56.530> is<00:00:56.680> what<00:00:56.830> this

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
emphasis on safety which is what this

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.190 
emphasis on safety which is what this
water<00:00:58.780> drops<00:00:59.170> for<00:00:59.440> so<00:01:00.220> if<00:01:00.400> you<00:01:01.200> college

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
water drops for so if you college

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.620 
water drops for so if you college
through<00:01:02.620> the<00:01:03.059> systems<00:01:04.059> for<00:01:04.119> any<00:01:04.270> reason

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:04.630 
through the systems for any reason

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.880 
through the systems for any reason
she'll<00:01:05.440> safely<00:01:05.860> back<00:01:06.009> into<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:06.369> water<00:01:07.890> this

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
she'll safely back into the water this

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.490 
she'll safely back into the water this
happens<00:01:09.250> a<00:01:09.610> fair<00:01:10.450> bit<00:01:10.660> in<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:12.070> S&amp;P<00:01:12.190> I<00:01:12.490> found

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
happens a fair bit in the S&amp;P I found

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.150 
happens a fair bit in the S&amp;P I found
and<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:16.420> other<00:01:16.690> thing<00:01:16.990> I've<00:01:17.619> done<00:01:17.649> there<00:01:17.979> is

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
and the other thing I've done there is

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.510 
and the other thing I've done there is
kind<00:01:18.640> of<00:01:18.759> slow<00:01:19.090> it<00:01:19.300> down<00:01:19.330> a<00:01:19.509> bit<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.710> this

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
kind of slow it down a bit so this

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.300 
kind of slow it down a bit so this
designs<00:01:21.910> got<00:01:22.240> two<00:01:23.670> rails<00:01:24.670> in<00:01:25.540> wood<00:01:26.160> on<00:01:27.160> either

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
designs got two rails in wood on either

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.240 
designs got two rails in wood on either
side<00:01:27.670> instead<00:01:28.420> of<00:01:28.570> a<00:01:29.009> sort<00:01:30.009> of<00:01:30.039> more

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
side instead of a sort of more

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.090 
side instead of a sort of more
convoluted<00:01:30.610> rail<00:01:31.119> at<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:31.780> back<00:01:32.020> as<00:01:32.770> in<00:01:33.039> the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
convoluted rail at the back as in the

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.880 
convoluted rail at the back as in the
original<00:01:33.190> design<00:01:33.700> and<00:01:34.050> n<00:01:35.050> each<00:01:35.200> one's<00:01:35.530> got<00:01:35.740> a

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
original design and n each one's got a

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.760 
original design and n each one's got a
repeater<00:01:36.340> set<00:01:36.640> on<00:01:36.729> max<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:38.020> if<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.289> want<00:01:38.500> it<00:01:38.590> to

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
repeater set on max so if you want it to

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.190 
repeater set on max so if you want it to
go<00:01:39.009> a<00:01:39.039> bit<00:01:39.220> faster<00:01:39.670> you<00:01:39.819> could<00:01:40.030> set<00:01:40.840> these<00:01:40.990> to<00:01:41.170> a

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
go a bit faster you could set these to a

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.779 
go a bit faster you could set these to a
lower<00:01:41.410> setting<00:01:42.360> all<00:01:43.360> over<00:01:43.810> and<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:45.340> should

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
lower setting all over and it should

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.760 
lower setting all over and it should
work<00:01:46.360> correctly<00:01:46.840> you<00:01:47.200> might<00:01:47.350> need<00:01:47.440> to<00:01:47.500> tweak

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
work correctly you might need to tweak

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.490 
work correctly you might need to tweak
it<00:01:47.920> and<00:01:51.300> so<00:01:52.300> it's<00:01:52.600> pressure<00:01:53.050> plate<00:01:53.319> activated

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
it and so it's pressure plate activated

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.380 
it and so it's pressure plate activated
and<00:01:55.530> then<00:01:56.530> that<00:01:56.679> signal<00:01:57.220> is<00:01:57.429> just<00:01:57.789> extend<00:01:58.209> it<00:01:58.330> a

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
and then that signal is just extend it a

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.490 
and then that signal is just extend it a
bit<00:01:58.509> here<00:01:59.190> delayed<00:02:00.190> a<00:02:00.220> bit<00:02:00.340> and<00:02:00.640> then<00:02:01.209> fed<00:02:01.569> to

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
bit here delayed a bit and then fed to

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.999 
bit here delayed a bit and then fed to
each<00:02:02.649> rail<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:04.170> another<00:02:05.170> modification<00:02:05.530> I<00:02:05.890> had

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
each rail and another modification I had

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.480 
each rail and another modification I had
to<00:02:06.100> make<00:02:06.479> from<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.569> original<00:02:07.869> design<00:02:08.140> is<00:02:08.490> the

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
to make from the original design is the

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.910 
to make from the original design is the
original<00:02:09.819> design<00:02:10.149> sends<00:02:10.869> let's<00:02:11.590> just<00:02:11.740> jump

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
original design sends let's just jump

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.630 
original design sends let's just jump
over<00:02:12.010> here<00:02:12.420> sends<00:02:13.420> these<00:02:13.690> two<00:02:14.530> signals<00:02:14.770> sort

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
over here sends these two signals sort

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.600 
over here sends these two signals sort
of<00:02:15.760> lengthways<00:02:16.890> through<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.010> elevator<00:02:18.310> at

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
of lengthways through the elevator at

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.600 
of lengthways through the elevator at
the<00:02:19.870> first<00:02:20.870> piston<00:02:21.320> and<00:02:21.530> then<00:02:22.130> powers<00:02:22.400> this

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
the first piston and then powers this

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.520 
the first piston and then powers this
block<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:23.180> this<00:02:23.330> power<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.840> second<00:02:24.200> piston

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
block to this power the second piston

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.690 
block to this power the second piston
and<00:02:24.850> I<00:02:25.850> couldn't<00:02:26.360> actually<00:02:26.540> fit<00:02:26.930> that<00:02:27.380> in<00:02:27.700> with

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
and I couldn't actually fit that in with

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.540 
and I couldn't actually fit that in with
the<00:02:28.730> power<00:02:29.030> rail<00:02:29.270> so<00:02:29.510> I<00:02:29.570> had<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.690> make<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:30.550> second

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
the power rail so I had to make a second

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.430 
the power rail so I had to make a second
configuration<00:02:31.940> where<00:02:32.630> it<00:02:32.690> sends<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.080> signal

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
configuration where it sends the signal

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.630 
configuration where it sends the signal
sideways<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:35.500> basically<00:02:36.500> as<00:02:36.710> the<00:02:36.950> as<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.520> goes

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
sideways and basically as the as it goes

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.190 
sideways and basically as the as it goes
up<00:02:37.670> it<00:02:37.970> alternates<00:02:38.420> between<00:02:38.510> these<00:02:38.930> two

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
up it alternates between these two

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.270 
up it alternates between these two
patterns<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:41.710> that's<00:02:42.710> more<00:02:42.890> or<00:02:42.950> less<00:02:43.010> how<00:02:43.220> it

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
patterns and that's more or less how it

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.180 
patterns and that's more or less how it
works<00:02:43.490> and<00:02:43.900> I<00:02:44.900> can<00:02:45.230> make<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.440> tutorial<00:02:45.890> if
