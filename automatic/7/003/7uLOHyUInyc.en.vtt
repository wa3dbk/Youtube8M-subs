alternatives need to be developed is

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.710 
alternatives need to be developed is
it's<00:03:15.259> still<00:03:15.620> a<00:03:15.919> very<00:03:16.310> very<00:03:16.669> dicey<00:03:16.939> situation

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
it's still a very very dicey situation

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.990 
it's still a very very dicey situation
for<00:03:17.930> those<00:03:18.049> animals<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:18.709> could<00:03:19.040> still<00:03:19.729> mean

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
for those animals it could still mean

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.429 
for those animals it could still mean
that<00:03:20.209> millions<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:20.870> millions<00:03:20.900> of<00:03:21.259> animals

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:21.439 
that millions and millions of animals

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.939 
that millions and millions of animals
suffer<00:03:22.009> and<00:03:22.129> die<00:03:22.189> in<00:03:22.340> these<00:03:23.560> toxicity<00:03:24.560> tests

suffer and die in these toxicity tests

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:27.670 
suffer and die in these toxicity tests
but<00:03:25.310> I<00:03:25.459> am<00:03:25.849> more<00:03:26.239> optimistic<00:03:26.299> now<00:03:27.169> now<00:03:27.620> that

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
but I am more optimistic now now that
