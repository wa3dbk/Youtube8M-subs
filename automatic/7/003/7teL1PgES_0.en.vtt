00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.730
 Do you know the source of the video? 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.790
 for those who thought that ninjutsu existed 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.510
 only in the universe of naruto are well 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.849
 cheated 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.730
 it does exist and it deals with a set 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.770
 of espionage tactics and murders 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.960
 practiced by masked warriors 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.290
 experts in fraudulent tricks 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.020
 called shinobi better known as 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.840
 the ninjas or if it is a technique of 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.940
 espionage une jutsu was secret and is 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.010
 difficult to accurately state its 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.800
 origin but believes that it has 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.990
 emerged in the reign of the emperor 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.870
 spread throughout Japan during the 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.690
 period known as sengoku dated 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.910
 between the 15th and 16th centuries at this time 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.259
 due to the constant civil wars that 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.720
 they took place in the country 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:09.119
 ninjas techniques began to be adopted 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.640
 by families who inhabited the mountains 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.100
 in the center of the largest island of honshu 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.590
 japan the old ninjas develop the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.600
 their techniques by necessity due to 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.659
 great pressure in the place where 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.060
 lived especially in china and japan 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.310
 formerly tradition was transmitted 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.499
 from parents to children and so 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.689
 considered the family and not a school 

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:33.479
 since early the members of a family 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.369
 ninja began his training and how 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.319
 were warriors of the shadows had to 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.310
 learn to move around without being 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.710
 perceived 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.810
 I also learned to use a variety of 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.649
 very useful arsenals in their 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.929
 missions 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.819
 I think those who, for example, are better known 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.880
 by ninja stars is one of the most 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:52.499
 popular melee techniques 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.569
 known as Tajo were also 

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:56.999
 seized by making the ninjas the 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.159
 more complex warriors that existed 

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:01.289
 not limited to only one type of 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.240
 with the samurai who is one of the 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.159
 greatest enemies of the media 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.929
 because they helped to maintain the 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.360
 power of the feudal lords 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.250
 despite this, it was common for media 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.700
 were hired by a feudal lord 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.890
 to kill rivals without arousing suspicion 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.860
 and this is how these warriors of the 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.860
 shadows survived for many years
