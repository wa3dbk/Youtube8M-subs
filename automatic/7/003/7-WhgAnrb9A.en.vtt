this for very long and I shot it all
very<00:00:32.579> quickly<00:00:32.820> because<00:00:32.969> I'm<00:00:33.180> juggling<00:00:33.420> about

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
very quickly because I'm juggling about

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.910 
very quickly because I'm juggling about
a<00:00:33.750> million<00:00:34.140> different<00:00:34.230> projects<00:00:34.739> right<00:00:34.829> now

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
a million different projects right now

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.670 
a million different projects right now
but<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.460> did<00:00:36.090> notice<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.780> landing<00:00:37.469> gear

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
but I did notice that the landing gear

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.750 
but I did notice that the landing gear
from<00:00:37.890> time<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.190> time<00:00:38.219> would<00:00:38.520> just<00:00:38.640> disappear

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
from time to time would just disappear

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.060 
from time to time would just disappear
almost<00:00:39.360> like<00:00:39.570> clockwork<00:00:40.350> for<00:00:40.559> periods<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.920> 10

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
almost like clockwork for periods of 10

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.220 
almost like clockwork for periods of 10
to<00:00:41.160> 20<00:00:41.430> seconds<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.120> would<00:00:42.270> just<00:00:42.300> go<00:00:42.420> away<00:00:42.510> it's

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
to 20 seconds it would just go away it's

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.290 
to 20 seconds it would just go away it's
actually<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.920> guess<00:00:44.460> on<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.670> larger<00:00:44.969> scale<00:00:45.120> not

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
actually I guess on a larger scale not

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.479 
actually I guess on a larger scale not
that<00:00:45.480> horrible<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.989> bug<00:00:46.170> but<00:00:46.489> obviously

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
that horrible of a bug but obviously

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.770 
that horrible of a bug but obviously
something<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.879> needs<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.149> be<00:00:48.239> patched<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
something that needs to be patched the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.930 
something that needs to be patched the
virtual<00:00:49.140> cockpit<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.890> as<00:00:50.160> always<00:00:50.489> very<00:00:50.730> nice

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940
