Costa depending so we're doing LSD ahi
many<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.019> coastal<00:02:10.349> rivers<00:02:10.619> especially<00:02:11.370> in

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
many of the coastal rivers especially in

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.100 
many of the coastal rivers especially in
the<00:02:11.519> dry<00:02:11.700> season<00:02:11.730> depend<00:02:12.540> on<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.690> water<00:02:12.930> that

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
the dry season depend on a water that

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.479 
the dry season depend on a water that
comes<00:02:13.290> from<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.650> melting<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.280> glaciers

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
comes from the melting of the glaciers

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.570 
comes from the melting of the glaciers
and<00:02:15.030> these<00:02:15.629> will<00:02:15.780> disappear<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:17.220> flow<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.459> the

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
and these will disappear the flow of the

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.100 
and these will disappear the flow of the
water<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.060> dry<00:02:18.239> season<00:02:18.480> from<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.810> rivers

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
water and the dry season from the rivers

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.160 
water and the dry season from the rivers
is<00:02:19.440> going<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:19.950> be<00:02:20.069> much<00:02:20.250> lower<00:02:20.489> if<00:02:21.299> not<00:02:21.540> zero<00:02:21.900> in

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
is going to be much lower if not zero in

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.740 
is going to be much lower if not zero in
many<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.830> valleys<00:02:23.099> in<00:02:23.220> Peru<00:02:23.459> sale<00:02:24.239> in

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
many of the valleys in Peru sale in

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.380 
many of the valleys in Peru sale in
which<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.230> little<00:02:25.470> values<00:02:25.739> in<00:02:25.890> 30<00:02:26.390> scientists

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
which a little values in 30 scientists

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.479 
which a little values in 30 scientists
believe<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.019> Andean<00:02:28.470> glaciers<00:02:29.040> have<00:02:29.220> reached

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
believe the Andean glaciers have reached

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.210 
believe the Andean glaciers have reached
a<00:02:29.700> tipping<00:02:29.879> point<00:02:30.140> they<00:02:31.140> say<00:02:31.410> reversing<00:02:32.099> the

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
a tipping point they say reversing the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.759 
a tipping point they say reversing the
thaw<00:02:32.459> is<00:02:32.700> an<00:02:32.849> unrealistic<00:02:33.360> prospect<00:02:34.079> the

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
thaw is an unrealistic prospect the

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.280 
thaw is an unrealistic prospect the
question<00:02:35.310> then<00:02:35.459> are<00:02:35.670> asking<00:02:36.150> is<00:02:36.329> how<00:02:36.989> can

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
question then are asking is how can

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.860 
question then are asking is how can
communities<00:02:37.829> successfully<00:02:38.610> adapt<00:02:39.000> as<00:02:39.269> their

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
communities successfully adapt as their

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.670 
communities successfully adapt as their
main<00:02:40.079> source<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.650> water<00:02:40.890> melts<00:02:41.519> away
