of<00:00:11.820> Napa<00:00:12.030> Valley<00:00:12.330> we've<00:00:13.320> worked<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.679> lot<00:00:13.710> with

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
of Napa Valley we've worked a lot with

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.129 
of Napa Valley we've worked a lot with
both<00:00:14.280> ground<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.849> aerial<00:00:15.120> spraying<00:00:15.630> in<00:00:16.020> the

both ground and aerial spraying in the

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.760 
both ground and aerial spraying in the
past<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.940> this<00:00:17.940> was<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.720> spray<00:00:19.170> application

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
past and this was a spray application

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.679 
past and this was a spray application
obviously<00:00:20.430> an<00:00:20.789> area<00:00:20.910> where<00:00:21.240> we<00:00:21.330> have<00:00:21.480> some

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
obviously an area where we have some

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.050 
obviously an area where we have some
expertise<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:23.070> was<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> vehicle<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.789> we

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
expertise and it was a vehicle that we

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.429 
expertise and it was a vehicle that we
were<00:00:24.180> very<00:00:24.330> interested<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:25.080> was<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.230> new

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
were very interested in it was a new

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.900 
were very interested in it was a new
vehicle<00:00:25.650> we<00:00:26.550> we<00:00:27.420> understood<00:00:27.949> traditional<00:00:28.949> AG

aviation<00:00:30.570> aerial<00:00:31.080> spraying<00:00:31.439> or<00:00:31.740> what<00:00:32.070> we<00:00:32.130> used

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
aviation aerial spraying or what we used

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.700 
aviation aerial spraying or what we used
to<00:00:32.369> call<00:00:32.520> crop<00:00:32.790> dusting<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:34.530> looked

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
to call crop dusting and this looked

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.799 
to call crop dusting and this looked
like<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.920> new<00:00:35.520> technology<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.210> would<00:00:36.480> fit<00:00:36.690> in

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
like a new technology that would fit in

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.760 
like a new technology that would fit in
with<00:00:37.129> the<00:00:38.129> old<00:00:38.250> crop<00:00:38.520> dusting<00:00:38.969> approach<00:00:39.930> okay

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
with the old crop dusting approach okay

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.240 
with the old crop dusting approach okay
in<00:00:41.010> Japan<00:00:41.399> there<00:00:41.910> are<00:00:42.030> 2,500<00:00:43.020> marmax<00:00:44.010> in

in Japan there are 2,500 marmax in

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.209 
in Japan there are 2,500 marmax in
operation<00:00:44.879> they're<00:00:45.420> used<00:00:45.750> primarily<00:00:46.050> for<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
operation they're used primarily for the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.290 
operation they're used primarily for the

well<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.559> look<00:00:55.770> at<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.489> questions<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.480> we

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
well we look at the questions that we

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.410 
well we look at the questions that we
ask<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.500> our<00:00:58.739> research<00:00:59.100> are<00:00:59.489> really<00:00:59.969> questions

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
ask in our research are really questions

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.979 
ask in our research are really questions
a<00:01:00.899> grower<00:01:01.260> or<00:01:01.410> potential<00:01:02.190> user<00:01:02.430> would<00:01:03.180> ask<00:01:03.390> how

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
a grower or potential user would ask how

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.440 
a grower or potential user would ask how
well<00:01:04.229> does<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.439> work<00:01:04.559> as<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.460> spray<00:01:05.909> application

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
well does it work as a spray application

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.840 
well does it work as a spray application
technique<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.080> how<00:01:07.229> efficient<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.850> how

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
technique and how efficient is it how

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.609 
technique and how efficient is it how
does<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.119> compare<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.510> ground<00:01:09.930> or<00:01:10.229> aerial

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
does it compare to ground or aerial

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.039 
does it compare to ground or aerial
vehicles<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.939> right<00:01:12.390> now<00:01:12.570> we're<00:01:12.840> measuring

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
vehicles so right now we're measuring

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.440 
vehicles so right now we're measuring
the<00:01:13.409> spray<00:01:13.619> deposition<00:01:14.250> from<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.210> sprayer

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the spray deposition from the sprayer

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.380 
the spray deposition from the sprayer
itself<00:01:16.009> just<00:01:17.009> as<00:01:17.189> though<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.790> was<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.090> new

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
itself just as though it was a new

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.460 
itself just as though it was a new
sprayer<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:19.369> wasn't<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.549> new<00:01:20.820> vehicle<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
sprayer that wasn't a new vehicle so the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.050 
sprayer that wasn't a new vehicle so the
same<00:01:22.680> techniques<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:23.490> would<00:01:23.640> use<00:01:23.850> as

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
same techniques that we would use as

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.670 
same techniques that we would use as
someone<00:01:24.360> had<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> new<00:01:24.750> tractor<00:01:25.049> base<00:01:25.350> sprayer

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
someone had a new tractor base sprayer

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.580 
someone had a new tractor base sprayer

unmanned<00:02:03.210> aircraft<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.710> we<00:02:05.159> have

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
unmanned aircraft and so we have

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.330 
unmanned aircraft and so we have
permission<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.119> fly<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.540> certain<00:02:06.869> areas

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
permission to fly in certain areas

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.100 
permission to fly in certain areas
operate<00:02:08.340> in<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.580> certain<00:02:08.729> way<00:02:09.030> daylight<00:02:09.750> hours

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
operate in a certain way daylight hours

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.360 
operate in a certain way daylight hours
to<00:02:10.800> operators

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
to operators

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.039 
to operators
and<00:02:12.430> I<00:02:12.640> are<00:02:12.760> both<00:02:12.909> commercial<00:02:13.420> pilots<00:02:13.810> were

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
and I are both commercial pilots were

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.490 
and I are both commercial pilots were
trained<00:02:14.349> were<00:02:14.650> licensed<00:02:15.220> we<00:02:16.060> also<00:02:16.510> notify<00:02:17.440> the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
trained were licensed we also notify the

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.910 
trained were licensed we also notify the
FAA<00:02:18.010> ever<00:02:18.640> before<00:02:19.060> every<00:02:19.269> flight<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:20.200> we<00:02:20.709> tell

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
FAA ever before every flight and we tell

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.009 
FAA ever before every flight and we tell
them<00:02:21.069> when<00:02:21.220> we're<00:02:21.370> done<00:02:21.459> flying<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:22.659> those<00:02:22.840> are

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
them when we're done flying so those are

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.420 
them when we're done flying so those are
some<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.319> conditions<00:02:23.620> that<00:02:23.950> we<00:02:24.129> have<00:02:24.280> for

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
some of the conditions that we have for

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.270 
some of the conditions that we have for
our<00:02:24.519> operations<00:02:25.030> well<00:02:25.810> as<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.260> citizen<00:02:26.799> I<00:02:26.920> share

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
our operations well as a citizen I share

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.220 
our operations well as a citizen I share
those<00:02:27.489> reservations<00:02:28.150> about<00:02:28.540> being<00:02:29.049> very

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
those reservations about being very

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.830 
those reservations about being very
careful<00:02:29.650> with<00:02:29.890> unmanned<00:02:30.400> aircraft<00:02:30.909> I<00:02:31.150> think

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
careful with unmanned aircraft I think

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.390 
careful with unmanned aircraft I think
with<00:02:31.989> this<00:02:32.110> particular<00:02:32.319> application<00:02:33.040> and

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
with this particular application and

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.690 
with this particular application and
this<00:02:33.489> aircraft<00:02:34.060> it's<00:02:34.629> a<00:02:34.750> very<00:02:34.959> visible<00:02:35.700> very

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
this aircraft it's a very visible very

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.530 
this aircraft it's a very visible very
specific<00:02:37.540> limited<00:02:38.079> use<00:02:38.349> and<00:02:38.829> I<00:02:39.579> think<00:02:39.849> in<00:02:40.239> all

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
specific limited use and I think in all

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.530 
specific limited use and I think in all
cases<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:41.440> whoever<00:02:42.220> is<00:02:42.579> under<00:02:42.940> this<00:02:43.120> aircraft

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
cases the whoever is under this aircraft

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.360 
cases the whoever is under this aircraft
is<00:02:44.230> going<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.530> be<00:02:44.620> very<00:02:44.799> happy<00:02:44.920> that<00:02:45.220> it's

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
is going to be very happy that it's

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.819 
is going to be very happy that it's
there<00:02:45.670> because<00:02:46.239> they've<00:02:46.810> paid<00:02:47.230> for<00:02:47.260> they've

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
there because they've paid for they've

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.830 
there because they've paid for they've
hired<00:02:48.129> that<00:02:48.760> aircraft<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:49.299> fly<00:02:49.450> over<00:02:49.599> their

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
hired that aircraft to fly over their

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.319 
hired that aircraft to fly over their
property<00:02:50.049> either<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.799> spray<00:02:51.069> or<00:02:51.370> inspect<00:02:51.790> or

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
property either to spray or inspect or

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.690 
property either to spray or inspect or
some<00:02:52.599> other<00:02:52.750> purpose<00:02:53.170> so<00:02:53.829> with<00:02:54.220> an<00:02:54.310> aircraft

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
some other purpose so with an aircraft

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.849 
some other purpose so with an aircraft
like<00:02:54.790> this<00:02:55.150> I<00:02:55.450> think<00:02:55.599> it's<00:02:55.959> a<00:02:56.109> very<00:02:56.349> specific

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
like this I think it's a very specific

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.490 
like this I think it's a very specific
purpose<00:02:57.370> very<00:02:57.819> purpose<00:02:58.599> designed<00:02:58.810> aircraft

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
purpose very purpose designed aircraft

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.110 
purpose very purpose designed aircraft
and<00:03:00.010> I<00:03:00.340> think<00:03:00.579> those<00:03:00.790> concerns<00:03:01.269> are<00:03:01.629> very<00:03:02.440> very

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
and I think those concerns are very very

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.680 
and I think those concerns are very very
very<00:03:04.120> less<00:03:05.670> relevant<00:03:06.670> for<00:03:06.849> this<00:03:06.940> aircraft<00:03:07.180> and

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
very less relevant for this aircraft and

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.550 
very less relevant for this aircraft and
for<00:03:08.049> something<00:03:08.530> that's<00:03:08.709> quiet<00:03:09.840> otherwise<00:03:10.840> a

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
for something that's quiet otherwise a

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.069 
for something that's quiet otherwise a
different<00:03:12.250> purpose<00:03:12.430> aircraft<00:03:12.940> it's<00:03:13.690> it<00:03:13.959> would

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
different purpose aircraft it's it would

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.620 
different purpose aircraft it's it would
be<00:03:14.170> like<00:03:14.349> a<00:03:14.379> motorcycle<00:03:15.120> trying<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.239> sneak<00:03:16.480> up

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
be like a motorcycle trying to sneak up

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.419 
be like a motorcycle trying to sneak up
on<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:17.019> it's<00:03:17.560> not<00:03:17.889> very<00:03:18.310> stealthy<00:03:18.790> at<00:03:18.970> all
