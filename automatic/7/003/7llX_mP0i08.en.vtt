00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:05.170
 the footballer is a figure that we also associate with social responsibility 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.209
 always in the name of violence in reality for foreign footballers 

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:12.029
 there is also this aspect they are representatives of a community 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.609
 immigrant da therefore they are a point of reference for their compatriots 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:17.669
 as and as always text 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:20.289
 very honored mark very proud 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.269
 not especially when we are part of a very large community like 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.970
 the Albanian one here in Italy 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.590
 eh makes me glad that these events vga not the opportunity to unite everyone 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.400
 together 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.270
 see to do these same things that also give a hand to our nation 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.410
 you also the future 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.850
 you are contacted by the Albanian fans who are here in Italy and 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.390
 look for them are Lazio fans in the Albanians if because city 2 footballers 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.250
 that 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.030
 that a lot of people play in Lazio, especially man, I often do 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.569
 also 

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:57.970
 turning to make us karaoke 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.970
 many of my countrymen stop me 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.660
 fury to talk a little about the football of Lazio's Albania 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.180
 especially so many Lazio fans 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.740
 Albanian immigration is now well integrated in Italy at the beginning is not 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.190
 so it was more than a few problems 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.000
 problem that Romanian immigrants live up to today 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.020
 and problems from this political point of view will serve or always have been 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.440
 well accepted where he played 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.260
 see you in the di as well as in rome has played below to play also in 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.420
 Germany has therefore stemmed very many square gardens but the problem of 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.229
 albania I have to compare it a little like 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.210
 with Italy from the 1950s when they left 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.340
 unfortunately it was an experience 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.150
 negative at the beginning because it was a very hard impact for all of ours 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.350
 people counted with a thousand we say with reality 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.760
 garelli altarello another world now I am very pleased grins around a 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.590
 couple of years as a community we are 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.020
 quite adequate - then we are also very well integrated into social life 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.089
 reopened guanita 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:14.319
 I am very proud of that for which it concerns me to me personally not 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.369
 I have 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:20.029
 not particularly because it is when a privileged person does not 

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:23.299
 hahaha you don't feel it so much worse 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.419
 I also feel a bit called for this fact here because it is 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:33.209
 a point of reference for all my countrymen here when I have to give mine 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.579
 example 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:39.099
 in the especially for the image of Albania they assumed I always do 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.759
 the espresso willingly 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:43.579
 you first talked about Italian emigration 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:48.669
 Italians abroad have a very strong moment of identification 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:52.170
 with the national team when there is a strong Albanian national team to live 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.369
 for immigrants, no, but if you knew how much 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:57.729
 obama let's say the contact 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:00.599
 obv strong Albanian fans trailler 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.039
 if our national price is in Albania 

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:08.249
 right now there is only the national football team for shoes when we 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:11.409
 we play abroad follow us 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.479
 perhaps even more than the Italians 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:16.709
 because they come from all over the world to see the games from america 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:17.379
 Australia
