fully Wi-Fi is on bluetooth is on and

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.490 
fully Wi-Fi is on bluetooth is on and
again<00:00:46.240> full<00:00:46.450> brightness<00:00:46.720> I<00:00:47.050> know<00:00:47.290> that<00:00:47.410> this

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
again full brightness I know that this

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.770 
again full brightness I know that this
thing<00:00:47.560> run<00:00:48.040> and<00:00:48.370> run<00:00:48.700> and<00:00:48.940> run<00:00:49.030> and<00:00:49.510> see<00:00:49.690> how

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
thing run and run and run and see how

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.320 
thing run and run and run and see how
long<00:00:49.960> it<00:00:50.110> lasts<00:00:50.500> now<00:00:51.130> these<00:00:51.610> tests<00:00:52.090> are<00:00:52.180> so

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
long it lasts now these tests are so

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.330 
long it lasts now these tests are so
expensive<00:00:52.750> because<00:00:53.080> we<00:00:53.260> found<00:00:53.680> that<00:00:53.980> it<00:00:54.160> takes

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
expensive because we found that it takes

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.940 
expensive because we found that it takes
about<00:00:54.460> 3<00:00:55.270> to<00:00:55.390> 4<00:00:55.600> hours<00:00:55.630> to<00:00:56.260> get<00:00:56.380> a<00:00:56.440> full<00:00:56.650> charge

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
about 3 to 4 hours to get a full charge

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.830 
about 3 to 4 hours to get a full charge
on<00:00:57.160> the<00:00:57.280> battery<00:00:57.460> and<00:00:57.850> I'll<00:00:58.300> be<00:00:58.420> looking<00:00:58.720> into

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
on the battery and I'll be looking into

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.250 
on the battery and I'll be looking into
that<00:00:59.020> as<00:00:59.200> well<00:00:59.440> the<00:00:59.800> last<00:01:00.160> time<00:01:00.610> I<00:01:01.079> charged<00:01:02.079> it

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
that as well the last time I charged it

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.860 
that as well the last time I charged it
the<00:01:02.829> first<00:01:03.100> hour<00:01:03.370> I<00:01:03.790> actually<00:01:04.000> had<00:01:04.269> it<00:01:04.300> on<00:01:04.600> I

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
the first hour I actually had it on I

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.720 
the first hour I actually had it on I
want<00:01:05.050> to<00:01:05.080> do<00:01:05.199> a<00:01:05.230> charging<00:01:05.860> with<00:01:06.070> it<00:01:06.250> off<00:01:06.430> the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 
want to do a charging with it off the

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.100 
want to do a charging with it off the
entire<00:01:07.030> time<00:01:07.390> and<00:01:07.540> see<00:01:07.659> if<00:01:07.690> I<00:01:07.780> can<00:01:07.870> get<00:01:07.990> to<00:01:08.050> that

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
entire time and see if I can get to that

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.899 
entire time and see if I can get to that
3<00:01:08.440> hours<00:01:08.590> that<00:01:08.890> people<00:01:08.950> are<00:01:09.340> saying<00:01:09.610> that<00:01:09.790> this

3 hours that people are saying that this

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.100 
3 hours that people are saying that this
thing<00:01:09.970> takes<00:01:10.360> to<00:01:10.510> charge<00:01:10.750> up

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
thing takes to charge up

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.200 
thing takes to charge up
but<00:01:11.440> regardless<00:01:11.770> every<00:01:12.010> test<00:01:12.190> I<00:01:12.310> do<00:01:12.370> is<00:01:13.000> gonna

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
but regardless every test I do is gonna

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.380 
but regardless every test I do is gonna
take<00:01:13.390> me<00:01:13.540> 3<00:01:14.200> to<00:01:14.320> 4<00:01:14.470> hours<00:01:14.500> at<00:01:14.980> least<00:01:15.010> to<00:01:15.550> charge

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
take me 3 to 4 hours at least to charge

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.490 
take me 3 to 4 hours at least to charge
it<00:01:16.540> up<00:01:16.630> to<00:01:16.780> do<00:01:16.930> another<00:01:17.080> test

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
it up to do another test

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.380 
it up to do another test
anyway<00:01:17.680> this<00:01:17.830> test<00:01:18.100> so<00:01:18.940> I'm<00:01:19.090> gonna<00:01:19.180> show<00:01:19.300> you

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
anyway this test so I'm gonna show you

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.390 
anyway this test so I'm gonna show you
how<00:01:19.479> it's<00:01:19.690> gonna<00:01:19.840> it's<00:01:20.320> gonna<00:01:20.409> work<00:01:20.620> I've

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
charged the iPad it's fully charged and

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.719 
charged the iPad it's fully charged and
there's<00:01:25.659> nothing<00:01:26.140> else<00:01:26.290> running<00:01:26.620> but<00:01:27.130> YouTube

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
there's nothing else running but YouTube

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.880 
there's nothing else running but YouTube
that's<00:01:28.570> it<00:01:28.780> just<00:01:29.020> YouTube<00:01:29.380> run<00:01:29.560> it<00:01:29.650> nothing

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
that's it just YouTube run it nothing

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:30.750 
that's it just YouTube run it nothing
goes<00:01:29.979> in<00:01:30.070> the<00:01:30.130> background

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
goes in the background

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.469 
goes in the background
typically<00:01:31.630> with<00:01:32.260> these<00:01:32.710> kinds<00:01:33.010> of<00:01:33.070> devices

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
typically with these kinds of devices

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.770 
typically with these kinds of devices
anything<00:01:34.479> that's<00:01:34.810> running<00:01:35.200> in<00:01:35.770> terms<00:01:36.220> of<00:01:36.780> you

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
anything that's running in terms of you

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.780 
anything that's running in terms of you
know<00:01:37.810> waiting<00:01:38.380> is<00:01:38.590> running<00:01:38.890> takes<00:01:39.370> up<00:01:39.460> memory

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
know waiting is running takes up memory

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.090 
know waiting is running takes up memory
and<00:01:39.820> memory<00:01:40.210> uses<00:01:40.600> power<00:01:40.840> so<00:01:41.590> even<00:01:41.950> if<00:01:42.010> you

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
and memory uses power so even if you

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.170 
and memory uses power so even if you
have<00:01:42.190> things<00:01:42.430> in<00:01:42.520> a<00:01:42.580> background<00:01:43.000> that<00:01:43.060> are

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
have things in a background that are

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.700 
have things in a background that are
interactive<00:01:43.630> doing<00:01:44.110> anything<00:01:44.350> let's<00:01:44.590> say

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
interactive doing anything let's say

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.219 
interactive doing anything let's say
like<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:44.979> word<00:01:45.580> document<00:01:45.610> you<00:01:46.450> say<00:01:46.780> really<00:01:47.080> it's

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
like a word document you say really it's

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:48.390 
like a word document you say really it's
just<00:01:47.320> a<00:01:47.470> word<00:01:47.590> document<00:01:47.799> it's<00:01:48.100> not<00:01:48.190> doing

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
just a word document it's not doing

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.719 
just a word document it's not doing
anything

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
anything

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.890 
anything
it<00:01:49.570> can<00:01:49.750> actually<00:01:49.900> be<00:01:50.080> burning<00:01:50.470> more<00:01:50.560> power<00:01:50.830> so

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
it can actually be burning more power so

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.359 
it can actually be burning more power so
I've<00:01:52.900> turned<00:01:53.260> off<00:01:53.500> all<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:53.860> other<00:01:54.010> apps<00:01:54.159> now

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
I've turned off all the other apps now

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:55.440 
I've turned off all the other apps now
why<00:01:54.580> are<00:01:54.640> we<00:01:54.760> doing<00:01:54.880> this<00:01:55.030> because<00:01:55.150> it's<00:01:55.360> an
