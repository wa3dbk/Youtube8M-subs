i<00:02:56.130> think<00:02:56.400> that's<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.820> worst<00:02:57.000> thing<00:02:57.120> there's<00:02:58.080> a

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
i think that's the worst thing there's a

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.680 
i think that's the worst thing there's a
reason<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.560> we're<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:58.890> four<00:02:59.190> seed<00:02:59.460> a<00:02:59.940> reason

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
reason that we're a four seed a reason

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.570 
reason that we're a four seed a reason
that<00:03:00.720> we're<00:03:01.080> only<00:03:01.380> install<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:02.040> tournament

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
that we're only install a tournament

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.090 
that we're only install a tournament
it's<00:03:03.060> more<00:03:03.450> about<00:03:03.570> making<00:03:04.200> sure<00:03:04.590> we're<00:03:04.920> good

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
it's more about making sure we're good

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.160 
it's more about making sure we're good
in<00:03:05.130> those<00:03:05.340> areas<00:03:05.850> as<00:03:06.090> opposed<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.690> change<00:03:06.990> in
