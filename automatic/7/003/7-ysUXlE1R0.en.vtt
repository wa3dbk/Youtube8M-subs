these<00:01:50.900> clubs<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.439> they<00:01:51.500> do<00:01:51.560> a<00:01:51.680> little<00:01:51.829> bit

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
these clubs and they do a little bit

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.060 
these clubs and they do a little bit
more<00:01:52.250> practicing<00:01:52.939> however<00:01:53.659> having<00:01:54.650> observed

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
more practicing however having observed

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.219 
more practicing however having observed
some<00:01:55.400> and<00:01:55.610> participated<00:01:56.299> in<00:01:56.420> some<00:01:56.659> we<00:01:57.200> don't

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
some and participated in some we don't

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.889 
some and participated in some we don't
get<00:01:57.560> full<00:01:57.799> participation<00:01:58.490> by<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:58.850> by<00:01:59.630> many<00:01:59.840> of

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
get full participation by the by many of

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.450 
get full participation by the by many of
the<00:01:59.990> players<00:02:00.229> because<00:02:00.680> they<00:02:00.860> are<00:02:00.920> rightfully

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
the players because they are rightfully

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.370 
the players because they are rightfully
off<00:02:01.880> playing<00:02:02.299> other<00:02:02.479> sports<00:02:02.630> which<00:02:03.200> is

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
off playing other sports which is

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.289 
off playing other sports which is
something<00:02:03.680> we<00:02:03.829> would<00:02:03.890> like<00:02:04.100> them<00:02:04.280> to<00:02:04.340> do<00:02:04.670> so

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
something we would like them to do so

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.559 
something we would like them to do so
they<00:02:05.420> don't<00:02:05.600> come<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:06.530> these<00:02:06.939> these<00:02:07.939> practice

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
they don't come to these these practice

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.690 
they don't come to these these practice
sessions<00:02:08.799> but<00:02:09.799> they<00:02:09.950> sure<00:02:10.099> come<00:02:10.309> to<00:02:10.429> the<00:02:10.519> game

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
sessions but they sure come to the game

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.010 
sessions but they sure come to the game
sessions<00:02:11.269> so<00:02:11.769> I<00:02:12.769> think<00:02:13.519> coaches

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
sessions so I think coaches

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.140 
sessions so I think coaches
have<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.590> make<00:02:15.620> a<00:02:15.800> decision<00:02:16.010> on<00:02:16.520> whether

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
have to make a decision on whether

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.760 
have to make a decision on whether
they're<00:02:17.390> going<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.570> develop<00:02:17.870> hockey<00:02:18.320> players

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
they're going to develop hockey players

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.100 
they're going to develop hockey players
or<00:02:20.080> they<00:02:21.080> want<00:02:21.320> to<00:02:21.410> win<00:02:21.560> games<00:02:22.810> now<00:02:23.810> winning

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.110 
or they want to win games now winning
games<00:02:24.380> is<00:02:24.620> terrific<00:02:24.950> but<00:02:25.610> it<00:02:25.700> really<00:02:25.880> doesn't

games is terrific but it really doesn't

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.930 
games is terrific but it really doesn't

I think we've gotta put in perspective
what<00:02:40.250> it<00:02:40.400> is<00:02:40.520> we're<00:02:40.730> trying<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:41.090> accomplish

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.320 
here as coaches and his parents of the

of that I think we have an obligation to

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.930 
of that I think we have an obligation to
the<00:03:05.030> players<00:03:05.830> because<00:03:06.830> of<00:03:06.860> the<00:03:07.010> time<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:07.640> the

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
the players because of the time and the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.240 
the players because of the time and the
money<00:03:07.970> that's<00:03:08.420> being<00:03:08.600> spent<00:03:08.720> by<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.650> parents

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250

money that's being spent by the parents
the<00:03:10.730> time<00:03:11.030> spent<00:03:11.420> by<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.600> players<00:03:11.990> to<00:03:12.590> give

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
the time spent by the players to give

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.160 
the time spent by the players to give
them<00:03:12.800> all<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.430> tools<00:03:13.730> that<00:03:14.030> they<00:03:14.180> need<00:03:14.360> to

them all the tools that they need to
become<00:03:15.320> as<00:03:15.770> good<00:03:16.100> of<00:03:16.160> a<00:03:16.370> hockey<00:03:16.610> player<00:03:17.090> that

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
become as good of a hockey player that

got five kids and you probably win a lot
of<00:03:30.350> games<00:03:30.560> but<00:03:30.740> what<00:03:30.980> about<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.370> rest<00:03:31.520> of<00:03:31.760> them

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
of games but what about the rest of them

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.440 
of games but what about the rest of them
do<00:03:33.110> we<00:03:33.230> always<00:03:33.440> do<00:03:34.010> we<00:03:34.310> always<00:03:34.490> allow<00:03:34.850> them<00:03:35.150> to

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
do we always do we always allow them to

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.140 
do we always do we always allow them to
play<00:03:35.660> in<00:03:35.840> special<00:03:36.260> situations<00:03:36.500> do<00:03:37.370> we<00:03:37.490> coach

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
play in special situations do we coach

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.780 
play in special situations do we coach
the<00:03:38.930> lesser<00:03:39.290> skilled<00:03:39.590> kids<00:03:39.950> and<00:03:40.160> I<00:03:40.610> would

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
the lesser skilled kids and I would

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.400 
the lesser skilled kids and I would
argue<00:03:40.940> that<00:03:41.120> we<00:03:41.360> should<00:03:41.390> coach<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.110> lesser

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
argue that we should coach the lesser

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.410 
argue that we should coach the lesser
skilled<00:03:42.650> kids<00:03:42.980> just<00:03:43.250> as<00:03:43.400> much<00:03:43.580> as<00:03:43.790> those<00:03:44.240> that

for<00:03:54.860> the<00:03:54.950> kids<00:03:55.190> we<00:03:55.910> should<00:03:56.150> be<00:03:56.300> helping<00:03:56.990> them

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
a poz

a poz
of<00:04:28.550> environment<00:04:29.360> all<00:04:29.569> through<00:04:30.169> their

their potential as athletes and his
people<00:04:35.090> so<00:04:35.889> coaches<00:04:36.889> you've<00:04:37.069> got<00:04:37.220> a<00:04:37.250> choice

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
people so coaches you've got a choice

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.499 
people so coaches you've got a choice
prepare<00:04:38.990> for<00:04:39.229> the<00:04:39.319> games<00:04:39.560> or<00:04:40.150> teach<00:04:41.150> skills

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:41.509 
prepare for the games or teach skills

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.710 
prepare for the games or teach skills
and<00:04:41.810> teach<00:04:42.380> the<00:04:42.680> game<00:04:42.919> of<00:04:43.130> hockey<00:04:43.340> and<00:04:43.729> I<00:04:44.539> would

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
and teach the game of hockey and I would

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.520 
and teach the game of hockey and I would
argue<00:04:44.750> that<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.380> second<00:04:45.770> choice<00:04:47.050> will<00:04:48.050> result

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
argue that the second choice will result

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.610 
argue that the second choice will result
in<00:04:48.710> more<00:04:48.860> wins<00:04:49.190> on<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.550> other<00:04:49.699> side<00:04:50.530> so<00:04:51.530> we'll

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
in more wins on the other side so we'll

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.370 
in more wins on the other side so we'll
see<00:04:51.800> you<00:04:51.830> around<00:04:51.919> the<00:04:52.190> rink
