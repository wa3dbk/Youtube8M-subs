 have moved the company to leave 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.080

 kevins took an active role 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.940
 Jerry Lawler is 65 years old 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.160
 on may 23 in memphis tennessee in the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.890

 compete 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.620
 The match is saved for money 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.140
 for the legendary with on coliseum 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.510

 again sharing pictures with kempinski 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.710

 nxp live special again 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.939
 is to be expected remains to be seen 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.659
 However, this is almost in stone 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.119
 chiseled there are some speculations 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.860
 for the extreme rules pay per view because 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.020
 he is on 26 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.720
 quarter and the card is always 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.509
 concrete previous plans saw for the 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.909
 Ice wine vettel passing match 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.460
 However, you should now bergius berit 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.950
 against Iran as a single match at 1 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.479

 also done in the title 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.530
 but maybe they should also be involved 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.720
 against each other a single get that 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.940
 is called sailor against China could 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.530
 also be an option another match 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.690
 what you want to put on the map is 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.470
 mating rom it rains against big show 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.350
