00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
words for this figure because they are

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.649 
words for this figure because they are
awesome<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.549> mean<00:02:03.000> just<00:02:03.180> look<00:02:03.299> at<00:02:03.360> his<00:02:03.450> boots

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
this is a detail that I normally may not

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.670 
this is a detail that I normally may not
care<00:02:06.360> about<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.689> much<00:02:06.840> but<00:02:07.049> geez<00:02:07.320> look<00:02:07.590> at

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
care about that much but geez look at

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.469 
care about that much but geez look at
the<00:02:07.799> way<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.099> there's<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.580> sculpt<00:02:09.060> here<00:02:09.270> and

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
the way that there's a sculpt here and

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.390 
the way that there's a sculpt here and
that<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.140> opens<00:02:10.470> up<00:02:10.560> it's<00:02:10.709> not<00:02:10.800> button<00:02:11.160> there

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
that it opens up it's not button there

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.050 
that it opens up it's not button there
and<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.849> way<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.090> these<00:02:12.150> boot<00:02:12.450> covers

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
and the way that these boot covers

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.479 
and the way that these boot covers
over<00:02:13.390> his<00:02:13.660> shoes<00:02:13.930> I<00:02:14.230> mean<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.950> sculpting<00:02:15.400> of

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
over his shoes I mean the sculpting of

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.890 
over his shoes I mean the sculpting of
the<00:02:15.520> way<00:02:15.640> all<00:02:15.819> that<00:02:15.970> goes<00:02:16.180> down<00:02:16.390> is<00:02:16.630> really

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
the way all that goes down is really

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.390 
the way all that goes down is really
really<00:02:17.050> good<00:02:17.200> work<00:02:17.349> then<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:17.770> add<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.160> pain

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
really good work then you add the pain

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.460 
really good work then you add the pain
of<00:02:18.550> all<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:18.819> it<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:19.050> like<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.230> kind<00:02:20.440> of

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
of all of it and like the kind of

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.110 
of all of it and like the kind of
weathering<00:02:20.980> paint<00:02:21.280> so<00:02:21.610> there's<00:02:21.790> like<00:02:21.940> more

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
weathering paint so there's like more

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.570 
weathering paint so there's like more
than<00:02:22.300> one<00:02:22.450> Brown<00:02:22.750> tone<00:02:23.020> being<00:02:23.230> used<00:02:23.530> just<00:02:24.459> the

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
than one Brown tone being used just the

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.430 
than one Brown tone being used just the
way<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:24.910> these<00:02:25.030> all<00:02:25.239> kind<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.599> are<00:02:25.930> sculpted

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
way that these all kind of are sculpted

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.960 
way that these all kind of are sculpted
to<00:02:26.500> be<00:02:26.590> this<00:02:26.680> open<00:02:27.010> position<00:02:27.069> really<00:02:27.640> really

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
to be this open position really really

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.270 
to be this open position really really
impresses<00:02:28.300> me<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:29.590> that<00:02:29.739> can<00:02:29.890> go<00:02:30.010> with<00:02:30.190> the

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
impresses me and that can go with the

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.320 
impresses me and that can go with the
rest<00:02:30.459> of<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.610> figure<00:02:30.730> too<00:02:30.940> but<00:02:31.120> for<00:02:31.209> some

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
rest of the figure too but for some

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.520 
rest of the figure too but for some
reason<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.630> shoes<00:02:31.870> really<00:02:32.080> stand<00:02:32.200> out

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
reason the shoes really stand out

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.740 
reason the shoes really stand out
underneath<00:02:33.010> his<00:02:33.250> coat<00:02:33.459> his<00:02:34.209> shirt<00:02:34.510> seems

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
underneath his coat his shirt seems

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.770 
underneath his coat his shirt seems

great this really does look just like

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.759 
great this really does look just like
how<00:03:33.160> he<00:03:33.220> does<00:03:33.430> in<00:03:33.609> the<00:03:33.880> episode<00:03:34.269> I<00:03:34.709> think<00:03:35.709> they
