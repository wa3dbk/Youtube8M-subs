00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 that we have just finished doing the 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.069
 expense we are ready to start 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.299
 get closer to start doing some 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.299
 nice sandwich plus symbols 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:32.390
 good evening guys then there we are 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.260
 here at the house of beppe to prepare a bel 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.000
 sandwich 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.170
 this is my bet so let's get started 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.790
 we present our members very well 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.769
 how can and should we start cats 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.879
 because later when we eat we put them 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:49.760
 with new salted inside we take long 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.890
 the pizzaiola humanize in beautiful oil 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.629
 shirt to make wider 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.100
 possibly because this is almost 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.500
 half a kilo I prefer that of a 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.700
 then chilo our beautiful mozzarella 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.570
 fresh for our raw ham 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.699
 use this one of the first episode 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.190
 then I would do in the others we will change the 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.780
 I prefer our pitted olives 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.410
 the green ones also the black ones are there 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.110
 same oppose is our meyer has ever 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:18.350
 wrong he has also to do e 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.180
 having elevated the state of crumb that of 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.610
 sure it does n't look to the empire because health 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.460
 you can see it well for the cat 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.970
 and the father will also be inexpensive 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.580
 always feeling the place of the hill 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.580
 we can already slice ours 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.990
 mozzarella our three mozzarella e 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.500
 will start cooking 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.800
 Well first let 's see the mayonnaise 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:47.330
 we see a glass of mine and the 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.039
 we put on our urban and start 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.990
 spread the first layer of mayonnaise 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.440
 see you later when everything is just 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.709
 fine as you can well see where 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.520
 smeared the first layer of mayonnaise 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:03.229
 mix well let's move on 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.860
 our cured ham 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.959
 I recommend you take it and break it up and 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.480
 try to cover all the spaces and the 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.210
 your sandwich 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.280
 we will meet again, he must be put to bed when 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.320
 the operation will be finished and I want you 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.240
 see how rom like will be reduced 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.770
 we can observe we put the 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.580
 our way doing what now 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.770
 we can also go to the wings 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.480
 other seasonings you can put them in 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.770
 any order you want is not there 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.530
 precise order 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.150
 I have my own way of doing it then maybe 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.680
 want at your home you can do it like 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.560
 want 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:44.160
 then we start allowing the bricks 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:48.030
 in oil do not put on uninterrupted e 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.050
 put it in quantities that way 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:55.230
 that your sandwich is well seasoned 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.780
 it 's our visa then you can see 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.760
 if spaces remain, he wants not 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.090
 important because the high will put another one 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:08.570
 so after we put half we pass 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.570
 to put our pizzaiola mushrooms 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:17.040
 the fungaiolo is also elementary thanks 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.959
 gold oil and how they were 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.400
 preserved they will make your sandwich 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:27.299
 more crunchy with a very even taste 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.610
 inviting because you will be better lighthouse 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.700
 after that we can put the 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.330
 mozzarella mozzarella people everywhere 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.190
 because this will drive you insane the whole 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.860
 I'm starting this mazzarella 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.220
 in the sterile taste they will come into 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.930
 heat practically then made two aces 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.930
 now your olives 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.890
 and your sandwich 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.780
 so the preparation is completed you can 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.240
 very few can be seen 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.270
 minutes and you can even pay them 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.510
 so now we must set the 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:10.600
 romanino and we put the body inside 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.210
 well now let's put on our bel 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:20.739
 sandwich on our land that we will go to 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:22.810
 insert I recommend when you have to 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.610
 street where only case was 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.200
 you see that the mozzarella already is 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.740
 starting to melt 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.080
 and then leave it a little bit longer 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.880
 cook when he sees the mozzarella 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.540
 it's coming out then it's cooked a 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.480
 dot 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.060
 there is not a minute established 5 15 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.620
 this well done at home 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.790
 oven at the price that awaits the place 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:48.220
 beautiful maybe you do not see work but between 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.890
 free this area water and mozzarella 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.260
 this color is very beautiful 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.700
 perfect according to my tastes 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.110
 raw ham 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.110
 so the only thing that remains for me is 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.890
 call your relatives 13 e 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:04.720

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:08.010
