00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.750
 with dear friends will take you back 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.580
 yesterday after the presentation of microsoft on the net 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.280
 There is a new information about the first 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.289
 addition for battlefield 4 she will 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.449
 called tea ryzen in this 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.300
 4 new maps will introduce us 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.359
 new equipment and high-tech equipment 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.340
 As for the cards, nothing is known yet, but I 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.840
 I assume that we will give Chinese 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.210
 maps of battlefield 2 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.430
 To be honest, I hope so because 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.040
 in battlefield 2 chinese cards were 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.739
 very beautiful and interesting in terms of 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.719
 gameplay with technology more or less everything 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.450
 I understand most likely we will provide 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.610
 new type of aircraft or rather 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.250
 addition can give you heavy 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.260
 bombers many news sites 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.920
 didn't pay attention to the cover of this 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.350
 additions 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.149
 the cover we can see the Chinese tank 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:00.539
 type 99 american soldier with rifle 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:03.559
 m39 and m 16 as well as Chinese 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.850
 Xinhua strategic bomber 6 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.400
 this chinese bomber can 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.090
 carry not only ordinary bombs 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.990
 or cruise missile but also a nuclear weapon 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.770
 does the multiplayer appear 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.430
 tactical nuclear strike 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.290
 not yet known but I think it is unlikely 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.920
 days will go on such an experiment with 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.900
 balance 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.540
 maybe the mechanic will repeat 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.299
 bombers from 1943 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.360
 when you went to headquarters summoned 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.380
 an air strike while you yourself managed 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.869
 a bombardment struck and 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.610
 bombers disappeared from the battlefield 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.649
 judging by the mechanics of the aircraft 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.590
 support from armored kill 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.350
 it will be so but in my opinion it would be better 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.420
 days we were just given bombers 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.509
 as a complete air unit 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.909
 so it was in the battlefield of 1942 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.070
 well, the last feature of this add-on 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.710
 hi-tech equipment is likely 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.259
 will be managed by the kernel and since the old 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.600
 name of this add-on drone strike 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.000
 I think that's all thanks for watching 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.679
