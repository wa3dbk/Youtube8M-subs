Sean Cena coming out with the chain

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.270 
Sean Cena coming out with the chain
acting<00:03:10.860> all<00:03:10.980> tough<00:03:11.010> um<00:03:12.650> and<00:03:13.650> just<00:03:13.739> losing<00:03:14.190> his

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
acting all tough um and just losing his

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.160 
acting all tough um and just losing his
mind<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:15.300> think<00:03:15.540> that's<00:03:15.690> probably<00:03:15.840> what's

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
mind and I think that's probably what's

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.110 
mind and I think that's probably what's
going<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.380> happen<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:17.100> it<00:03:17.580> would<00:03:17.730> kind<00:03:18.060> of

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
going to happen and it would kind of

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.420 
going to happen and it would kind of
make<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.540> most<00:03:18.690> sense<00:03:18.959> where<00:03:19.290> Cena<00:03:19.890> just<00:03:20.160> goes

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
make the most sense where Cena just goes

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.410 
make the most sense where Cena just goes
out<00:03:20.610> there<00:03:20.670> balls<00:03:21.239> to<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.480> wall<00:03:21.720> just<00:03:21.989> no

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
out there balls to the wall just no

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.940 
out there balls to the wall just no
thought<00:03:24.420> in<00:03:24.600> mind<00:03:24.810> of<00:03:25.049> getting<00:03:25.380> killed<00:03:25.620> again

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
thought in mind of getting killed again

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.280 
thought in mind of getting killed again
and<00:03:26.750> just<00:03:27.750> gets<00:03:27.989> himself<00:03:28.140> disqualified<00:03:29.060> and

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
and just gets himself disqualified and

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.600 
and just gets himself disqualified and
that's<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:31.500> but<00:03:31.769> then<00:03:31.980> again<00:03:32.010> what<00:03:32.430> will<00:03:32.580> that

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
that's it but then again what will that

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.160 
that's it but then again what will that
