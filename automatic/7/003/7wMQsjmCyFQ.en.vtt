00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.479

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.790
 jose portocarrero says I like it very 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.100
 good but needs improvements in the 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.700
 time to choose the sounds boot me 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.500
 of the app later and solve it another 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.229
 problem here we have ay such italy 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.240
 salinas a sexy girl says when 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.090
 record everything well but when playing the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.000
 video the colors come out ready 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.719
 2 and the sound does not fit with the bone video 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.630
 svr against the created the guided as 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:07.280
 whatever you want, it looks very bad 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:11.150
 says diane on the right says lousy 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.180
 very slow michelle is new also recorded 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:18.530
 and do not reproduce it I do not know why lousy 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:23.330
 lousy ok there are many people and that is 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:26.959
 also happening that you are more does not even 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.290
 a fuck then I have come here to 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.870
 try to solve it apparently 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:37.189
 the problem with all this is a 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:40.250
 update that launched stops more than 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:44.780
 certain android devices do not know if in 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.310
 which is the problem but I think 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.939
 which is the majority of devices 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.670
 Android that problem then in that 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:55.909
 update a problem occurs so 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:00.469
 I do not know when the fuck is going to fix that 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:03.540
 problem so for now for now what 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:06.569
 only that I recommend is 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.670
 that if there are some users that just 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:13.130
 are watching this video and downloaded 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:16.130
 the light the 2 more when the version 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.670
 before this I think that if I'm not wrong 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:25.010
 I do not know but it's a previous version 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:27.280
 the 1.0 point 8 nor update it because 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.100
 that's the problem the update 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.290
 then what I 'm going to do is 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.280
 I'm going to leave a link below in the 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.280
 description of this video 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:43.580
 so you can download the 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.140
 application before it is updated what 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.350
 that has the only thing they have to do 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:52.240
 is to uninstall the application that they have 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:55.090
 does not serve you and then 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.580
 download the application in the link 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.990
 I'll leave you in the description of 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:05.190
 video and later that is already 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.190
 downloaded to your pc 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.890
 they go to their cell phone and they go through 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.740
 via usb via bluetooth any 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:19.900
 medium but that downloaded application that 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:23.650
 it is a file this app 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:27.190
 and they pass it to their cell phone and activate in their 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:30.430
 the cell by this application activate 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.610
 The name of this option our 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.190
 option is called I think there's something of 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.320
 accept applications from origins 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.729
 strangers I do not know if it sounds like that 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:45.560
 and they have to activate that so they can 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.440
 install your 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.450
 application 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.550
 I'm not sure but maybe I'll put a 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.340
 video with my cell phone how is the 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.170
 application but if I do not put the video 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.040
 then more or less have to be guided 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:02.440
 but all they have to do is 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.600
 install the application of your more than 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.540
 an earlier version and stay with that 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:11.290
 at the moment eye when the application 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:13.680
 is installed is installed in your 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.850
 place thor will appear installed and 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.700
 and they are not going to appear osea 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.350
 button of the green to be uninstalled 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.090
 and the other normally installed does not 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:26.800
 then the little green button is going 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:29.110
 appear update eye do not update it 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.360
 because if they update it obviously it's going to 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:36.400
 return to the same thing and if it returns what 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:40.360
 same as it is the same as nothing not like that 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.370
 that they do not update it and simply what 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.970
 you mean to a forthcoming 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.930
 version where the creators of doom more 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.900
 This application 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.840
 wonderful 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.240
 fix the problem so that all 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.060
 users can be happy so 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.270
 for the moment that is my recommendation 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.830
 you know in conclusion download the 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.650
 application from the link that I'm going to 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.710
 leave in the description of this video and 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:10.500
 we had to close it install it and ready 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.690
 they will see that if it works and those that 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.699
 they have and they want to update it by 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.979
 please not the police yet until a 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:19.650
 next version eye versions the 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:22.229
 can look from the Pleistocene accurate 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.940
 when hoisting put in the description and it comes out 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:26.100
 the version for example here are watching 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:30.180
 the pc where I am and says the version 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:32.760
 current is 1.0 point 8 that version 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:36.180
 this is bringing problems for the 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:39.270
 which two more still does not do anything 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:45.870
 then for now recommended to install 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:47.139

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.330
