 Petter just gave his blood to Harry 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.520
 instead of injecting with the poison of 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.460
 the spider as it happens in the movie 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.930
 the suit was also going to be better explained 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.180
 of the goblin as a special suit 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.790
 designed for norman osborn not as 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.920
 military suit when richard parker is 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.720
 refused to give his Norman blood the suit to 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.820

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.660
 can have a final conversation with 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.179
 petter in which he demands that he never 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.320
 render since he already broke his promise with 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.990
 the captain is here 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.180

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.460
 At the end of the original script, Petter leaves 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.410

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.540

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.830

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.540
