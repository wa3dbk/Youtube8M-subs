00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
first thing I'll talk to you about is

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.450 
first thing I'll talk to you about is
Ravens<00:00:19.410> weaknesses<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.130> think<00:00:20.340> it's

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
Ravens weaknesses and I think it's

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.890 
Ravens weaknesses and I think it's
really<00:00:20.640> important<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.150> understand<00:00:21.600> how<00:00:21.840> to

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
really important to understand how to

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.779 
really important to understand how to
play<00:00:22.140> against<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.650> champion<00:00:22.859> before<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.519> start

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
play against a champion before you start

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.340 
play against a champion before you start
playing<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.539> make<00:00:24.660> sure<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:25.080> don't<00:00:25.260> do

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
playing it so make sure you don't do

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.080 
playing it so make sure you don't do
those<00:00:25.500> things<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:25.949> make<00:00:26.160> him<00:00:26.369> weak<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:27.000> the

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
those things that make him weak so the

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.839 
those things that make him weak so the
first<00:00:27.359> thing<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.840> his<00:00:28.109> Q<00:00:28.529> now<00:00:28.830> at<00:00:29.070> level<00:00:29.340> 1<00:00:29.640> your

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
first thing is his Q now at level 1 your

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.790 
first thing is his Q now at level 1 your
Q<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.210> 12<00:00:30.599> second<00:00:31.019> cooldown<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.590> if<00:00:31.710> you

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
Q is a 12 second cooldown and if you

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.250 
Q is a 12 second cooldown and if you
drop<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.189> axe<00:00:32.399> there's<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.000> huge<00:00:33.450> window<00:00:33.930> in

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
drop that axe there's a huge window in

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.049 
drop that axe there's a huge window in
which<00:00:34.590> your<00:00:34.829> enemy<00:00:35.130> can<00:00:35.250> trade<00:00:35.489> with<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.850> and

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
which your enemy can trade with you and

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.490 
which your enemy can trade with you and
you're<00:00:36.180> going<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.360> lose<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.719> trade<00:00:36.930> every

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
you're going to lose that trade every

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.560 
you're going to lose that trade every
time<00:00:37.710> because<00:00:38.160> your<00:00:38.370> Q<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.850> all<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.480> your

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
time because your Q is all of your

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.959 
time because your Q is all of your
damage<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.200> lane<00:00:40.590> now<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.010> second<00:00:41.460> weakness

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
damage in lane now the second weakness

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.479 
damage in lane now the second weakness
is<00:00:42.180> going<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.809> be<00:00:42.960> his<00:00:43.170> ultimate<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.250> lot<00:00:44.460> of

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
people just use his ultimate for a long

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.500 
people just use his ultimate for a long
range<00:00:46.440> snipe<00:00:46.860> or<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.460> clear<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.000> wave<00:00:48.149> because

which<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.920> talked<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.280> about<00:01:23.340> later<00:01:23.610> and

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
which I talked to you about later and

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.940 
which I talked to you about later and
just<00:01:24.030> attacking<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.840> enemy<00:01:25.170> because<00:01:25.500> 9<00:01:25.710> times

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
just attacking the enemy because 9 times

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.560 
just attacking the enemy because 9 times
out<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.130> 10<00:01:26.220> Draven<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.060> going<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.299> do<00:01:27.390> more

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
out of 10 Draven is going to do more

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.020 
out of 10 Draven is going to do more
damage<00:01:27.750> than<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.200> enemy<00:01:28.350> ad<00:01:28.740> now<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.759> two

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
damage than the enemy ad now the two

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.240 
damage than the enemy ad now the two
slightly<00:01:30.780> more<00:01:30.900> effective<00:01:31.200> ways<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.890> guess<00:01:31.950> of

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
slightly more effective ways I guess of

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.580 
slightly more effective ways I guess of
trading<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.790> going<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.000> be<00:01:33.090> using<00:01:33.329> minions<00:01:33.869> so

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
trading is going to be using minions so

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.170 
trading is going to be using minions so
the<00:01:34.680> first<00:01:34.920> way<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.220> use<00:01:35.520> your<00:01:35.670> minions<00:01:36.030> is

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
the first way you use your minions is

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.999 
the first way you use your minions is
gonna<00:01:36.360> be<00:01:36.570> when<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.840> enemy<00:01:37.110> ad<00:01:37.259> comes<00:01:37.650> up<00:01:37.829> for

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
gonna be when the enemy ad comes up for

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.560 
gonna be when the enemy ad comes up for
a<00:01:38.070> last<00:01:38.280> hit<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.790> want<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.030> attack<00:01:39.329> them

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
a last hit you want to attack them

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.780 
a last hit you want to attack them
because<00:01:39.930> I'll<00:01:40.259> be<00:01:40.619> attacking<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.220> minions<00:01:41.640> I

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
because I'll be attacking the minions I

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.700 
because I'll be attacking the minions I
won't<00:01:42.000> be<00:01:42.119> focusing<00:01:42.689> on<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.259> you'll<00:01:43.590> get

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
won't be focusing on you and you'll get

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.859 
won't be focusing on you and you'll get
a<00:01:43.740> free<00:01:44.070> hit<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.700> obviously<00:01:45.270> after<00:01:45.630> you've

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
a free hit in and obviously after you've

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.149 
a free hit in and obviously after you've
done<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.229> all<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.560> have<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.740> do<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.009> then

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
done that all you have to do is then

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.039 
done that all you have to do is then
lead<00:01:47.369> your<00:01:47.579> axe<00:01:47.820> backwards<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.899> you've<00:01:49.020> just

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
lead your axe backwards so you've just

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.810 
lead your axe backwards so you've just
done<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> one<00:01:49.770> Auto<00:01:49.920> Attack<00:01:50.189> trade<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.670> with

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
done a one Auto Attack trade and with

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.219 
done a one Auto Attack trade and with
Drive<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.210> your<00:01:51.299> one<00:01:51.450> or<00:01:51.570> two<00:01:51.720> attack<00:01:51.930> does<00:01:52.200> a

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
Drive and your one or two attack does a

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.870 
Drive and your one or two attack does a
lot<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.500> damage<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.009> that's<00:01:53.280> enough<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.759> a

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
lot of damage so that's enough of a

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.670 
lot of damage so that's enough of a
trade<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.659> other<00:01:54.780> way<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:55.020> using<00:01:55.170> minions

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
trade so the other way of using minions

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.490 
trade so the other way of using minions
to<00:01:56.040> trade<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.670> going<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.149> be<00:01:57.329> when<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:58.049> go<00:01:58.259> for

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
to trade is going to be when you go for

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.990 
to trade is going to be when you go for
a<00:01:58.560> last<00:01:58.770> hit<00:01:59.070> now<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.549> sounds<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.820> little<00:01:59.880> bit

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
a last hit now it sounds a little bit

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.999 
a last hit now it sounds a little bit
strange<00:02:00.390> but<00:02:00.960> when<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.320> go<00:02:01.469> for<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.710> last<00:02:01.860> hit

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
strange but when you go for a last hit

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.499 
strange but when you go for a last hit
the<00:02:02.159> enemy<00:02:02.369> ad<00:02:02.549> will<00:02:02.700> notice<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.390> nine

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
the enemy ad will notice that and nine

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.450 
the enemy ad will notice that and nine
times<00:02:03.750> out<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:03.990> ten<00:02:04.290> what<00:02:04.710> they'll<00:02:04.920> do<00:02:05.130> is

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
times out of ten what they'll do is

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.980 
times out of ten what they'll do is
they'll<00:02:05.790> just<00:02:05.880> go<00:02:06.119> for<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.329> last<00:02:06.479> hit<00:02:06.659> as<00:02:06.810> well

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
they'll just go for a last hit as well

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.089 
they'll just go for a last hit as well
because<00:02:07.350> you're<00:02:07.469> not<00:02:07.560> going<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.770> be<00:02:07.829> attacking

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
because you're not going to be attacking

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.650 
because you're not going to be attacking
them<00:02:08.369> because<00:02:08.610> obviously<00:02:08.759> you're<00:02:09.179> gonna<00:02:09.330> go

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
them because obviously you're gonna go

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.180 
them because obviously you're gonna go
for<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.899> CS<00:02:10.229> now<00:02:10.590> what<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.800> want<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.009> do<00:02:11.099> it

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
for a CS now what you want to do it

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.220 
for a CS now what you want to do it
actually<00:02:11.640> instead<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.330> attack

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
actually instead is attack

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.869 
actually instead is attack
the<00:02:13.379> enemy<00:02:13.800> ID<00:02:13.980> they're<00:02:14.310> not<00:02:14.400> gonna<00:02:14.520> be<00:02:14.670> ready

the enemy ID they're not gonna be ready
for<00:02:15.090> an<00:02:15.209> attack<00:02:15.510> nine<00:02:15.780> times<00:02:15.989> out<00:02:16.140> ten<00:02:16.319> they're

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
for an attack nine times out ten they're

not gonna attack you back either because

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.670 
not gonna attack you back either because
they're<00:02:18.269> not<00:02:18.360> ready<00:02:18.540> for<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:19.140> they<00:02:19.349> want<00:02:19.530> that

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
they're not ready for and they want that

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.710 
they're not ready for and they want that
CS<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.550> even<00:02:20.879> though<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.030> do<00:02:21.239> miss<00:02:21.420> out<00:02:21.540> on<00:02:21.660> a

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
CS so even though you do miss out on a

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.360 
CS so even though you do miss out on a
minion<00:02:21.900> establishing<00:02:22.769> Lane<00:02:23.010> pressure

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
minion establishing Lane pressure

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.970 
minion establishing Lane pressure
through<00:02:23.970> trading<00:02:24.540> like<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:24.959> akun<00:02:25.530> force<00:02:25.800> an

through trading like that akun force an

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.559 
through trading like that akun force an
enemy<00:02:26.220> out<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.550> lane<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:27.150> can<00:02:27.300> end<00:02:27.450> up<00:02:27.510> getting

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
enemy out of lane you can end up getting

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.750 
enemy out of lane you can end up getting
a<00:02:27.870> kill<00:02:28.110> which<00:02:28.349> is<00:02:28.560> obviously<00:02:28.920> much<00:02:29.459> more

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
a kill which is obviously much more

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.580 
a kill which is obviously much more
advantageous<00:02:30.239> than<00:02:30.690> actually<00:02:31.200> picking<00:02:31.410> up

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
advantageous than actually picking up

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.070 
advantageous than actually picking up
one<00:02:31.920> CS<00:02:32.340> so<00:02:32.910> this<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.180> just<00:02:33.300> an<00:02:33.480> example<00:02:33.989> of

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
one CS so this is just an example of

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.170 
one CS so this is just an example of
trading<00:02:34.470> effectively<00:02:35.040> early<00:02:35.400> as<00:02:35.519> Draven<00:02:36.000> and

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
trading effectively early as Draven and

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.880 
trading effectively early as Draven and
when<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.450> see<00:02:36.630> actually<00:02:37.019> exchange<00:02:37.470> a

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
when you see actually exchange a

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.039 
when you see actually exchange a
headshot<00:02:38.370> there<00:02:38.640> with<00:02:38.819> Kate<00:02:39.239> for<00:02:39.720> one<00:02:39.840> of<00:02:39.930> my

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
headshot there with Kate for one of my

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.229 
headshot there with Kate for one of my
exes<00:02:40.349> because<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.709> know<00:02:40.769> that<00:02:41.190> my<00:02:41.340> cue<00:02:41.970> actually

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
exes because I know that my cue actually

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.820 
exes because I know that my cue actually
does<00:02:42.390> more<00:02:42.599> damage<00:02:42.629> than<00:02:43.049> a<00:02:43.170> headshot<00:02:43.560> at<00:02:43.709> this

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
does more damage than a headshot at this

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.039

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
here and in general when you're playing

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.880 
here and in general when you're playing
against<00:02:54.569> Raven<00:02:54.959> you<00:02:55.079> always<00:02:55.410> want<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.709> focus

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
against Raven you always want to focus

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.770 
against Raven you always want to focus
Draven<00:02:56.579> that's<00:02:56.880> because<00:02:57.120> he<00:02:57.180> puts<00:02:57.390> out<00:02:57.480> so

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
Draven that's because he puts out so

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.870 
Draven that's because he puts out so
much<00:02:57.959> damage<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.620> if<00:02:58.829> he's<00:02:59.010> left<00:02:59.280> alone<00:02:59.610> he

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
much damage and if he's left alone he

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.640 
much damage and if he's left alone he
can<00:03:00.030> just<00:03:00.269> pick<00:03:00.450> up<00:03:00.599> his<00:03:00.720> axes<00:03:01.140> he's<00:03:01.410> not

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
can just pick up his axes he's not

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.920 
can just pick up his axes he's not
pressured<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.340> most<00:03:02.970> Ravens<00:03:03.510> aren't<00:03:03.840> gonna

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
pressured and most Ravens aren't gonna

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.690 
pressured and most Ravens aren't gonna
drop<00:03:04.200> an<00:03:04.349> axe<00:03:04.530> when<00:03:04.920> they<00:03:05.040> aren't<00:03:05.220> pressured

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
drop an axe when they aren't pressured

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.339 
drop an axe when they aren't pressured
so<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.030> see<00:03:06.180> I<00:03:06.209> actually<00:03:06.420> do<00:03:06.750> drop<00:03:07.049> my<00:03:07.230> axe

I've been using my q I have it ready to

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.009 
I've been using my q I have it ready to
activate<00:03:11.610> again<00:03:11.819> so<00:03:12.299> activate<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.750> straight

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
activate again so activate you straight

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.870

away<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.620> pick<00:03:13.799> up<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.069> second<00:03:14.489> kill<00:03:14.670> on

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
away and I pick up the second kill on

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.000 
away and I pick up the second kill on
Lulu<00:03:15.480> so<00:03:15.900> one<00:03:16.049> of<00:03:16.079> the<00:03:16.170> most<00:03:16.319> important<00:03:16.709> parts

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
Lulu so one of the most important parts

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.470 
Lulu so one of the most important parts
of<00:03:17.130> Draven<00:03:17.519> is<00:03:17.609> leading<00:03:17.970> his<00:03:18.090> axis

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
of Draven is leading his axis

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.210 
of Draven is leading his axis
effectively<00:03:19.079> now<00:03:19.350> what<00:03:19.500> I<00:03:19.530> mean<00:03:19.709> by<00:03:19.859> that<00:03:19.889> is

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
effectively now what I mean by that is

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.280 
effectively now what I mean by that is
if<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:20.850> don't<00:03:21.000> know<00:03:21.209> when<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.540> throw<00:03:21.780> your<00:03:21.810> q

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
if you don't know when you throw your q

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.020 
if you don't know when you throw your q
you<00:03:22.620> can<00:03:22.799> right-click<00:03:23.040> somewhere<00:03:23.489> near<00:03:23.850> you

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
you can right-click somewhere near you

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.059 
you can right-click somewhere near you
and<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.540> axe<00:03:24.720> will<00:03:24.989> then<00:03:25.139> land<00:03:25.440> in<00:03:25.650> that<00:03:25.829> place

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
and the axe will then land in that place

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.830 
and the axe will then land in that place
so<00:03:26.280> you<00:03:26.340> can<00:03:26.489> effectively<00:03:26.700> choose<00:03:27.299> where<00:03:27.569> axe

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
so you can effectively choose where axe

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.660 
so you can effectively choose where axe
is<00:03:28.049> going<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.440> land<00:03:28.620> now<00:03:28.980> this<00:03:29.130> is<00:03:29.250> really<00:03:29.430> good

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
is going to land now this is really good

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.340 
is going to land now this is really good
for<00:03:29.819> either<00:03:29.940> chasing<00:03:30.359> or<00:03:30.870> retreating

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
for either chasing or retreating

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.890 
for either chasing or retreating
combined<00:03:32.160> with<00:03:32.340> your<00:03:32.459> W<00:03:32.850> which<00:03:33.060> resets<00:03:33.569> every

combined with your W which resets every

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.080 
combined with your W which resets every
time<00:03:34.109> you<00:03:34.319> catch<00:03:34.829> your<00:03:35.069> Q<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:35.549> can<00:03:35.730> actually

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
time you catch your Q you can actually

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.479 
time you catch your Q you can actually
get<00:03:36.269> away<00:03:36.359> or<00:03:36.810> chase<00:03:37.380> people<00:03:37.590> really<00:03:38.280> really

so<00:04:06.180> that<00:04:06.209> I<00:04:06.329> can<00:04:06.569> keep<00:04:06.780> up<00:04:06.989> with<00:04:07.019> the<00:04:07.230> chase<00:04:07.470> and

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
so that I can keep up with the chase and

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.190 
so that I can keep up with the chase and
keep<00:04:08.190> attacking<00:04:08.760> her<00:04:08.940> this<00:04:09.510> next<00:04:09.900> clip<00:04:10.019> is<00:04:10.079> a

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
keep attacking her this next clip is a

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.659 
keep attacking her this next clip is a
little<00:04:10.500> bit<00:04:10.620> different<00:04:10.950> because<00:04:11.160> it's<00:04:11.430> not<00:04:11.579> in

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
little bit different because it's not in

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.129 
little bit different because it's not in
the<00:04:11.730> lane<00:04:11.910> phase<00:04:12.209> but<00:04:12.660> I'm<00:04:12.780> just<00:04:12.930> going<00:04:13.079> to

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
the lane phase but I'm just going to

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.930 
the lane phase but I'm just going to
show<00:04:13.260> you<00:04:13.290> just<00:04:13.530> pick<00:04:13.650> up<00:04:13.709> a<00:04:13.919> kill<00:04:14.250> here<00:04:14.549> I'm

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
show you just pick up a kill here I'm

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.330 
show you just pick up a kill here I'm
gonna<00:04:15.180> be<00:04:15.359> leading<00:04:15.540> my<00:04:15.780> axes<00:04:16.229> backwards<00:04:16.859> so

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
gonna be leading my axes backwards so

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.759 
gonna be leading my axes backwards so
it's<00:04:18.060> basically<00:04:18.959> what<00:04:19.380> I<00:04:19.410> was<00:04:19.500> talking<00:04:19.739> about

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
it's basically what I was talking about

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.319 
it's basically what I was talking about
trading<00:04:20.220> before<00:04:20.370> if<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:20.880> see<00:04:21.030> I'm<00:04:21.120> going<00:04:21.269> to

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
trading before if you see I'm going to

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:22.880 
trading before if you see I'm going to
attack<00:04:21.539> Sion<00:04:22.019> and<00:04:22.200> I'm<00:04:22.289> gonna<00:04:22.380> pace<00:04:22.620> max

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
attack Sion and I'm gonna pace max

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.620 
attack Sion and I'm gonna pace max
behind<00:04:23.099> me<00:04:23.490> this<00:04:23.729> is<00:04:23.909> just<00:04:23.940> applying<00:04:24.390> pressure

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
behind me this is just applying pressure

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.070 
behind me this is just applying pressure
onto<00:04:24.930> Sion<00:04:25.440> without<00:04:25.800> any<00:04:25.979> danger<00:04:26.400> to<00:04:26.430> me<00:04:26.700> but

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
onto Sion without any danger to me but

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.110 
onto Sion without any danger to me but
because<00:04:27.199> I'm<00:04:27.409> placing<00:04:27.860> wax<00:04:28.250> behind<00:04:28.639> me<00:04:28.819> so<00:04:29.030> I'm

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
because I'm placing wax behind me so I'm

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.640 
because I'm placing wax behind me so I'm
always<00:04:29.300> retreating<00:04:29.960> and<00:04:30.139> now<00:04:30.349> we're<00:04:30.530> going

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
always retreating and now we're going

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.230 
always retreating and now we're going
for<00:04:30.740> the<00:04:30.889> kill<00:04:31.189> I'm<00:04:31.400> gonna<00:04:31.580> place<00:04:31.819> my<00:04:32.090> axe

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
for the kill I'm gonna place my axe

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.420 
for the kill I'm gonna place my axe
forward<00:04:32.720> so<00:04:32.990> I<00:04:33.020> can<00:04:33.289> chase<00:04:33.530> him<00:04:33.560> and<00:04:34.069> we<00:04:34.189> end<00:04:34.310> up

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
forward so I can chase him and we end up

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.550 
forward so I can chase him and we end up
picking<00:04:34.610> up<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.330> kill<00:04:35.569> Germany's<00:04:36.229> obviously

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
picking up the kill Germany's obviously

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.619 
picking up the kill Germany's obviously
I<00:04:36.590> was<00:04:36.770> strongest<00:04:37.189> when<00:04:37.400> he<00:04:37.490> has<00:04:37.639> two<00:04:37.939> axes

00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:38.629 
I was strongest when he has two axes

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:41.200 
I was strongest when he has two axes
spinning<00:04:39.409> but<00:04:39.710> I'll<00:04:39.949> often<00:04:40.460> see<00:04:40.639> people<00:04:41.000> say

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
spinning but I'll often see people say

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.969 
spinning but I'll often see people say
that<00:04:41.389> it's<00:04:41.569> too<00:04:41.750> difficult<00:04:42.289> to<00:04:42.530> catch<00:04:42.710> both

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
that it's too difficult to catch both

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:45.369 
that it's too difficult to catch both
axes<00:04:43.490> so<00:04:43.909> it<00:04:44.090> doesn't<00:04:44.360> really<00:04:44.449> work<00:04:44.750> and<00:04:45.080> it's

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:45.379 
axes so it doesn't really work and it's

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:47.350 
axes so it doesn't really work and it's
just<00:04:45.590> a<00:04:45.650> silly<00:04:45.860> mechanic<00:04:46.400> to<00:04:46.550> have<00:04:46.699> two<00:04:46.939> axes

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
just a silly mechanic to have two axes

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.610 
just a silly mechanic to have two axes
spinning<00:04:47.750> now<00:04:47.960> all<00:04:48.169> I'm<00:04:48.259> going<00:04:48.379> to<00:04:48.439> do<00:04:48.530> in

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
spinning now all I'm going to do in

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.899 
spinning now all I'm going to do in
these<00:04:48.710> clips<00:04:49.009> is<00:04:49.159> I'm<00:04:49.280> going<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.460> show<00:04:49.520> you<00:04:49.669> how

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:49.909 
these clips is I'm going to show you how

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:52.480 
these clips is I'm going to show you how
to<00:04:49.969> use<00:04:50.689> two<00:04:51.050> axes<00:04:51.469> effectively<00:04:52.099> and<00:04:52.370> it

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
to use two axes effectively and it

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.520 
to use two axes effectively and it
doesn't<00:04:52.789> require<00:04:52.879> you<00:04:53.090> to<00:04:53.360> catch<00:04:53.750> both<00:04:54.050> axes

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
doesn't require you to catch both axes

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.070 
doesn't require you to catch both axes
because<00:04:54.680> admittedly<00:04:55.520> that<00:04:55.639> is<00:04:56.090> very<00:04:56.689> very

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
because admittedly that is very very

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.869 
because admittedly that is very very
difficult<00:04:57.319> to<00:04:57.650> do<00:04:57.889> so<00:04:58.069> as<00:04:58.430> you<00:04:58.460> can<00:04:58.610> see<00:04:58.669> in

00:04:58.869 --> 00:04:58.879 
difficult to do so as you can see in

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:00.520 
difficult to do so as you can see in
these<00:04:59.000> clips<00:04:59.210> before<00:04:59.479> I<00:04:59.719> go<00:04:59.960> in<00:05:00.050> for<00:05:00.229> a<00:05:00.289> fight

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
these clips before I go in for a fight

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.350 
these clips before I go in for a fight
when<00:05:00.770> I<00:05:00.800> recognize<00:05:01.310> a<00:05:01.340> fight<00:05:01.669> is<00:05:01.819> coming<00:05:01.849> I'm

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
when I recognize a fight is coming I'm

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.240 
when I recognize a fight is coming I'm
going<00:05:02.599> to<00:05:02.659> activate<00:05:03.110> my<00:05:03.409> cue<00:05:03.650> again<00:05:03.770> and<00:05:04.159> so

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
going to activate my cue again and so

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.860 
going to activate my cue again and so
I'm<00:05:04.340> gonna<00:05:04.490> have<00:05:04.639> two<00:05:04.849> spinning<00:05:05.270> axes<00:05:05.690> now

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
I'm gonna have two spinning axes now

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.659 
I'm gonna have two spinning axes now
what<00:05:06.020> this<00:05:06.199> means<00:05:06.469> is<00:05:06.740> that<00:05:06.770> during<00:05:07.280> the<00:05:07.460> fight

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
what this means is that during the fight

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.420 
what this means is that during the fight
I<00:05:07.879> can<00:05:08.090> focus<00:05:08.300> on<00:05:08.629> just<00:05:08.840> catching<00:05:09.289> one<00:05:09.620> axe<00:05:09.949> but

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
I can focus on just catching one axe but

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.369 
I can focus on just catching one axe but
for<00:05:10.580> the<00:05:10.639> first<00:05:10.909> couple<00:05:11.479> of<00:05:11.690> hits<00:05:11.870> I'm<00:05:12.169> gonna

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:12.379 
for the first couple of hits I'm gonna

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:14.080 
for the first couple of hits I'm gonna
have<00:05:12.500> two<00:05:12.740> axes<00:05:13.159> spinning<00:05:13.520> and<00:05:13.699> if<00:05:13.819> I<00:05:13.909> get

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
have two axes spinning and if I get

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.969 
have two axes spinning and if I get
lucky<00:05:14.449> I<00:05:14.479> can<00:05:14.690> catch<00:05:14.870> both<00:05:15.199> of<00:05:15.440> them<00:05:15.650> but<00:05:15.889> it

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
lucky I can catch both of them but it

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:18.010 
lucky I can catch both of them but it
means<00:05:16.069> you<00:05:16.310> have<00:05:16.430> a<00:05:16.460> massive<00:05:17.000> burst<00:05:17.419> of<00:05:17.690> damage

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
means you have a massive burst of damage

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.510 
means you have a massive burst of damage
at<00:05:18.169> the<00:05:18.259> start<00:05:18.560> of<00:05:18.650> the<00:05:18.770> fight<00:05:19.009> and<00:05:19.250> if<00:05:19.400> you

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
at the start of the fight and if you

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.980 
at the start of the fight and if you
also<00:05:19.639> activate<00:05:20.120> your<00:05:20.210> queue<00:05:20.479> before<00:05:20.629> the

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
also activate your queue before the

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.110 
also activate your queue before the
fight<00:05:21.199> starts<00:05:21.229> then<00:05:21.979> your<00:05:22.129> key<00:05:22.340> will<00:05:22.460> be<00:05:22.490> ready

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
fight starts then your key will be ready

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.420 
fight starts then your key will be ready
to<00:05:23.330> be<00:05:23.419> activated<00:05:23.509> sooner<00:05:24.500> which<00:05:24.860> means<00:05:25.159> that

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
to be activated sooner which means that

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.309 
to be activated sooner which means that
you<00:05:25.550> can<00:05:25.789> activate<00:05:26.360> it<00:05:26.419> again<00:05:26.599> get<00:05:27.050> another

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 
you can activate it again get another

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:29.589 
you can activate it again get another
two<00:05:27.889> axes<00:05:28.340> or<00:05:28.580> if<00:05:28.699> you've<00:05:28.849> dropped<00:05:29.029> both<00:05:29.300> you

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599 
two axes or if you've dropped both you

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
which is fine right here I dropped my Q

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.899 
which is fine right here I dropped my Q
and<00:06:09.080> tear<00:06:09.469> it<00:06:09.529> goes<00:06:09.680> to<00:06:09.889> engage<00:06:10.190> so<00:06:10.520> at<00:06:10.759> this

and tear it goes to engage so at this

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:12.879 
and tear it goes to engage so at this
point<00:06:11.180> I<00:06:11.360> can<00:06:11.629> act<00:06:11.779> out<00:06:11.900> my<00:06:12.050> Q<00:06:12.289> again<00:06:12.409> but

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:12.889 
point I can act out my Q again but

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:14.050 
point I can act out my Q again but
that's<00:06:12.949> going<00:06:13.129> to<00:06:13.190> be<00:06:13.310> on<00:06:13.430> a<00:06:13.460> 9<00:06:13.699> second

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
that's going to be on a 9 second

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.300 
that's going to be on a 9 second
cooldown<00:06:14.300> because<00:06:14.719> it's<00:06:14.870> ranked<00:06:15.110> 3<00:06:15.469> and<00:06:15.710> so

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
cooldown because it's ranked 3 and so

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.159 
cooldown because it's ranked 3 and so
I've<00:06:16.550> gotta<00:06:16.819> drop<00:06:17.089> it<00:06:17.240> again<00:06:17.330> and<00:06:17.810> now<00:06:18.020> I've

got no Q I can't fight it because I

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.269 
got no Q I can't fight it because I
don't<00:06:20.479> have<00:06:20.659> my<00:06:20.900> Q<00:06:21.139> available<00:06:21.680> but<00:06:21.949> if<00:06:22.099> I

bit sloppy because of the box and I
didn't<00:06:47.099> anticipate<00:06:47.309> that<00:06:47.729> was<00:06:47.849> actually<00:06:48.210> up

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:48.389 
didn't anticipate that was actually up

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:49.999 
didn't anticipate that was actually up
but<00:06:48.719> you<00:06:48.779> can<00:06:48.899> see<00:06:49.080> there<00:06:49.289> I<00:06:49.319> have<00:06:49.499> both<00:06:49.710> cues

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:50.009 
but you can see there I have both cues

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:51.350 
but you can see there I have both cues
active<00:06:50.460> so<00:06:50.550> I<00:06:50.610> don't<00:06:50.789> have<00:06:50.939> to<00:06:51.059> worry<00:06:51.270> about

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
active so I don't have to worry about

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.909 
active so I don't have to worry about
picking<00:06:51.719> them<00:06:51.990> back<00:06:52.169> up<00:06:52.379> I<00:06:52.559> know<00:06:52.680> there's

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 
picking them back up I know there's

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:54.589 
picking them back up I know there's
gonna<00:06:53.009> be<00:06:53.189> enough<00:06:53.430> damage<00:06:53.819> and<00:06:54.029> I<00:06:54.180> pick<00:06:54.360> up<00:06:54.479> the

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:54.599 
gonna be enough damage and I pick up the

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:56.239 
gonna be enough damage and I pick up the
kill<00:06:54.779> the<00:06:55.169> last<00:06:55.379> thing<00:06:55.499> I<00:06:55.529> want<00:06:55.649> to<00:06:55.710> say<00:06:55.830> is<00:06:56.099> the

00:06:56.239 --> 00:06:56.249 
kill the last thing I want to say is the

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:57.499 
kill the last thing I want to say is the
best<00:06:56.399> way<00:06:56.580> to<00:06:56.610> improve<00:06:56.969> the<00:06:57.119> Draven<00:06:57.449> is

00:06:57.499 --> 00:06:57.509 
best way to improve the Draven is

00:06:57.509 --> 00:06:58.700 
best way to improve the Draven is
probably<00:06:57.779> going<00:06:57.930> to<00:06:57.990> be<00:06:58.050> through<00:06:58.319> your<00:06:58.439> queue

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.710 
probably going to be through your queue

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.829 
probably going to be through your queue
cooldown<00:06:59.189> so<00:06:59.399> if<00:06:59.789> it's<00:06:59.999> always<00:07:00.240> if<00:07:00.629> you<00:07:00.719> always

00:07:00.829 --> 00:07:00.839 
cooldown so if it's always if you always

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:02.749 
cooldown so if it's always if you always
have<00:07:01.050> it<00:07:01.139> active<00:07:01.559> then<00:07:01.860> if<00:07:02.009> you<00:07:02.129> do<00:07:02.279> drop<00:07:02.580> it

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 
have it active then if you do drop it

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:04.429 
have it active then if you do drop it
there's<00:07:02.969> less<00:07:03.149> pressure<00:07:03.330> on<00:07:03.659> you<00:07:03.839> because<00:07:04.020> you

00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:04.439 
there's less pressure on you because you

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:06.079 
there's less pressure on you because you
can<00:07:04.559> just<00:07:04.649> reactivate<00:07:05.249> the<00:07:05.369> queue<00:07:05.550> again<00:07:05.580> and

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:06.089 
can just reactivate the queue again and
