00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
had a mishap where I broke my memory

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.990 
had a mishap where I broke my memory
card<00:01:13.439> by<00:01:13.770> accident<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.430> not<00:01:14.580> my<00:01:14.729> memory

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
card by accident this is not my memory

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.820 
card by accident this is not my memory
card<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.299> I'm<00:01:15.390> filming<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.619> camera

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
card that I'm filming on and this camera

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.109 
card that I'm filming on and this camera
is<00:01:16.979> starting<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.340> be<00:01:17.400> used<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.670> my<00:01:17.729> dad's<00:01:17.909> work

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
is starting to be used in my dad's work

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.399 
is starting to be used in my dad's work
so<00:01:18.420> it's<00:01:18.720> going<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.869> be<00:01:18.930> harder<00:01:19.170> for<00:01:19.200> me<00:01:19.380> to

single is I think a satin finish i would

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.400 
single is I think a satin finish i would
say<00:03:35.730> it<00:03:36.060> might<00:03:36.389> have<00:03:36.660> just<00:03:36.690> glitter<00:03:37.170> in<00:03:37.319> it

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410

haven't like increase in thickness or
whatever<00:04:56.820> but<00:04:56.970> it<00:04:57.120> looks<00:04:57.570> like<00:04:57.660> there's<00:04:57.870> a

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
whatever but it looks like there's a
