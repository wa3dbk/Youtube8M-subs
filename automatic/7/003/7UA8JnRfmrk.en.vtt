10-15<00:01:59.650> years<00:02:00.100> exactly<00:02:01.090> I<00:02:04.649> think<00:02:05.649> one<00:02:05.800> of<00:02:05.830> the

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
10-15 years exactly I think one of the

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.460 
10-15 years exactly I think one of the
largest<00:02:06.280> obstacles<00:02:06.970> for<00:02:07.479> my<00:02:07.810> generation<00:02:08.229> of

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
largest obstacles for my generation of

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.160 
largest obstacles for my generation of
people<00:02:08.619> who<00:02:08.800> are<00:02:08.979> interested<00:02:09.340> in<00:02:09.369> farming<00:02:09.670> is

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
people who are interested in farming is

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.020 
people who are interested in farming is
it's<00:02:11.170> really<00:02:11.560> almost<00:02:11.980> impossible<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:12.850> make

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
it's really almost impossible to make

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.120 
it's really almost impossible to make
the<00:02:13.180> money<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.840> buy<00:02:13.959> a<00:02:13.989> farm<00:02:14.319> through<00:02:14.709> farming

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
the money to buy a farm through farming

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.750 
the money to buy a farm through farming
there's<00:02:15.819> a<00:02:15.880> lot<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.120> really<00:02:16.630> great<00:02:16.780> internship

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
there's a lot of really great internship

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.160 
there's a lot of really great internship
opportunities<00:02:18.760> out<00:02:18.940> there<00:02:18.970> but<00:02:19.660> they<00:02:20.140> are

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
opportunities out there but they are

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.130 
opportunities out there but they are
hardly<00:02:20.950> enough<00:02:21.489> to<00:02:21.850> live<00:02:22.090> off<00:02:22.120> of<00:02:22.300> especially

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
hardly enough to live off of especially

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.699 
hardly enough to live off of especially
if<00:02:23.380> you're<00:02:23.590> living<00:02:23.769> in<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.130> city<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:25.709> once

if you're living in the city and once

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.550 
if you're living in the city and once
you've<00:02:26.980> completed<00:02:27.489> those<00:02:28.260> opportunities<00:02:29.260> to

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
you've completed those opportunities to

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.590 
you've completed those opportunities to
actually<00:02:29.650> make<00:02:30.130> money<00:02:30.489> as<00:02:30.760> maybe<00:02:31.209> a<00:02:31.300> farm

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
actually make money as maybe a farm

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.979 
actually make money as maybe a farm
manager<00:02:32.110> or<00:02:32.380> very<00:02:32.680> limited<00:02:33.220> so<00:02:33.580> we<00:02:34.480> both<00:02:34.690> have

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
manager or very limited so we both have

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.220 
manager or very limited so we both have
off<00:02:35.410> farm<00:02:35.950> jobs<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:37.650> we're<00:02:38.650> saving<00:02:39.160> so<00:02:39.489> that

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
off farm jobs and we're saving so that

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.630 
off farm jobs and we're saving so that
ideally<00:02:41.230> we'll<00:02:41.410> be<00:02:41.530> able<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.830> get<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.220> farm<00:02:42.489> of

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
ideally we'll be able to get a farm of

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.290 
ideally we'll be able to get a farm of
our<00:02:42.790> own<00:02:42.940> someday<00:02:44.220> we<00:02:45.220> happen<00:02:45.519> to<00:02:45.580> be<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.760> lucky

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
our own someday we happen to be a lucky

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.479 
our own someday we happen to be a lucky
few<00:02:46.569> of<00:02:46.780> people<00:02:47.170> who<00:02:47.319> have<00:02:47.739> purchased<00:02:48.010> a<00:02:48.310> piece

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
few of people who have purchased a piece

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.410 
few of people who have purchased a piece
of<00:02:48.519> ground<00:02:48.819> and<00:02:50.850> let<00:02:51.850> me<00:02:51.940> make<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.120> quick<00:02:52.390> i

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
of ground and let me make it quick i

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.449 
of ground and let me make it quick i
farmed<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.290> ground<00:02:53.500> my<00:02:53.680> wife<00:02:53.890> works<00:02:54.130> off<00:02:54.430> the

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
farmed the ground my wife works off the

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.039 
farmed the ground my wife works off the
farm<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.030> that<00:02:55.150> really<00:02:55.299> is<00:02:55.420> what<00:02:55.540> makes<00:02:55.840> it

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
farm and that really is what makes it

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.440 
farm and that really is what makes it
possible<00:02:56.489> so<00:02:57.489> I<00:02:57.519> put<00:02:57.970> that<00:02:58.000> out<00:02:58.239> right<00:02:58.390> now

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
possible so I put that out right now

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.280 
possible so I put that out right now
it's<00:02:58.720> by<00:02:58.900> no<00:02:59.230> means<00:02:59.440> a<00:03:00.570> glorious<00:03:01.570> solution<00:03:02.110> and

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
it's by no means a glorious solution and

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.840 
it's by no means a glorious solution and
all<00:03:02.440> of<00:03:02.530> a<00:03:02.620> sudden<00:03:02.650> were<00:03:02.980> in<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.250> Utopia<00:03:03.730> of

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
young farmers on the land but you know

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.860 
young farmers on the land but you know
that<00:03:07.930> said<00:03:08.200> five<00:03:08.470> years<00:03:08.739> down<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.310> road<00:03:09.340> and

that said five years down the road and

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.330 
that said five years down the road and
you<00:03:10.870> know<00:03:10.959> having<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.860> wrangling<00:03:12.250> that

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
you know having the the wrangling that

not to be so tied to the idea of owning
a<00:03:17.440> piece<00:03:17.590> of<00:03:17.620> ground<00:03:17.920> I<00:03:18.280> think<00:03:18.670> there's<00:03:18.820> going

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
a piece of ground I think there's going

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.430 
a piece of ground I think there's going
to<00:03:19.000> be<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.120> lot<00:03:19.329> more<00:03:19.359> opportunities<00:03:20.109> than<00:03:20.140> the

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
to be a lot more opportunities than the

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.640 
to be a lot more opportunities than the
at<00:03:20.650> least<00:03:20.829> in<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.070> near<00:03:21.100> future<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.880> find

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
at least in the near future to find

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.420 
at least in the near future to find
