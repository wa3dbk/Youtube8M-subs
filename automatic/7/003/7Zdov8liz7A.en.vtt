my name is Ken and this is my car which
finally<00:00:09.719> known<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.230> me<00:00:10.380> as<00:00:10.650> big<00:00:11.219> blue<00:00:11.490> I<00:00:13.969> have<00:00:14.969> a

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
finally known to me as big blue I have a

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.359 
finally known to me as big blue I have a
5<00:00:16.109> 11<00:00:16.470> cubic<00:00:16.650> inch<00:00:16.920> 440<00:00:17.550> with<00:00:18.029> aluminum<00:00:18.449> heads

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
5 11 cubic inch 440 with aluminum heads

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.099 
5 11 cubic inch 440 with aluminum heads
makes<00:00:20.369> very<00:00:20.699> good<00:00:20.910> power<00:00:21.090> maybe<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.779> little<00:00:21.930> too

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
makes very good power maybe a little too

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.109 
makes very good power maybe a little too
much<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.590> makes<00:00:22.890> 680<00:00:23.519> foot-pounds<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.060> torque

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
much it makes 680 foot-pounds of torque

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.140 
much it makes 680 foot-pounds of torque
and<00:00:24.660> for<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.380> reason<00:00:25.439> I've<00:00:26.220> eaten<00:00:26.760> up<00:00:27.029> a

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
and for that reason I've eaten up a

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.310 
and for that reason I've eaten up a
couple<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.539> 727s<00:00:28.670> in<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.789> past<00:00:30.029> two<00:00:30.510> years<00:00:30.539> so

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
couple of 727s in the past two years so

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.930 
couple of 727s in the past two years so
I<00:00:31.349> decided<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.279> install<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.300> Tremec<00:00:34.110> t56<00:00:34.940> which

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
I decided to install a Tremec t56 which

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.400 
I decided to install a Tremec t56 which
i<00:00:36.090> got<00:00:36.300> from<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> boys<00:00:36.840> at<00:00:37.020> American

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
i got from the boys at American

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.950 
i got from the boys at American
powertrain<00:00:37.850> who<00:00:38.850> are<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.360> leaders<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.840> my

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
powertrain who are the leaders in my

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.110 
powertrain who are the leaders in my
mind<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:40.710> type<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.219> application<00:00:41.850> those

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120

boys<00:00:42.390> are<00:00:42.510> fantastic<00:00:43.110> over<00:00:43.350> there<00:00:43.469> at

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
boys are fantastic over there at

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.279 
boys are fantastic over there at
American<00:00:43.920> powertrain<00:00:44.719> so<00:00:45.719> here<00:00:45.989> are<00:00:46.050> some<00:00:46.200> of

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
American powertrain so here are some of

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.619 
American powertrain so here are some of
the<00:00:46.350> things<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.680> had<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.010> do<00:00:47.300> here's<00:00:48.300> my<00:00:48.450> new

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
the things I had to do here's my new

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.479 
the things I had to do here's my new
upper<00:00:49.140> crossmember<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:50.700> replaces<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.360> loop

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
upper crossmember this replaces the loop

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.080 
upper crossmember this replaces the loop
that<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:54.180> original<00:00:54.719> car<00:00:55.050> has<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:56.030> it's<00:00:57.030> a

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
that the original car has and it's a

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.810 
that the original car has and it's a
little<00:00:57.329> too<00:00:57.480> tight<00:00:57.780> for<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.289> t56<00:00:58.820> application

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
little too tight for a t56 application

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.020 
little too tight for a t56 application
here's<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.020> original<00:01:01.170> loop<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:02.039> size<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:03.000> I

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
here's the original loop in size that I

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.539 
here's the original loop in size that I
had<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.329> cut<00:01:03.510> out<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.809> car<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.290> as<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.369> can

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
had to cut out of the car and as you can

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.320 
had to cut out of the car and as you can
see<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:06.060> fits<00:01:06.600> inside<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.350> one<00:01:08.000> not<00:01:09.000> leaving

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
see it fits inside this one not leaving

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.420 
see it fits inside this one not leaving
much<00:01:09.479> room<00:01:09.750> for<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.920> t56<00:01:12.500> 50:56<00:01:13.500> takes<00:01:14.130> up<00:01:14.310> a

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
much room for the t56 50:56 takes up a

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.670 
much room for the t56 50:56 takes up a
lot<00:01:14.700> more<00:01:14.880> room<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.780> floor<00:01:15.990> pan<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.530> had

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
lot more room in the floor pan so I had

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.980 
lot more room in the floor pan so I had
to<00:01:16.770> make<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:18.229> special<00:01:19.229> piece<00:01:20.509> so<00:01:21.509> I'll<00:01:21.810> see

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
to make this special piece so I'll see

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.609 
to make this special piece so I'll see
inside<00:01:22.290> my<00:01:22.500> car<00:01:23.840> that<00:01:24.840> I've<00:01:25.049> cut<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.380> floor

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
inside my car that I've cut the floor

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.289 
inside my car that I've cut the floor
out<00:01:25.799> which<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.430> had<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.729> do<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:26.909> fit<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
out which I had to do I fit the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.600 
out which I had to do I fit the
transmission<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.080> place<00:01:28.380> I've<00:01:29.250> made<00:01:29.310> a

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
transmission in this place I've made a

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.280 
transmission in this place I've made a
new<00:01:29.820> lower<00:01:30.060> crossmember<00:01:30.689> also<00:01:30.990> which<00:01:31.140> I'll

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
new lower crossmember also which I'll

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.380 
new lower crossmember also which I'll
show<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.770> second<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.820> here's<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.150> upper

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
show you in a second so here's the upper

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.240 
show you in a second so here's the upper
piece<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:34.259> I'll<00:01:34.560> show<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.770> how<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.130> this

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
piece and I'll show you how that this

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.929 
piece and I'll show you how that this
slides<00:01:35.520> into<00:01:35.729> place<00:01:37.369> goes<00:01:38.369> right<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.729> there

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
slides into place goes right in there
