00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
sadness and not very just generally not

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.780 
sadness and not very just generally not
very<00:02:30.050> positive<00:02:30.440> feelings<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.130> I<00:02:31.430> hadn't

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
very positive feelings and I hadn't

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.070 
very positive feelings and I hadn't
really<00:02:31.940> let<00:02:32.090> people<00:02:32.120> see<00:02:32.600> that<00:02:32.810> on<00:02:32.960> the

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
really let people see that on the

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.540 
really let people see that on the
outside<00:02:33.110> I've<00:02:33.590> just<00:02:33.740> always<00:02:33.920> kept<00:02:34.340> things

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
outside I've just always kept things

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.970 
outside I've just always kept things
very<00:02:34.820> upbeat<00:02:35.690> so<00:02:36.200> this<00:02:36.350> is<00:02:36.380> meant<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:36.680> I<00:02:36.770> guess

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
very upbeat so this is meant to I guess

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.650 
very upbeat so this is meant to I guess
show<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.400> contrast<00:02:37.610> between<00:02:37.940> how<00:02:38.300> it<00:02:38.450> feel<00:02:38.630> on
