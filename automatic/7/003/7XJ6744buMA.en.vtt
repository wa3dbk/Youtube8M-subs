 hello youtube friends here master 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.570

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.880
 this is my first video this channel is going 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.970
 to deal with tutorials and 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.340
 buildings 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.780
 good as we give that you are in 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.620
 survival and you want to make a 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.480
 Modern and very simple house and you do not want 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.260
 do as you want to do something nice 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.210
 but it does not tire you time that I would like 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.890
 make an action is very big 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.530
 well instead you can make a house 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.500
 simple and very easy like the one that also 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.380
 now gives a very simple house with 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.930
 few materials and good let's start with 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.270
 the tutorial 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:07.810
 Well the first thing we will do will 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.810
 be with the trunk go up four times 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.799
 then with the planks put 5 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:20.940
 and again go up 4 times 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:26.159
 and then here we put 9 planks 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:29.540
 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.590
 and then we do the same here 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.590
 again here 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:40.310
 I am in one another time four times 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:44.200
 and here we do the same thing again 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:48.899
 once done this we continue to 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.899
 seal all this with planks 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.000
 A) Yes 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.000
 we seal all this 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.119
 then we will fix the details 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.630
 what wood 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.630
 well we're still here 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.980
 there 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.190
 well once finished let's set aside 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.280
 let's move on to the good part of the roof 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:34.240
 we take the fir ladder and 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.010
 we started to put 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.010
 these stairs like this 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.000
 then here too 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.010
 staircase ladder staircase 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.600
 9 here we also do the same 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.170
 staircase ladder 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.170
 stairs 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:15.030
 this is a bit complicated because the 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.030
 stairs know in different ways 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.700
 now we remove this here and do what 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.700
 same here 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:29.640
 staircase ladder 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:34.100
 ladder ladder ladder 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.100
 ladder and staircase 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:43.080
 now let's move on to the next side of the 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.080
 ladder stair 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.110
 for here 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.890
 there 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:05.030
 then here also what 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.030
 h 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.730
 then we continue from this part here 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.880
 here we are already finishing 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:33.740
 good 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:40.000
 once finished we continue to catch 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:45.240
 the heels already vetoed and fill all this 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.770
 we fill all this here in this part 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.120
 Y 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.120
 of this is part 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:02.120
 but every day in this way he consents 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:04.430
 What we will do is going to be put 4 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:12.860
 4 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:14.670
 1 2 3 4 1 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.910
 3. 4 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:21.330
 so on so that afterwards they can 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.880
 put it on 5 but in my case I'm going to 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.169
 put 4 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:29.210
 I already have this way 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.210
 then with the berries 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.610
 we have this 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.180
 and good that there are these forms now 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.569
 let's go with the inside 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.220
 here will go 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:45.170
 the door 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.920
 here we make some holes to be 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.920
 the Windows 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.400
 here on this side too 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.720
 in the punt back if you want 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.900
 also those windows I 'm going to 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.900
 do 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:17.500
 what are you looking for 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:20.030
 until the mind then gives us fill 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:24.730
 of Cristal 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.730
 all this say crystal glass 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.690
 here in front 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:40.650
 this part also 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:43.160
 then with the planks how to do the 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.160
 floor 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:53.100
 there is no acceptance at night 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.100
 here we do the floor 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:07.629
 Y 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:07.629
 the door 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.760
 Ok here 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:19.040
 we start this 

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:21.580
 this we take the double staircase 

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:24.449
 and here 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.449
 we would put 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.300
 a door 

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:29.300
 A) Yes 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:36.500
 we the decorations postulate own 

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.570
 account 

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.450
 and here I'm going to put the torch I do not know 

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:44.710
