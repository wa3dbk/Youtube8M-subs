 Detailed graphic shines after first 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.970

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.970

 this game no balls but 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.210
 microchips necessary in different 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.280
 own stages of effectiveness 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.460
 catch we just catch and catch 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.960
 can look the particular chip 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.250
 it has a lot to do with luck if that 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.690
 monster is caught or not 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.790
 If this is the case, this will happen 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.690
 automatically added to your team 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.880
 or saved the interface of course 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.380
 very good for all ios devices like me 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.869
 have been optimized 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.210
 on the left we find our bag with all 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.369
 possible items chips and others 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.960

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.570
 Furthermore , this menu serves 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.780
 corresponding pokédex 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.970
 where all 138 minutes are displayed 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.690
 if caught or already 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.690
 were seen 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.280
 There is also another online 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.890
 mode and most importantly the 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.959
 memory function playing with pokémon 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.250
 It is also very important here 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.540
 his score repeatedly 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.160
 Save before closing the apps 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.720
 it is not saved automatically 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.430
 right is our quest log in 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.680

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.540
 top right you will find one minimized 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.770
 the current you were in your 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:40.880
 area indicates the shop and the lucky 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.440
 symbol we come right away is moved 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.209
 hang up by finger and pull in 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.200
 respective direction by another 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:50.000
 click on the shoes will run through 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.250
 diamonds as a reward for quests 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.989
 we can shop in the shop and this 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.890
 then in a kind roulette in the lucky 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.890
 let it slip 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.000
 These mikromann are partly very 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.450
 rarely and will automatically be your team 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.310
 added or saved course 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.810
 There are also again trainers fighting for 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.310
 a pokémon game are common 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.380
 These are much better here 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.690
 made as in the other old pokémon 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.340
 game we can now decide whether 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.140
 we want a fight or not 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.480
 only with some exceptions can 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.670
 We do not do this the developer 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.620
 promises as already mentioned 138 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.780
 mikromann and several hours of gameplay 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.850
 and the whole for 89 cents 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.290
 I definitely have very big ones 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.940
 liked this game found that 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.760
 an optimized alternative to the 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.340
 the whole aggravation is the only drawback 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.769
 for some people it could just be that 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.820
 an English language edition are but 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.890
 I am sure that through the 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.750
 popularity still localized versions 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.010
 The game will be released 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.690
 definitely on your own 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.220
 that's really one thing for me so far 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.020
 the best games for you ever 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.090
 have played 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.550
 also on the price performance ratio 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.170
 I am very positively surprised what do you say 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.700
