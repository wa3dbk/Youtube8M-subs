of<00:00:28.830> my<00:00:28.859> ambitions<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.429> know<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.609> want<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.880> try

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
of my ambitions you know I want to try

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.669 
of my ambitions you know I want to try
to<00:00:30.090> push<00:00:30.480> in<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.660> band<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.080> even<00:00:31.320> further<00:00:31.470> and

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
to push in the band is even further and

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:48.750 
to push in the band is even further and
further<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.040> see<00:00:32.910> how<00:00:33.000> far<00:00:33.059> people<00:00:33.480> can<00:00:33.719> go

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.400 

basically<00:00:49.760> boils<00:00:50.149> down<00:00:50.210> to<00:00:50.660> a<00:00:50.870> centripetal

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
basically boils down to a centripetal

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.939 
basically boils down to a centripetal
force<00:00:52.070> you<00:00:52.670> need<00:00:52.879> to<00:00:52.969> keep<00:00:53.120> on<00:00:53.360> accelerating

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
force you need to keep on accelerating

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.950 
force you need to keep on accelerating
so<00:00:54.949> you<00:00:55.040> need<00:00:55.160> to<00:00:55.219> reach<00:00:55.339> a<00:00:55.460> certain<00:00:55.610> speed<00:00:55.960> and

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
so you need to reach a certain speed and

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.210 
so you need to reach a certain speed and
I've<00:00:57.110> worked<00:00:57.320> out<00:00:57.470> it's<00:00:57.769> quite<00:00:57.949> good<00:00:58.070> news

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
I've worked out it's quite good news

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.219 
I've worked out it's quite good news
actually<00:00:58.399> the<00:00:58.670> speed<00:00:58.879> at<00:00:59.180> the<00:00:59.239> top<00:00:59.360> is<00:00:59.809> eight

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
actually the speed at the top is eight

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:02.259 
actually the speed at the top is eight
point<00:01:00.440> six<00:01:00.559> five<00:01:00.680> miles<00:01:01.280> per<00:01:01.339> hour<00:01:01.550> okay

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
point six five miles per hour okay

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:23.030 
point six five miles per hour okay
that's<00:01:02.839> it<00:01:02.989> okay<00:01:03.739> three<00:01:04.159> two<00:01:04.430> one<00:01:05.089> go<00:01:07.270> 17
