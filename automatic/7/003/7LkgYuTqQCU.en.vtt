00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
pre-cut fret wire into the jig I

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.830 
pre-cut fret wire into the jig I
previously<00:00:58.320> set<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.800> jig<00:00:59.100> up<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.809> place<00:01:00.809> a

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
previously set this jig up I place a

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.080 
previously set this jig up I place a
spacer<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:01.890> there<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.219> case<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.730> width

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
spacer in there in this case the width

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
spacer in there in this case the width
of<00:01:03.239> my<00:01:03.420> binding<00:01:05.060> push<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.240> slider<00:01:06.540> up<00:01:06.659> against

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
of my binding push the slider up against

of my binding push the slider up against
it<00:01:10.070> remove<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.100> spacer<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.820> then<00:01:12.600> simply<00:01:13.049> run

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
it remove the spacer and then simply run

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.870 
it remove the spacer and then simply run
the<00:01:13.560> fret<00:01:13.950> wire<00:01:13.979> along<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.610> edge<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.909> file

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.160 

usually<00:01:20.880> about<00:01:21.030> four<00:01:21.299> or<00:01:21.390> five<00:01:21.540> passes<00:01:22.020> and

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
usually about four or five passes and

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.550 
usually about four or five passes and
it's<00:01:22.290> done<00:01:23.570> you<00:01:24.570> can<00:01:24.720> now<00:01:24.840> see<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.320> Tang

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
it's done you can now see that the Tang

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.140 
it's done you can now see that the Tang
has<00:01:25.799> been<00:01:25.979> removed<00:01:26.250> cleanly<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.090> precisely

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
has been removed cleanly and precisely

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.420 
has been removed cleanly and precisely
right<00:01:28.020> up<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.409> correct<00:01:28.650> depth<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.100> need<00:01:29.310> so

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
right up to the correct depth I need so

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.679 
right up to the correct depth I need so
there's<00:01:29.579> no<00:01:29.729> waste<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.240> end<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.509> fret

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
there's no waste on the end of the fret

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.690 
there's no waste on the end of the fret
wire<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.110> also<00:01:31.770> right<00:01:31.979> up<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.310> body<00:01:32.520> of

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
wire and also right up to the body of

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.440 
wire and also right up to the body of
the<00:01:32.850> fret<00:01:33.030> wire<00:01:33.079> so<00:01:34.079> now<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.439> turn<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.710> around

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
the fret wire so now just turn it around

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:49.099 
the fret wire so now just turn it around
wash<00:01:36.450> rinse<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.960> repeat

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:49.109 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:52.499 

and<00:01:50.109> that's<00:01:50.259> all<00:01:50.409> there<00:01:50.469> is<00:01:50.590> to<00:01:50.740> it<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:52.000> Terry<00:01:52.299> I

that<00:01:54.340> when<00:01:54.460> I<00:01:54.490> started<00:01:54.969> using<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.329> fret

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
that when I started using the fret

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.599 
that when I started using the fret
saying<00:01:55.719> father<00:01:55.929> from<00:01:56.229> LMI<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.950> quality<00:01:57.490> of

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:57.609

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
fret work on my bound fret boards went

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.770 
fret work on my bound fret boards went
up<00:01:59.770> tremendously<00:02:00.369> and<00:02:00.789> I<00:02:01.149> think<00:02:01.450> you'll<00:02:01.600> find
