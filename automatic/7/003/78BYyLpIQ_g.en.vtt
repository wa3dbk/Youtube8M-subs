similar<00:00:45.670> in<00:00:45.969> the<00:00:46.030> fact<00:00:46.059> that<00:00:46.390> you<00:00:47.230> know<00:00:47.350> the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
similar in the fact that you know the

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.799 
similar in the fact that you know the
whole<00:00:47.890> goal<00:00:47.920> is<00:00:48.429> to<00:00:48.699> get<00:00:49.329> the<00:00:49.510> low-level

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809

whole goal is to get the low-level
monster<00:00:50.260> out<00:00:50.379> first<00:00:50.679> protect<00:00:51.579> it<00:00:51.760> or<00:00:51.940> make<00:00:52.089> it

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
monster out first protect it or make it

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.090 
monster out first protect it or make it
level<00:00:52.510> up<00:00:52.629> quickly<00:00:52.899> by<00:00:53.229> the<00:00:53.260> effect<00:00:53.679> of<00:00:53.800> level

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
level up quickly by the effect of level

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.369 
level up quickly by the effect of level
up<00:00:54.219> like<00:00:54.399> I'm<00:00:54.519> doing<00:00:54.550> here<00:00:55.059> and<00:00:55.289> then<00:00:56.289> you

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
up like I'm doing here and then you

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:57.779 
up like I'm doing here and then you
basically<00:00:56.530> just<00:00:56.769> go<00:00:57.039> from<00:00:57.249> there<00:00:57.429> and<00:00:57.460> you

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
basically just go from there and you

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.200
