00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.600 

before<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:05.880> start<00:01:06.740> picking<00:01:07.740> up<00:01:07.950> masking<00:01:08.490> fluid

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
before I start picking up masking fluid

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.460 
before I start picking up masking fluid
with<00:01:08.939> my<00:01:09.090> brush<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.540> always<00:01:09.720> rub<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> little<00:01:10.290> bit

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
with my brush I always rub a little bit

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.620 
with my brush I always rub a little bit
of<00:01:10.710> detergent<00:01:11.130> into<00:01:11.520> it

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
of detergent into it

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.170 
of detergent into it
that's<00:01:13.080> dishwashing<00:01:13.710> detergent<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.640> whether

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
that's dishwashing detergent and whether

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.020 
that's dishwashing detergent and whether
I'm<00:01:15.299> using<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.750> splatter<00:01:16.049> brush<00:01:16.229> or<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:17.100> normal

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
I'm using the splatter brush or a normal

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.210 
I'm using the splatter brush or a normal
paint<00:01:18.330> brush<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.869> do<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.259> same<00:01:19.530> because<00:01:20.100> it

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
paint brush I do the same because it

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.430 
paint brush I do the same because it
helps<00:01:20.549> wash<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.570> masking<00:01:22.020> fluid<00:01:22.140> out

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
helps wash the masking fluid out

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.070 
helps wash the masking fluid out
afterwards<00:01:23.090> you<00:01:24.090> need<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.360> wash<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.750> masking

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
afterwards you need to wash the masking

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.510 
afterwards you need to wash the masking
fluid<00:01:25.110> out<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.590> your<00:01:25.740> brush<00:01:25.920> as<00:01:26.100> soon<00:01:26.340> as

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
fluid out of your brush as soon as

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.179 
fluid out of your brush as soon as
you've<00:01:26.670> finished<00:01:27.740> flicking<00:01:28.740> or<00:01:28.890> painting

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
you've finished flicking or painting

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.070 
you've finished flicking or painting
masking<00:01:29.580> fluid<00:01:29.700> because<00:01:30.149> it<00:01:30.270> does<00:01:30.450> dry<00:01:30.810> and

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
masking fluid because it does dry and

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.389 
masking fluid because it does dry and
then<00:01:31.259> it's<00:01:31.409> hard<00:01:31.649> to<00:01:31.799> remove<00:01:33.920> because<00:01:34.920> this

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
then it's hard to remove because this

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.719 
then it's hard to remove because this
bottle<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.330> almost<00:01:37.050> empty<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:38.130> very<00:01:38.369> easy<00:01:38.580> to

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
bottle is almost empty it's very easy to

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.840 
bottle is almost empty it's very easy to
just<00:01:39.119> turn<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.569> on<00:01:39.720> its<00:01:39.960> side<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.289> pick<00:01:40.770> up<00:01:40.920> a

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
just turn it on its side and pick up a

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.539 
just turn it on its side and pick up a
little<00:01:42.330> bit<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.659> masking<00:01:43.110> fluid<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:44.310> way<00:01:44.520> I

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
little bit of masking fluid that way I

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.430 
little bit of masking fluid that way I
don't<00:01:44.819> pull<00:01:45.270> out<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.450> lot<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.110> drip<00:01:46.409> it

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
don't pull out a lot and drip it

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.669 
don't pull out a lot and drip it
everywhere<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.659> do<00:01:48.659> use<00:01:48.869> another<00:01:49.170> method<00:01:49.409> as

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
everywhere I do use another method as

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:51.350 
everywhere I do use another method as
well<00:01:49.860> which<00:01:50.069> I'll<00:01:50.250> show<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.520> later<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:51.179> the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
well which I'll show you later in the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:00.980 
well which I'll show you later in the
video<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:58.670> do<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.880> lot<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.119> my<00:02:00.299> projects<00:02:00.750> on

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
video I do a lot of my projects on

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.559 
video I do a lot of my projects on
watercolor<00:02:01.860> paper<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:03.000> my<00:02:03.149> favorite

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
watercolor paper and this is my favorite

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:05.480 
watercolor paper and this is my favorite
one<00:02:03.720> to<00:02:03.869> use<00:02:04.080> it's<00:02:04.319> Fabriano<00:02:04.709> hot<00:02:05.190> pressed

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
one to use it's Fabriano hot pressed

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.669 
one to use it's Fabriano hot pressed
watercolor<00:02:06.000> paper<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.479> it's<00:02:06.899> in<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.319> block

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
watercolor paper and it's in a block

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.380 
watercolor paper and it's in a block
which<00:02:08.519> just<00:02:08.880> means<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:10.289> pages<00:02:10.590> are

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
which just means that the pages are

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.569 
which just means that the pages are
fixed<00:02:12.390> down<00:02:12.840> on<00:02:13.200> all<00:02:13.440> four<00:02:13.709> sides<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.280> they're

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
fixed down on all four sides and they're

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.390 
fixed down on all four sides and they're
just<00:02:15.019> just<00:02:16.019> separated<00:02:16.530> on<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.709> corner<00:02:17.190> there

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
just just separated on the corner there

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.550 
just just separated on the corner there
so<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.329> you<00:02:18.420> can<00:02:18.630> peel<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.109> you're<00:02:19.230> paid<00:02:19.410> off

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
so that you can peel the you're paid off

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.050 
so that you can peel the you're paid off
when<00:02:19.739> you<00:02:19.829> finish<00:02:20.160> this<00:02:20.400> stops<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.880> paper

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
when you finish this stops the paper

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.940 
when you finish this stops the paper
from<00:02:21.269> warping<00:02:21.570> you<00:02:22.170> don't<00:02:22.350> have<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.590> tape<00:02:22.769> it

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
from warping you don't have to tape it

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.970 
from warping you don't have to tape it
down<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.900> can<00:02:25.109> get<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.350> really<00:02:25.470> wet<00:02:25.739> and

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
down and you can get it really wet and

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.979 
down and you can get it really wet and
it<00:02:26.100> stops<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.489> from<00:02:26.670> warping<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.359> dries

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
it stops it from warping it it dries

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.430 
it stops it from warping it it dries
flat<00:02:28.790> so<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:29.850> hold<00:02:30.180> up<00:02:30.359> your<00:02:30.630> brush<00:02:30.900> with<00:02:31.260> the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
flat so you hold up your brush with the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.580 
flat so you hold up your brush with the
pen<00:02:31.739> facing<00:02:32.400> your<00:02:32.519> project<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.440> then<00:02:34.440> you

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
pen facing your project and then you

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.810 
pen facing your project and then you
turn<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:36.480> handle<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.650> brush<00:02:37.950> towards

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
turn the handle of the brush towards

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.729 
turn the handle of the brush towards
your<00:02:38.970> project<00:02:39.359> and<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.570> flicks<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.350> masking

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
your project and that flicks the masking

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.440 
your project and that flicks the masking
fluid<00:02:40.769> off<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.400> brush<00:02:41.640> onto<00:02:41.940> your<00:02:42.239> project

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
fluid off the brush onto your project

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.930 
fluid off the brush onto your project
I've<00:02:42.840> recently<00:02:43.500> just<00:02:43.920> started<00:02:44.010> doing<00:02:44.609> it<00:02:44.760> with

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
I've recently just started doing it with

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.289 
I've recently just started doing it with
my<00:02:45.209> paper<00:02:45.810> on<00:02:46.170> my<00:02:46.530> panel<00:02:46.799> leaned<00:02:47.640> up<00:02:47.819> against

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
my paper on my panel leaned up against

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.449 
my paper on my panel leaned up against
the<00:02:48.450> side<00:02:48.690> of<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:48.959> box<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.590> way<00:02:49.739> if<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:50.040> do<00:02:50.100> get

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
the side of the box that way if I do get

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.030 
the side of the box that way if I do get
any<00:02:50.609> droplets<00:02:51.180> from<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.600> brush<00:02:51.870> they<00:02:52.799> don't

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
any droplets from the brush they don't

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.610 
any droplets from the brush they don't
land<00:02:53.310> on<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:53.850> project<00:02:54.299> now<00:02:54.870> if<00:02:54.989> I<00:02:55.109> want<00:02:55.380> some

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
land on the project now if I want some

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.190 
land on the project now if I want some
bigger<00:02:55.799> bra<00:02:56.010> droplets<00:02:56.760> I'll<00:02:57.060> lay<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.049> paper

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
bigger bra droplets I'll lay the paper

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.410 
bigger bra droplets I'll lay the paper
down<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.829> flick<00:02:59.430> them<00:02:59.640> right<00:02:59.850> off<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.239> brush

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
down and flick them right off the brush

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.009 
down and flick them right off the brush
like<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:02.840> but<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:04.609> to<00:03:05.609> keep<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:06.660> splatter

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
like that but to to keep the splatter

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.979 
like that but to to keep the splatter
fine<00:03:07.530> it's<00:03:07.920> good<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.370> lean<00:03:08.549> your<00:03:08.670> project<00:03:09.120> your

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
fine it's good to lean your project your

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.539 
fine it's good to lean your project your
panel<00:03:10.290> up<00:03:10.410> against<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.859> side<00:03:11.069> of<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.340> box

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
panel up against the side of the box

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.300 
panel up against the side of the box
that<00:03:11.910> works<00:03:12.120> well<00:03:12.480> you<00:03:13.379> can't<00:03:13.650> really<00:03:13.799> see<00:03:14.159> it

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
that works well you can't really see it

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.449 
that works well you can't really see it
in<00:03:14.549> this<00:03:15.269> video<00:03:15.480> because<00:03:16.110> of<00:03:16.409> that<00:03:16.950> white<00:03:17.250> on

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
in this video because of that white on

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.309 
in this video because of that white on
white<00:03:17.959> but<00:03:18.959> you'll<00:03:19.440> see<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.709> a<00:03:19.799> bit<00:03:19.950> later<00:03:21.319> the

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
white but you'll see it a bit later the

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:23.690 
white but you'll see it a bit later the
other<00:03:22.470> way<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.709> you<00:03:22.950> can<00:03:23.310> load<00:03:23.489> up<00:03:23.670> your

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
other way that you can load up your

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.149 
other way that you can load up your
brush<00:03:24.150> with<00:03:24.450> masking<00:03:24.840> fluid<00:03:24.989> is<00:03:25.319> to<00:03:25.560> just<00:03:25.830> pour

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
brush with masking fluid is to just pour

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.839 
brush with masking fluid is to just pour
a<00:03:26.190> little<00:03:26.610> out<00:03:26.849> into<00:03:27.450> a<00:03:27.480> shallow<00:03:27.930> dish<00:03:28.230> and

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
a little out into a shallow dish and

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.020 
a little out into a shallow dish and
then<00:03:29.849> pick<00:03:30.060> it<00:03:30.090> up<00:03:30.299> that<00:03:30.510> way<00:03:30.750> I<00:03:31.760> realized<00:03:32.760> that

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
then pick it up that way I realized that

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.300 
then pick it up that way I realized that
if<00:03:33.269> I<00:03:33.480> splattered<00:03:34.049> on<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.560> black<00:03:34.769> panel<00:03:35.129> you

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
if I splattered on a black panel you

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.759 
if I splattered on a black panel you
will<00:03:35.430> be<00:03:35.549> able<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.849> see<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.510> effects<00:03:36.780> a<00:03:37.049> little

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
will be able to see the effects a little

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.300 
will be able to see the effects a little
better<00:03:37.920> so<00:03:38.400> I'm<00:03:39.590> flicking<00:03:40.590> masking<00:03:41.159> fluid

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
better so I'm flicking masking fluid

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.199 
better so I'm flicking masking fluid
onto<00:03:41.670> a<00:03:42.209> black<00:03:42.930> panel<00:03:43.379> now<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:43.939> the<00:03:44.939> first

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
onto a black panel now and the first

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.929 
onto a black panel now and the first
flicks<00:03:45.750> from<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.860> brush<00:03:47.069> will<00:03:47.400> be<00:03:47.549> a<00:03:47.730> little

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:47.939 
flicks from the brush will be a little

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.149 
flicks from the brush will be a little
larger<00:03:48.209> and<00:03:48.720> then<00:03:48.930> as<00:03:49.140> you<00:03:49.260> keep<00:03:49.500> going<00:03:49.980> and

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
larger and then as you keep going and

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.539 
larger and then as you keep going and
keep<00:03:50.220> splattering<00:03:51.000> you'll<00:03:51.599> get<00:03:51.810> a<00:03:51.840> finer<00:03:52.200> mist

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
keep splattering you'll get a finer mist

00:03:52.549 --> 00:04:04.350 
keep splattering you'll get a finer mist
so<00:03:53.549> it<00:03:53.640> just<00:03:53.790> depends<00:03:54.180> what<00:03:54.330> you're<00:03:54.540> after

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.420 

so<00:04:04.990> remember<00:04:05.410> to<00:04:05.530> wash<00:04:05.770> your<00:04:05.980> brush<00:04:06.130> straight

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
so remember to wash your brush straight

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.310 
so remember to wash your brush straight
after<00:04:06.730> you're<00:04:06.850> finished<00:04:07.200> clicking<00:04:08.200> the

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
after you're finished clicking the

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.560 
after you're finished clicking the
musket<00:04:08.680> fluid<00:04:09.070> and<00:04:09.250> let<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.150> masking<00:04:10.540> fluid

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
musket fluid and let the masking fluid

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.140 
musket fluid and let the masking fluid
dry<00:04:11.170> completely<00:04:11.710> which<00:04:12.010> is<00:04:12.160> usually<00:04:12.520> about<00:04:12.760> 20

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
dry completely which is usually about 20

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.400 
dry completely which is usually about 20
minutes<00:04:13.510> now<00:04:14.500> to<00:04:14.560> show<00:04:14.890> you<00:04:14.950> what<00:04:15.070> I<00:04:16.290> ended<00:04:17.290> up

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
minutes now to show you what I ended up

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.750 
minutes now to show you what I ended up
with<00:04:17.470> with<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:17.920> masking<00:04:18.250> fluid<00:04:18.280> I'm<00:04:18.549> just

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
with with the masking fluid I'm just

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.570 
with with the masking fluid I'm just
blaring<00:04:19.330> some<00:04:19.540> color<00:04:19.810> over<00:04:20.260> that<00:04:20.580> mainly

under<00:05:06.610> the<00:05:07.300> masking<00:05:07.690> fluid<00:05:07.840> when<00:05:08.140> you<00:05:08.260> started

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.350 

so<00:05:13.780> I<00:05:14.780> finished<00:05:15.320> off<00:05:15.590> this<00:05:15.800> video<00:05:16.580> with<00:05:16.880> just<00:05:17.090> a

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
so I finished off this video with just a

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.720 
so I finished off this video with just a
few<00:05:17.750> examples<00:05:18.350> where<00:05:18.560> I<00:05:18.620> used<00:05:19.010> masking<00:05:19.580> fluid

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
few examples where I used masking fluid

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.480 
few examples where I used masking fluid
as<00:05:20.630> the<00:05:20.900> one<00:05:21.080> I<00:05:21.290> showed<00:05:21.590> at<00:05:21.740> the<00:05:21.770> beginning<00:05:22.310> I

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
as the one I showed at the beginning I

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.210 
as the one I showed at the beginning I
didn't<00:05:23.180> splatter<00:05:23.480> a<00:05:23.600> lot<00:05:23.930> there<00:05:24.260> but<00:05:24.530> you<00:05:25.010> can

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
didn't splatter a lot there but you can

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.390 
didn't splatter a lot there but you can
see<00:05:25.370> it<00:05:25.460> in<00:05:25.550> the<00:05:25.670> sky<00:05:26.090> and<00:05:26.390> on<00:05:26.690> the<00:05:26.900> trees<00:05:27.400> this

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
see it in the sky and on the trees this

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.120 
see it in the sky and on the trees this
one<00:05:28.640> I<00:05:28.670> started<00:05:29.180> with<00:05:29.330> a<00:05:29.360> cream<00:05:29.750> card<00:05:30.170> base

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
one I started with a cream card base

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.300 
one I started with a cream card base
well<00:05:31.490> a<00:05:31.520> cream<00:05:32.150> panel<00:05:32.600> and<00:05:33.190> splattered<00:05:34.190> on

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
well a cream panel and splattered on

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.610 
well a cream panel and splattered on
that<00:05:34.580> and<00:05:34.940> so<00:05:35.120> there<00:05:35.300> are<00:05:35.390> little<00:05:35.540> cream<00:05:36.320> dots

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
that and so there are little cream dots

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.490 
that and so there are little cream dots
all<00:05:36.830> over<00:05:36.860> the<00:05:37.160> panel<00:05:37.900> slightly<00:05:38.900> larger<00:05:39.290> dots

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
all over the panel slightly larger dots

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.530 
all over the panel slightly larger dots
on<00:05:39.770> this<00:05:39.950> one<00:05:40.130> I<00:05:40.160> may<00:05:40.520> have<00:05:40.700> even<00:05:40.880> flicked

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:41.540 
on this one I may have even flicked

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.060 
on this one I may have even flicked
those<00:05:41.720> on<00:05:41.930> with<00:05:42.110> a<00:05:42.140> toothbrush<00:05:42.620> because<00:05:42.800> it's

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
those on with a toothbrush because it's

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.980 
those on with a toothbrush because it's
an<00:05:43.160> old<00:05:43.310> card<00:05:43.610> and<00:05:43.910> I<00:05:44.030> could<00:05:44.630> have<00:05:44.720> done<00:05:44.870> it

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
an old card and I could have done it

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.010 
an old card and I could have done it
before<00:05:45.110> I<00:05:45.320> got<00:05:45.470> my<00:05:45.650> splatter<00:05:46.010> brush<00:05:46.870> there<00:05:47.870> you

before I got my splatter brush there you

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.480 
before I got my splatter brush there you
can<00:05:48.110> see<00:05:48.230> all<00:05:48.260> the<00:05:48.560> little<00:05:48.710> dots<00:05:49.010> that's<00:05:49.310> the
