00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.190
 well, how are we doing lately? 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.600
 many of you ask me about the 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.369
 traction of specific pectorals 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.170
 women I was wondering if it was harmful 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.970
 if it was beneficial if the chest increases 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.289
 If the chest decreases so I think 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.850
 there are many myths about this 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.470
 that's why we're going to try to cover what 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.029
 let's see if it's harmful if it's 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.619
 beneficial let's see tips for 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.029
 properly train the pectorals in 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.080
 so let's try to try all these 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.970
 topics that usually tend to 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.970
 ask without more let's go to it 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.110
 well first of all let's make a 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.760
 brief anatomical review so that after 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.620
 it is much easier to analyze the points 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.180
 next let's say we have two things 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.530
 completely apart first of all the 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.540
 mom and secondly the tissue 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.920
 muscle in terms of the breast we have to 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.390
 know that approximately as a rule 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.739
 general is between the second and 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.450
 the sixth rib and fifty 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.980
 superimposing the pectoral muscles 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.540
 who are the ones who will perform the action 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.910
 what is the function of the gland 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.500
 breastfeed the baby and we have to 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.210
 know that it is made up of three layers in 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.100
 first place a surface layer the 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.869
 superficial fascia that is found 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.140
 separated from the skin approximately 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.940
 0.5 or 2.5 centimeters of hillary posed in 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.320
 second place a more intermediate layer 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.910
 that would be formed by connective tissue 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.800
 very dense and that is responsible for acting 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.210
 as a support framework and thirdly 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.680
 a deeper test that would be 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.600
 formed by the glandular tissue that 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.950
 find let's say sustained at the level 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.330
 biochemical and functional 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.009
 estrogens that are the hormone exchange 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.479
 of good on the one hand we have the breast 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.619
 as I just explained and on the other hand 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.729
 we have the muscle tissue that 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.140
 we will mainly sit in the 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.119
 pectoralis major and we will focus on the 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.039
 pectoralis minor that muscle tissue 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.539
 obviously it's the one we're going to 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.500
 stimulate is to say that which is going 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.030
 commission to carry out the movement 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.770
 volunteer and the one that we are going to train 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.210
 when we work the pecs 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.340
 this muscle tissue is going to find 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.509
 wrapped by the muscular part and then 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.950
 make scams you want to separate 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.600
 structurally the muscle tissue of 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.140
 the breast and also unite it to this one 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.140
 mechanics 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.380
 well as you can see we have passed very fast 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.300
 because what interests mainly 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.860
 are the conclusions and conclusions 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.140
 are that the breasts are formed by 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.630
 glandular tissue adipose tissue 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.430
 connective and the superficial fascia which 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.780
 it is the question because these tissues do not 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.490
 respond directly to movement 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.050
 voluntary that means that we 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.060
 we condemn the pectoral we are not 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.709
 directly stimulating these tissues and 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.270
 therefore we can not hypertrophy and 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.220
 we can not gain muscle mass in them 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.870
 now the pectoral muscles do 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.070
 that we can gain muscle mass and if 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.810
 we gain muscle mass in muscles 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.610
 pectorals and we can say push 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.650
 the mammary gland if we can give 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.270
 certain momentum to the cup now well as 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.170
 I say we can give some impetus to the 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.760
 cup but we can not win 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.750
 circumference more than anything because that 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.000
 it would depend on the muscles of the back 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.200
 dorsal wide trapezius middle of the 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.200
 special exhibition and so on 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.450
 in previous points next to 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.860
 hypertrophy I've talked about gain 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.450
 muscle mass and I am aware that 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.250
 Many women are afraid to win 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.140
 a lot of muscle mass are afraid of 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.970
 get me big hypertrophy well in 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.319
 this point I want to emphasize what are 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.209
 the real expectations regarding the 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.250
 muscle mass gains in women and 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.690
 is that you have very difficult to gain mass 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.130
 muscular is very complicated that you 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.950
 make it as big or as you do not want 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.510
 be I want to say approximately one 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.459
 woman have 10 times less testosterone 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.989
 that a man and approximately has 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.000
 four times more estrogen than a 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.440
 man therefore physiologically is 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.030
 impossible that you put yourself as a 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.709
 man or you get very big as not 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.850
 you want to be basically because the 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.120
 hormone levels are not going to 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.069
 let's say that stereotype or 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.720
 those women of bodybuilding magazine 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.310
 that we usually see move away 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.870
 very much of the reality of saying that does not 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.190
 is how often these people are 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.690
 using exogenous aids to be able 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.130
 get those results and those 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.110
 muscle mass gains with so little 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.670
 body fat so if you work from 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.900
 Naturally do not worry because you do not 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.900
 you're going to get a big hypertrophy 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.010
 mainly these changes in terms of 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.329
 size weight shape and so on are going to 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.459
 depend on the main changes 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.450
 hormones in a woman's life now 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.980
 well on what firmness depends 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.810
 mainly depends on the density 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.790
 mammary, that is, the relationship between 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.170
 fat and connective tissue that as we have 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.700
 said before the connective tissue was 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.889
 In charge of acting as a support framework 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.510
 well I have to comment that in 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:58.819
 normal conditions and a stage 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.319
 concrete of a woman these factors are 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.510
 quite resistant to change me 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.439
 I mean in a stable normal environment with 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.180
 correct hydration conditions 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:07.219
 correct nutrition conditions 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.409
 it really is quite unlikely that 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:11.030
 these factors change now well 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.739
 we lose a lot of 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.780
 body fat yes it is possible that it 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.070
 see diminished for example a person 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.630
 obese what you have to do is train 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.530
 have to make a proper diet and in 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.910
 definitive what I had to do is 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.410
 lose body fat 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.240
 so consequently yes that is 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.919
 possible that you lose a certain amount of 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.330
 mammary gland but not because it 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.949
 grace of pectoral not because I train 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.630
 properly the pectoral but because in 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.849
 yes you have to reduce your body fat 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.380
 something similar happens with the athletes of 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:35.919
 elite that has a body percentage 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.919
 very low 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.430
 well at this point I want to comment 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.990
 some important aspects so that 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.060
 we can get much more out of some 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.710
 Workouts first comment 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.390
 that women have as much 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.490
 intramuscular triglycerides and these 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.650
 they help as an energy substrate during 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.510
 the edition of any exercise is more 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.950
 more or less a woman reduces around a 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.780
 50 percent less on sebas 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.520
 glycogen compared to any man my 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.050
 personal advice then is that 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.850
 you work in ranges of between 8 and 12 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.140
 repetitions is to say that I think I 'm going to 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.420
 get more out of it than in ranges of 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.400
 lower repetitions now well this 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.810
 is a guide these are examples by 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.130
 Of course there will always be 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.570
 individualize especially depending on 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.660
 the person according to the objective 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.770
 etcetera well in second place 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.970
 we would have to focus especially on 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.100
 the upper portion of the pectoralis major 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.420
 that is to say in the clavicle more than anything 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.250
 because it's the part that is really going to 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.440
 be more visible so it's worth it 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.030
 that is a little more trained now well 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.740
 that does not have to be the only thing 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.240
 we train but I think that since it 's 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.139
 the most visible is worth dedicating 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.610
 a little more attention 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:35.139
 I personally believe that it is more 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.490
 interesting a work with dumbbells or 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:37.990
 a job with leverage machines 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.909
 independent of independent arms 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.979
 more than anything to avoid problems of 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:43.360
 pain sensitivity problems for 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:44.979
 be able to work with a range of travel 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.300
 bigger I think these are the three 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.919
 considerations that would have accounts of 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.029
 face pectoral work in a 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.029
 women's concrete work 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.670
 well in conclusion relax the pectoral 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.530
 correctly only you are going to 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.630
 put things that are positive a better 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.890
 muscle tone a better tone in the fascia 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.510
 that wraps the breast as agreed to its 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.310
 structural support function goes to 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.050
 get it partially in the long term 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.880
 his fall is avoided obviously they are going to 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.070
 fall but it's partially going to get 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.060
 avoid you're going to improve your strength you're going to 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.440
 get to balance certain 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.030
 decompensation and stabilize a lot 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.170
 better your scapular waist you're going to 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.600
 get avoid injuries 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.710
 in short really if you work it in a way 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.360
 right you're just going to get things
