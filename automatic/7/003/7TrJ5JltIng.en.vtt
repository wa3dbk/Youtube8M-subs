00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.320
 everyone is here is the boss and today you 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.710
 I wanted to talk about a question that 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.680
 I thought it had been closed for several years 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:31.630
 of the infinite debate on the term o 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.630
 heel wide the initials 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.989
 then I premise ourselves for years 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.340
 its taboo in the bayern we always have 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.989
 defended the use of the word attack for 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.520
 identify the fans we have 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.610
 also written several articles that 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.710
 show that in Italy and in Europe it is 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.670
 it is normal to call yourself otaku if you are 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.910
 passionate 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.309
 we have also shown that in Japan 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.310
 the thing is a bit ambiguous because there are those 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.729
 he claims he means sick 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.020
 obsessed with social maniacs while 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.460
 those who claim the opposite 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:19.880
 and I still see people here today 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.600
 in Italy that stands on one of the 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.600
 two opinions and sells it for truth 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.330
 absolute that is but above all those who 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.520
 argue that otaku is an insult 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.890
 I see a lot of comments on facebook 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.440
 every time you open the question that 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.030
 they say you don't have to call yourself a cork not 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.860
 you can say this doesn't mean that 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.420
 because in Japan an insult and japan 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.950
 from here in Japan to Japan in Japan 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.539
 they have never been there 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.280
 or there have been people there 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.550
 week for tourism but above all 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.740
 now I also see a lot of videos 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.899
 even small and large youtuber from 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.679
 milano with this story 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:00.679
 then I'm not going to say that 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:03.580
 what they say is wrong but yes 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:06.319
 it's an opinion, not a truth 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.539
 because if you read the article we have 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.610
 written eto'o on the site 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.760
 the article that collects the 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.060
 testimony of keiko ichiguchi 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.900
 you discover that even in japan it is not known 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:24.230
 well if otaku means obsessed or 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.180
 I want it to be a word with meaning 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.390
 positive but because there is no real 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.050
 meaning does not exist meaning 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.709
 it depends on what we want 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.959
 the article says that later 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:42.590
 it is unpleasant news 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.310
 come to think that the otaku are 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.800
 all fanatics because it happened 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.840
 which often happens here in Italy 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.950
 a person a kid I commit a 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.140
 crime 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.360
 the police to investigate at his home e 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.760
 discovers that he is passionate about souls 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.730
 manga video games then make them 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.370
 imbecile service in which it is said to i 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.650
 two video games are violent manga 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.830
 slow and successful even in Italy when 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.080
 in 1996 they were the balls they have 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.030
 pulled the stones from the overpass and have 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.980
 given the blame that will come out it's all 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.650
 documented this the gist of the speech 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.200
 which you don't even know it hides there 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.840
 are many people who claim that 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.790
 to be otaku sitting while there are 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.880
 many others that support them 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:32.290
 otherwise there are manga like these that 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:35.590
 give them an idea of ​​what reality is like 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.810
 They do give you a bit of observations 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.330
 this is the daughter of the heel it is 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.599
 of the story of a man who finds himself 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.180
 suddenly a 9 year old daughter who 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:48.430
 he didn't know he had this daughter 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.920
 to find at home and discover that man is 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.950
 note was of those of the worst kind 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.230
 and the first volumes begin to show 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.750
 all the downsides of the otaku all 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.650
 what makes them in bad people 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:05.890
 that is precisely their way of escaping 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.430
 from life to close all the house 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.290
 perversions that year and beginning look for 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.989
 to show how much people are 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.530
 unable but then as you go forward 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:21.489
 in the manga the protagonist changes and yes 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:24.000
 evolves and that makes you see and puts you in 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.560
 also all those positive aspects 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.050
 that characterize them from people 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:33.220
 normal all those sides that make them 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.800
 often more human and ok, then of course 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.500
 there is a happy ending now not a spoiler 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.470
 this what i have to teach that in 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.300
 prejudice is rooted in Japan 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.950
 Tacus it is an incompetent social dinner 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.320
 etc. etc. 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.350
 but there are so many people who are not 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:53.300
 so and so you can't think of that 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:57.650
 are all as those described 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:05:00.620
 nhk that they are the hikikomori but they are there 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.139
 people people in Italy what happens 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.479
 in Italy we have on one side i 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:08.000
 ignorant children who define themselves 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:10.699
 taku so lightly without knowing 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.639
 nothing but in good faith 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:16.430
 on the other we have those that are for 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:18.919
 insulting little babies is just for 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.789
 appear smarter when not 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.159
 I'm 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:24.800
 I quickly read with an insult 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:27.349
 more bombs than the sun ciccione hoc 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.960
 those who behave this way 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:32.150
 they pass off as absolute truth that which 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.030
 in reality it is an opinion is an opinion 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.370
 that some Japanese have in 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.319
 against the otaku but then stronger 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.930
 they are the ones who come to tell you 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:45.500
 mature Jun few manga knows two or 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:47.870
 three and you call yourself otaku but what it wants 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.250
 say one that for example knows only 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.750
 naruto because generally on those who 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.849
 those who are more attacked 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:56.030
 I read did not have one that reads only one 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:58.819

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.830
 speech 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:20.690

 true meaning of the word taboo 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:26.029
 there may be opinions in the 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:28.699
 social issues will never exist 

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:32.330

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:34.879
 math or physics then be wary
