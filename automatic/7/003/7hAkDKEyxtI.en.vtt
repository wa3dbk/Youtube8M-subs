then it's nice because they translated
into<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.460> lot<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.210> different<00:01:18.740> time<00:01:19.740> zone<00:01:19.979> which

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
into a lot of different time zone which

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.630 
into a lot of different time zone which
is<00:01:20.250> really<00:01:20.400> nice<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.360> if<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.560> know<00:01:22.640> first

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
is really nice so if you you know first

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.490 
is really nice so if you you know first
thing<00:01:23.759> here's<00:01:24.119> physically<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:25.020> first

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
thing here's physically this this first

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.850 
thing here's physically this this first
column<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.369> PST<00:01:27.229> so<00:01:28.229> if<00:01:28.380> you're<00:01:28.530> on<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.740> west

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
column is PST so if you're on the west

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.380 
column is PST so if you're on the west
coast<00:01:29.009> remember<00:01:29.579> take<00:01:29.820> into<00:01:30.030> account<00:01:30.210> they

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
coast remember take into account they

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.330 
coast remember take into account they
like<00:01:30.540> savings<00:01:30.960> they<00:01:31.049> have<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.229> add<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.560> out<00:01:31.680> so

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
like savings they have to add it out so

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.719 
like savings they have to add it out so
first<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.759> if<00:01:32.909> your<00:01:33.060> digit<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.479> a0<00:01:33.509> or<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.049> five

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
first is if your digit is a0 or a five

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.249 
first is if your digit is a0 or a five
so<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.090> further<00:01:36.270> second<00:01:36.689> turtle<00:01:36.900> time<00:01:37.079> it

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
so the further second turtle time it

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.080 
so the further second turtle time it
says<00:01:37.380> 23<00:01:37.740> that's<00:01:38.189> actually<00:01:38.460> midnight<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:39.030> you

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
says 23 that's actually midnight for you

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.460 
says 23 that's actually midnight for you
so<00:01:39.540> if<00:01:39.600> you're<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.810> west<00:01:39.990> coast<00:01:40.110> like

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
so if you're on the west coast like

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.469 
so if you're on the west coast like
California<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.579> know<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:41.790> gotta<00:01:42.150> have<00:01:42.299> one

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
California you know it's gotta have one

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.859 
California you know it's gotta have one
at<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:43.140> 21<00:01:44.009> at<00:01:44.220> midnight<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.479> remember<00:01:45.540> this

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
at a 21 at midnight and I remember this

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.510 
at a 21 at midnight and I remember this
is<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> second<00:01:46.409> time<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.770> always<00:01:46.890> 10<00:01:47.189> hours

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
is the second time is always 10 hours

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.480
