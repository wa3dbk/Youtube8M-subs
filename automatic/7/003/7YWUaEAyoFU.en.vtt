 Hello, how is the weather report? 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.040
 from the national meteorological service 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.889
 additionally I comment that today 6 of 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.010
 March marks 138 years of creation 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.760
 of the central meteorological observatory 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.080
 antecedent of the current service 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.070
 national meteorological 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.630
 let's go with the conditions 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.179
 meteorological that are the following 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.650
 we have front system number 41 that is 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.570
 extends from the northern part of 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.519
 national territory north of the 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.200
 gulf of mexico this keeps an event 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.270
 from north of moderate to strong intensity 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.220
 with wind challenges of up to 90 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.050
 kilometers per hour on the coast of the 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.539
 gulf of mexico this event in the 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.190
 24- hour forecast could reach 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:44.079
 what is the isthmus and gulf of 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.449
 tehuantepec and generate gusts of up 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.980
 100 kilometers per hour also the most 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.109
 cold air because it only maintains a 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.519
 potential for snow fall in the 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:55.440
 mountainous areas of the state of chihuahua 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:57.180
 coahuila in the northern part of the volcano 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.710
 let's go with the temperatures where it 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.629
 wait for the next condition the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.789
 minimum temperature is oscillating between 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.589
 4 to 8 degrees celsius the maximum could 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.140
 reach from 18 to 24 degrees 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.170
 celsius this in the course of this 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.909
 day 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.369
 for the northwest part we have the 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.860
 following conditions the minimum between 3 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.869
 at 10 degrees celsius the maximum between 10 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.159
 up to 20 degrees the region is expected and 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.570
 in general, some rains 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.840
 general due to displacement 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.340
 front system number 41 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.990
 for the western part of treatment 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.939
 national we will have the following

 5 and 2 degrees the maximum can reach 

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:35.210
 the 25 to 28 degrees celsius and this 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:38.829
 varying the region some rain very 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.829
 widespread for the central part 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.540

 the maximum between 21 and 22 degrees those 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.360
 let's remember some isolated storms 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.490
 due to the closeness of the frontal theme 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.110
 number 41 the yucatan peninsula the 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.090

 could reach 32 degrees celsius 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.570
 some isolated storms too 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.400
 due to the proximity of this system 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.409
