the wood or from the glue job it comes
into<00:01:12.840> my<00:01:13.049> shop<00:01:13.080> because<00:01:13.409> it's<00:01:13.680> buzzing<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.220> the

truss rod is loose there's no tension
that's<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.229> problem

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
that's a problem

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
the peghead but a stick of wood would

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.280 
the peghead but a stick of wood would
work<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.360> then<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.390> come<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.659> with<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.930> clamp

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
work and then I come in with a clamp

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.069 
work and then I come in with a clamp
from<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.189> top<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.000> peghead<00:01:45.420> just<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.930> hold

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
from the top of the peghead just to hold

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.289 
from the top of the peghead just to hold
it<00:01:46.259> firm<00:01:46.560> keep<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.189> peghead<00:01:47.430> from<00:01:47.850> twisting

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
it firm keep the peghead from twisting

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.960 
it firm keep the peghead from twisting
and<00:01:48.570> give<00:01:49.079> me<00:01:49.259> rigidity<00:01:49.890> because<00:01:50.700> I'm<00:01:50.850> gonna

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
and give me rigidity because I'm gonna

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.260 
and give me rigidity because I'm gonna
wrap<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.390> board<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:51.840> with<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> rubber<00:01:52.290> bands

support<00:02:21.940> at<00:02:22.240> that<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:23.650> only<00:02:23.800> have<00:02:24.010> about

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
support at that and you only have about

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.000 
support at that and you only have about
two<00:02:24.640> minutes<00:02:24.910> before<00:02:25.180> hot<00:02:25.750> glue<00:02:26.380> starts<00:02:26.770> to

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
two minutes before hot glue starts to

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.920 
two minutes before hot glue starts to
gel<00:02:27.250> on<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:27.940> if<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.240> gels<00:02:28.480> then<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:28.810> have

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
gel on you and if it gels then you have

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.540 
gel on you and if it gels then you have
to<00:02:29.080> warm<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:29.590> up<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:29.830> start<00:02:30.040> all<00:02:30.160> over

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
to warm it up and start all over

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.150 
to warm it up and start all over
so<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:31.450> warm<00:02:31.840> up<00:02:32.050> with<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.410> fretboard<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:33.040> the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
so I warm up with the fretboard and the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.610 
so I warm up with the fretboard and the
neck<00:02:33.340> using<00:02:33.610> desk<00:02:34.000> lamps<00:02:34.450> or<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.780> video<00:02:35.050> lamps

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
neck using desk lamps or the video lamps

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.490 
neck using desk lamps or the video lamps
sometimes<00:02:36.490> a<00:02:36.670> heat<00:02:36.850> gun<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.960> winner<00:02:38.140> even

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
sometimes a heat gun and the winner even

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.500 
sometimes a heat gun and the winner even
an<00:02:38.650> oil<00:02:38.770> filled<00:02:39.100> heater<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.940> get<00:02:40.120> them<00:02:40.240> warm

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
an oil filled heater to get them warm

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.470 
an oil filled heater to get them warm
over<00:02:41.380> a<00:02:41.410> hundred<00:02:41.740> degrees<00:02:41.860> maybe<00:02:42.370> around<00:02:42.550> 110

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
over a hundred degrees maybe around 110

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.990 
over a hundred degrees maybe around 110
then<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.709> glue<00:02:44.920> job<00:02:45.160> can<00:02:45.370> last<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.730> little<00:02:45.880> bit

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
then the glue job can last a little bit

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.170 
then the glue job can last a little bit
longer<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.720> glue<00:02:46.900> won't<00:02:47.050> set<00:02:47.320> so<00:02:47.500> fast<00:02:47.770> I<00:02:48.220> let

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
longer the glue won't set so fast I let

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.570 
longer the glue won't set so fast I let
it<00:02:49.270> dry<00:02:49.300> overnight<00:02:49.780> um<00:02:50.310> probably<00:02:51.310> could<00:02:51.520> have

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
it dry overnight um probably could have

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.510 
it dry overnight um probably could have
one<00:02:51.760> clamped<00:02:52.120> it<00:02:52.240> in<00:02:52.360> five<00:02:52.600> or<00:02:52.810> six<00:02:53.020> hours<00:02:53.520> but

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
one clamped it in five or six hours but

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.890 
one clamped it in five or six hours but
I<00:02:54.550> wouldn't<00:02:54.820> have<00:02:54.940> put<00:02:55.090> tension<00:02:55.300> on<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.690> truss

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
I wouldn't have put tension on the truss

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.900 
I wouldn't have put tension on the truss
rod<00:02:56.050> that<00:02:56.380> quick<00:02:56.650> so<00:02:56.860> overnight<00:02:57.280> is<00:02:57.520> good<00:02:57.700> for

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
rod that quick so overnight is good for

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.670 
rod that quick so overnight is good for
something<00:02:58.180> like<00:02:58.300> that<00:02:58.510> I'm<00:02:58.989> looking<00:02:59.350> forward

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
something like that I'm looking forward

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.460 
something like that I'm looking forward
to<00:02:59.770> getting<00:02:59.950> on<00:03:00.190> with<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:00.520> job<00:03:04.290> let's<00:03:05.290> see

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
to getting on with this job let's see

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.160 
to getting on with this job let's see
how<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.650> came<00:03:05.920> out<00:03:06.070> here<00:03:06.400> got<00:03:07.360> a<00:03:07.390> nice<00:03:07.630> little<00:03:07.900> up

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
how I came out here got a nice little up

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.890 
how I came out here got a nice little up
low<00:03:08.320> in<00:03:08.530> there<00:03:08.770> that's<00:03:09.100> what<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.340> wanted<00:03:09.760> I<00:03:10.030> can

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
low in there that's what I wanted I can

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.690 
low in there that's what I wanted I can
tighten<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.260> truss<00:03:11.470> rod<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.950> get<00:03:12.340> rid<00:03:12.519> of<00:03:12.580> the

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
tighten the truss rod and get rid of the

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.810 
tighten the truss rod and get rid of the
ball<00:03:12.880> I<00:03:13.650> can<00:03:14.650> keep<00:03:14.800> on<00:03:14.950> going<00:03:15.010> into<00:03:15.580> a<00:03:15.610> nice

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
ball I can keep on going into a nice

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.650 
ball I can keep on going into a nice
back<00:03:16.090> ball

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
back ball

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.550 
back ball
I<00:03:16.690> see<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.800> hump<00:03:18.010> it's<00:03:18.190> right<00:03:18.370> in<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.550> center

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
I see the hump it's right in the center

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.500 
I see the hump it's right in the center
loosen<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.650> back<00:03:20.890> straight<00:03:21.250> it's<00:03:22.209> all<00:03:22.330> really

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
loosen it back straight it's all really

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.190 
loosen it back straight it's all really
short<00:03:22.930> this<00:03:23.049> is<00:03:23.200> a<00:03:23.380> relief<00:03:23.799> gauge<00:03:25.200> watching

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
short this is a relief gauge watching

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.670 
short this is a relief gauge watching
the<00:03:26.680> action<00:03:27.040> here<00:03:30.360> that's<00:03:31.360> control<00:03:31.840> isn't

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
the action here that's control isn't
