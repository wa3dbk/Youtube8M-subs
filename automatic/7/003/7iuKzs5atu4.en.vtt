think that's how you say it I'm probably
mispronouncing<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.740> but<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.670> term<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.450> his

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.620 
mispronouncing it but the term that his
boss<00:01:30.900> used<00:01:31.229> against<00:01:31.680> him<00:01:31.829> was<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.970> racist

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
series quite a bit but getting into the

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.089

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
wear with the spear pretty much is a

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.259 
wear with the spear pretty much is a
kilo<00:03:24.160> I<00:03:24.400> think<00:03:24.579> that's<00:03:24.700> how<00:03:24.790> you<00:03:24.819> say<00:03:25.060> name

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269

kilo I think that's how you say name
like<00:03:25.599> I'm<00:03:25.750> sorry<00:03:25.989> if<00:03:26.109> I<00:03:26.200> butcher<00:03:26.500> her<00:03:26.620> name<00:03:26.829> but

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
she transforms into a spear like she is

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.190 
she transforms into a spear like she is
literally<00:03:30.040> a<00:03:30.250> spear<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:31.000> she<00:03:31.660> stops<00:03:31.989> herself

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
literally a spear and she stops herself

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.559

up there in the high heavens or maybe

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.229 
up there in the high heavens or maybe
you<00:04:07.810> know<00:04:08.310> there<00:04:09.310> might<00:04:09.489> be<00:04:09.549> a<00:04:09.669> tragic<00:04:10.090> ending

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
you know there might be a tragic ending

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.460

maybe she might die at the end of the
series<00:04:11.680> I<00:04:11.739> have<00:04:11.829> no<00:04:11.950> idea<00:04:12.280> so<00:04:12.849> that's<00:04:13.180> pretty

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
series I have no idea so that's pretty

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:14.729 
series I have no idea so that's pretty
much<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:13.930> episode<00:04:14.230> I<00:04:14.260> mean<00:04:14.410> there<00:04:14.500> was<00:04:14.560> a<00:04:14.620> lot

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
much the episode I mean there was a lot

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.140

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:18.009 
selfish nature of human beings how they

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:20.430 
selfish nature of human beings how they
continue<00:04:18.489> to<00:04:18.519> fight<00:04:18.910> and<00:04:18.940> stuff<00:04:19.419> like<00:04:19.630> that

a<00:04:20.470> really<00:04:20.709> cool<00:04:20.799> animation<00:04:21.489> especially<00:04:21.610> on

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
a really cool animation especially on

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.640 
a really cool animation especially on
some<00:04:22.150> of<00:04:22.240> these<00:04:22.300> fighting<00:04:22.810> segments<00:04:23.350> of<00:04:23.440> this

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
some of these fighting segments of this

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.410 
some of these fighting segments of this
episode<00:04:24.100> I<00:04:24.130> think<00:04:24.460> was<00:04:24.550> done<00:04:24.700> really<00:04:24.910> proper

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
episode I think was done really proper

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.140 
episode I think was done really proper
and<00:04:25.780> it<00:04:25.990> actually<00:04:26.140> beats<00:04:26.500> some<00:04:27.150> animation

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
and it actually beats some animation

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.820 
and it actually beats some animation
