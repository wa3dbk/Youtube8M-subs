00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
seem childish but it's actually quite

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.340 
seem childish but it's actually quite

that<00:02:23.730> read<00:02:24.060> talks<00:02:24.330> about<00:02:24.660> in<00:02:24.810> relationship<00:02:25.350> to

next<00:02:25.740> that<00:02:26.640> I've<00:02:26.760> just<00:02:26.790> really<00:02:27.150> loved<00:02:27.360> I

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
next that I've just really loved I

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.000 
next that I've just really loved I
hadn't<00:02:27.840> heard<00:02:27.960> people<00:02:28.260> talking<00:02:28.470> about<00:02:28.830> what's

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
hadn't heard people talking about what's

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.220 
hadn't heard people talking about what's
our<00:02:29.160> intention<00:02:29.640> for<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.000> relationship<00:02:30.240> and

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
our intention for the relationship and

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.720 
our intention for the relationship and
it<00:02:31.320> made<00:02:31.440> me<00:02:31.530> think<00:02:31.740> a<00:02:31.830> lot<00:02:31.860> about<00:02:32.100> what<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.430> want

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
it made me think a lot about what I want

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.540 
it made me think a lot about what I want
to<00:02:32.820> do<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.240> I<00:02:33.930> think<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.350> clarifies<00:02:34.980> when<00:02:35.370> to

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
to do and I think that clarifies when to

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.340 
to do and I think that clarifies when to
combine<00:02:35.880> money<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.360> when<00:02:36.480> not<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.750> because

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
combine money and when not to because

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.950 
combine money and when not to because
some<00:02:37.380> people<00:02:37.860> just<00:02:38.100> may<00:02:38.400> not<00:02:38.700> be<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.450> good<00:02:39.540> fit

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
some people just may not be a good fit

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.280 
some people just may not be a good fit
for<00:02:40.020> having<00:02:40.590> joint<00:02:40.860> accounts<00:02:41.750> so<00:02:42.750> deciding<00:02:43.230> on

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
for having joint accounts so deciding on

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.640 
for having joint accounts so deciding on
that<00:02:43.500> if<00:02:43.830> each<00:02:44.790> person<00:02:44.850> can<00:02:45.390> specify<00:02:45.930> what

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
that if each person can specify what

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
they need to feel safe and abundant in

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.890 
they need to feel safe and abundant in
the<00:02:48.990> world<00:02:49.760> you<00:02:50.760> know<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.120> saver<00:02:51.360> we<00:02:51.630> want<00:02:51.810> to

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
might be a conversation in the same way

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.440 
might be a conversation in the same way
that<00:03:11.550> you<00:03:11.670> would<00:03:11.700> create<00:03:12.090> your<00:03:12.180> shared

your shared intention around finances

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.520 
your shared intention around finances
and<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.580> best<00:03:17.880> way<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.150> look<00:03:18.720> at<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:19.020> I<00:03:19.260> think

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
and the best way to look at that I think

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.620 
and the best way to look at that I think
is<00:03:19.710> talk<00:03:20.310> about<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.640> end<00:03:20.880> of<00:03:21.210> your<00:03:21.360> lives
