00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.270 
around other dogs and now I think that
is<00:01:56.610> on<00:01:56.850> us<00:01:57.120> we<00:01:57.479> have<00:01:57.660> to<00:01:57.810> maintain<00:01:57.990> what<00:01:58.860> he

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
is on us we have to maintain what he

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.330 
is on us we have to maintain what he
instilled<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.210> her<00:02:00.479> Cesar's<00:02:01.220> lessons<00:02:02.220> have

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
instilled in her Cesar's lessons have

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.010 
instilled in her Cesar's lessons have
definitely<00:02:02.880> given<00:02:03.330> us<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.540> whole<00:02:03.840> new

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
definitely given us a whole new

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.260 
definitely given us a whole new
perspective<00:02:04.380> on<00:02:04.800> owning<00:02:05.160> dogs<00:02:05.550> and<00:02:05.940> what<00:02:06.119> it

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
perspective on owning dogs and what it

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.389 
perspective on owning dogs and what it
means<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.840> not<00:02:07.050> just<00:02:07.320> provide<00:02:07.530> them<00:02:07.920> with<00:02:08.070> food

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
means to not just provide them with food

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.210 
means to not just provide them with food
and<00:02:08.820> hugs<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.450> all<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.410> fun<00:02:10.619> stuff<00:02:10.800> but

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
and hugs and all the fun stuff but

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.199 
and hugs and all the fun stuff but
actually<00:02:11.400> there's<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.000> plan<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:13.170> leader

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
actually there's a plan and a leader

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.510 
actually there's a plan and a leader
nice<00:02:15.320> that's<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.470> song<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.920> like<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.340> thumb

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
that's been something a rule that we

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.740
