loop for like ever
with<00:00:25.199> everything<00:00:25.849> but<00:00:26.849> yeah<00:00:27.349> getting<00:00:28.349> back

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.380 
with everything but yeah getting back
into<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.769> yeah<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.399> know<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.000> there<00:00:33.270> are

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
into this yeah so I know that there are

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.330 
into this yeah so I know that there are
a<00:00:33.420> ton<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.690> videos<00:00:34.110> already<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.800> YouTube<00:00:35.100> about

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
a ton of videos already on YouTube about

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.709 
a ton of videos already on YouTube about
this<00:00:35.550> but<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.820> just<00:00:35.910> figured<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.360> would<00:00:36.510> make<00:00:36.540> one

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
this but I just figured I would make one

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.869 
this but I just figured I would make one
anyway<00:00:37.110> because<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:38.010> just<00:00:38.250> looked<00:00:38.430> like<00:00:38.520> fun

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
anyway because it just looked like fun

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.030 
anyway because it just looked like fun
and<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.510> was<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.660> good<00:00:39.780> excuse<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.200> just<00:00:40.559> make<00:00:40.829> it

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
and it was a good excuse to just make it

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.340 
and it was a good excuse to just make it
so<00:00:41.730> for<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.149> use<00:00:42.329> some<00:00:42.510> sample<00:00:42.899> containers

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
so for this I use some sample containers

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.279 
so for this I use some sample containers
I<00:00:43.530> had<00:00:43.860> already<00:00:44.250> from<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:45.600> products<00:00:46.200> that

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
I had already from just products that

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.350 
I had already from just products that
I've<00:00:46.410> sampled<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.070> also<00:00:47.730> some<00:00:48.000> empty

and with the coconut oil you definitely
want<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:11.010> use<00:01:11.159> coconut<00:01:11.400> oil<00:01:11.670> because<00:01:12.119> as

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
want to just use coconut oil because as

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.090 
want to just use coconut oil because as
most<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.260> probably<00:01:13.290> already<00:01:13.770> know

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
most of you probably already know

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.160 
most of you probably already know
coconut<00:01:14.640> oil<00:01:14.790> when<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.299> hardens<00:01:17.780> it<00:01:18.780> hardens

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
coconut oil when it hardens it hardens

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.030 
coconut oil when it hardens it hardens
back<00:01:19.409> into<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> solid<00:01:20.509> state<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.049> that's<00:01:22.530> really

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
back into a solid state so that's really

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.130 
back into a solid state so that's really
going<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.280> be<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.490> only<00:01:23.880> oil<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.930> can<00:01:25.110> use

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
going to be the only oil you can use

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.300 
going to be the only oil you can use
that's<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.710> get<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.950> consistency

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
that's going to get the consistency

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.910 
that's going to get the consistency
right<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.180> mean<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.570> may<00:01:27.900> be<00:01:27.930> wrong<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:28.380> just

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
right I mean I may be wrong but just

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.130 
right I mean I may be wrong but just
thinking<00:01:29.700> about<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.020> only

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
thinking about it it just is the only

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.440 
thinking about it it just is the only
one<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.380> makes<00:01:31.650> sense<00:01:31.820> to<00:01:32.820> use<00:01:32.970> coconut<00:01:33.240> oil

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
one that makes sense to use coconut oil

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.870 
one that makes sense to use coconut oil
for<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.560> yeah<00:01:34.740> coconut<00:01:35.310> water<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.610> can<00:01:35.790> get

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
for it so yeah coconut water you can get

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.940 
for it so yeah coconut water you can get
from<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.119> grocery<00:01:36.240> store<00:01:36.509> it's<00:01:36.990> pretty

using a paper towel underneath the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.240 
using a paper towel underneath the
candle<00:02:19.140> because<00:02:19.350> this<00:02:19.620> does<00:02:19.830> get<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.100> little

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
candle because this does get a little

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.090 
candle because this does get a little
messy<00:02:20.670> I'm<00:02:20.850> not<00:02:21.030> gonna<00:02:21.180> lie<00:02:21.360> I'm<00:02:22.110> just<00:02:22.950> gonna

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
messy I'm not gonna lie I'm just gonna

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.560 
messy I'm not gonna lie I'm just gonna
start<00:02:23.310> this<00:02:23.430> out<00:02:23.610> by<00:02:23.760> measuring<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:24.210> half<00:02:24.390> an

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
start this out by measuring a half an

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.540 
start this out by measuring a half an
inch<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.900> purple<00:02:25.350> crown<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.070> I'm<00:02:26.400> just

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
inch of the purple crown and I'm just

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.640 
inch of the purple crown and I'm just
indenting<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.240> line<00:02:27.510> into<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:28.020> with<00:02:28.200> my

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
indenting a line into it with my

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.680 
indenting a line into it with my
fingernail<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.460> I'm<00:02:29.640> just<00:02:29.910> gonna<00:02:30.030> cut<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.480> and

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
fingernail and I'm just gonna cut it and

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.470 
fingernail and I'm just gonna cut it and
then<00:02:31.500> I<00:02:31.530> cut<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.920> piece<00:02:32.610> in<00:02:32.820> half<00:02:33.000> again

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
then I cut the piece in half again

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.880 
then I cut the piece in half again
because<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.050> smaller<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.470> pieces<00:02:34.500> the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
because the smaller the pieces the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.100 
because the smaller the pieces the
easier<00:02:35.460> is<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:36.150> melt<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:38.720> now<00:02:39.720> I'm<00:02:39.840> just<00:02:39.990> using

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
easier is to melt and now I'm just using

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:48.780 
easier is to melt and now I'm just using
a<00:02:40.470> half<00:02:40.770> inch<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.340> white

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:03:00.650 

and<00:02:50.069> also<00:02:51.069> 1/2<00:02:51.640> inch<00:02:51.939> of<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.180> pink

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.270 

now<00:03:01.660> using<00:03:02.020> my<00:03:02.140> half<00:03:02.380> a<00:03:02.500> teaspoon<00:03:02.950> I'm<00:03:03.100> gonna

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
now using my half a teaspoon I'm gonna

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.340 
now using my half a teaspoon I'm gonna
get<00:03:03.430> my<00:03:03.580> coconut<00:03:04.000> oil<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:04.810> I'm<00:03:04.930> gonna<00:03:05.080> set

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
that aside then so that it's there when

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.540 
that aside then so that it's there when
I<00:03:07.360> need<00:03:07.660> it<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.020> the<00:03:08.440> ratio<00:03:08.830> that<00:03:08.890> I<00:03:09.100> use<00:03:09.370> is

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
I need it and the ratio that I use is

I'm just going to hold a spoon above the

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.730 
I'm just going to hold a spoon above the
flame<00:03:18.010> of<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.340> candle<00:03:19.320> there<00:03:20.320> are<00:03:20.440> definitely

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.440 
flame of the candle there are definitely
other<00:03:20.830> ways<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:21.520> can<00:03:21.700> melt<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:22.000> wax<00:03:22.150> I've

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
other ways you can melt the wax I've

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.520 
other ways you can melt the wax I've
seen<00:03:22.720> some<00:03:22.990> people<00:03:23.350> use<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:25.150> pop<00:03:26.050> method

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
seen some people use the pop method

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.140 
seen some people use the pop method
where<00:03:26.710> you<00:03:26.890> put<00:03:27.130> a<00:03:27.160> pot<00:03:27.430> of<00:03:27.610> water<00:03:27.790> on<00:03:27.940> the

where you put a pot of water on the
stove<00:03:28.210> and<00:03:28.810> then<00:03:28.870> you<00:03:29.350> put<00:03:29.500> a<00:03:29.530> glass<00:03:29.860> jar<00:03:30.280> in

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
stove and then you put a glass jar in

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.490 
stove and then you put a glass jar in
the<00:03:30.580> middle<00:03:30.850> of<00:03:30.970> it<00:03:31.120> and<00:03:31.360> kind<00:03:31.990> of<00:03:32.080> melt<00:03:32.290> it

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
the middle of it and kind of melt it

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.110 
the middle of it and kind of melt it
like<00:03:32.650> that<00:03:32.890> but<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:33.310> just<00:03:33.400> found<00:03:33.730> it<00:03:33.820> this<00:03:33.850> way

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
like that but I just found it this way

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.100 
like that but I just found it this way
works<00:03:34.360> easier<00:03:34.780> for<00:03:35.290> me<00:03:35.440> personally<00:03:37.050> so<00:03:38.050> I'm

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
works easier for me personally so I'm

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.530 
works easier for me personally so I'm
just<00:03:38.230> gonna<00:03:38.350> melt<00:03:38.590> down<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.830> wax<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:39.540> then

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
just gonna melt down the wax and then

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.360 
just gonna melt down the wax and then
when<00:03:40.630> I'm<00:03:40.720> done<00:03:40.750> that<00:03:41.140> I'm<00:03:41.290> going<00:03:41.620> to<00:03:41.830> hold<00:03:42.280> my

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
when I'm done that I'm going to hold my

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.520 
when I'm done that I'm going to hold my
coconut<00:03:42.880> oil<00:03:43.060> above<00:03:43.300> the<00:03:43.450> flame<00:03:43.690> for<00:03:43.900> a<00:03:44.140> couple

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
coconut oil above the flame for a couple

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.290 
coconut oil above the flame for a couple
seconds<00:03:44.980> so<00:03:45.130> that<00:03:45.160> it<00:03:45.460> melts<00:03:45.850> a<00:03:45.940> little<00:03:45.970> bit

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
seconds so that it melts a little bit

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.820 
seconds so that it melts a little bit
and<00:03:46.540> it<00:03:46.900> just<00:03:47.050> makes<00:03:47.200> it<00:03:47.320> come<00:03:47.470> out<00:03:47.560> of<00:03:47.620> the

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
and it just makes it come out of the

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.280 
and it just makes it come out of the
spoon<00:03:48.370> so<00:03:48.430> much<00:03:48.910> easier<00:03:49.330> because<00:03:49.870> you<00:03:50.140> are

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
spoon so much easier because you are

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.170 
spoon so much easier because you are
using<00:03:50.650> both<00:03:50.830> hands<00:03:51.190> for<00:03:51.430> this<00:03:51.610> so<00:03:51.820> it's<00:03:51.970> kind

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
using both hands for this so it's kind

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.450 
using both hands for this so it's kind
of<00:03:52.210> hard<00:03:52.480> but<00:03:53.410> doing<00:03:53.740> it<00:03:53.830> this<00:03:53.950> way<00:03:54.010> makes<00:03:54.340> it

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.460 
of hard but doing it this way makes it

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:02.040 
of hard but doing it this way makes it
so<00:03:54.550> much<00:03:54.640> easier<00:04:00.270> and<00:04:01.270> then<00:04:01.420> you<00:04:01.480> just<00:04:01.660> mix<00:04:01.840> it

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
so much easier and then you just mix it

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.740 
so much easier and then you just mix it
all<00:04:02.230> together<00:04:02.350> and<00:04:03.190> this<00:04:04.120> part<00:04:04.360> is<00:04:04.390> completely

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
all together and this part is completely

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.390 
all together and this part is completely
optional<00:04:05.020> but<00:04:05.410> I'm<00:04:05.500> adding<00:04:05.709> lemon<00:04:06.160> essential

and<00:04:49.490> now<00:04:49.790> using<00:04:50.150> a<00:04:50.240> piece<00:04:50.390> of<00:04:50.420> cardboard<00:04:50.780> that

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
and now using a piece of cardboard that

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.690 
and now using a piece of cardboard that
I<00:04:51.140> ripped<00:04:51.320> off<00:04:51.470> of<00:04:51.500> a<00:04:51.740> tea<00:04:51.920> box<00:04:52.130> I'm<00:04:52.370> just<00:04:52.550> kind

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
I ripped off of a tea box I'm just kind

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.240 
I ripped off of a tea box I'm just kind
of<00:04:52.730> making<00:04:52.790> a<00:04:53.150> funnel<00:04:53.690> so<00:04:54.440> that<00:04:54.470> it's<00:04:54.800> easier

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
of making a funnel so that it's easier

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:17.840

to<00:04:55.460> pour<00:04:55.670> the<00:04:55.790> wax<00:04:56.030> into<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:56.600> container

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.030 

when<00:05:18.390> cleaning<00:05:18.750> out<00:05:18.900> these<00:05:19.110> spoons<00:05:19.470> it's<00:05:19.920> a

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
when cleaning out these spoons it's a

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.950 
when cleaning out these spoons it's a
lot<00:05:20.250> easier<00:05:20.610> if<00:05:20.820> you<00:05:20.940> do<00:05:21.060> it<00:05:21.180> while<00:05:21.270> the<00:05:21.570> wax<00:05:21.690> is

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
lot easier if you do it while the wax is

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.450 
lot easier if you do it while the wax is
still<00:05:22.170> hot<00:05:22.350> and<00:05:22.380> you<00:05:22.620> just<00:05:22.740> get<00:05:22.890> a<00:05:22.920> paper<00:05:23.100> towel

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
and clean it out and it comes right out

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.920 
and clean it out and it comes right out
and<00:05:25.790> this<00:05:26.790> is<00:05:26.940> just<00:05:27.090> another<00:05:27.210> one<00:05:27.540> that<00:05:27.660> I<00:05:27.690> made
