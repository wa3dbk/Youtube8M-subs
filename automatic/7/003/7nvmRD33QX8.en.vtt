00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.539
 two 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.700
 hello how I hope you are very 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.520
 well this time we are going to do some 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.700
 Strawberries with cream are going to say like strawberries 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:20.320
 with cream yes but we will have to give 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:22.590
 a touch of de rompe and cinnamon here 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.470
 are the strawberries clean and disinfected 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.060
 if you want to use 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.240
 do not 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.279
 Chantilli cream can you do it from 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.360
 the recipes that I have shown you that 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.059
 take cream 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.070
 This is the cream because many times I 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.890
 they ask what kind of cream this is 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.440
 this law of different brands but it is 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.760
 whole cream 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.800
 we are also going to use the breaker p 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.600
 in some places it seems to me that I do not 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.699
 they know because they have also asked me 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.789
 what is the diamond p 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.750
 this is a drink with some alcohol 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.440
 it's sweet if it 's 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.430
 this has 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:08.210
 did not reach him here 12.5 times 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.909
 percent alcohol is not much in itself 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.369
 well we are going to need to and this 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.600
 drink is made from egg yolks 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.360
 milk egg 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.540
 in vanilla 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.120
 and among other things we are also going to 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.680
 need sugar sugar from which you 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.600
 want if you want you can use a 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.980
 substitute and cinnamon powder good 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.470
 look, you want to make them do a 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.440
 Comment on other videos have told me 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.660
 why do not I show the brands I decided 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.670
 show them so that you have the 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.610
 idea in other videos that I have 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.460
 shown and also asked me 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.229
 why do I show the marks that yes 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.720
 someone is sponsoring me so that 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.990
 I show them and sometimes I do not even know what 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.420
 think if I show them because I show them 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.240
 and if I do not show them because they do not 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.610
 show but in the end let's continue with 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.500
 the recipe 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.140
 I'm doing the recipe now in the 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.840
 table because in the kitchen one of the 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:14.030
 the few and it is not appreciated very well 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:17.200
 let's empty our base cream the 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.200
 amount you want 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:27.530
 is half of this ink this band- aid 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:30.970
 It has 450 milliliters 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.970
 and we are going to stir it 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.970
 we are going to add it here on the 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.960
 sugar also the amount that you 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.300
 you want depending on the taste of the polo 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.200
 sweet of each actor of each person or of 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.439
 everyone 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.439
 has also 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.879
 we'll see 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.160
 with this cream for enough stocking 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.770
 now we are going to put this little glass 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.390
 we're going to put so much grimace on Earth that 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.530
 look pretty 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:15.360
 but without messing up the outside 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.360
 and we are going to put our strawberries 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.590
 It is a super fast and super dessert 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.900
 easy if you want whole strawberries or if 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.370
 you want to chop it, it's your decision 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.000
 the straps of the 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.940
 good neighborhood so let's put it 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.720
 our dams and we're going to put the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.720
 cream in area 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.610
 did not see the cream I was putting 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.410
 over truth 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.800
 well, we are going to put our 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.750
 cream 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.850
 over 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.270
 the cream the cavity also that you 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.270
 want 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.310
 and once we have our cream 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.030
 let's add 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.030
 break 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.740
 and a trickle of breaks 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.520
 in rice pudding also use the 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.759
 py rhombus have asked me if 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:29.770
 can take the kids a little bit 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.770
 It does not hurt them, it does not have much alcohol 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.630
 and little bit breaks 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:39.110
 because they will not walk for a while children 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:42.080
 look with that break it was enough 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.530
 now we are going to put the block of 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.530
 cinnamon 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.120
 only by encimita 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:55.720
 it has been very fast and easy and here it is 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:59.830
 our 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:02.620
 our strawberries with cream and breaks 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.020
 good and if you like it, I invite you to 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.610
 the prepayments and apart from you giving the 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.300
 Dean and I send many 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.300
 little kisses 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.030
 it happened to me to tell them that if they want 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.850
 do them individually as with the 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.700
 glass of the cup or if you want to prepare them 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:25.240
 all together as in this case but 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:27.790
 many times if there are children some of 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.430
 you are afraid to give them this 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.560
 Breaks by the alcohol grades but 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.530
 as they saw it is very little what has 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.520
 alcohol is already a decision of each one if 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:42.670
 they want to do them like this or individual 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.890
 You can also make them into pieces and 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:50.220
 put them in the refrigerator to be 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:50.220
 well several are really delicious
