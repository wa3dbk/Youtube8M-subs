00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
few days you'll probably hear me say

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.940 
few days you'll probably hear me say
things<00:02:30.570> like<00:02:30.930> oh<00:02:31.080> man<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.410> wish<00:02:31.530> I<00:02:31.740> could<00:02:31.860> go

back the touchwiz our wish to go back to

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.570 
back the touchwiz our wish to go back to
some<00:02:34.080> other<00:02:34.170> device<00:02:34.500> alternative<00:02:35.100> but<00:02:35.520> you

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
some other device alternative but you

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.860 
some other device alternative but you
know<00:02:35.700> what<00:02:35.880> once<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:36.270> get<00:02:36.390> past<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.690> certain

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
know what once you get past a certain

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.480 
know what once you get past a certain
few<00:02:37.110> days<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.410> this<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.650> why<00:02:37.860> we<00:02:38.070> do<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.310> 30

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
few days and this is why we do the 30

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.160 
few days and this is why we do the 30
day<00:02:38.760> challenge<00:02:38.940> stuff<00:02:39.390> once<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:39.990> get<00:02:40.140> past

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
day challenge stuff once you get past

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.320 
day challenge stuff once you get past
this<00:02:40.410> initial<00:02:40.590> few<00:02:40.920> days<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.250> setup<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.790> find

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
this initial few days of setup I find

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.850 
this initial few days of setup I find
that<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:42.480> can<00:02:42.600> really<00:02:42.750> dive<00:02:43.020> in<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.500> it's

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
that you can really dive in and it's

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.199 
that you can really dive in and it's
something<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.250> don't<00:02:44.490> get<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.640> chance<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.060> do

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
something you don't get a chance to do

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.970 
something you don't get a chance to do
when<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:45.750> do<00:02:45.900> reviews<00:02:46.320> because<00:02:46.470> usually<00:02:46.740> you

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
when you do reviews because usually you

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.500 
when you do reviews because usually you
have<00:02:47.070> to<00:02:47.160> flip<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.459> review<00:02:47.790> around<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.240> quickly

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
have to flip a review around so quickly

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.660 
have to flip a review around so quickly
that<00:02:48.930> it's<00:02:49.350> challenging<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:49.920> get<00:02:50.070> a<00:02:50.130> real<00:02:50.370> feel

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
that it's challenging to get a real feel

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.420 
that it's challenging to get a real feel
of<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:51.270> device<00:02:51.630> so<00:02:51.930> 30<00:02:52.200> days<00:02:52.410> with<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.680> HTC<00:02:53.190> One

of a device so 30 days with the HTC One
it's<00:02:53.700> definitely<00:02:54.090> earned<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.660> it's
