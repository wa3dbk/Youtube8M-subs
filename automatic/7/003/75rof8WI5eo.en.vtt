00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
to install you just have to be

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.279 
to install you just have to be
jailbroken<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.620> course<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:54.329> have<00:00:54.600> to

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
jailbroken of course and you have to

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.130 
jailbroken of course and you have to
just<00:00:55.469> copy<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.949> paste<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.550> then<00:00:57.140> replace

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
just copy and paste it and then replace

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.000 
just copy and paste it and then replace
all<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.489> Minecraft<00:01:00.000> PE<00:01:00.510> app<00:01:01.170> folder

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
all in the Minecraft PE app folder

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.780 
all in the Minecraft PE app folder
that's<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.530> shader<00:01:04.769> we<00:01:05.640> have

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
that's it so this is the shader we have

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.539 
that's it so this is the shader we have
it's<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.810> wavy<00:01:07.409> world<00:01:07.740> that's<00:01:07.920> built<00:01:08.159> into<00:01:08.460> it

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
it's a wavy world that's built into it

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.450 
it's a wavy world that's built into it
as<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.700> can<00:01:08.880> see<00:01:09.470> there<00:01:10.470> are<00:01:10.590> shadows<00:01:10.920> and

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
as you can see there are shadows and

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.920 
as you can see there are shadows and
everything's<00:01:11.790> really<00:01:11.970> bright<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.540> really<00:01:12.780> like

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
everything's really bright I really like

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.050 
everything's really bright I really like
the<00:01:13.080> look<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.619> gives<00:01:13.799> everything<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
the look that it gives everything the

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.760 
the look that it gives everything the
fog<00:01:15.780> looks<00:01:16.200> pretty<00:01:16.890> good<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.869> when<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.259> think

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
fog looks pretty good and when I think

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.039 
fog looks pretty good and when I think
things<00:01:20.130> look<00:01:20.340> cool<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.790> like<00:01:20.970> pixelated<00:01:21.659> when

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
things look cool and like pixelated when

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.649 
things look cool and like pixelated when
they're<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.790> when<00:01:23.790> they<00:01:23.939> are<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.330> like<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
they're in the when they are in like the

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.010 
they're in the when they are in like the
the<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.890> don't<00:01:26.310> know<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.850> fog<00:01:27.119> normally<00:01:27.930> you

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
the I don't know in the fog normally you

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.240 
the I don't know in the fog normally you
wouldn't<00:01:28.140> see<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.409> trees<00:01:28.650> but<00:01:28.860> they<00:01:28.950> look<00:01:29.100> all

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
wouldn't see the trees but they look all

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.850 
wouldn't see the trees but they look all
like<00:01:29.400> weird<00:01:29.700> pixelated<00:01:30.329> see<00:01:30.509> looks<00:01:31.350> weird<00:01:31.680> but

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
like weird pixelated see looks weird but

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.580 
like weird pixelated see looks weird but
I<00:01:31.890> think<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.250> looks<00:01:32.400> really<00:01:32.700> good<00:01:32.970> now<00:01:33.590> some

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
I think it looks really good now some

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.830 
I think it looks really good now some
things<00:01:34.619> are<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.950> little<00:01:35.009> bright<00:01:35.360> such<00:01:36.360> as<00:01:36.509> sand

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
things are a little bright such as sand

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.499 
things are a little bright such as sand
as<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.829> can<00:01:37.950> see<00:01:38.100> sand<00:01:38.460> quartz<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.030> snow<00:01:39.299> now

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
as you can see sand quartz and snow now

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.149 
as you can see sand quartz and snow now
snow<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.869> not<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.020> big<00:01:40.200> deal<00:01:40.380> cuz<00:01:40.650> snow<00:01:40.979> is

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
snow is not a big deal cuz snow is

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.289 
snow is not a big deal cuz snow is
already<00:01:41.520> really<00:01:41.850> frickin<00:01:42.329> bright<00:01:42.619> but<00:01:44.299> sand

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
already really frickin bright but sand

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.090 
already really frickin bright but sand
is<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.780> only<00:01:45.899> one<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.079> really<00:01:46.290> annoys<00:01:46.590> me<00:01:46.619> as

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
is the only one that really annoys me as

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.569 
is the only one that really annoys me as
you<00:01:47.729> can<00:01:47.850> see<00:01:47.970> it's<00:01:48.119> too<00:01:48.450> bright<00:01:48.860> also<00:01:49.860> you

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
you can see it's too bright also you

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.350 
you can see it's too bright also you
kind<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.880> always<00:01:51.000> have<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.240> have<00:01:51.329> your

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
kind of always have to have your

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.399 
kind of always have to have your
brightness<00:01:51.720> done<00:01:51.869> because<00:01:52.049> if<00:01:52.110> it's<00:01:52.229> all<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
brightness done because if it's all the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.510 
brightness done because if it's all the
way<00:01:52.530> up<00:01:52.560> look<00:01:53.310> at<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:54.439> it's<00:01:55.439> just<00:01:55.770> it's<00:01:55.950> it's

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
way up look at this it's just it's it's

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.480 
way up look at this it's just it's it's
too<00:01:56.880> bright<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.979> you<00:01:58.979> kind<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.189> have<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.369> put

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
too bright and you kind of have to put

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.530 
too bright and you kind of have to put
your<00:01:59.579> brightness<00:01:59.880> all<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.030> way<00:02:00.149> down<00:02:00.299> but

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
your brightness all the way down but

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.850 
your brightness all the way down but
that<00:02:00.810> makes<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.049> look<00:02:01.200> good<00:02:01.229> because<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.770> the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
that makes it look good because of the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.130 
that makes it look good because of the
contrast<00:02:02.310> with<00:02:02.549> like<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.509> shadow<00:02:03.750> it's<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.020> bad

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
contrast with like the shadow it's a bad

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.630 
contrast with like the shadow it's a bad
thing<00:02:04.170> as<00:02:04.439> if<00:02:04.590> you're<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.860> cave<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.490> need

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
thing as if you're in a cave you need

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.180 
thing as if you're in a cave you need
lots<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.969> torches<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:07.170> yeah<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.649> water<00:02:07.860> is

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
lots of torches so yeah the water is

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.580 
lots of torches so yeah the water is
like<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.119> instead

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
like this instead

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.449 
like this instead
and<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:11.730> looks<00:02:12.000> freakin<00:02:12.600> amazing<00:02:12.780> oh<00:02:13.560> my<00:02:13.770> gosh

and it looks freakin amazing oh my gosh
I<00:02:14.670> love<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.030> water<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.540> water<00:02:15.720> might<00:02:15.900> be<00:02:16.020> one

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
I love the water the water might be one

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.030 
I love the water the water might be one
of<00:02:16.230> my<00:02:16.290> favorite<00:02:16.950> parts<00:02:17.130> about<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:18.330> shader

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
of my favorite parts about the shader

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.010 
of my favorite parts about the shader
yeah<00:02:20.040> that's<00:02:20.340> that's<00:02:20.550> really<00:02:21.270> it<00:02:21.480> also<00:02:21.720> the

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
yeah that's that's really it also the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.250 
yeah that's that's really it also the
way<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.230> world<00:02:22.440> incorporates<00:02:23.250> moving<00:02:24.030> water

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
way the world incorporates moving water

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.199 
way the world incorporates moving water
if<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.500> see<00:02:25.890> it's<00:02:26.160> there<00:02:26.459> are<00:02:26.610> waves<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:27.180> have

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
if you see it's there are waves you have

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.790 
if you see it's there are waves you have
to<00:02:27.360> look<00:02:27.510> right<00:02:27.780> up<00:02:27.959> against<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.380> block<00:02:28.590> and

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
to look right up against the block and

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.510 
to look right up against the block and
you'll<00:02:28.890> see<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.130> moving<00:02:30.020> so<00:02:31.020> yes<00:02:31.170> guys<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:32.190> is

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
you'll see it moving so yes guys that is

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.630 
you'll see it moving so yes guys that is
this<00:02:33.270> shader<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.410> looks<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.860> looks<00:02:35.010> quite

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
this shader it it looks it looks quite

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.640 
this shader it it looks it looks quite
nice<00:02:36.209> in<00:02:36.450> my<00:02:36.480> opinion<00:02:36.569> I<00:02:36.989> really<00:02:37.260> like<00:02:37.380> how<00:02:37.530> all

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
nice in my opinion I really like how all

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.930 
nice in my opinion I really like how all
the<00:02:37.739> shadows<00:02:37.950> look<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.370> really<00:02:38.400> like<00:02:38.790> the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
the shadows look and I really like the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.229 
the shadows look and I really like the
lighting<00:02:39.209> that<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.569> gives<00:02:40.280> yes<00:02:41.310> again<00:02:42.090> the

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
lighting that it gives yes again the

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.250 
lighting that it gives yes again the

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
really good graphics processor like it's

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.560 
really good graphics processor like it's
really<00:03:29.190> good<00:03:29.549> so<00:03:30.150> if<00:03:30.209> you<00:03:30.299> don't<00:03:30.450> have<00:03:30.540> a

really good so if you don't have a
higher<00:03:30.660> end<00:03:30.870> device<00:03:31.079> you<00:03:31.230> might<00:03:31.380> not<00:03:31.530> want<00:03:31.680> to

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
higher end device you might not want to

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.530 
higher end device you might not want to
install<00:03:32.040> this<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:32.640> one<00:03:32.970> last<00:03:33.120> note<00:03:33.269> that

you'll see in the OOH this really
showcases<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.390> how<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.780> fog<00:03:37.079> works<00:03:37.880> yeah

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
showcases the how the fog works yeah

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.920
