00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.230
 Android guys a day of course the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.660
 you will find better applications in 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.670
 my channel hello friends how are you waiting 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.949
 are already very well today we are going to 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.680
 talk about the theme of do not get or 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.410
 back from lollipop to kit kat that has 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.390
 been a serious problem for many and that 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.969
 have caused a hard break in their 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.070
 devices the companies have been very 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.620
 punctual when notifying that you can not 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.440
 return from lollipop to kit kat but 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.050
 many have ignored this 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.050
 information and the truth is that lollipop 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.149
 is just evolving is having 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.860
 many important changes some 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.170
 functions still we can not 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.510
 find little by little you will be giving 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.460
 in the installation of the different 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.920
 applications that will be updating 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.650
 to the new version it is obvious that it is not 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.660
 so fast 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.880
 it must be done there are many people who want 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.420
 come back here but it ends 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.030
 device in a garden that very difficult 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.060
 to repair until it comes out in the picture 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.460
 from lollipop factory so avoid 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.830
 return to an earlier version 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.580
 if they still do not have knowledge that 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:29.870
 returning mainly to 4.4 point 2 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.240
 and updating 4.4 causes point 4 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.180
 this problem that we call as hard 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.729
 bridge and that your device will remain as 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.369
 a brick or as a paperweight like 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.290
 they call him out there so let's avoid this 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.290
 the companies have been notifying us 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.390
 not only in motorola but all the 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.729
 companies have mentioned that once 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.850
 we do that we can not go back 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.790
 to an earlier version here tells us the 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.310
 note you can not degrade to a 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.369
 previous version of the software after 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.100
 install this update or improvements 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.470
 so you should take into account this 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.019
 information that you may have 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.580
 your device safe and not return to 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.920

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.290
 to prevent any good problem 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.390
