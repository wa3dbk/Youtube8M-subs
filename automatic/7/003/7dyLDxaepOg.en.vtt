 allocated a large 2-inch clock display 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.810
 the frame above and below the screen is impressive 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.760
 but when the latter lights up then 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.370
 there is a feeling that this is exactly the case 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.710
 should actually be watches themselves 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.770

 acceleration sensor and gyroscope help 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.880
 device to recognize that moment when

 you raise your hand and turn the display on 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.240

 the ability to read news feeds on 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:47.139
 my opinion is more than enough 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:50.139
 working with the interface is nice it is convenient 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:52.480

 an important advantage of the test 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:00.389
 device is a large number

 samsung gear's not deprived function 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:21.849
 having mastered the truth at the bottom of the company still need 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.669
 work is not always you can understand 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.409
 each other is correct if we talk about 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:28.569
 autonomy then built-in clock 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:31.180
 300 milliamp hours me 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.159
 enough for two days charging up to 100 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.159
 percent he's just over three hours 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:38.829
 through a special base last 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:41.819
 also serves as an external battery 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:44.019
 which capacity is 350 milliampere hours 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.540
 summing up the two week 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.329
 operating gears with confidence I can 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.650
 say just one technology change 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.839
 and improved 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.029
 and the company's bold experiments 

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:58.870
 particular samsung make our life 

00:03:55.029 --> 00:04:01.659
 more interesting and brighter of course gear s expensive 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.449
 their cost is within 290 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:06.159
 dollars in my mind 50 percent of 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.479
 of this amount you pay for the case and 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:09.909
 hardware stuffing 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:12.459
 another half is the impression that 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.730
 you feel possesses such tech 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.060
 about 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.060
 hands there
