00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 so hello and welcome to a new one 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.130
 Video 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.899
 Thanks for turning on my name 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.360
 more stands and today I have ten 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.040
 further questions for you answered the 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.540
 ask the pulls again through all 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.490
 possible topics are given by am 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.350
 Of course, most of them are asking 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.359
 something to do with what I have 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.039
 that's called youtube battlefield 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.350
 and everything else but we still have 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.740
 others ask the frequently asked 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.660
 were 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.460
 we'll just catch the youtube 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.650
 specific questions and there we have 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.660
 the first question is which 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.189
 recording program and that is 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.840
 really often asked how else 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.030
 So probably the number 1 question 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.800
 generally no matter which youtuber at 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.829
 I am the question answered that 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.020
 I eternal story with the pick video codec 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.340
 used the pick video codec is the 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.110
 not completely free and big story 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.879
 Of course not that means you can 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.070
 not just get it for free 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.050
 but it is definitely pretty good 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.180
 So just this pick video codec the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.309
 that'll get to me that I really 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.350
 can record constantly in 60 frames 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.449
 Of course only if the game in 60 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.270
 frames runs and at the same time i have 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.140
 thus a really nice little one 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.760
 file size that means I can too 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.590
 out infinitely more excitement 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.140
 the recordings will be natural 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.970
 someday to further processed videos 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.460
 and that brings us to our next one 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.189
 ask and how do you work 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.290
 your videos my videos that i make 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.600
 basically with sony vegas actually 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.830
 that's the basis for everything but above 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.720
 Of course, one more thing will come up 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.619
 a bit more that's the overlays that 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.030
 are the effects 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.020
 these are the introns the cars and 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.180
 Otherwise, and you can of course 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.549
 do not create with sony vegas 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.310
 that means the processing itself 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.530
 in the after effects and photoshop city 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.540
 that's really the most that ever 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.579
 after how easy it is to create 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.079
 then directly in after effects and if it 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.549
 not so easy because the tools 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.930
 not quite enough because programed 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.479
 I'll take photoshop and then 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.310
 then later animates less technically 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.590
 but still very detailed is the 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.840
 next question and what was yours 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.259
 Model when you started with youtube 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.540
 have 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.630
 I would say that from frankie and 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.430
 pc in therapy and level cap so not 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.680
 really because of the content that has me 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.390
 At the time, do not say so much 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.879
 but it is the way of the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.649
 videos with much information just something 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.410
 I really liked the entertainment 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.180
 with me it was rather then 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.480
 the first of both, but I like it 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.060
 as well and that makes me the most fun 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.320
 basecamp so we do not just like that 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.930
 let stand but also once 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.090
 a little something to say yes so I find 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.530
 facetime generally okay clear one 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.090
 does not mind I can not do anything 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.860
 I only think that's easy 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.260
 not that it's the kind of videos the 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.550
 I somehow fits except 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.870
 maybe this one would 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.000
 maybe fit in with a face 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.530
 but would otherwise they would be my 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.600
 opinion not appropriate and also 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.580
 not against how beneficial she would be 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.200
 maybe even disturbing 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.790
 if you want to maybe on the 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.290
 Concentrate on all that is 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.270
 really really hard and sometimes really 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.980
 I often see it in the comments 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.990
 are asked questions actually in 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.000
 answered the video and it 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.750
 I see that the 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.340
 attention span is not too high 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.800
 and I do not think that there 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.700
 face camp will somehow help 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.560
 to increase the 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.720
 But who just wants to see who I am 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.030
 am or what I look like is an old one 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.370
 picture of emco and me that got somewhere 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.870
 taken in London 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.550
 the next question is especially for me 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.500
 interesting or important we say so 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.870
 that you want that because I intend to 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.820
 recently changed a stream plan like that 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.910
 that I always Thursdays and now 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.890
 Sundays from 18 clock live in that is who 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.980
 he likes to watch live streams as well 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.320
 I'll stop by on tape.tv 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.300
 estate and as said on sundays and 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.209
 Thursdays from 6 pm I'm live 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.640
 Do you have a very good question 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.990
 yes, I have it there but there 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.720
 many I think the request is 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.070
 somehow 800 or so current and me 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.420
 somehow I have no idea how I am 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.250
 should go through it or how 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.560
 I should find out who meant it 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.239
 plates is suitable at all and 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.100
 so I just assume no 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.230
 this is a solution behind it i know 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.300
 that it is not very optimal but it 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.980
 only the possibility remains up-to-date 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.840
 to get into this platoon if you can 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.580
 tips off is easy because then the 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.620
 request is much lower 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.900
 all plates members the 18 years 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.030
 or older ones can as well 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.650
 directly on the teamspeak server active 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.600
 be there and there with us and the others 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.670
 slabs members alongside then gamble 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.850
 we are also active regularly and that 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.109
 actually works pretty well so far 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.730
 I'll play it, apparently 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.710
 To be tough and therefore the question here 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.150
 if battlefield hardliner appeared 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:25.120
 will you then synonymous videos too 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.949
 Battlefield 4 do it 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.389
 I do not really have that yet 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.160
 as planned so of course I want 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:32.139
 somehow maintaining both that is 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.000
 Battlefield 4 and has at the same time 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.740
 I just want to have this good mix 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.949
 so that somehow it does not become monotonous 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.350
 but really much more than that 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.840
 Unfortunately, I'm not planning you too 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.800
 times at shows like last man standing too 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.990
 be seen 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.400
 really a very good question and mine 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.710
 network has me that too ever 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.020
 asked if I would be interested 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.520
 So in general I'm already there 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.650
 because it's something new, that's me 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.690
 would like to try it out but so 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.139
 I'm not really keen on that 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.120
 yes, maybe I'll be there 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.650
 maybe no idea what 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.570
 I but the answer is white to 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.490
 next question because that is what 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.440
 Do you do it professionally ? 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.000
 really real quite often I know 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.080
 not why seems pretty 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.979
 to be interesting what the people are 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.410
 to do a job 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.570
 yes and i am active in the marketing sector 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.090
 that is in the case with me I am 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.699
 mostly responsible for the graphics 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.169
 I also create that and praise for that 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:29.110
 real man because that makes me fun 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:31.090
 even if youtube me about the last 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.460
 a few years really fun 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.900
 I'm not quite sure how 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.099
 I should answer the next question 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.289
 that's a nice one again 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:40.750
 final question there you can again 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:42.389
 Of course, your mustard will be added to yours 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.580
 perspective depending on whether you 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:47.080
 video producer or spectator since that 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.780
 of course depends on you but has the 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.030
 question do you think that you are in 30 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:55.780
 still make youtube videos 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.370
 and that's really difficult lately 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.620
 We had the question if I am in 30 years 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.720
 I'll be able to gamble that right 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.860
 easy answer but when videos 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.900
 if I'm not so sure 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.479
 maybe I'll make videos I would 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.220
 not exclude that on hold 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.080
 higher in 30 years because who knows 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.690
 ever on youtube then ever 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.910
 still exists around just once 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.460
 explain how I see it when I am 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.960
 would actively gamble in 30 years then 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.690
 that would be a prerequisite 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.729
 of course ticked off to make videos 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.360
 I can not make videos without gambling 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:27.490
 in that case 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.870
 and that means if I play active then 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.410
 maybe I will also get videos 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.880
 do 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.330
 the problem is of course that it still 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.919
 of much more than the dependent because 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.570
 It's pretty easy to gamble that's it 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:37.930
 smallest part of the video production at 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.580
 me 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.620
 the real problem is the 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.660
 the rest of the time and who knows what in 30 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.940
 Years have passed so maybe I have 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.860
 then no time to do so 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.570
 of course I have time in 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.460
 this video and this is my note 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.169
 on the tk advertising in the description
