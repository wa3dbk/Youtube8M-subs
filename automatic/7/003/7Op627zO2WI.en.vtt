00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:35.590
 First, I want to say hello Sasha 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:37.840

 landing today was stealing great 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.790
 this performance of my guys I understand you 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.760
 it was hard to understand that a little bit not 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.060
 your genre but I think everyone will say now 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.889
 Kostya and I will tell you all backstage 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.750
 Konstantin I think you learned Sasha by 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:55.989
 occasionally and personally, I also recognized her because 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.159
 that almost everyone is not on the jury 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.909
 I want to go in via 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:03.549
 Sasha did not get Viagra 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:06.129
 but her fate was so she 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.819
 big stage she sings in the famous 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.459
 team 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.769
 First of all, I am very happy to see with us in 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:19.599
 Away this wonderful axis group 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:22.539
 afraid very happy and certainly very happy 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:24.849
 see here sasha because i think 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:29.919
 it's deeply symbolic that's it on 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:32.650
 at this stage understand what even those guys 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:35.320
 who do not win in our projects 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.590
 they still find their way on on 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.630
 big stage and it should be 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.880
 encouraging factor with regards to 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.000
 your speech I can't 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:49.090
 comment it without laughing you see 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.120
 because I was very feeling with 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:55.810
 the first bars that girls sang this song 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:58.470
 and you sing like hindered as to 44 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.940
 hooligans who actually 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:07.330
 brutally pester intelligent 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.330
 beautiful mehovushka what force males 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.900
 it was not bad because it 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.090
 of course due to the fact that you have two months 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.060
 live far away from civilization not 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:23.230
 seen women in your place i 'm afraid i 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:26.110
 would still be disgusting 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:29.840
 but listening was hard 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.200
 guys and you all heard ask you 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:44.300
 waiting for faith 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:46.220
 [applause] 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.830
 you're laughing now because you 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.379
 girls did not get dumbbells that gives 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:54.740
 so I did not understand why 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:57.470
 but I kind of with her she was on really 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.449
 Actually I 1 3 Monica differently but because 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:03.440
 that all they said is fair 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:09.379
 the truth is simple and send you see them three 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:10.699
 Well, they are not like that, but when I 

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:13.240
 I sing I watch 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:17.270
 but I try and look into the eyes and 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:19.940
 it turns out that way but it’s difficult 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.280
 describe it this of course is very funny 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:25.460
 it sounds sad to 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:28.610
 really really awful for the first time 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.169
 it's not even bad because even you 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.509
 know to make of favorites in your 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:35.150
 team you know what I'm with is not 

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:37.280
 I support you and somehow all of you 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.810
 libitum and here I was just stunned by 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.550
 what did you do and really 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.830
 you even have a feeling for me here 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.979
 interfered and that were superfluous on this our 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:49.520
 the second stage is over and right now we 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:52.930
 find out what the next team package 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.930
 on 6 reality
