00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:22.439
 hello you love today I want you 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:27.619
 Show how you strictly yours on the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:30.420
 finished finish if you enter now 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.000
 Knitted knitted pieces are finished 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:38.879
 so far I just got it here 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.800
 mesh sample taken yes then you have to 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.160
 yes somehow to see you here 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.129
 your make nice again 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.559
 can chain and I will you 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:55.850
 It's not hard to show today 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.850
 and we can start now 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:05.909
 The first thing you do is trick your first one 

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:09.590
 So yes, in the house most of the time 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.439
 I the pattern I am here too 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.990
 did not knit so stretch 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:21.180
 just right stitches but it 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.220
 follow the knitting pattern 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.810
 but you can only mesh right 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.120
 just knit naturally then you have 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.630
 a small paragraph you always one 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.150
 little sees this pattern is now 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.100
 smooth right knitted so it is now 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.180
 of course, only with right 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.180
 to take off 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:45.479
 otherwise as I said so that 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.470
 So it works so well for me 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.659
 opinion 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:55.380
 and first of all, you are tricking 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:02:00.330
 your first stitch as normal 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:06.299
 once as with the pattern before and on 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:09.269
 the second marshall you strictly too 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:13.470
 Now you have your two stitches on 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:20.029
 your needle now you take yours 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:23.220
 second needle and pull the first stitch 

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:31.390
 about your second stitch 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:39.280
 just over there and then you can 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:41.470
 you let go of this mesh then like that 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.370
 looks like you say only one again 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:48.420
 mesh on your needle and the other 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.550
 knit is already off knitted 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:56.940
 now you keep doing this 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:03:02.980
 knit the next stitch as normal 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:09.460
 and the second stitch you look over 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:15.640
 your first stitch over and then leave 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:20.550
 go ahead and that is actually 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:26.380
 everything already you speak the mesh 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:29.580
 and just pull the second stitch 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.580
 pull over it 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:50.909
 so now you have all your stitches 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:54.930
 removed 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:57.849
 Now you can do yours here 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.490
 Cutting down work phases in length 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:03.400
 which you would like to have is mine 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:08.830
 tip is it always cuts quietly 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:11.469
 a bit longer than too short it is 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:17.759
 is quite this thread synonymous 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:20.439
 to sew at the same time 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:23.370
 I do all this here with this 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:26.919
 small pieces not quite as long 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:30.460
 because actually it is only for 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:36.610
 have been demonstrating so and now 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:43.719
 you can just load your invite here 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:46.599
 pull through and with that are both 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:49.180
 end tight 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:52.330
 and can you also first no more 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:55.180
 Now you can solve these threads 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.190
 use around your model together 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:01.930
 take when you have something to sew 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:03.490
 or watch this piece of TV so that 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.870
 in hindsight you will never go back 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:10.620
 able to see 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.620
 yes and with that you have your end 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:18.990
 I hope you liked it and me 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.990
 wish you much fun until then bye
