00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:11.550
 whaaaaat and until then you think to 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.889
 You, but the day's commented play and the video 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.830
 of today is again on caldini do 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.779
 xbox 360 but let's not talk about 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.760
 no news no news at 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.119
 respect of the game today a video plus the 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.000
 end to talk about something that I 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.609
 I would like very much, but I really should 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.529
 of xbox 360 I think we'll see more 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.750
 would be for me without doubt one of the 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.940
 better than perhaps the best tradition 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.829
 that treyarch could put on the blog 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.050
 optical power have even bring 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.010
 comes back because like talking already existed and 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.469
 other cuts 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.079
 I speak of fashion esmod tubes ne or 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.210
 you can modify the game and 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.950
 certain forms more specifically 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.809
 because of the code mapping I 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.309
 I think it would be the most interesting 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.510
 this speaking clearly in terms of the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.000
 men because I do not think so for many 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.219
 would implement this but for the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.680
 men without a doubt this would be 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.409
 great news is a big turn 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.240
 because the code 5 is the current code 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.950
 people had this including one who 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.439
 you are seeing background is from a map 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.720
 Modified machine is a singer in the 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.860
 time we call for zombies can 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.770
 yes you must know that we are 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.390
 playing men in fsm play positions is 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.619
 10 issue from the secondary channel 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.939
 including your map that we are 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.860
 playing this way you want to see if you win 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.030
 completely and not comment gives a 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.180
 the side of this protein is 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.009
 always here in the description and this is the map 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.140
 black ops 2 o multiplano post 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.610
 bankoff 2 being thrown on the shoulders and 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.290
 clear in their modifications they can see that 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.119
 It 's raining at night and everything 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.430
 more and have extra areas 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.200
 ok but it was adapted to be played 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.450
 shoulders it has several maps 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.119
 happen in the same thing of fear did 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.840
 This is how it once played and played beck lot 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.850
 code 4 and has several maps that are 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.460
 remastered between multiplayer quotes 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.350
 for the men outside the diverse creations 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.299
 Exclusive and the guys created a map 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.310
 completely from scratch and make maps 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.200
 amazing game maps as soon as it arrived 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.880
 to be some even better than the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.600
 maps I entered here created in 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.270
 some maps to treyarch so it 's amazing 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.970
 that the community can do this 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.470
 in the code 5 is that the men more say 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.720
 so common 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.910
 6 more to those who have fewer things clear 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.880
 it is with these modes all there put 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.050
 things on the shoulders of op zoom in box 2 on 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.790
 code 5 l 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.070
 the modules there allows them to do 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.870
 This but I want to say that's how it is at 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.190
 group they are dealing with the product 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.080
 ancient women are shrugging 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.480
 with that ancient India with the 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.390
 stop all old or old items 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.600
 is it try if there is even one 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.030
 updated mode tool should new 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.450
 completely remastered let's say 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.160
 so polished cop3 problem would be very 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.050
 interestingly imagine the amount of 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.150
 things to them that the modules and 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.260
 was able to create the maps that the 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.690
 I could do 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.290
 in block 3 with an updated tool 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.940
 huh 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.430
 and that's when I really doubt 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.260
 I do not know exactly why this does not 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.750
 There is more in the new people in the neighborhood. 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.360
 lopes an I'm not sure but I 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.410
 I'm not mistaken in block 1 had dead 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.050
 not yet 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.670
 I just do not know why there's much less. 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.410
 maps of black ops onu that have diploma 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.940
 makes you very difficult to do that is 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.170
 a lot of cattle kind of thing if someone 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.150
 know below comment 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.950
 but if I am not mistaken lopes 1 still had 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.950
 block bike had nothing of the kind 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.019
 certain and probably also 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.519
 will not have another child ever 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.739
 wondering why they do not 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.989
 they put more than the reason 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.970
 will the option of themselves really 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.709
 they say that we do not want to 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.290
 people do not like them for some reason 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.269
 do not like do not want and do not put or 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.100
 is there any greater obstacle 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.900
 So I do not know where India is. 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.340
 updating things have been updated 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.320
 and this is much harder for them 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.690
 to do is a mode tool or 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.220
 It's kind of complicated to understand, I 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.230
 I swear I had an interview with 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.269
 someone from men or identity to brake 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.100
 that even if you knew I answered 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.380
 ask this, I asked why it does not have 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.930
 more dead because you solved 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.970
 take you guys no more because face 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.880
 it's fashion is a very interesting thing 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.440
 This increases the long life of the 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.900
 truth of the game in a way 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.150
 awesome gta5 is there to prove 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.650
 This is for everyone now on the pc, right? 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.290
 expectation was created upon 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.570
 clarify and ok, but damn if with 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.130
 community of shadows was sure to 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.900
 do various things do until today 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.810
 because your code name pictures 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.480
 launch so it's modes for the Xbox 360 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.390
 new 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.950
 new things all new would be 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.290
 fantastic would be great 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.930
 so I really really like this 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.610
 would be the best edition for 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.740
 me or one of the best options for me 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.420
 that could come with black ops 3 when 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.710
 I said I think the multiplayer creation 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.150
 of multiplayer maps 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.680
 Of course it would be very mass but I think 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.660
 that there is already a little more out of 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.440
 why this moves for example with 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.210
 It is dlc maps of the game and everything else and 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.980
 the question of how to create a 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.070
 much greater, for example , the approval of 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.880
 maps and such I really think maps 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.080
 multiplayer 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.400
 although of course I would like it 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.770
 I think it would be much more 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.790
 difficult to happen almost impossible in the 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.980
 not true 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.810
 but it is very possible to grow and 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.220
 it would be very interesting if they keep 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.380
 I do not know if men got so 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.420
 big for them that they do not want anymore 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.910
 support also influences the purchase of 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.860
 of dlc clothes on the shoulders, not because 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.140
 can not 5 men is still small 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.240
 block was when the men decided it is 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.190
 start expanding but not yet 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.300
 it was a total certainty that revenge both 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:30.130
 so how then is avenged I think 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.140
 can be this too they are afraid of 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.670
 launch by time of activision not speak 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.050
 I'll do it because then I'll be alone. 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.310
 lowering doctors cost is not going to 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.040
 question is that no one will want to know 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.540
 to buy the dlcs nor do I think it is 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.250
 well I think we should be 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.780
 always bring unique content that I know 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.130
 that are impossible to do for example 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.600
 to sing maps 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.960
 so anyway the galley that 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.810
 I would like to buy and anyway, it's just an opinion 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.370
 I really think they end up 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.960
 losing a lot did not launch a tool 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.280
 of death but as I said not to be the 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.600
 real reason for this may be that they 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.910
 do not bid because they really do not 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.560
 Get more throw, right? 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.360
 - I hope it's because of this. 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.150
 option is really enough. 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.500
 disappointing at last is that it only one 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.140
 fast video even to pass this mine 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.670
 opinion for you ok as I said it 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.680
 you want to completely check this 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.970
 even with cold in the background this stretch 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.950
 you can access the do not descend pro play 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.600
 beauty comment below you think about 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:23.200
 this matter and I'm staying here 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:25.860
 A hug to everyone, become god and even 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.860
 more
