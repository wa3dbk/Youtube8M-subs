this<00:00:06.250> is<00:00:06.399> called<00:00:06.640> an<00:00:06.790> exhaust<00:00:07.089> manifold<00:00:07.750> this

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:08.710 
this is called an exhaust manifold this

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.589 
this is called an exhaust manifold this
is<00:00:08.860> called<00:00:09.099> a<00:00:09.219> wrench<00:00:09.429> and<00:00:09.730> what<00:00:10.240> i'm<00:00:10.360> doing

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:10.599 
is called a wrench and what i'm doing

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:13.049 
is called a wrench and what i'm doing
here<00:00:10.630> is<00:00:10.809> called<00:00:11.110> work<00:00:11.610> see<00:00:12.610> i'm<00:00:12.700> trying<00:00:12.849> to

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.059 
here is called work see i'm trying to

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.669 
here is called work see i'm trying to
increase<00:00:13.269> the<00:00:13.480> horsepower<00:00:13.599> of<00:00:14.049> this<00:00:14.259> engine

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:14.679 
increase the horsepower of this engine

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.260 
increase the horsepower of this engine
the<00:00:14.889> best<00:00:15.070> way<00:00:15.219> to<00:00:15.250> do<00:00:15.490> that<00:00:15.669> is<00:00:15.940> to<00:00:16.090> allow<00:00:16.180> the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
the best way to do that is to allow the

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.599 
the best way to do that is to allow the
exhaust<00:00:16.840> to<00:00:17.050> flow<00:00:17.320> more<00:00:17.680> easily<00:00:17.890> out<00:00:18.369> of<00:00:18.520> the

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:18.609 
exhaust to flow more easily out of the

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:19.980 
exhaust to flow more easily out of the
engine<00:00:18.910> regardless<00:00:19.689> of<00:00:19.779> what<00:00:19.869> your

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
engine regardless of what your

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.689 
engine regardless of what your
grandfather<00:00:20.470> said<00:00:20.769> exhaust<00:00:21.189> flow<00:00:21.460> and<00:00:21.609> more

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:21.699 
grandfather said exhaust flow and more

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.109 
grandfather said exhaust flow and more
easily<00:00:21.970> is<00:00:22.359> no<00:00:22.689> joke<00:00:23.279> see<00:00:24.279> the<00:00:24.430> problem<00:00:24.789> is<00:00:24.939> the

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
easily is no joke see the problem is the

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:26.910 
easily is no joke see the problem is the
exhaust<00:00:25.449> erm<00:00:25.720> each<00:00:25.840> cylinder<00:00:26.349> gets<00:00:26.619> funneled

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
exhaust erm each cylinder gets funneled

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.040 
exhaust erm each cylinder gets funneled
into<00:00:27.189> this<00:00:27.400> bottleneck<00:00:28.060> which<00:00:28.420> restricts<00:00:28.960> the

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
into this bottleneck which restricts the

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.900 
into this bottleneck which restricts the
flow<00:00:29.080> you<00:00:30.070> older<00:00:30.340> guys<00:00:30.490> know<00:00:30.699> what<00:00:30.820> I'm

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
flow you older guys know what I'm

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.560 
flow you older guys know what I'm
talking<00:00:31.179> about<00:00:32.520> now<00:00:33.520> a<00:00:33.550> lot<00:00:33.790> of<00:00:33.910> guys<00:00:34.060> go<00:00:34.330> with

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
talking about now a lot of guys go with

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.900 
talking about now a lot of guys go with
bigger<00:00:34.780> pipes<00:00:35.170> maybe<00:00:35.710> even<00:00:36.070> use<00:00:36.220> one<00:00:36.460> for<00:00:36.820> each

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
bigger pipes maybe even use one for each

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.960 
bigger pipes maybe even use one for each
cylinder<00:00:37.300> these<00:00:38.140> are<00:00:38.290> called<00:00:38.470> headers<00:00:38.970> I'll

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
cylinder these are called headers I'll

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.070 
cylinder these are called headers I'll
like<00:00:40.150> the<00:00:40.240> header<00:00:40.420> you<00:00:40.510> took<00:00:40.780> down<00:00:40.930> the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
like the header you took down the

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.750 
like the header you took down the
basement<00:00:41.260> stairs<00:00:41.710> nobody<00:00:42.580> laughs<00:00:42.790> these<00:00:43.120> ones

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
basement stairs nobody laughs these ones

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.700 
basement stairs nobody laughs these ones
but<00:00:45.760> I'm<00:00:45.910> thinking<00:00:46.270> if<00:00:46.420> size<00:00:46.690> matters<00:00:47.230> why

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
but I'm thinking if size matters why

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.280 
but I'm thinking if size matters why
stop<00:00:48.040> at<00:00:48.070> pipes<00:00:48.460> why<00:00:49.420> not<00:00:49.600> go<00:00:49.780> up<00:00:49.870> to<00:00:50.020> something

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
stop at pipes why not go up to something

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.840 
stop at pipes why not go up to something
that's<00:00:50.470> way<00:00:50.620> bigger<00:00:50.890> and<00:00:51.040> used<00:00:51.340> to<00:00:51.490> handling

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
that's way bigger and used to handling

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.350 
that's way bigger and used to handling
hot<00:00:52.030> gases<00:00:52.570> no<00:00:53.320> I'm<00:00:53.470> not<00:00:53.590> your<00:00:53.770> grandfather

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
hot gases no I'm not your grandfather

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.830 
hot gases no I'm not your grandfather
that's<00:00:55.360> right

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
that's right

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.270 
that's right
