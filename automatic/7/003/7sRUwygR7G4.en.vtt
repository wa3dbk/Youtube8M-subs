00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
magnetic head and then you've got

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.500 
magnetic head and then you've got
something<00:02:33.240> that's<00:02:33.480> exclusive<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.740> wall

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
something that's exclusive to the wall

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.020 
something that's exclusive to the wall
right<00:02:36.510> here<00:02:37.050> it's<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.950> it's<00:02:38.550> called<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.850> pivot

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
right here it's a it's called the pivot

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.900 
right here it's a it's called the pivot
holder<00:02:39.540> it's<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.200> they've<00:02:41.100> got<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.459> patent<00:02:41.850> on

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
holder it's a they've got the patent on

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.720 
holder it's a they've got the patent on
this<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.739> you<00:02:43.739> know<00:02:43.830> it's<00:02:44.010> got<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.220> end<00:02:44.489> it

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
this and you know it's got the end it

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.000 
this and you know it's got the end it
goes<00:02:44.880> into<00:02:45.120> your<00:02:45.239> impact<00:02:45.600> driver<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:48.739> we<00:02:49.739> pull

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
goes into your impact driver and we pull

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.920 
goes into your impact driver and we pull
it<00:02:50.100> like<00:02:50.220> this<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.770> pivots<00:02:53.450> so<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.600> put<00:02:54.900> a

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
it like this and it pivots so you put a

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.180 
it like this and it pivots so you put a
head<00:02:55.200> in<00:02:55.350> there<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.709> you're<00:02:55.800> supposed<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.070> be

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
head in there and you're supposed to be

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.790 
head in there and you're supposed to be
able<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.400> get<00:02:56.520> into<00:02:56.640> tighter<00:02:56.940> spaces<00:02:57.560> it<00:02:58.560> also

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
able to get into tighter spaces it also

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.310 
able to get into tighter spaces it also
just<00:02:59.100> works<00:02:59.730> as<00:02:59.940> a<00:02:59.970> nice<00:03:01.040> magnetic<00:03:03.290> bit<00:03:04.290> holder

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
just works as a nice magnetic bit holder

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.530 
just works as a nice magnetic bit holder
it's<00:03:05.130> straight<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:05.730> know<00:03:05.850> when<00:03:06.030> this<00:03:06.180> is<00:03:06.390> on

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
it's straight you know when this is on

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.320 
it's straight you know when this is on
here<00:03:06.810> it's<00:03:06.930> nice<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.290> straight<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:07.940> if<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.150> do

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
here it's nice and straight so if you do

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.030 
here it's nice and straight so if you do
get<00:03:09.570> a<00:03:09.630> situation<00:03:09.930> where<00:03:10.709> you're<00:03:10.860> going<00:03:10.980> to

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
get a situation where you're going to

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.340 
get a situation where you're going to
tight<00:03:11.250> spot<00:03:11.610> and<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.660> want<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:12.989> get<00:03:13.170> in

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
tight spot and you want to get in

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.000 
tight spot and you want to get in
somewhere<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.220> just<00:03:14.430> pop<00:03:15.090> this<00:03:15.330> up<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:16.260> you

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
somewhere you just pop this up and you

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.380 
somewhere you just pop this up and you
pit<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.690> so<00:03:18.690> that's<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.790> that's<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:21.000> pivot

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
pit it so that's the that's the pivot

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.259 
pit it so that's the that's the pivot
holder<00:03:23.090> okay

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
holder okay

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.020 
holder okay
so<00:03:24.630> then<00:03:24.840> right<00:03:25.350> up<00:03:25.470> above<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:25.910> you<00:03:26.910> have

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
so then right up above that you have

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.240 
so then right up above that you have
eight<00:03:29.000> number<00:03:30.000> two<00:03:30.709> drill<00:03:31.709> bits<00:03:31.920> but<00:03:32.100> these

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
eight number two drill bits but these

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.490 
eight number two drill bits but these
are<00:03:32.459> these<00:03:32.760> are<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:33.030> narrow<00:03:33.690> diameter<00:03:33.959> once

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
are these are the narrow diameter once

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.180 
are these are the narrow diameter once
these<00:03:34.769> are<00:03:34.920> for<00:03:35.100> drywall<00:03:35.310> guns<00:03:36.620> these<00:03:37.620> is<00:03:38.010> for

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
these are for drywall guns these is for

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.850 
these are for drywall guns these is for
drywall<00:03:38.870> okay<00:03:39.870> this<00:03:40.080> would<00:03:40.230> do<00:03:40.410> there's<00:03:40.620> eight

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
drywall okay this would do there's eight

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.860 
drywall okay this would do there's eight
more<00:03:41.070> on<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.760> other<00:03:41.850> side<00:03:42.180> number<00:03:42.690> two

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
more on the other side number two

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.350 
more on the other side number two
Phillips<00:03:43.370> but<00:03:44.370> they're<00:03:44.580> just<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.940> standard

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
Phillips but they're just the standard

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.330 
Phillips but they're just the standard
ones<00:03:45.540> for<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.810> magnetic<00:03:46.140> tips<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:46.860> that's

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
ones for the magnetic tips and that's

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.729 
ones for the magnetic tips and that's
that's<00:03:48.330> not<00:03:48.540> those<00:03:48.750> there's<00:03:48.959> these<00:03:49.530> right

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
that's not those there's these right

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.460 
that's not those there's these right
here<00:03:50.090> these<00:03:51.090> right<00:03:51.360> here<00:03:51.600> there's<00:03:51.810> eight<00:03:52.080> more

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470

here these right here there's eight more
so<00:03:52.799> you<00:03:52.890> got<00:03:52.980> sixteen<00:03:53.430> number<00:03:53.790> two<00:03:54.230> but

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
so you got sixteen number two but

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.740 
so you got sixteen number two but
they're<00:03:56.190> different<00:03:56.400> there's<00:03:57.239> eight<00:03:57.450> of<00:03:57.480> them

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
they're different there's eight of them

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.640 
they're different there's eight of them
for<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.590> drywall<00:03:59.010> and<00:03:59.690> it<00:04:00.690> um<00:04:00.930> for<00:04:01.230> just

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
for the drywall and it um for just

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.610 
for the drywall and it um for just
regular<00:04:01.769> magnetic<00:04:02.310> tips<00:04:03.290> okay<00:04:04.290> they're<00:04:04.470> all
