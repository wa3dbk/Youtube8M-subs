so<00:00:04.970> this<00:00:05.090> is<00:00:05.210> the<00:00:05.300> dry<00:00:05.480> and<00:00:05.750> exotic<00:00:06.319> country

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:06.590 
so this is the dry and exotic country

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.560 
so this is the dry and exotic country
trip<00:00:06.740> with<00:00:07.490> this<00:00:07.550> test<00:00:07.879> we<00:00:08.059> set<00:00:08.240> an<00:00:08.330> average

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:08.570 
trip with this test we set an average

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.869 
trip with this test we set an average
that<00:00:08.750> time<00:00:08.960> over<00:00:09.500> three<00:00:09.770> laps<00:00:09.980> for<00:00:10.400> each<00:00:10.520> tire

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:10.879 
that time over three laps for each tire

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.180 
that time over three laps for each tire
second<00:00:11.719> is<00:00:11.840> 3.4<00:00:12.530> kilometers<00:00:12.980> long<00:00:13.129> and

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
second is 3.4 kilometers long and

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.769 
second is 3.4 kilometers long and
constantly<00:00:13.699> twisting<00:00:14.029> the<00:00:14.119> turning<00:00:14.389> so<00:00:14.510> quite

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:14.779 
constantly twisting the turning so quite

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:16.330 
constantly twisting the turning so quite
difficult<00:00:15.020> to<00:00:15.260> set<00:00:15.440> a<00:00:15.469> consistent<00:00:15.980> lap<00:00:16.100> time

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
difficult to set a consistent lap time

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.769 
difficult to set a consistent lap time
but<00:00:16.460> that's<00:00:16.520> what<00:00:16.699> we<00:00:16.760> have<00:00:16.880> to<00:00:17.000> do<00:00:17.119> and<00:00:17.630> over

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
but that's what we have to do and over

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:19.029 
but that's what we have to do and over
the<00:00:17.869> five<00:00:18.109> tires<00:00:18.350> have<00:00:18.560> you<00:00:18.619> have<00:00:18.710> on<00:00:18.800> test

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
the five tires have you have on test

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.950 
the five tires have you have on test
here<00:00:19.250> we<00:00:19.669> look<00:00:19.789> for<00:00:20.000> an<00:00:20.060> average<00:00:20.150> difference

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
here we look for an average difference

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.509 
here we look for an average difference
