okay<00:00:02.100> here<00:00:02.280> we<00:00:02.370> have<00:00:02.399> whiskey<00:00:02.970> stones<00:00:03.240> by

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
okay here we have whiskey stones by

okay here we have whiskey stones by
terraformer<00:00:04.440> these<00:00:04.920> are<00:00:05.160> Iranian<00:00:05.520> idea<00:00:06.060> and

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
terraformer these are Iranian idea and

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.839 
terraformer these are Iranian idea and
literally<00:00:07.140> what<00:00:07.379> they<00:00:07.560> are<00:00:07.710> are<00:00:08.010> made<00:00:08.309> from

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
literally what they are are made from

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.589 
literally what they are are made from
the<00:00:09.059> soapstone<00:00:09.450> so<00:00:09.780> they<00:00:09.900> are<00:00:10.139> indeed<00:00:10.830> stone

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:11.599 
the soapstone so they are indeed stone

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.360 
the soapstone so they are indeed stone
what<00:00:12.599> you<00:00:12.719> get<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.139> in<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.710> packet<00:00:14.009> you<00:00:14.190> get

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
what you get is in a packet you get

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.820 
what you get is in a packet you get
knowing<00:00:14.730> they<00:00:15.480> supply<00:00:15.809> your<00:00:15.990> very<00:00:16.170> nice<00:00:16.320> linen

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
knowing they supply your very nice linen

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.769 
knowing they supply your very nice linen
bag<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:17.910> rather<00:00:18.150> cool<00:00:18.420> because<00:00:18.570> about

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
bag this is rather cool because about

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.769 
bag this is rather cool because about
that<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.050> freezer<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.670> the<00:00:20.670> idea<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.570> that

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
that in the freezer and the idea is that

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.689 
that in the freezer and the idea is that
by<00:00:22.199> using<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.650> property<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.250> soapstone

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
by using the property of the soapstone

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.730 
by using the property of the soapstone
and<00:00:24.480> that's<00:00:24.630> what<00:00:24.750> these<00:00:24.840> are<00:00:24.990> made<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.289> and

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
and that's what these are made of and

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.800 
and that's what these are made of and
that<00:00:26.250> they<00:00:26.369> don't<00:00:26.580> absorb<00:00:27.029> any<00:00:27.269> fluids<00:00:27.660> they

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
that they don't absorb any fluids they

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.150 
that they don't absorb any fluids they
don't<00:00:27.990> react<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.619> they<00:00:28.710> don't<00:00:28.890> cause<00:00:29.130> any

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
don't react and they don't cause any

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.339 
don't react and they don't cause any
taste<00:00:29.670> but<00:00:30.449> they<00:00:30.539> have<00:00:30.689> very<00:00:30.929> good<00:00:31.109> heat

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
taste but they have very good heat

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.530 
taste but they have very good heat
retention<00:00:31.890> properties<00:00:32.309> by<00:00:32.820> freezing<00:00:33.239> them

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
retention properties by freezing them

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.569 
retention properties by freezing them
and<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:34.110> need<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.380> freeze<00:00:34.770> them<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.399> back

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
and you need to freeze them in the back

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.090 
and you need to freeze them in the back
in<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.940> freezer<00:00:36.239> for<00:00:36.390> about<00:00:36.540> four<00:00:36.960> hours<00:00:37.350> they

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
in the freezer for about four hours they

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.100 
in the freezer for about four hours they
work<00:00:38.309> brilliantly<00:00:38.730> as<00:00:39.270> an<00:00:39.629> ice<00:00:39.840> cube

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
work brilliantly as an ice cube

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.880 
work brilliantly as an ice cube

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
already chilling it down now I've had

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.460 
already chilling it down now I've had
them<00:01:12.360> in<00:01:12.420> there<00:01:12.600> for<00:01:12.689> about<00:01:12.750> four<00:01:13.260> or<00:01:13.290> five

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
them in there for about four or five

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.440 
them in there for about four or five

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
and that's typically about the kind of

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.120 
and that's typically about the kind of
time<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.060> need<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.630> get<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.590> kind<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.890> chill

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
time you need to get that kind of chill

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.880 
time you need to get that kind of chill
that<00:01:21.090> really<00:01:21.479> chilled<00:01:21.780> throughout<00:01:22.200> me<00:01:22.710> just

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
that really chilled throughout me just

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.870 
that really chilled throughout me just
about<00:01:24.500> yep<00:01:25.500> that's<00:01:25.710> about<00:01:25.830> right<00:01:26.100> now<00:01:26.250> that

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
about yep that's about right now that

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.810 
about yep that's about right now that
kind<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.090> chilled<00:01:27.710> taste<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.400> want<00:01:29.610> that

so do they taint the flavors well I've
drunk<00:01:35.820> my<00:01:36.659> whiskey's<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.140> I've<00:01:37.259> drunk<00:01:37.409> them

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
drunk my whiskey's and I've drunk them

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.260 
drunk my whiskey's and I've drunk them
with<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.220> without<00:01:38.430> these<00:01:38.610> whiskey<00:01:39.030> stones

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
with and without these whiskey stones

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.100 
with and without these whiskey stones
and<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.680> can<00:01:41.369> tell<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.210> can't<00:01:42.750> tell<00:01:42.960> any

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
and I can tell you that I can't tell any

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.690 
and I can tell you that I can't tell any
difference<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.890> does<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> really<00:01:44.159> neat<00:01:44.520> job

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
difference so it does a really neat job

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.639 
difference so it does a really neat job
why<00:01:45.360> would<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.630> sleep<00:01:45.689> with<00:01:45.960> stones<00:01:46.380> are<00:01:46.530> better

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
why would I sleep with stones are better

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.530 
why would I sleep with stones are better

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.100 
seen these kind of plastic dolphins and
I've<00:01:50.549> seen<00:01:50.670> plastic<00:01:51.180> blue<00:01:51.509> whales<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:52.049> you
