00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.129
 I do not want everything planned and organized by this 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.460
 so far 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.460
 Kurt Langbein 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.970
 like a freak show 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.970
 an act 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.460
 because the boys from 21 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.770
 dpa at 13 the presentation albeit one 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.770
 will be welcome at night 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.640
 that's great 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.480
 then be dangerous 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.410
 how important is a vampire books 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.410
 are you amused the roles 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.660
 Hanover 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.660
 Artists and many become 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.840
 Dr 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.840
 Come on 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.020
 his future in business or should it actually have an impact 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.020
 August left on buy 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.610
 the calendar will 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.860
 I really would not have anyone no 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.080
 convince them only a small cut in the 2 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.700
 and then you take a sip 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.690
 very refreshing 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.050
 you have to fight 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.100
 Harrer 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.020
 has now promised so synonymous 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.350
 through the future program 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.270
 to be able to this as well as Michelle bat too 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.270
 transform and so that remains nonsense 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.900
 at the diocese of Trier 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.850
 this knowledge on 8 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.850
 like a real vampire 

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:10.959
 that was fully agreed
