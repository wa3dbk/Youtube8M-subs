00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:24.840
 and you are an osteopathic veterinarian 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.730
 white fountain quite regularly a 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.230
 course we have a lot of readers 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.360
 on every 100 points like that foam 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.910
 oil that hunt fairly 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.250
 assiduously and we would like to know 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.860
 how to prepare his horse 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.020
 hunting out period we will say what 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.200
 are the little things to do for 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.770
 to be ready to hunt 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.090
 so a hunting horse is a sportsman 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.930
 is not forgetting about it anyway 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.370
 way that when someone who goes them 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.030
 do the marathon will train 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.339
 regularly 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.199
 okay we still see a lot of 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:01.080
 hunting horses all came out that 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.000
 for hunting it is very important to 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.250
 physically prepare his horses 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.210
 okay so to have outings 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.780
 regular 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:14.790
 because out of five six seven 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.760
 hours without having been prepared it's fine 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.090
 is physically very moving the horse 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.880
 yes it can have consequences that 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.310
 call veterinarians a term 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.979
 music okay and that some 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:35.600
 call boots in effect will ferrari 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:38.539
 create a blockage at the kidney level of 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.880
 horse muscles agree and the 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:43.399
 horses are going to have to be infused 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.439
 so it's often a lack of 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:50.149
 preparation of the horse I was not talking 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:51.950
 too intense too much too sudden hockey and 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.039
 so horses with loses not very well 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.140
 in back up that it's very important to 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.659
 first a regular training of 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.569
 horse then daily it can be 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.490
 complicated but at least that the horse 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.540
 kinds and real releases of three times 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.410
 per week of agreement 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:13.090
 twice a week this ideal on horseback 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.560
 does well but let's agree and if 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.510
 is that once a week it seems 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.550
 according to brad or you really that a 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.310
 times per week 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.720
 plus the hunt yeah it's still a 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.640
 little bit limited for the horse 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.330
 ok it's clear a little pot limit 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.250
 it's like we're saying we're going 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.400
 run once a week a 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.530
 half an hour and the other time we make a 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.890
 real race after waiting to be 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.290
 behind 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.120
 I think ours to be 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.360
 unable to stop dark hair 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:47.110
 nice years i 'm going so they go 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.120
 to the end but it's not a point 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.500
 view of the horse's health 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.580
 we will not leave the ideal so others 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.100
 April is the month of September 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.530
 ideally go out only united but love 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.830
 to three a week so season's 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.020
 hunt 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.760
 we can leave no agreement we must 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.380
 these three four months of rest it's not 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.170
 the problem there then host 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.900
 represent the rope start over at 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.720
 least a month and a half to two months before 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.120
 that it would come out regularly so 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.880
 to restore them to a muscular condition 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.330
 put the heart back on the road too 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:27.320
 yeah 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:28.910
 and to tackle the season is coming to an end 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.650
 and during the class season it takes 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.850
 continue to maintain what we do 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.130
 not only hunting weekdays 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.750
 oh no, we have to talk to them now 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.230
 we will have to mount them in the 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.880
 cave 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.040
 that's really important or not 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.740
 only an ideal veil too that would be 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.060
 these horses so at least there 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.760
 understood the day after the hunt 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.980
 crew eliminate muscle toxins 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.790
 okay so that's it wins like a 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.790
 recovery 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.960
 no word has not left to fucking boks 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.120
 it's to bring out a little bit of 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.980
 head made me out in how many 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.110
 of time work the ideal that's what 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.850
 worth it to him for example since the 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.730
 type that links this market the agreement 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:08.300
 claims it was missing here are two 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.590
 ways I do hunting in front 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.840
 with feeding properly 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.190
 so you go 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.870
 and with the right centers and especially 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.329
 also to give him energy 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:21.459
 necessary to keep everyone from 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:23.560
 hunt for the docks and that's important 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:28.470
 as well as during the hunting season 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.370
 so that they can recover well and 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.919
 evacuate the heat during the hunt 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.290
 that it be tense yes because then the 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.050
 camp the echelon of the very long hairs that 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.340
 are a bit of shetland 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.699
 they can not choose to evacuate the 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.550
 heat 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.990
 and then at the end of the hunt he stays 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.419
 also soak for a very long time 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.110
 okay he can also give them some 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.600
 good or cold 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.220
 okay so it's very nice that 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.810
 i 'm going to be either shorn he's going 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.940
 better able to see them provoke 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.229
 okay because we do it 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.389
 regularly for hunting horses 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.620
 that of the hunting graves not everything to 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.940
 does like this mare who is mowed 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:07.000
 in full we can just left behind 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.470
 from the horse with the sail what he closes to 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.010
 will not find you in the grain for 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.050
 the hunt but the neckline the chest and 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.060
 the wind are well cleared so as to 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.940
 what those areas there that are men 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.650
 rolling hair south more agree 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.660
 that a good guy for me to be well 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.310
 Funny there before the hunt it's very 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.950
 important 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.910
 the aftermath of hunting make them a 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.760
 good outlet filled box 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.320
 also and especially as you 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.790
 said to take them out the most 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.860
 regularly possible for it to be 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:40.910
 fresh as sportsmen has retacked from 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:43.880
 a hunting very well perfect thank you 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:46.490
 a lot and then see you soon on 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.850
 globes hunt to discover how 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.590
 this time we have to do to help 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.970
 the horse and the little ones 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.970
 gestures to do in the end a hunt
