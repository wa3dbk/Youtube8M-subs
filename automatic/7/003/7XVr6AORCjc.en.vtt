 often very bad and reinstalled 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.850
 Itâ€™s not good for us 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.739
 and our task is to understand what amounts 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.659

 Helly slightly stained 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.640
 find out the exact size we summed up 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.750
 first measure the width of the opening 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.750
 I have the width of the opening 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.399
 she will consider using 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:24.630

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:41.100
 open not interfere with the class on your 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.780
 case it is better to send over there 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.270
 why because if you will 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.460
 open and here the case of fire you 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.979

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:20.360
 by 1 subtracted the standard 80 they do 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:29.250
 such projects we have to choose 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:31.410
