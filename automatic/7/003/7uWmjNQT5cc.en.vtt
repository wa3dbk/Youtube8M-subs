00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.660 
because it has a little nozzle on the
top<00:02:08.960> and<00:02:09.170> it's<00:02:09.380> just<00:02:09.619> easier<00:02:09.950> for<00:02:10.040> pouring<00:02:10.550> out

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
top and it's just easier for pouring out

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.510 
top and it's just easier for pouring out
the<00:02:10.760> foundation<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:12.440> I<00:02:12.500> love<00:02:12.770> that<00:02:12.800> foundation

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.560 
you obviously it gets humid so you want
your<00:05:11.100> makeup<00:05:11.400> to<00:05:11.520> last<00:05:11.640> all<00:05:11.940> day<00:05:11.970> long<00:05:12.240> and

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
your makeup to last all day long and

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.860 
your makeup to last all day long and
also<00:05:12.800> when<00:05:13.800> it<00:05:13.890> does<00:05:14.070> get<00:05:14.220> humid<00:05:14.700> I<00:05:14.910> find<00:05:15.780> that

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
also when it does get humid I find that

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.540 
also when it does get humid I find that
your<00:05:15.990> pores<00:05:16.290> sort<00:05:16.590> of<00:05:16.650> open<00:05:17.010> up<00:05:17.100> a<00:05:17.190> little<00:05:17.430> bit

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
your pores sort of open up a little bit

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.090 
your pores sort of open up a little bit
more<00:05:17.790> and<00:05:18.030> look<00:05:18.930> more<00:05:19.169> apparent<00:05:19.620> especially

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
more and look more apparent especially

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.240 
more and look more apparent especially
if<00:05:20.250> you<00:05:20.940> have<00:05:21.710> what<00:05:22.710> you<00:05:22.830> might<00:05:22.860> call<00:05:22.979> it<00:05:23.190> a

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
if you have what you might call it a

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.230 
if you have what you might call it a
little<00:05:23.370> bit<00:05:23.550> of<00:05:23.669> that

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
little bit of that

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.059 
little bit of that
the<00:05:25.389> skin<00:05:25.630> thing<00:05:25.930> going<00:05:26.259> on<00:05:26.349> so<00:05:26.650> it<00:05:26.740> looks<00:05:26.770> a

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.069 
the skin thing going on so it looks a

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:28.529 
the skin thing going on so it looks a
little<00:05:27.220> bit<00:05:27.430> more<00:05:27.610> apparent<00:05:28.120> and<00:05:28.270> it<00:05:28.389> looks

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
little bit more apparent and it looks

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.360 
little bit more apparent and it looks
shiny<00:05:28.780> and<00:05:28.990> gross<00:05:29.199> but<00:05:29.919> this<00:05:30.039> helps<00:05:30.310> to

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
shiny and gross but this helps to

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.980 
shiny and gross but this helps to
prevent<00:05:30.699> it<00:05:30.910> so<00:05:31.060> I<00:05:31.120> just<00:05:31.180> use<00:05:31.449> a<00:05:31.479> little<00:05:31.630> bit<00:05:31.930> of

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
prevent it so I just use a little bit of

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.589 
prevent it so I just use a little bit of
this<00:05:32.289> right<00:05:32.620> into<00:05:32.770> my<00:05:32.949> pores<00:05:33.250> and<00:05:33.490> around<00:05:34.479> my
