00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.269
 from cherries found how to do this blank 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.799
 and it will be an option for the lazy for those 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.330
 who 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.550
 absolutely no time and in principle with 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.410
 this recipe generally disappears 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.439
 the need is somehow very long 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.590
 messing around in the kitchen about this recipe 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:29.789
 I learned back in my student years before 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.309
 his marriage in this way compote 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.770
 my mom's mom was also closing 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.020
 does to this day at that moment I don't 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.379
 immediately took this recipe but because 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.600
 and we in our family do much more 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.600
 manipulations first poured syrup afterwards 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.700
 Pour the berries already in the banks a few 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.140
 once back and forth they poured again 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.469
 took a lot of body movements 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.500
 because of this somehow i'm not very 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.690
 I loved to make comfort it seemed to me that I 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.090
 i 'd better freeze easier freeze and 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.920
 then in the winter to cook compote at any 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.049
 convenient time but in a similar way 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.720
 which will show you today very quickly 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.430
 easy and easy to recycle I'm ready 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.350
 attach or have grandma send on 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.360
 storage in the basement and believe me 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.820
 kept such a billet in the cool 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.280
 the whole place will be perfect 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.159
 it is tested over the years and not only on my 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.960
 experience and so proceed on need 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.030
 selected cherries without cisterns by the sea and and and 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.380
 we put in the bank I fill the bank 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.020
 about April 1 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.110

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.659
 glasses of cherries 1 cup of sugar 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.360
 in a half liter can just like me and 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.539
 I fall asleep 2 cups of cherry and 1 cup 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.539
 Sahara 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.080
 boil separately on the stove in the pot 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.750
 the water here I do not measure exactly how much 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.849
 there I have about the amount 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.750
 cans which we will do 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:26.950
 bring it to a boil and boiling water 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.950
 fill the contents of the folder 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:45.510
 and by the way the lid I also separately skipyachu 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.510
 so they too were to erase 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.420
 further in our banks roll 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:59.750
 and after we proceed to the interesting 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.660
 manipulate the grandmother with the help of 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:06.220
 kitchen towel and we do it up 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.220
 complete dissolution of sugar 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.220
 and then everything is as usual I clean grandma 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.549
 I turn them on the cover 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:27.650
 I lay on top of something warm somehow 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.650
 a blanket and leave it until the morning 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.500
 and in the morning I clean the cans for a long time 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.500

 everything is simple and fast 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.000
 this comfort is obtained concentrate but 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.430
 so before use and it can 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.500
 dilute the routine into the palm in this way 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.270
 regulate his sweetness according to your 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.319
