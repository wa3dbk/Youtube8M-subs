00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:20.349
 and people said a little bit more macho 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.910
 a song has been put on and I 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.620
 I say 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.180
 we also when that 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:30.550
 in this mixer they are just also 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.810
 we are determined 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.810
 you have to continue 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.809
 and well I guess not just some clothes 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.460
 or what you have to have of stars 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:46.510
 matches what less things 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.510
 let's see if we're here 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.290
 not for nothing Perez maciÃ¡n putting one 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.010
 Look, it's 44 stars to tell me 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.850
 the people if I write being the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.850
 one stars 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.810
 just like this look around here when 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.810
 you 54 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.020
 now before I start I'll look to see if 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.820
 it is well placed because it is only 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.320
 put as already said to the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:25.050
 left but they can do the left 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:29.210
 to the buttons and that's all this 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:32.850
 can be mixtures and I have a guarantee not 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:37.880
 You can compete between another person but 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.880
 I already say with one already being one 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:49.100
 I'm going to change the controls it does not get 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.100
 better than with that left a second 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.969
 and there we are 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.580
 my mom does not know her 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.580
 I do not know 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.390
 but I'm missing then I mean the 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.330
 true that is a pass 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.930
 it's pretty cool to entertain you and 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.930
 play some champions 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.300
 we are where the animal 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.270
 then also chosen are units 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.270
 blacks 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.270
 mental 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.550
 Then we 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:59.650
 because in a withered say it seems to me 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.120
 what do you like in your songs 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.010
 I tell you, little by little they are going 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:10.260
 unlocking and is that of michael jackson 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.260
 to another type of singers 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.900
 very well 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.490
 we have 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.420
 I say because in short 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:40.540
 It is not when we put you with mixed 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.540
 all a little 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.120
 in changing the bar to a bar 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.260
 let's go man computing 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.450
 then the euphoria that we needed 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.050
 all right 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.740
 these are complicated 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.430
 no no 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:21.590
 yes sir waiting for more stars here 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.120
 finally the third action without 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.490
 you guys but if you liked this is with 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.490
 march and the result is not improved 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:30.089
 in 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:38.949
 to 68 thousand 158 points that passed and I tell you 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:40.539
 what can fleas enjoy is a 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.369
 bit simpler I think that when 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:44.020
 a little more gear and such as the 

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:45.249
 much more what we have is to have in 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.229
 in front of certain the point is not bad 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:49.240
 it's pretty good and five stars and 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.819
 nothing in the smoke feels like song 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.149
 green that we do not like it and even the 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:54.839
 next 

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:54.839
 goodbye
