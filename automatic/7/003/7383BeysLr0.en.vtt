00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.440
 i have all your theories about that 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.750
 we have to read human brain 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.820
 all of us said so i am 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.379
 very flattered young lady but that 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.789
 I find it hard to believe I know 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.480
 your theory about the use of the brain 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:18.769
 capacity 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.240
 there are a few gaps but they are 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:25.070
 On the right track I have one 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.499
 large amount of synthetic cpi trace 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.179
 was added resulting in 100 percent 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:31.519
 my brain capacity can use 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.530
 At the moment I am at 28 and what they are 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.030
 Writing is true when the brain is 20 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.969
 achieved percent opened to 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.500
 control this metabolism yes 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:42.699
 as well as magnetic and electrical 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.699
 waves TV 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.770
 what I mean by the script 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.960
 imagined faded compared 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.770
 with what kind and in addition in the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.500
 look stuck this project is a 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.110
 filmmaker has fun on filmmaking 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.420
 you have a very impressive one 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.979
 author and director is very relaxed 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.500
 and has a great sense of humor 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.970
 I think I think he could be his 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.130
 finance films alone 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.110
 but he likes the view from the outside of him 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.360
 new perspectives on his projects 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.350
 opened I think we are a good one 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.210
 team 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.979
 you have to be the most interesting at the 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.660
 work with louis the fact that he 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.790
 is also a cameraman and a director 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:36.990
 every tiny detail of a picture 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:38.610
 already in mind has one is 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.979
 impressive representative of his kind 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.820
 because he understands his vision precisely 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.680
 implement 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.840
 one recognizes it by the kind as he the 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.180
 camera moves and we with me and in 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.440
 I like other actors 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.440
 Directors work this 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.850
 my baby and i love it i try 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.170
 Everywhere to give my best and close to 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.390
 to be the actors 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.270
 That's why I work with my shoulder camera 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.520
 without cuts it like it before it 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.080
 It means action every time 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.300
 prepare and it's easy 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.300
 exhausting to do that every 30 seconds 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.290
 especially stahel is great every 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.819
 when you have an emotional scene 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.980
 had to turn the room full of people 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.600
 but still she was fully focused 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.760
 you always had the feeling she is 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.680
 Ready you just wanted the right one 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.560
 moment to say she is done 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.050
 I can not feel any pain 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.910
 no fear, as if everything was 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.360
 what makes us human fades 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.180
 All this know about everything 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.140
 I start with it I'm in twelve 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.440
 hours in front of your door 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.440
 Lucy roll off August only in the cinema 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.180
 I was vulnerable just like you 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.220
 uncertain he is afraid of death 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:05.239
 then everything has changed just before 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:09.099
 Twelve hours I have not done anything 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.099
 I implore her a bit 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.290
 we have a package with something very 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.880
 also used and special in theirs 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.830
 they will transport it for us 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.380
 Follow the rules and it will 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.740
 nobody hurt i'm not in 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.740
 Mood 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.430
 It says we only use ten people 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:36.390
 percent of our cerebral skills 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:38.070
 but what if there is a way out 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.250
 to one hundred percent of our brain too 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:51.330
 gain 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:52.710
 then why would we be able professor 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.300
 Norman I do your research 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.410
 about the human brain read it 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.300
 There are a few gaps in what I am up to 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.230
 the right track 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:02.660
 Thank you I am capable of doing you 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.760
 had never done before 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.140
 I feel everything and I can do that 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.760
 Control elements around me 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.760
 we must get sick 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.940
 believe me 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.800
 The chemical allows her new areale 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.300
 unlock your brain 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:25.440
 she has skills 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:28.690
 it must not fall into the wrong hands 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:34.390
 and let's say there is no movement 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:38.190
 Please take your hands up 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.190
 brain capacity grows with every minute 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.370
 What happens if you lower than percent 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.370
 reached 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:54.990
 I have no idea 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.990
 but she is the key to everything 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.120
 I drive 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.120
 no, this is a police car
