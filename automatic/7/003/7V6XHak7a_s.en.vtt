00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.460
 Hello 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.410
 the quick guide from before acz is a hero 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.840
 of strength that fulfills the function of 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.940
 tank in a game we will see that your 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.590
 skills have good synergy with the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.390
 Translation dagger which 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.529
 provides good capabilities 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.950
 initiator 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.140
 when activating the cv acz they will win a lot but 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.030
 that much additional armor and will force 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.330
 to the enemies around him to attack him 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.360
 for a few seconds 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.580
 with the w when clicking an enemy causes 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.530
 we will do damage per second slow down 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.970
 We have your movement speed jacks 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.510
 will get movement speed 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.510
 additional 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.890
 The more enemies we mark the more 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.890
 speed movement will get ac 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.640
 the w will last until the end of the 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.420
 effect or until the enemy kills a 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.420
 enemy unit 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.410
 age is a passive skill that 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.270
 provides a probability that 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.680
 when it is attacked return a 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.760
 counterattack that harms all 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.760
 enemies around you 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.490
 with the last one that will give you an ax 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.530
 enemy taking away life isis enemy 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.600
 is below the threshold of life what 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.550
 I will kill is entirely hidden where the 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.140
 skill will restart jacques and his 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.240
 close allies will gain speed of 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.490
 additional movement 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.920
 as for the order of skills what 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.619
 we will do as follows at level 1 we 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.920
 we will give a point on level 2 ea and 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.350
 level 3 we will give points in the wa 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.930
 level 4 here puts in the point in the ep 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.490
 but this is already to everyone's taste 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.560
 I also recommend taking a point in the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.600
 cv at level 4 because they are 40 armor 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.820
 not too much mana and we can really 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.560
 help to help an ally or is able to 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.479
 end situations 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.000
 from here max we will first make the 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.490
 w followed by the e and finally the q 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.829
 respecting the last levels 6 11 and 16 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.659
 another appreciation for those who 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.700
 play here in the jungle that is also 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.130
 viable in the case of playing it in the 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.110
 jungle as I say max we will do before the 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.970
 that the w 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.530
 as for the seven months that we 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.420
 compare with acz 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.960
 are the following for the line 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.790
 we'll start with the scudetto tangos at a 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.560
 life position 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.260
 this was not quite enough in 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.020
 line after as you say principals I've 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.940
 highlighted the most important shield gere 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.310
 conax is what will give us that ability 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.490
 of initiation we listen with the linda 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.780
 de de act has been used the cv and 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.830
 the mana routes 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.750
 there are really enough boots 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.280
 to be made extra for me and for 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.650
 many people the best a week 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.080
 because that way we can act a character 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.209
 that boasts of having a lot of mana and this 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:49.190
 provokes us will always provide mana 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:51.770
 for one last w etcetera as after 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.200
 situational item is good late items 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.850
 game we have there the heart of Tarascan and 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.550
 the bloodstone two sites that we 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.840
 will make very very tanks especially the 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.660
 bloodstone that provides us 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.550
 also mana to add skills and you 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.950
 institutional we can 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:12.890
 highlight the mesh of blades the chivas 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.020
 if they have a lot of physical Pipe year if 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.880
 they have much magical year and the halberd 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.710
 heavenly if we have if they have any 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.780
 car or some character that is giving 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.360
 many problems and be necessary 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.090
 neutralize good in terms of 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.870
 counter picks which characters are strong 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.930
 with tracks 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.140
 I would mention three in the first place 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.959
 er lifestyle lifestyle we know that is the 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.120
 anti tanks when doing damage by 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.860
 percentage of maximum rise although ex 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.290
 have armor this will follow 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.170
 doing a lot of damage apart from it being 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.220
 ex activates the cube the mania of blades 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.270
 textiles you just have to activate your CV 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.610
 to get rid of this 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:55.060
 on the other hand is in chan three in three 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.750
 econsult and does pure damage that is to say the 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.940
 armor of axs is useless 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.890
 last of investment of 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.800
 investment has its main strength 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.710
 source of damage is magical and there too 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:11.400
 can do pure harm apart from what it does 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:13.410
 hurt a skillful with its removing attribute 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.790
 main character who does that 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.120
 it will be used so it will also 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:21.000
 would take more life to take strength 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.660
 on the other hand against what characters is 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.540
 good acz 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.270
 well here there are enough I think for 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.470
 mention but I'm going to stay with the 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.289
 that I consider access 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.779
 it is mainly strong against them 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:37.389
 First of all judge judge is a 

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:40.719
 character that as we know consulting is 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:43.029
 would throw away at that moment a 

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:45.669
 percentage of life but from here 

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:47.379
 judge will go hitting us and how much 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.199
 less life has faster we will go 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:52.569
 hitting is going to let us do it 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.219
 that jump many more times is not the 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.629
 passive of ours is why he goes to 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:57.550
 receive a lot of damage 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:59.379
 also putting this together all the armor 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.020
 that we have to look at a lot year 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:03.339
 if we activate the q still more armor and 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.469
 if we have the mesh of blades 

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:07.080
 practically without judging is going to die 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:09.300
 single 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.610
 in second place I would mention fantome 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.409
 lancer and bruce hose to these two 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.270
 characters annoy you the next 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:17.819
 way they both become invisible 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.800
 jacques you can take them out of their invisible 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:23.009
 with the q he forces them to attack him so 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.719
 that I take them to invisibility and both 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:26.789
 bruce mather with his spiders like 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:29.129
 laser phantom with your copies if you 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:32.219
 put all to focus will be done c's 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:34.500
 many people hitting him are going to do like 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:36.539
 asia seek to jump many more times 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.789
 the suez passive that hurts the area 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.800
 so doing a lot of damage and everyone like that 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.659
 that to clean the copies and more 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.050
 whoever is attacking him receives 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:48.319
 pretty hurt 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:52.250
 and finally I would highlight the shell 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:55.009
 as as late counter axa das el la w 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.830
 of giving oneself yes it is thrown by an ally or 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:59.900
 It will also make them unable to 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.470
 kill it so be immortal for about 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.289
 seconds 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.690
 this does not affect the last c's 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:07.729
 if a person has the w of the he is 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.310
 immortal but is below the threshold 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:13.129
 AXS life is if you strip the last 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.500
 he will give equal wy everything 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:18.590
 is going to kill him instantly so why 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.539
 that motive is included in this group 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.840
 of characters from those who hit the 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:26.960
 cracks does counter and up to here the guide 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.879
 quick axs I hope you find it useful and 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.370
