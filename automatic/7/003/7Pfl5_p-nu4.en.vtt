00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
up getting up to three or four thousand

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.260 
up getting up to three or four thousand
pounds<00:00:37.500> from<00:00:37.710> them<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.160> leave<00:00:39.000> them<00:00:39.030> without

pounds from them and leave them without
a<00:00:39.450> car<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.110> it's<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.760> quite<00:00:41.760> serious<00:00:42.239> situation

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
a car so it's a quite serious situation

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.770 
a car so it's a quite serious situation
and<00:00:43.670> thirty<00:00:44.670> five<00:00:44.910> thousand<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.420> these<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.600> week

and thirty five thousand of these a week

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.240 
and thirty five thousand of these a week
and<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.410> think<00:00:46.620> most<00:00:46.739> people<00:00:47.070> are<00:00:47.160> pretty

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
and I think most people are pretty

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.940 
and I think most people are pretty
horrified<00:00:47.760> by<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.110> so<00:00:49.110> anyway<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.649> just<00:00:49.710> thought

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
horrified by it so anyway I just thought

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.979 
horrified by it so anyway I just thought
one<00:00:50.250> other<00:00:50.430> little<00:00:50.579> funny<00:00:50.910> thing<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.360> not

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
one other little funny thing is that not

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.959 
one other little funny thing is that not
only<00:00:52.110> was<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.379> 700-pound<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.280> it's<00:00:53.399> also<00:00:53.520> one

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
only was it 700-pound but it's also one

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.979 
only was it 700-pound but it's also one

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
pound 25 handling fee to use visa but

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.529 
pound 25 handling fee to use visa but

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
are that they're basically kind of very

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.609
