00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
another main feature of barbershop music

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.130 
another main feature of barbershop music
is<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.310> fact<00:02:50.610> that<00:02:51.120> all<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.750> words<00:02:51.959> are

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
is the fact that all of the words are

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.930 
is the fact that all of the words are
understandable<00:02:52.830> and<00:02:53.040> that's<00:02:53.220> because<00:02:53.520> barber

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
understandable and that's because barber

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.720

shoppers<00:02:54.330> use<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.440> vowels<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.190> carry<00:02:56.519> the

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
shoppers use the vowels to carry the

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.509 
shoppers use the vowels to carry the
sound<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.720> then<00:02:57.930> we<00:02:58.019> use<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.230> consonants<00:02:58.950> to

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
sound and then we use the consonants to

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.180 
sound and then we use the consonants to
emphasize<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.450> meaning<00:03:00.600> so<00:03:00.900> if<00:03:01.019> you

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
emphasize the meaning so if you

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.920 
emphasize the meaning so if you
overemphasize<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.370> consonants<00:03:02.970> you'll<00:03:03.780> give

overemphasize the consonants you'll give

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:12.160 
overemphasize the consonants you'll give
the<00:03:04.080> words<00:03:04.260> greater<00:03:04.680> meaning
