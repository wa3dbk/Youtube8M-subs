to make sure I got it before something

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.920 
to make sure I got it before something
happened<00:03:06.829> it<00:03:07.220> wasn't<00:03:07.400> available<00:03:07.760> anymore<00:03:08.180> cuz

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
happened it wasn't available anymore cuz

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.410 
happened it wasn't available anymore cuz
like<00:03:09.859> this<00:03:10.099> summer<00:03:10.370> we<00:03:10.609> saw<00:03:10.849> with<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.150> sunny

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
like this summer we saw with the sunny

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:18.030 
like this summer we saw with the sunny
Isle<00:03:11.689> outlet<00:03:12.400> it<00:03:13.400> was<00:03:13.700> gone<00:03:14.030> before<00:03:16.269> fall<00:03:17.269> even

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
Isle outlet it was gone before fall even

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.240 
Isle outlet it was gone before fall even
so<00:03:19.040> I<00:03:19.430> guess<00:03:20.209> it<00:03:20.359> was<00:03:20.480> a<00:03:20.510> really<00:03:20.870> true<00:03:21.680> sell<00:03:22.010> out

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
so I guess it was a really true sell out

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.180 
so I guess it was a really true sell out
so<00:03:22.959> hopefully<00:03:23.959> this<00:03:24.319> will<00:03:24.470> be<00:03:24.590> around<00:03:24.799> for<00:03:25.160> a
