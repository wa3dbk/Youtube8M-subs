don't a common misconception is thinking
that<00:01:47.040> all<00:01:47.190> right<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.340> need<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.580> train<00:01:47.790> arms<00:01:48.090> like

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
that all right I need to train arms like

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.870 
that all right I need to train arms like
three<00:01:48.570> days<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> week<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.530> order<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.100> get<00:01:50.640> bigger

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
three days a week in order to get bigger

three days a week in order to get bigger
arms<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.480> we<00:01:51.840> don't<00:01:52.110> have<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.530> do<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.100> if

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
arms and we don't have to do that so if

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.040 
arms and we don't have to do that so if
you<00:01:53.280> stick<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.550> the<00:01:53.730> program<00:01:54.150> by<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.780> end<00:01:54.990> of

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
you stick to the program by the end of

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.730 
you stick to the program by the end of
the<00:01:55.110> program

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
the program

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.710 
the program
definitely<00:01:56.040> have<00:01:56.130> bigger<00:01:56.340> arms<00:01:56.820> assuming

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
definitely have bigger arms assuming

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.539 
definitely have bigger arms assuming
your<00:01:57.990> nutrition<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.860> place<00:01:59.100> right<00:01:59.340> that's

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
your nutrition is in place right that's

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.819 
your nutrition is in place right that's
kind<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.939> third<00:02:00.270> missing<00:02:00.810> element<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.680> can

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
kind of a third missing element that can

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.380 
kind of a third missing element that can
really<00:02:01.979> throw<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.280> lot<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.520> guys<00:02:02.759> off<00:02:03.000> because

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
really throw a lot of guys off because

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.330 
really throw a lot of guys off because
your<00:02:03.899> body<00:02:04.080> doesn't<00:02:04.350> just<00:02:04.560> build<00:02:04.740> muscle<00:02:05.189> out

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
your body doesn't just build muscle out

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.219 
your body doesn't just build muscle out
of<00:02:05.580> thin<00:02:05.759> air<00:02:05.939> right<00:02:06.360> we<00:02:06.509> need<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.810> give<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.200> the

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
of thin air right we need to give it the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.839 
of thin air right we need to give it the
right<00:02:07.470> supplies<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.220> right<00:02:08.340> nutrients

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
right supplies and the right nutrients

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.059 
right supplies and the right nutrients
so<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.209> can<00:02:09.390> take<00:02:10.080> those<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.380> turn<00:02:10.920> them

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
so that it can take those and turn them

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.880 
so that it can take those and turn them
in<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.280> muscle<00:02:11.720> we<00:02:12.720> start<00:02:13.019> off<00:02:13.110> with<00:02:13.290> first<00:02:13.560> is

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
in the muscle we start off with first is

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.380 
in the muscle we start off with first is
close<00:02:14.190> grip<00:02:14.400> bench<00:02:14.459> press<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.150> we're<00:02:15.269> going

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
close grip bench press and we're going

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.300 
close grip bench press and we're going
to<00:02:15.420> do<00:02:15.510> four<00:02:15.750> sets<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:16.200> ten<00:02:16.260> reps<00:02:16.530> for<00:02:17.130> this

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
to do four sets of ten reps for this

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.460 
to do four sets of ten reps for this
exercise<00:02:17.819> and<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:18.599> is<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.780> great<00:02:19.110> exercise

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
exercise and this is a great exercise

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.580 
exercise and this is a great exercise
because<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.550> uses<00:02:21.150> our<00:02:21.480> chest<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:22.170> help<00:02:22.440> us

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
because it uses our chest to help us

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.059 
because it uses our chest to help us
lift<00:02:22.860> more<00:02:23.190> weight<00:02:23.489> on<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.940> triceps<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:25.069> kind

of overload them so right from the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.699 
of overload them so right from the
beginning<00:02:27.540> we're<00:02:27.870> telling<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.170> triceps<00:02:28.560> hey
