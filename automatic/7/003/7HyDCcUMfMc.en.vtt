00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
right arrow keys you can go over and now

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.760 
right arrow keys you can go over and now
you<00:01:44.850> get<00:01:45.030> your<00:01:45.210> types<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:46.049> I'm<00:01:46.170> browsing<00:01:46.380> all

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
you get your types so I'm browsing all

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.460 
you get your types so I'm browsing all
products<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.610> now<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.149> can<00:01:48.360> go<00:01:48.509> into<00:01:48.690> base<00:01:49.050> I

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
products and now I can go into base I

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.050 
products and now I can go into base I
can<00:01:49.830> go<00:01:49.920> into<00:01:50.070> whatever<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.670> you'll<00:01:50.790> notice

can go into whatever and you'll notice
that<00:01:51.450> any<00:01:52.020> time<00:01:52.290> there's<00:01:52.500> more<00:01:52.770> filters<00:01:53.250> you

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
that any time there's more filters you

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.730 
that any time there's more filters you
can<00:01:53.399> use<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.180> get<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> little<00:01:54.990> dash<00:01:55.320> in

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
can use you get like a little dash in

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.920 
can use you get like a little dash in
these<00:01:56.159> columns<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:56.759> I'm<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:56.970> base<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.750> let's

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
these columns so I'm in base and let's

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.139 
these columns so I'm in base and let's
say<00:01:58.080> I<00:01:58.110> want<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.380> go<00:01:58.560> into<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.830> specific<00:01:59.430> style

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
say I want to go into a specific style

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.350 
say I want to go into a specific style
of<00:02:00.330> base<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.659> got<00:02:00.810> an<00:02:00.899> analog<00:02:01.229> base<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:03.030> now<00:02:03.299> I

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
of base I got an analog base and now I

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.109 
of base I got an analog base and now I
got<00:02:03.570> additive<00:02:04.050> and<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:05.190> narrows<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.759> down<00:02:05.789> that

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
got additive and it narrows it down that

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.050 
got additive and it narrows it down that
way<00:02:06.410> chords<00:02:07.410> whatever<00:02:08.039> that's<00:02:08.580> pretty<00:02:08.910> much

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
way chords whatever that's pretty much

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.759 
way chords whatever that's pretty much
how<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.330> works<00:02:09.509> it's<00:02:09.690> gonna<00:02:09.810> work<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.140> same<00:02:10.470> in

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
how it works it's gonna work the same in

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.280 
how it works it's gonna work the same in
any<00:02:11.280> category<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:12.420> again<00:02:12.690> we<00:02:12.810> can<00:02:12.900> go<00:02:13.019> back<00:02:13.050> to

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
any category so again we can go back to

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.040 
any category so again we can go back to
all<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:13.920> let's<00:02:14.580> say<00:02:14.760> affects<00:02:15.420> only<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.840> same

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
all and let's say affects only the same

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.360 
all and let's say affects only the same
thing<00:02:16.319> so<00:02:16.500> if<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.680> want<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:16.890> browse<00:02:17.100> all

thing so if you want to browse all

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.490 
thing so if you want to browse all
effects<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.880> can<00:02:18.030> do<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:18.420> or<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:19.140> can<00:02:19.260> go<00:02:19.380> into

effects you can do so or you can go into

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.490 
effects you can do so or you can go into
the<00:02:19.650> individual<00:02:20.250> products<00:02:21.209> fm8<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.350> let's

say I want a specific bank maybe legacy

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.120 
say I want a specific bank maybe legacy
now<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.069> can<00:02:26.280> go<00:02:26.459> over<00:02:26.489> and<00:02:27.200> there's<00:02:28.200> my<00:02:28.470> effects

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
now I can go over and there's my effects

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.860 
now I can go over and there's my effects
right<00:02:29.280> there<00:02:29.519> so<00:02:29.850> pretty<00:02:30.540> straightforward
