 the road of turquoise named so because 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.040
 there was the famous blue stone 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.519

 the desert atmosphere and abandoned us 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:36.510
 like a lot more on the road of 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.980

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.540
 hot 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.870

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.059

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.509
 of a sleeping volcano the abbas room is 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.160
 a very clean city 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.270
 that's where the bomb was designed 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.590
 atomic during the second war 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.990
 world by a whole team of 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.910
 scientists we come to santa fe under 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.539

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.850
 American 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.860
 we loved the oldest house of 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.110
 united states canyon roads and its galleries 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.149
 of art we walk in the city is 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.149
 very small very calm very chic 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.800
 we take the road that runs along the river 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.150
 great and approaching taos the 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.710
 great rio and finds himself at the bottom of a 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.510
 canyon that literally pierces this 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.229
 plateau there is wind that is an old 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.479
 truck or buy millas on va 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:02:01.729

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:04.100
 above the canyon tao it's a very small 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.310
 village raymond little we're going to be seven 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.899
 needles and then a hacienda that dates 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.470
 16th century 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.470
 Otherwise nothing 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.489
 stay here 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.270
 on his little cart does the real 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.739
 attraction of taos it's house pueblo the 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.180
 small village next door where lives a 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.819
 Indian community in these homes 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.220
 millennium there is also a lot of dog 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.900
 crazy they're going to make the fight we 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.150
 may not have much left over 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.769
 especially be large main square and 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.180
 during guided life we do not learn 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.519
 more things than on the brochure of 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.500
 the entrance but it's still worth it 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.709
 the place is very beautiful frozen in the 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.750
 time 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.160
 in front of the mountains and especially 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.160
 approach a unique culture 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.610
 we arrive at the sanctuary of chemo and 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.739
 how to say 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.019
 we did not like this place 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.430
 pilgrimage then certainly the church is 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.590
 very cute and the rest is creepy 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.349
 like this Christmas tree with its little ones 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.760
 slippers to have a baby for christmas 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:04.280
 we're right in the superstition 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.780
 the miracles is not too much our thing 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.180
 it's time to go back to the ebook 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.440
 hours that we have happened I have not 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.300
 filming all the shooting of breaking 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.220
 bad to see that you have to go on the 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.140
 blog directly 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.490
 we filmed his petroglyphs which dates from 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.810
 a few hundred years and who 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.970
 used to navigate the roads 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.610
 finally I say that but the meaning of his 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:27.050
 drawings is not sure and certain she 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:29.540
 is extremely hot very hot at night 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.250
 ride on Route 66 and despite 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.390
 neons in every way it's not the 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.390
 the craziest thing we've seen 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.360
 it was our model and its rooms 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:45.210
 great luxury you do not see but I did 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:50.430
 the tour of the coast big luxury little bonus 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.430
 green drink
