ended up triggering that rc-xd way too
early<00:02:16.120> it<00:02:16.510> wasn't<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.109> sniper<00:02:17.409> that<00:02:17.709> shot<00:02:18.010> it

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:18.189 
early it wasn't the sniper that shot it

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
in in the middle of round one see we

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.670 
in in the middle of round one see we
don't<00:02:28.490> have<00:02:28.640> any<00:02:28.790> score<00:02:29.140> myself<00:02:30.140> Axl<00:02:30.590> and

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
don't have any score myself Axl and

don't have any score myself Axl and
hyper<00:02:30.890> I<00:02:31.360> was<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.390> four<00:02:32.780> v6<00:02:33.380> like<00:02:34.310> i<00:02:34.400> said<00:02:34.610> i'm

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
hyper I was a four v6 like i said i'm

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.150 
hyper I was a four v6 like i said i'm
running<00:02:35.210> the<00:02:35.420> mp7<00:02:35.810> with<00:02:36.350> quick<00:02:36.620> draw<00:02:36.890> and

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
running the mp7 with quick draw and

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.610 
running the mp7 with quick draw and
suppressor<00:02:37.940> i<00:02:38.120> really<00:02:38.510> like<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.840> mp7<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.530> be

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
suppressor i really like the mp7 to be

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.180 
suppressor i really like the mp7 to be
honest<00:02:39.830> I<00:02:39.950> think<00:02:40.220> it's<00:02:40.370> next<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:42.290> PDW

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
honest I think it's next to the the PDW

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.900 
honest I think it's next to the the PDW
it's<00:02:43.490> probably<00:02:44.030> my<00:02:44.510> second<00:02:45.110> go<00:02:45.350> to<00:02:45.410> SMG<00:02:46.190> it's

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
it's probably my second go to SMG it's

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.990 
it's probably my second go to SMG it's
got<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.150> 40<00:02:47.570> round<00:02:47.780> magazine<00:02:48.620> capacity<00:02:49.000> which

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
got a 40 round magazine capacity which

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.170 
got a 40 round magazine capacity which
is<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.570> second<00:02:51.080> highest<00:02:51.110> of<00:02:51.710> all<00:02:51.980> smgs<00:02:52.940> it's

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
is the second highest of all smgs it's

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.910 
is the second highest of all smgs it's
got<00:02:53.300> a<00:02:53.330> pretty<00:02:53.510> decent<00:02:53.660> fire<00:02:54.050> rate<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.470> pretty

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
got a pretty decent fire rate a pretty

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.730 
got a pretty decent fire rate a pretty
decent<00:02:55.370> time<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:56.030> kill<00:02:56.330> um<00:02:56.870> one<00:02:57.410> thing<00:02:57.440> I

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
decent time to kill um one thing I

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.080 
decent time to kill um one thing I
thought<00:02:57.950> I<00:02:58.010> should<00:02:58.160> address<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:58.910> I've<00:02:58.970> been

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
thought I should address and I've been

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.610 
thought I should address and I've been
getting<00:02:59.360> a<00:02:59.450> couple<00:02:59.480> of<00:02:59.780> comments<00:02:59.930> or<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.260> see<00:03:00.470> it

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
getting a couple of comments or I see it

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.990 
getting a couple of comments or I see it
from<00:03:00.860> time<00:03:01.070> to<00:03:01.220> time<00:03:01.250> in<00:03:01.459> some<00:03:01.820> of<00:03:01.880> my<00:03:01.970> videos

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
from time to time in some of my videos

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.350 
from time to time in some of my videos
is<00:03:02.450> that<00:03:03.110> I<00:03:03.350> drop<00:03:03.800> shot<00:03:04.070> I<00:03:04.340> do<00:03:04.520> drop<00:03:05.000> shot<00:03:05.209> I've

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
is that I drop shot I do drop shot I've

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.360 
is that I drop shot I do drop shot I've
changed<00:03:05.690> to<00:03:05.990> a<00:03:06.020> tactical<00:03:06.709> button<00:03:06.920> layout<00:03:07.130> I

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
changed to a tactical button layout I

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.400 
changed to a tactical button layout I
think<00:03:07.730> in<00:03:07.820> modern<00:03:08.060> warfare<00:03:08.209> 3<00:03:08.360> I<00:03:08.630> change<00:03:09.050> to<00:03:09.290> it

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
think in modern warfare 3 I change to it

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.500 
think in modern warfare 3 I change to it
and<00:03:09.560> I've<00:03:10.130> been<00:03:10.280> drop<00:03:10.610> shotting<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:11.150> lot<00:03:11.360> and

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
and I've been drop shotting a lot and

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.170 
and I've been drop shotting a lot and
the<00:03:11.630> thing<00:03:11.840> is<00:03:11.870> I<00:03:12.290> do<00:03:12.350> it<00:03:12.709> every<00:03:12.920> almost<00:03:13.760> every

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
the thing is I do it every almost every

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.660 
the thing is I do it every almost every
time<00:03:14.480> I'm<00:03:14.810> shooting<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:15.380> it's<00:03:15.530> just<00:03:15.830> habit<00:03:16.340> is

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
time I'm shooting and it's just habit is

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.610 
time I'm shooting and it's just habit is
it<00:03:16.820> just<00:03:17.000> reflex<00:03:17.600> and<00:03:17.780> people<00:03:17.990> say<00:03:18.140> will<00:03:18.590> you

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
it just reflex and people say will you

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.260 
it just reflex and people say will you
shot<00:03:18.920> that<00:03:18.950> guy<00:03:19.280> in<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.490> back<00:03:19.700> there's<00:03:20.150> no

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
shot that guy in the back there's no

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.240 
shot that guy in the back there's no
need<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.480> drop<00:03:20.810> shot<00:03:21.140> you're<00:03:21.380> an<00:03:21.500> idiot<00:03:21.590> yeah

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
need to drop shot you're an idiot yeah

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.160 
need to drop shot you're an idiot yeah
but<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.520> problem<00:03:22.820> is<00:03:23.150> that's<00:03:23.690> what<00:03:23.870> I<00:03:23.900> do<00:03:24.020> I

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
but the problem is that's what I do I

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.830 
but the problem is that's what I do I
don't<00:03:24.440> think<00:03:25.340> about<00:03:25.610> I<00:03:25.910> don't<00:03:26.269> think<00:03:26.330> about

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
don't think about I don't think about

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.810 
don't think about I don't think about
drop<00:03:27.110> shotting<00:03:27.380> I<00:03:27.590> just<00:03:27.920> do<00:03:28.130> it<00:03:28.280> just<00:03:28.550> like<00:03:28.670> I

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
drop shotting I just do it just like I

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.699 
drop shotting I just do it just like I
did<00:03:28.880> there<00:03:29.239> it's<00:03:29.420> just<00:03:29.690> reaction<00:03:30.410> and<00:03:30.560> that's

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
did there it's just reaction and that's

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.100 
did there it's just reaction and that's
all<00:03:30.890> it<00:03:31.040> is<00:03:31.070> I<00:03:31.430> don't<00:03:32.090> take<00:03:32.330> the<00:03:32.540> time<00:03:32.720> to<00:03:32.930> think

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
all it is I don't take the time to think

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.110 
all it is I don't take the time to think
because<00:03:33.530> if<00:03:33.680> you<00:03:33.800> do<00:03:33.980> that<00:03:34.190> it's<00:03:34.610> just<00:03:34.880> going

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
because if you do that it's just going

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.570 
because if you do that it's just going
to<00:03:35.150> add<00:03:35.390> to<00:03:35.660> your<00:03:35.690> reaction<00:03:36.260> time<00:03:36.530> and<00:03:36.769> if<00:03:37.430> you

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
to add to your reaction time and if you

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.670 
to add to your reaction time and if you
know<00:03:37.790> I<00:03:38.209> make<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:38.900> decision<00:03:39.260> should<00:03:39.290> i<00:03:39.470> drop

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
know I make the decision should i drop

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.770 
know I make the decision should i drop
shot<00:03:39.890> or<00:03:40.010> not<00:03:40.190> in<00:03:40.370> this<00:03:40.489> situation<00:03:40.820> then<00:03:41.750> it's

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
shot or not in this situation then it's

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.840 
shot or not in this situation then it's
going<00:03:42.260> to<00:03:42.320> add<00:03:42.500> to<00:03:42.709> my<00:03:42.739> reaction<00:03:43.310> time<00:03:43.459> in<00:03:43.670> all

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
going to add to my reaction time in all

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.870 
going to add to my reaction time in all
situations<00:03:44.150> ok<00:03:44.959> so<00:03:45.350> I<00:03:45.380> think<00:03:45.470> there<00:03:45.890> are<00:03:45.920> two

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
situations ok so I think there are two

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.600 
situations ok so I think there are two
players<00:03:47.180> left<00:03:47.440> possibly<00:03:48.440> axles<00:03:49.340> running

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
players left possibly axles running

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.009 
players left possibly axles running
around<00:03:49.910> there's<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.510> guy<00:03:50.630> with<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.810> ride

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
around there's the guy with the ride
