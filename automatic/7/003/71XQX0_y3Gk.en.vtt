just kept everything calm and cool and
more<00:02:19.220> often<00:02:19.519> than<00:02:19.700> not<00:02:19.730> competed<00:02:20.629> really<00:02:20.750> well

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.220 

yeah<00:02:25.549> I<00:02:25.580> had<00:02:25.730> some<00:02:25.879> good<00:02:26.150> results<00:02:26.510> in<00:02:27.110> my

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
yeah I had some good results in my

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.520 
yeah I had some good results in my
career<00:02:27.650> I<00:02:28.220> won<00:02:28.549> US<00:02:29.180> national<00:02:29.720> championships

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
career I won US national championships

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.320 
career I won US national championships
three<00:02:30.739> times<00:02:31.069> in<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.430> row<00:02:31.580> which<00:02:31.849> I<00:02:32.000> don't<00:02:32.180> think

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
three times in a row which I don't think

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.600 
three times in a row which I don't think
anyone<00:02:32.750> in<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:32.989> u.s.<00:02:33.260> severed<00:02:33.769> on<00:02:33.890> so<00:02:34.250> he<00:02:34.489> had

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
anyone in the u.s. severed on so he had

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.390 
anyone in the u.s. severed on so he had
a<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:35.360> be<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.540> top<00:02:35.900> dog<00:02:35.930> for<00:02:36.590> three<00:02:36.799> years<00:02:37.099> was

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
a to be the top dog for three years was

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.460 
a to be the top dog for three years was
just<00:02:37.430> so<00:02:38.180> cool

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.080 

so<00:02:42.470> when<00:02:42.650> he<00:02:42.890> made<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:43.820> team<00:02:44.000> in<00:02:45.280> 2010<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:46.640> was

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
so when he made the team in 2010 I was

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.900 
so when he made the team in 2010 I was
very<00:02:47.960> excited<00:02:48.500> for<00:02:48.680> my<00:02:48.950> own<00:02:49.070> selfish<00:02:49.490> reasons

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
very excited for my own selfish reasons

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.330 
very excited for my own selfish reasons
because<00:02:50.090> I<00:02:50.480> knew<00:02:50.690> how<00:02:51.350> much<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:51.560> mattered<00:02:52.220> to

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
because I knew how much it mattered to

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.610 
because I knew how much it mattered to
Dylan<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:53.450> go<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.750> Olympics<00:02:54.110> for<00:02:54.170> aerials

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
Dylan to go to the Olympics for aerials

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.790 
Dylan to go to the Olympics for aerials
but<00:02:54.950> we<00:02:55.640> all<00:02:55.790> myself<00:02:56.480> included<00:02:57.230> wanted<00:02:57.530> him<00:02:57.710> to

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
but we all myself included wanted him to

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.180 
but we all myself included wanted him to
just<00:02:58.010> kind<00:02:58.790> of<00:02:58.900> put<00:02:59.900> more<00:03:00.050> time<00:03:00.260> into<00:03:00.530> skiing

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
just kind of put more time into skiing

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.490 
just kind of put more time into skiing

gonna kill it and do well and then that

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.490 
gonna kill it and do well and then that
chapter<00:03:08.420> was<00:03:08.570> life<00:03:08.750> would<00:03:08.900> be<00:03:08.990> over<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:09.380> he

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
chapter was life would be over and he

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.400 
chapter was life would be over and he
could<00:03:09.920> now<00:03:10.190> move<00:03:11.090> on<00:03:11.330> to<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.600> next<00:03:11.810> thing<00:03:11.930> with

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410

us

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.970 

and<00:03:24.709> the<00:03:24.830> hard<00:03:25.040> thing<00:03:25.250> about<00:03:25.280> aerials<00:03:26.000> is<00:03:26.269> it's

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
and the hard thing about aerials is it's

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.500 
and the hard thing about aerials is it's
you<00:03:27.980> know<00:03:28.099> on<00:03:28.250> such<00:03:28.519> a<00:03:28.550> set<00:03:28.910> schedule<00:03:29.450> people
