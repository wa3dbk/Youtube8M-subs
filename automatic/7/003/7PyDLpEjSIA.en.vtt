00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello everyone welcome to this new 

00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:07.890
 delivery of the android section of your 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.950
 point gamer today I bring you a 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.590
 small review of some minecraft pocket 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.809
 edition an excellent game I hope that a 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.179
 everyone like it is a paid game in a 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.099
 play but that's really worth it 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.980
 to stay in order not to miss what 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.980
 come and subscribe to not miss out on 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.330
 nothing else 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.460
 as we all know it in the version of 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.430
 pc is an adventure game in which 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.739
 let's incarnate a small miner with 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.440
 who are we going to have to survive let's go 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.570
 to have to create things, let's go 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.210
 needing we are going to have to go 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.710
 progressing also build different 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.989
 tools we are going to see get 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.000
 different materials and of course 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.760
 we will be able to create everything that we 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.070
 I felt like the truth, it turned out to be a game 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.750
 excellent, I'm very surprised 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.020
 similar it has with the pc version 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.790
 a recommendation that I am going to make 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.140
 Be careful with the nights if it is that 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:06.050
 they play it in the survival mode 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.640
 since it is usually filled with monsters there 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.520
 as we are seeing the distance we have 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.310
 to a damn kripper those who are going to 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.549
 chase until tired 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.240
 and if we kill each other and come very close 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:22.430
 they will explode and they will break destroy 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.439
 everything they have nearby and if they were 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.009
 course they are going to kill us, I have a 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.539
 zombie close the question because the truth 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.399
 I liked the recommendation that 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.659
 I'll give them when they start what 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.979
 first they have to do is put together 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.460
 I now have wood tools 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.860
 stone let's vote this zombie 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.440
 for pure fun to hit them 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.440
 they have to touch you have to touch them 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.140
 and in that way he manages to hit when 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.390
 it just starts as I was telling you there are 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.720
 hit with whatever they have to the 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.990
 hand or with the same hand a tree and 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.840
 gather wood to the first to be 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.370
 slow and yes, but be calm 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.070
 that is already progressing with the 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.220
 tools is going to be faster a 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.080
 once they have some wood 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.390
 have to come here to these three points 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.870
 that they see at the bottom and they're going to 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.810
 where it says craft there in kraft first 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.240
 that they believe in these little blocks 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.250
 of wood and you will need one of these 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.300
 of these pieces of wood 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.290
 when they have their wooden blocks 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.439
 they build a fretbox 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.310
 with that kraft box to be able to create 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.310
 many other things 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.750
 once they are ready already 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.140
 have something to do chris bell creepers 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.140
 do not 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.280
 my house is near 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:58.630
 there is perfect as you come here I already have 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.630
 made my little lairs 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.870
 Now it's a little dark and I ask you 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.870
 apology for that 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:12.900
 but as I was telling you to start 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.900
 damage the spider to scratch 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.850
 to start a small den grows 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.530
 and once they are in account they should 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.319
 put the doors as they say 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.180
 and what I recommend is that you create a 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.020
 I'm going to show you, I'm going to create a 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.020
 fret board 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.610
 perfect for the team and place it 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.260
 anywhere in the craft table eo les 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.970
 I recommend creating a bed go 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.580
 walking the map until 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.620
 find some sheep and kill it together 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.150
 to the wool and then create a bed for 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.849
 that is going to serve you in the camera this is 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.260
 for those who do not know minecraft 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.330
 they simply come to their lair they close 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.580
 the door of course if they do not have 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.790
 block door with some block 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.150
 of stone or wood whatever it is that 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.150
 have 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.280
 to hold the bed created and the 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.380
 bed placed in its place but what 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.790
 can see is quite dark it 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.379
 they sleep 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.299
 what will happen is that they are going to 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:18.090
 wake up the next day when the sun is 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.400
 up above then well no 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.259
 monster is going to bother is something 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.820
 very good so that when it gets dark 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:26.580
 directly they come and they go to bed 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.949
 sleep and then you can continue with your 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:33.110
 I'm going to show you a little adventure 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.110
 how is the world now that day 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:41.260
 the truth is very, very good, I like it 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.390
 very much as you see I did this little 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.970
 tower to locate it then I can go out 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:49.580
 to explore and whenever you see this tower 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:52.569
 I will remember that here is close 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.569
 small hour 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.819
 As you can see we have different too 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.520
 elements we have earth we have sand 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:01.390
 water and rock and I have not finished too much 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.300
 deep 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.790
 if we check the kraft table , we're going 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.240
 to be able to see that many things for 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.240
 build 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.870
 he named them and renamed them 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.180
 This is a paid game on Google Play 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.690
 but that the truth is worth a lot 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.110
 pity is very entertaining and there is a lot to 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.390
 do 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:30.860
 I'm sure it's going to bring you 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:32.539
 many many hours of entertainment 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.129
 we will be able to play also in a way 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:37.509
 online I am playing now in modes 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:37.509
 simple player 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:48.320
 good to know what happens when 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.320
 the bugs come out in the sun 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.009
 as they see when the monsters come out 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.900
 Sun 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:56.780
 they are going to die 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:59.830
 the other zombie 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.910
 let's see if we can make it out 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.910
 let's go to sleep 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:13.920
 let's see how nice he dies so I 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.210
 die 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.210
 good are women 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:22.560
 nowadays the pc version is already 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:25.110
 much more advanced there are many other 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.380
 more things to do that I do have the 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.480
 6 I keep it in mind but in general 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.550
 game and the mechanics of the game is very 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.870
 but very similar I think that you 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.510
 should 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.800
 buy it of course there are other ways 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:39.450
 to get it but I recommend that 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.150
 buy it so you can receive the 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:45.300
