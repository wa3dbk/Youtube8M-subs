00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
of like an apple day so I cut up an

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.950 
of like an apple day so I cut up an
apple<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.549> put<00:01:30.030> pieces<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.600> into<00:01:30.780> my

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
apple and put pieces of it into my

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.200 
apple and put pieces of it into my
oatmeal<00:01:31.250> I<00:01:32.250> actually<00:01:32.579> didn't<00:01:32.880> put<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.030> much

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
oatmeal I actually didn't put that much

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.670 
oatmeal I actually didn't put that much
oat<00:01:33.390> meal<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.750> today<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.020> think<00:01:34.140> getting<00:01:34.500> that

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
oat meal in today I think getting that

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.280 
oat meal in today I think getting that
like<00:01:34.890> I'm<00:01:35.670> not<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.000> hungry<00:01:36.180> but<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.840> realized

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
like I'm not that hungry but I realized

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.249 
like I'm not that hungry but I realized
I'm<00:01:37.470> gonna<00:01:37.619> have<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.829> eat<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.009> entire<00:01:38.189> Apple

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
I'm gonna have to eat this entire Apple

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.429 
I'm gonna have to eat this entire Apple
so<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:41.340> ratio<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.820> probably<00:01:42.210> really<00:01:42.720> off<00:01:42.960> but

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
so the ratio is probably really off but

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.980 
so the ratio is probably really off but
it's<00:01:44.280> okay<00:01:44.640> i'm<00:01:44.909> still<00:01:45.299> really<00:01:45.420> excited<00:01:45.899> to

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
it's okay i'm still really excited to

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.109 
it's okay i'm still really excited to
eat<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.140> cuz<00:01:46.470> cold<00:01:46.829> apples<00:01:47.310> with<00:01:47.490> hot<00:01:47.820> oatmeal
