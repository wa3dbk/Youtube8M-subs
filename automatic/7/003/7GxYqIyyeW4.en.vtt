go ahead and answer question number one

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.370 
go ahead and answer question number one
is<00:00:26.020> what<00:00:27.010> is<00:00:27.160> topspin<00:00:27.780> question<00:00:28.780> number<00:00:29.080> two

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
is what is topspin question number two

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.549 
is what is topspin question number two
is<00:00:29.680> why<00:00:30.490> is<00:00:30.550> topspin<00:00:31.119> important<00:00:31.660> and<00:00:31.869> question

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
is why is topspin important and question

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.349 
is why is topspin important and question
number<00:00:32.800> three<00:00:33.070> is<00:00:33.250> how<00:00:33.730> do<00:00:33.789> I<00:00:33.940> hit<00:00:34.149> with

00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:34.359 
number three is how do I hit with

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:37.319 
number three is how do I hit with
topspin<00:00:34.890> okay<00:00:35.890> our<00:00:36.010> first<00:00:36.159> question<00:00:36.640> is<00:00:36.789> what

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
topspin okay our first question is what

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:38.279 
topspin okay our first question is what
is<00:00:37.359> topspin

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:38.289 
is topspin

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:40.709 
is topspin
now<00:00:38.710> what<00:00:38.949> topspin<00:00:39.460> is<00:00:39.699> if<00:00:39.909> you<00:00:40.149> were<00:00:40.479> to<00:00:40.600> have

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
now what topspin is if you were to have

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:43.049 
now what topspin is if you were to have
a<00:00:40.780> ball<00:00:41.050> like<00:00:41.260> this<00:00:41.319> what<00:00:41.920> you<00:00:41.949> have<00:00:42.280> is<00:00:42.550> is<00:00:42.940> you

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
a ball like this what you have is is you

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:44.880 
a ball like this what you have is is you
have<00:00:43.149> a<00:00:43.239> spin<00:00:43.539> on<00:00:43.569> the<00:00:43.719> ball<00:00:44.019> and<00:00:44.260> as<00:00:44.589> the<00:00:44.710> ball

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
have a spin on the ball and as the ball

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.279 
have a spin on the ball and as the ball
comes<00:00:45.219> towards<00:00:45.699> you<00:00:45.850> that<00:00:46.059> ball<00:00:46.659> is<00:00:46.839> spinning

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289 
comes towards you that ball is spinning

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:51.509 
comes towards you that ball is spinning
from<00:00:48.100> top<00:00:48.489> to<00:00:48.789> bottom<00:00:49.559> rush<00:00:50.559> number<00:00:50.889> two<00:00:51.069> why

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
from top to bottom rush number two why

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.639 
from top to bottom rush number two why
is<00:00:51.579> topspin<00:00:52.120> important<00:00:52.659> topspin<00:00:53.589> is

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
is topspin important topspin is

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.219 
is topspin important topspin is
important<00:00:54.249> because<00:00:54.429> wherever<00:00:55.389> the<00:00:55.719> ball<00:00:55.899> is

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:56.229 
important because wherever the ball is

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:58.049 
important because wherever the ball is
rotating<00:00:56.889> say<00:00:57.100> for<00:00:57.309> example<00:00:57.699> of<00:00:57.789> ball<00:00:57.940> is

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
rotating say for example of ball is

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.139 
rotating say for example of ball is
rotating<00:00:58.889> moving<00:00:59.889> along<00:01:00.159> this<00:01:00.459> pattern<00:01:00.999> and

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
rotating moving along this pattern and

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.110 
rotating moving along this pattern and
is<00:01:02.079> rotating<00:01:02.709> from<00:01:03.249> top<00:01:03.549> to<00:01:03.579> bottom

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
is rotating from top to bottom

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.270 
is rotating from top to bottom
meaning<00:01:04.420> rotating<00:01:04.930> down<00:01:05.110> what<00:01:05.740> happens<00:01:06.130> is

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
meaning rotating down what happens is

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.039 
meaning rotating down what happens is
when<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.549> ball<00:01:06.700> is<00:01:06.759> rotating<00:01:07.060> down<00:01:07.570> it's

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
when the ball is rotating down it's

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.350 
when the ball is rotating down it's
travel<00:01:08.740> will<00:01:09.100> naturally<00:01:09.310> occur<00:01:09.909> to<00:01:10.060> be<00:01:10.149> down

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
travel will naturally occur to be down

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.810 
travel will naturally occur to be down
depending<00:01:10.960> on<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.350> rpms<00:01:11.860> the<00:01:12.130> revolutions

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
depending on the rpms the revolutions

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.580 
depending on the rpms the revolutions
per<00:01:13.060> minute<00:01:13.329> of<00:01:13.719> this<00:01:13.869> ball<00:01:14.140> the<00:01:14.409> more

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
per minute of this ball the more

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.560 
per minute of this ball the more
revolutions<00:01:15.250> per<00:01:15.280> minute<00:01:15.430> the<00:01:16.030> more<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.390> ball

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
revolutions per minute the more the ball

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.899 
revolutions per minute the more the ball
goes<00:01:16.869> down<00:01:17.039> why<00:01:18.039> would<00:01:18.219> we<00:01:18.340> want<00:01:18.490> to<00:01:18.579> hit<00:01:18.729> with

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
goes down why would we want to hit with

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:19.620 
goes down why would we want to hit with
topspin

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
topspin

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.410 
topspin
if<00:01:19.780> you<00:01:20.350> hit<00:01:20.560> with<00:01:20.740> topspin<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.549> ball<00:01:21.850> at<00:01:22.390> a

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
if you hit with topspin the ball at a

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.620 
if you hit with topspin the ball at a
higher<00:01:22.689> trajectory<00:01:22.930> can<00:01:23.649> go<00:01:23.799> over<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:25.149> net<00:01:25.420> at

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
higher trajectory can go over the net at

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.679 
higher trajectory can go over the net at
a<00:01:25.659> higher<00:01:26.109> distance<00:01:26.770> but<00:01:27.280> yet<00:01:27.490> still<00:01:27.850> tend<00:01:28.570> to

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
a higher distance but yet still tend to

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.440 
a higher distance but yet still tend to
come<00:01:28.930> down<00:01:29.200> into<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:29.829> court<00:01:30.100> stays<00:01:30.820> into<00:01:31.179> play

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
come down into the court stays into play

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.539 
come down into the court stays into play
and<00:01:31.929> then<00:01:32.079> you<00:01:32.109> have<00:01:32.289> an<00:01:32.439> added<00:01:32.920> advantage<00:01:33.039> of

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
and then you have an added advantage of

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.370 
and then you have an added advantage of
once<00:01:33.789> it<00:01:33.969> does<00:01:34.149> hit<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:34.420> court<00:01:34.810> of<00:01:35.049> it

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
once it does hit the court of it

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.740 
once it does hit the court of it
bouncing<00:01:35.829> up<00:01:36.009> high<00:01:36.369> to<00:01:37.119> the<00:01:37.240> person's

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
bouncing up high to the person's

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.090 
bouncing up high to the person's
shoulders<00:01:38.289> which<00:01:38.469> makes<00:01:38.710> it<00:01:38.859> a<00:01:38.920> lot<00:01:39.039> harder

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
shoulders which makes it a lot harder

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.250 
shoulders which makes it a lot harder
ball<00:01:40.090> to<00:01:40.299> hit

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
ball to hit

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.500 
ball to hit
question<00:01:42.010> number<00:01:42.280> three<00:01:42.580> how<00:01:43.120> do<00:01:43.180> you<00:01:43.330> hit

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
question number three how do you hit

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.140 
question number three how do you hit
with<00:01:43.690> topspin<00:01:44.200> a<00:01:44.560> really<00:01:45.160> easy<00:01:45.430> way<00:01:45.760> to<00:01:45.820> think

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
with topspin a really easy way to think

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.540 
with topspin a really easy way to think
of<00:01:46.330> how<00:01:46.480> you<00:01:46.540> get<00:01:46.780> topspin<00:01:47.380> is<00:01:47.530> by<00:01:48.070> taking<00:01:48.490> your

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
of how you get topspin is by taking your

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.060 
of how you get topspin is by taking your
racquet<00:01:48.970> and<00:01:49.090> brushing<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.080> ball<00:01:50.290> in<00:01:50.530> other

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
racquet and brushing the ball in other

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.770 
racquet and brushing the ball in other
words<00:01:51.400> I'm<00:01:51.610> not<00:01:51.640> going<00:01:51.940> to<00:01:52.000> roll<00:01:52.210> it<00:01:52.420> over<00:01:52.510> and

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
words I'm not going to roll it over and

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.910 
words I'm not going to roll it over and
I'm<00:01:52.840> just<00:01:52.900> going<00:01:53.080> to<00:01:53.170> do<00:01:53.290> this<00:01:53.440> vertically

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
I'm just going to do this vertically

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.370 
I'm just going to do this vertically
what<00:01:54.250> they<00:01:54.370> call<00:01:54.640> it<00:01:54.820> up<00:01:55.030> volley<00:01:55.330> so<00:01:55.960> if<00:01:56.080> I<00:01:56.200> hit

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
what they call it up volley so if I hit

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.330 
what they call it up volley so if I hit
the<00:01:56.440> ball<00:01:56.680> like<00:01:56.920> this

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
the ball like this

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.700 
the ball like this
there's<00:01:57.640> no<00:01:57.970> spin<00:01:58.390> no<00:01:58.570> topspin<00:01:59.290> you'll<00:01:59.500> spin

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
there's no spin no topspin you'll spin

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.530 
there's no spin no topspin you'll spin
it<00:01:59.830> all<00:01:59.980> in<00:02:00.160> the<00:02:00.250> ball<00:02:00.430> then<00:02:01.030> if<00:02:01.150> I<00:02:01.240> start

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
it all in the ball then if I start

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.180 
it all in the ball then if I start
brushing<00:02:02.190> with<00:02:03.190> my<00:02:03.400> racquet<00:02:03.820> like<00:02:03.850> this<00:02:05.190> you

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
brushing with my racquet like this you

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.609 
brushing with my racquet like this you
and<00:02:06.310> you<00:02:06.820> impart<00:02:07.180> a<00:02:07.480> spin<00:02:07.930> on<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.200> ball<00:02:08.350> so

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
and you impart a spin on the ball so

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.010 
and you impart a spin on the ball so
what<00:02:09.490> happens<00:02:09.880> is<00:02:10.030> in<00:02:10.150> order<00:02:10.330> to<00:02:10.420> hit<00:02:10.510> topspin

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
what happens is in order to hit topspin

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.610 
what happens is in order to hit topspin
on<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.200> ball

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
on the ball

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.070 
on the ball
I<00:02:11.650> will<00:02:12.520> have<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:12.910> start<00:02:13.330> with<00:02:13.510> my<00:02:13.630> racket

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
I will have to start with my racket

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.810 
I will have to start with my racket
lower<00:02:14.380> than<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.800> ball<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.280> about<00:02:15.460> thirty

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
lower than the ball and about thirty

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.870 
lower than the ball and about thirty
degrees<00:02:16.270> lower<00:02:16.540> in<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.780> ball<00:02:16.990> I<00:02:17.230> then<00:02:17.980> hit<00:02:18.640> the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
degrees lower in the ball I then hit the

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.270 
degrees lower in the ball I then hit the
ball<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.330> I<00:02:19.540> brush<00:02:19.870> up<00:02:20.110> against<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.800> ball<00:02:21.010> in

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
ball and I brush up against the ball in

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.770 
ball and I brush up against the ball in
order<00:02:21.550> to<00:02:21.790> impart<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.360> Tusk

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
order to impart the Tusk

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.830 
order to impart the Tusk
so<00:02:23.680> it's<00:02:23.860> this<00:02:24.010> brushing<00:02:24.640> action<00:02:24.820> that<00:02:25.570> gives

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
so it's this brushing action that gives

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.040 
so it's this brushing action that gives
topspin<00:02:26.710> to<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.610> ball<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.540> that's<00:02:28.780> how<00:02:28.960> you

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
topspin to the ball and that's how you

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.160 
topspin to the ball and that's how you
hit<00:02:29.320> good<00:02:29.710> topspin<00:02:30.190> now<00:02:31.180> we<00:02:31.240> will<00:02:31.540> demonstrate

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
hit good topspin now we will demonstrate

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.740 
hit good topspin now we will demonstrate
how<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.620> hit<00:02:32.890> with<00:02:33.040> topspin<00:02:33.610> so<00:02:34.330> I<00:02:34.360> will<00:02:34.630> now

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
how to hit with topspin so I will now

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.350 
how to hit with topspin so I will now
hit<00:02:35.020> lower<00:02:35.770> than<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.220> ball<00:02:36.430> get<00:02:36.880> up<00:02:37.000> through

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
hit lower than the ball get up through

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.330 
hit lower than the ball get up through
and<00:02:37.570> brush<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.050> ball<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.740> find<00:02:38.950> out<00:02:39.160> how

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
and brush the ball to find out how

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.850 
and brush the ball to find out how
topspin<00:02:39.970> works<00:02:40.270> on<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.660> court<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.650> balls

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
topspin works on the court the balls

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.000 
topspin works on the court the balls
were<00:02:42.100> coming<00:02:42.460> down<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:43.000> bouncing<00:02:43.840> high<00:02:44.140> some

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
were coming down and bouncing high some

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.620 
were coming down and bouncing high some
of<00:02:45.160> them<00:02:45.280> even<00:02:45.370> hit<00:02:45.760> in<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.180> back<00:02:46.390> of<00:02:46.600> that

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
of them even hit in the back of that

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.030 
of them even hit in the back of that
screen<00:02:47.110> back<00:02:47.320> there<00:02:47.350> but<00:02:47.680> yet<00:02:47.830> they<00:02:47.980> still

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
screen back there but yet they still

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:57.700 
screen back there but yet they still
stayed<00:02:48.520> in<00:02:48.670> play

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.770
