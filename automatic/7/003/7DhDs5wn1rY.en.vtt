Andy overdrive right here you can mess

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.549 
Andy overdrive right here you can mess
with<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.550> megahertz<00:00:32.550> for<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.420> actual<00:00:33.750> GPU

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
with the megahertz for the actual GPU

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.790 
with the megahertz for the actual GPU
and<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.480> memory<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.690> best<00:00:36.930> feature<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.469> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
and the memory the best feature and the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.830 
and the memory the best feature and the
software<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.520> auto-tune<00:00:38.790> button<00:00:39.329> which

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
software is the auto-tune button which

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.900 
software is the auto-tune button which
allows<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.410> get<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.620> best<00:00:41.190> performance

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
allows you to get the best performance

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.630 
allows you to get the best performance
out<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.450> your<00:00:42.600> GPU<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.410> memory<00:00:43.920> because<00:00:44.489> it

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
out of your GPU and memory because it

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.700 
out of your GPU and memory because it
automatically<00:00:45.210> sets<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.840> its<00:00:46.020> highest<00:00:46.289> and

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
automatically sets it to its highest and

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.729 
automatically sets it to its highest and
it<00:00:47.670> makes<00:00:47.910> sure<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.420> your<00:00:49.050> system<00:00:49.710> can

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
it makes sure that your system can

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.270 
it makes sure that your system can
actually<00:00:50.219> handle<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:51.350> instead<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.620> having

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
actually handle it instead of you having

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.520 
actually handle it instead of you having
to<00:00:53.430> sit<00:00:53.670> over<00:00:53.850> here<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.270> guess<00:00:54.960> at<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
to sit over here and guess at the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.970 
to sit over here and guess at the
megahertz<00:00:56.120> it<00:00:57.120> does<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.539> all<00:00:57.690> for<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:57.989> over

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
megahertz it does it all for you over

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.410 
megahertz it does it all for you over
here<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> couple<00:00:59.699> temperature

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
here you have a couple temperature

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.830 
here you have a couple temperature
gauges<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:01.410> activity<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.550> fan<00:01:02.760> speed<00:01:03.120> if

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
gauges the activity and the fan speed if

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.780 
gauges the activity and the fan speed if
you'd<00:01:04.170> like<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.500> enable<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.979> fan<00:01:05.189> speed<00:01:05.549> you

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
you'd like to enable the fan speed you

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.179 
you'd like to enable the fan speed you
can<00:01:05.909> come<00:01:06.060> over<00:01:06.150> here<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:07.170> can<00:01:07.350> up<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.979> or

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
can come over here and you can up it or

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.210 
can come over here and you can up it or
you<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:09.030> decrease<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:10.470> up<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.950> or

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
you can decrease it it's up to you or

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.070 
you can decrease it it's up to you or
you<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:11.729> just<00:01:11.760> uncheck<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.600> it'll

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
you can just uncheck it and it'll

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.050 
you can just uncheck it and it'll
automatically<00:01:13.770> adjust<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.850> whatever

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
automatically adjust to whatever

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.679 
automatically adjust to whatever
temperature<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:16.939> so<00:01:17.939> right<00:01:18.180> now<00:01:18.330> I'm<00:01:18.540> gonna

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
temperature it is so right now I'm gonna

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.710 
temperature it is so right now I'm gonna
go<00:01:19.140> ahead<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.470> do<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> benchmark<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.509> show

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
go ahead and do a benchmark just to show

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.810 
go ahead and do a benchmark just to show
you<00:01:21.780> all<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.500> stock<00:01:22.799> how<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
you all this is the stock how the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.130 
you all this is the stock how the
graphics<00:01:24.210> card<00:01:24.390> comes<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.869> then<00:01:25.020> we'll

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
graphics card comes and then we'll

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.520 
graphics card comes and then we'll
compare<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.280> overclocked<00:01:26.700> version

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
compare it to the overclocked version

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.069 
compare it to the overclocked version
alright<00:01:28.530> we<00:01:28.680> now<00:01:28.829> have<00:01:29.100> our<00:01:29.340> 2d<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.270> 3d<00:01:30.329> marks

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
alright we now have our 2d and 3d marks

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.899 
alright we now have our 2d and 3d marks
so<00:01:31.619> what<00:01:31.770> we're<00:01:31.890> gonna<00:01:31.950> do<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.369> come<00:01:32.520> over<00:01:32.549> to

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
so what we're gonna do is come over to

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.830 
so what we're gonna do is come over to
our<00:01:33.030> software<00:01:33.210> up<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:34.110> memory<00:01:34.560> up<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.829> about

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
our software up this memory up to about

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.740 
our software up this memory up to about
750<00:01:37.220> megahertz<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.759> then<00:01:38.909> bump<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.390> up<00:01:39.570> to

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
750 megahertz and then bump this up to

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.609 
750 megahertz and then bump this up to
about<00:01:41.090> 670<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.329> we're<00:01:42.899> gonna<00:01:43.020> test<00:01:43.409> this

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
about 670 and we're gonna test this

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.230 
about 670 and we're gonna test this
clock<00:01:43.890> make<00:01:44.189> sure<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.520> runs<00:01:44.700> through<00:01:44.939> pretty

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
clock make sure it runs through pretty

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:54.370 
clock make sure it runs through pretty
good

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.480 

alright<00:01:55.380> looks<00:01:55.650> like<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.920> passed<00:01:56.159> we're<00:01:56.369> gonna

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
alright looks like it passed we're gonna

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.050 
alright looks like it passed we're gonna
click<00:01:57.000> accept<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:58.430> now<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.610> we<00:01:59.729> have<00:01:59.850> that

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
click accept and now that we have that

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.789 
click accept and now that we have that
done<00:02:00.119> we're<00:02:00.720> gonna<00:02:00.810> run<00:02:01.140> our<00:02:01.380> second

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
done we're gonna run our second

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.450 
done we're gonna run our second
benchmark<00:02:03.530> alright<00:02:04.530> we<00:02:04.740> now<00:02:04.890> however<00:02:05.070> before

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
benchmark alright we now however before

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.880 
benchmark alright we now however before
and<00:02:05.880> after<00:02:06.240> benchmarks<00:02:06.810> what<00:02:07.440> we're<00:02:07.560> gonna<00:02:07.649> do

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
and after benchmarks what we're gonna do

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.460 
and after benchmarks what we're gonna do
is<00:02:08.220> compare<00:02:08.789> them<00:02:08.970> on<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.600> first<00:02:09.840> category<00:02:10.319> it

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470
