let's take a look at the game let's

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.130 
let's take a look at the game let's
start<00:00:47.160> by<00:00:47.460> looking<00:00:47.610> at<00:00:47.850> layout<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.450> simcity

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
start by looking at layout in simcity

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.139 
start by looking at layout in simcity
societies<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:50.100> place<00:00:50.370> each<00:00:50.640> building

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
societies you place each building

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.850 
societies you place each building
yourself<00:00:51.510> if<00:00:51.719> you're<00:00:52.170> trying<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.620> get<00:00:52.739> the

most from your city you will plan your

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.689 
most from your city you will plan your
layout<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.649> take<00:00:55.860> advantage<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.520> the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.780 
video I'd laid out my central downtown
area<00:01:12.600> carefully<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.590> maximize<00:01:14.220> my<00:01:14.430> revenue

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
area carefully to maximize my revenue

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.030 
area carefully to maximize my revenue
and<00:01:15.090> prosperity<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.930> planned<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.830> whole<00:01:16.860> thing

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
and prosperity I planned the whole thing

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.609 
and prosperity I planned the whole thing
around<00:01:17.790> my<00:01:17.939> district<00:01:18.420> courthouse<00:01:18.659> it's<00:01:19.439> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
around my district courthouse it's the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.880 
around my district courthouse it's the
center<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.220> area<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:21.290> can<00:01:22.290> see<00:01:22.470> from<00:01:22.680> its

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
center of this area I can see from its

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.499 
center of this area I can see from its
building<00:01:23.280> card<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.790> one<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.180> its<00:01:24.240> attributes

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
building card that one of its attributes

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.289 
building card that one of its attributes
is<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.560> increases<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.310> somalian<00:01:26.880> output

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
is that it increases the somalian output

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.510 
is that it increases the somalian output
of<00:01:27.450> surrounding<00:01:28.110> workplaces<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:29.490> I

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
of surrounding workplaces so I

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.160 
of surrounding workplaces so I
surrounded<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.479> with<00:01:30.509> buildings<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.110> are

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
surrounded it with buildings that are

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.319 
surrounded it with buildings that are
already<00:01:31.409> high<00:01:31.950> revenue<00:01:32.400> producers<00:01:33.030> to

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
already high revenue producers to

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.429 
already high revenue producers to
maximize<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.079> effect<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.799> percentage<00:01:35.280> bump

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
maximize the effect of a percentage bump

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.590 
maximize the effect of a percentage bump
then<00:01:37.439> i<00:01:37.470> put<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.920> focus<00:01:38.250> test<00:01:38.490> lab<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:39.299> makes

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
then i put in a focus test lab it makes

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.060 
then i put in a focus test lab it makes
