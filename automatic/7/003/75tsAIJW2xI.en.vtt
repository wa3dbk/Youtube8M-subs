against<00:03:21.400> heed<00:03:21.549> on<00:03:21.699> that<00:03:22.299> strange<00:03:22.780> is<00:03:22.989> it<00:03:23.139> that

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
against heed on that strange is it that

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.379 
against heed on that strange is it that
in<00:03:23.919> this<00:03:24.069> universe<00:03:24.280> she<00:03:24.639> trained<00:03:24.909> a<00:03:25.030> lot<00:03:25.180> more

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
in this universe she trained a lot more

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:27.629 
in this universe she trained a lot more

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
different personalities but will the

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.280
