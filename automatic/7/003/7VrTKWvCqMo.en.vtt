00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.279
 another minecraft 1.8 tutorial and in 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.049
 I will show you this video 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.040
 if a kind of slow motion effect for 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.510
 monster can do 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.340
 that means that they are very slow 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.719
 run after and that I have them 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.670
 so to speak can beat them and then 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.900
 very slowly go up and down so 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.730
 we find ourselves in a kind 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.590
 Slow motion condition but we can do here 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.970
 run around normally and that's it 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.460
 very handy for me now 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.410
 take a break and into the survival mode 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.430
 goes then I see that they very quickly 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.750
 for me, I've actually come 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.820
 no chance not to fly 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.759
 or against the fight and I would 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.440
 Instantly die so you can see that I am yes 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.239
 a pretty bad chance though 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.430
 do not you build me like that and that 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.610
 time perfect turn on then I have 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.950
 enough time to dodge quickly 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.079
 and to fight against this mother and 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.000
 then all to win one by one 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.480
 that somehow I just die 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.770
 would 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.030
 how is that possible in this tutorial 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.800
 for the slow-motion effect we need 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.480
 these six command blocks being these 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.309
 Four of these are super fast clogs 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.260
 and the really really important 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.699
 these two come back here again 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.320
 content of these command blocks 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.330
 I'll show you that now 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.970
 I take a quick look at the clock and here 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.250
 will be set so a block after there 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.840
 there we are fortunately still there and 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.610
 here in these two command blocks 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.799
 We set each directly to the blocks 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.570
 Back on the air this disease 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.500
 really works fine and 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.200
 now we come to these two 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.640
 important command blocks in this 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.070
 command blog here we put with help 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.570
 by dementer idea the command for all 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.560
 Creatures from the player in one 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.570
 radius from 50 to 1 we just go with it 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.460
 a radius of 50 so not all 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.659
 creatures are affected because otherwise 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.350
 That would just be too much performance 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.360
 We do not eat from the pc and we do not want that 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.909
 Colon we use the ki 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.500
 so to speak, and so does the mob 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.479
 nothing for a fraction of a second 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.549
 and blog active in this command 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.439
 somehow they again and therefore not 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.149
 again currently in effect because very short 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.399
 he thinks i have no ki i have 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.090
 ki again and so it will be a lot 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.950
 slower 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.840
 this does not only work for pugs 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.700
 but also for bullets such as at 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.380
 this place here the normal fireball 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.299
 flies pretty much around the slow motion effect 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.550
 fast with the slow motion effect 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.229
 fixed only half as fast now as me 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.819
 that made that effect 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.140
 on and off can so if I 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.210
 here on the lever presses then is 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.670
 and when I press it, it goes out 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.100
 for that we set with this command 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.020
 block here a redstone 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.700
 blog with that activated me can 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.280
 For example, a manual one too 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.900
 put so then we see the whole 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.910
 is activated in order for us to do that 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.310
 we need to turn off one here 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.990
 sit down weblog and then we see that 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.670
 the whole thing is turned off and that 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.080
 We then do this with this command block 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.239
 the then sets the fast back there 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.920
 a ride to the blog and a bit later 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.239
 this is then removed so that the 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.310
 whole equipment started again 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.020
 can be 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.940
 i hope i like the tutorial though 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.200
 you want to see more 1.8 tutorials 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.239
 could the infobox 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.730
 There you will find a link to a playlist 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.260
 with a lot of 1.8 tutorials and yes 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.950
 Thanks for watching until the 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:10.750
 next time 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:15.939
 [Music] 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:18.409
 so the recording was started 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:20.629
 stupidity zombie if i am now 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:23.000
 example in survival mode trials 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.950
 just so against zombies you do not go in 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.109
 a slow motion effects is struggling 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.120
 that's pretty hard and I can 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.069
 actually only lose and we see 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.480
 I'll die pretty fast, too 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.430
 but then, for example, this one 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.230
 slow motion effect then I have 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:41.709
 here is really a real chance this 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:43.760
 Here's why it 's such a shit 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.250
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.209
 another minecraft 1.8 tutorial and in 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.230
 I will show you this video 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.419
 how close hello and welcome to 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.480
 the other minecraft 1.8 tutorial and 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:59.719
 in this video i will mean why 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.799
 are you talking fast for this slow motion 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:02.480
 effect, we need one here 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.969
 ultrafast club the again and again 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.379
 this whole command is blocked and how 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:10.939
 the whole thing they look like you in 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:12.700
 We would like to take this command blog with you 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:15.319
 help from n 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:19.190
 in this command blog we join 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:20.750
 Help from android data in this command 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.050
 blog we do with the help of the truck 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.419
 data komano at 1 for all creatures 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.389
 from players in a radius of 50 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:32.389
 blocks around the command blogs are 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:35.860
 no , we set this command block 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.860
 help in helping
