the<00:00:34.290> most<00:00:34.440> outstanding<00:00:34.739> thing<00:00:35.040> about<00:00:35.309> this

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
the most outstanding thing about this

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.400 
the most outstanding thing about this
boat<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.059> feels<00:00:36.329> exactly<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.350> same

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
boat is that it feels exactly the same

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.930 
boat is that it feels exactly the same
in<00:00:37.770> terms<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> course<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.640> fittings

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
in terms of the course in the fittings

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.479 
in terms of the course in the fittings
as<00:00:39.450> it's<00:00:39.750> bigger<00:00:40.200> sister's<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.070> layout<00:00:41.370> as

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
as it's bigger sister's the layout as

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.770 
as it's bigger sister's the layout as
well<00:00:41.520> as<00:00:41.790> interesting<00:00:42.239> because<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.719> is

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
well as interesting because this is

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.779 
well as interesting because this is
almost<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.620> carbon<00:00:43.800> copy<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.430> something<00:00:44.610> like<00:00:44.760> a

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
almost a carbon copy of something like a

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.299 
almost a carbon copy of something like a
tomahawk<00:00:45.059> 37<00:00:45.870> you've<00:00:46.230> got<00:00:46.379> your<00:00:46.530> Sun<00:00:46.739> pad<00:00:46.980> back

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
tomahawk 37 you've got your Sun pad back

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.520 
tomahawk 37 you've got your Sun pad back
up<00:00:47.520> over<00:00:47.820> your<00:00:47.910> engine<00:00:48.270> big<00:00:48.870> bench<00:00:49.110> seat<00:00:49.350> back

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
up over your engine big bench seat back

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.229 
up over your engine big bench seat back
here<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.920> couple<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.550> bucket<00:00:50.789> seats<00:00:51.030> at<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
here a couple of bucket seats at the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.850 
here a couple of bucket seats at the
front<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> cockpit<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.289> then<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.530> cabin

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
front of the cockpit and then you cabin

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.900 
front of the cockpit and then you cabin
ahead<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.399> difference<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.820> course

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
ahead of that the difference of course

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.700 
ahead of that the difference of course
is<00:00:54.059> everything<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.449> filled<00:00:54.660> right<00:00:55.230> down<00:00:55.500> so

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
is everything is filled right down so

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.279 
is everything is filled right down so
your<00:00:55.860> cabin<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.219> literally<00:00:56.699> just<00:00:57.260> really<00:00:58.260> a

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
your cabin is literally just really a

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.599 
your cabin is literally just really a
double<00:00:58.590> berth<00:00:58.739> underneath<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.250> poor<00:00:59.430> deck

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
double berth underneath the poor deck

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.610 
double berth underneath the poor deck
and<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.239> floor<00:01:00.690> area<00:01:00.930> here<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> lot<00:01:01.379> smaller

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
and the floor area here is a lot smaller

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.349 
and the floor area here is a lot smaller
but<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.250> great<00:01:02.430> thing<00:01:02.579> about<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.030> say<00:01:03.210> is

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
but the great thing about is to say is

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.329 
but the great thing about is to say is
the<00:01:03.480> feeling<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:04.320> just<00:01:04.559> like<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.949> big<00:01:05.129> boats

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
the feeling is just like the big boats

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.570 
the feeling is just like the big boats
that<00:01:05.880> scaled<00:01:06.150> right<00:01:06.330> down<00:01:06.540> it's<00:01:06.720> brilliant<00:01:07.580> so

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
that scaled right down it's brilliant so

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.710 
that scaled right down it's brilliant so
something<00:01:08.970> you've<00:01:09.090> built<00:01:09.210> these<00:01:09.450> boats

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
something you've built these boats

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.830 
something you've built these boats
exclusively<00:01:10.530> with<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.280> Volvo<00:01:11.490> v8<00:01:12.180> petrol

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
exclusively with a Volvo v8 petrol

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.810 
exclusively with a Volvo v8 petrol
engines<00:01:13.200> but<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:14.130> didn't<00:01:14.400> stop<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.670> for

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
engines but that didn't stop you for

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.880 
engines but that didn't stop you for
changing<00:01:15.090> them<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.299> course<00:01:15.530> simply<00:01:16.530> gets<00:01:16.710> this

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
changing them of course simply gets this

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.440 
changing them of course simply gets this
sort<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.130> age<00:01:17.310> where's<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.850> wrong<00:01:18.030> eventual

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
sort of age where's the wrong eventual

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.060 
sort of age where's the wrong eventual
skate<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> little<00:01:18.780> bit<00:01:18.960> older<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.920> this

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
skate a little bit older and this

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.679 
skate a little bit older and this
particular<00:01:20.400> place<00:01:20.759> rather<00:01:21.000> interesting

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
particular place rather interesting

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.450 
particular place rather interesting
because<00:01:21.720> what<00:01:22.080> they've<00:01:22.200> done<00:01:22.229> with<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.650> is

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
because what they've done with this is

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.340 
because what they've done with this is
they<00:01:23.670> put<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> Volvo<00:01:24.390> diesel<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.200> is

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
they put the Volvo diesel in it this is

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.219 
they put the Volvo diesel in it this is
such<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> good<00:01:25.650> kg<00:01:25.979> 32<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:27.240> 170<00:01:27.990> horsepower

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
such a good kg 32 it's 170 horsepower

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.070 
such a good kg 32 it's 170 horsepower
actually<00:01:28.829> suits<00:01:29.009> both<00:01:29.250> very<00:01:29.579> very<00:01:29.729> well

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
actually suits both very very well

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.770 
actually suits both very very well
