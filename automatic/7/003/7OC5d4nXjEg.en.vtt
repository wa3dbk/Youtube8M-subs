that<00:03:06.739> I<00:03:06.950> work<00:03:07.310> on<00:03:07.549> is<00:03:08.389> this<00:03:09.260> technique<00:03:09.889> trainer

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
that I work on is this technique trainer

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.119 
that I work on is this technique trainer
and<00:03:10.780> when<00:03:11.780> you're<00:03:11.959> learning<00:03:12.200> how<00:03:12.560> to<00:03:12.590> play<00:03:12.950> the

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
and when you're learning how to play the

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.180 
and when you're learning how to play the
violin<00:03:13.639> it's<00:03:14.510> really<00:03:15.290> really<00:03:15.530> difficult<00:03:15.739> to

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
violin it's really really difficult to

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.000 
violin it's really really difficult to
hit<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.549> notes<00:03:17.079> unlike<00:03:18.079> a<00:03:18.109> guitar<00:03:18.650> there<00:03:18.919> are

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
hit the notes unlike a guitar there are

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.750 
hit the notes unlike a guitar there are
no<00:03:19.159> frets<00:03:19.609> so<00:03:19.940> as<00:03:20.810> you<00:03:21.019> can<00:03:21.199> see<00:03:21.489> there's<00:03:22.489> no

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
no frets so as you can see there's no

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.089 
no frets so as you can see there's no
markers<00:03:23.389> on<00:03:24.109> the<00:03:25.900> board<00:03:26.900> here<00:03:27.290> to<00:03:27.799> show<00:03:28.040> you

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
markers on the board here to show you

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.509 
markers on the board here to show you
where<00:03:28.609> G<00:03:28.940> is<00:03:29.150> or<00:03:29.540> E<00:03:29.780> or<00:03:30.260> a<00:03:30.500> so<00:03:30.739> you<00:03:31.099> pretty<00:03:31.430> much

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
where G is or E or a so you pretty much

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.420 
where G is or E or a so you pretty much
have<00:03:31.699> to<00:03:32.019> train<00:03:33.019> your<00:03:33.199> fingers<00:03:33.709> to<00:03:34.010> hit<00:03:34.250> the

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
notes supposed to sound like to so this

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.899 
notes supposed to sound like to so this
particular<00:03:40.310> trainer<00:03:41.590> teaches<00:03:42.590> you<00:03:42.799> to<00:03:43.250> keep<00:03:43.609> a

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:43.909 
particular trainer teaches you to keep a

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:48.250 
particular trainer teaches you to keep a
guide<00:03:44.870> finger<00:03:45.229> down<00:03:46.239> so<00:03:47.239> for<00:03:47.510> example<00:03:47.959> in<00:03:48.079> this

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
guide finger down so for example in this

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.000 
guide finger down so for example in this
case<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:48.859> first<00:03:49.129> finger<00:03:49.609> on<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:50.870> D<00:03:51.290> string<00:03:51.319> on

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
case the first finger on the D string on

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.199 
case the first finger on the D string on
the<00:03:52.639> a<00:03:52.669> note<00:03:53.150> and<00:03:53.449> you<00:03:53.479> keep<00:03:54.199> that<00:03:54.439> down<00:03:54.849> as<00:03:55.849> you

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
the a note and you keep that down as you

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.460 
the a note and you keep that down as you
move<00:03:56.449> up<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:57.439> string<00:03:58.069> and<00:03:58.419> then<00:03:59.419> and<00:04:00.079> across

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
move up the string and then and across

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.259 
move up the string and then and across
the<00:04:00.739> string<00:04:01.040> so<00:04:01.250> it<00:04:01.370> gives<00:04:01.579> you<00:04:01.699> a<00:04:01.760> little<00:04:02.060> bit

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
the string so it gives you a little bit

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.960 
the string so it gives you a little bit
of<00:04:02.419> a<00:04:02.510> guide<00:04:02.750> you're<00:04:03.409> keeping<00:04:03.829> the<00:04:03.979> finger

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
of a guide you're keeping the finger

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.099 
of a guide you're keeping the finger
down<00:04:05.239> as<00:04:05.569> a<00:04:06.199> bit<00:04:06.560> of<00:04:06.680> a<00:04:06.799> guide<00:04:07.040> to<00:04:07.370> train<00:04:08.109> how

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
down as a bit of a guide to train how

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:11.319 
down as a bit of a guide to train how
far<00:04:09.409> apart<00:04:09.530> to<00:04:10.340> keep<00:04:10.519> the<00:04:10.669> fingers<00:04:11.030> so<00:04:11.209> that

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
far apart to keep the fingers so that

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.899 
far apart to keep the fingers so that
you<00:04:11.479> hit<00:04:11.599> the<00:04:11.750> notes<00:04:11.959> also<00:04:12.430> anyway<00:04:13.430> so<00:04:13.729> for

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:13.909 
you hit the notes also anyway so for

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:41.690 
you hit the notes also anyway so for
example<00:04:14.389> this<00:04:14.840> trainer<00:04:15.229> sounds<00:04:15.680> like<00:04:15.829> this

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.120 

okay<00:04:42.700> so<00:04:43.090> that<00:04:43.270> brings<00:04:44.080> us<00:04:44.380> to<00:04:44.410> where<00:04:44.770> I<00:04:44.830> am

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
okay so that brings us to where I am

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.820 
okay so that brings us to where I am
today<00:04:45.160> in<00:04:45.730> the<00:04:45.850> book<00:04:46.060> and<00:04:46.300> that's<00:04:47.170> actually

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
today in the book and that's actually

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
today in the book and that's actually
learning<00:04:48.100> how<00:04:48.430> to<00:04:48.870> use<00:04:49.870> my<00:04:50.260> fourth<00:04:50.950> finger<00:04:51.490> the

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
learning how to use my fourth finger the

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.890 
learning how to use my fourth finger the
pinky<00:04:51.880> finger<00:04:52.630> and<00:04:53.490> it's<00:04:54.490> very<00:04:55.030> very<00:04:55.390> hard<00:04:55.690> to

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
pinky finger and it's very very hard to

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.380 
pinky finger and it's very very hard to
do<00:04:56.080> I<00:04:56.350> mean<00:04:57.070> how<00:04:57.250> often<00:04:57.490> do<00:04:57.790> we<00:04:57.850> use<00:04:58.180> this

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
do I mean how often do we use this

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.580 
do I mean how often do we use this
finger<00:04:58.690> anyway<00:04:59.440> for<00:04:59.910> strength<00:05:00.910> and

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
finger anyway for strength and

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:08.190 
finger anyway for strength and
flexibility<00:05:02.590> so<00:05:03.660> so<00:05:04.660> far<00:05:04.960> in<00:05:05.340> the<00:05:06.340> lessons<00:05:07.200> all

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
flexibility so so far in the lessons all

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.720 
flexibility so so far in the lessons all
of<00:05:08.320> them<00:05:08.470> have<00:05:08.620> been<00:05:08.800> pretty<00:05:09.070> much<00:05:09.160> about<00:05:09.550> the

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
of them have been pretty much about the

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.410 
of them have been pretty much about the
first<00:05:09.940> three<00:05:10.120> fingers<00:05:10.720> so<00:05:11.350> now<00:05:11.590> it's<00:05:11.830> time<00:05:12.130> to

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
first three fingers so now it's time to

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.540 
first three fingers so now it's time to
bring<00:05:13.420> the<00:05:13.540> pinky<00:05:13.960> into<00:05:14.260> it<00:05:14.410> and<00:05:14.590> this<00:05:15.250> song

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
bring the pinky into it and this song

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.030 
bring the pinky into it and this song
Little<00:05:15.970> Brown<00:05:16.150> Jug<00:05:16.210> is<00:05:16.960> one<00:05:17.470> of<00:05:17.590> those<00:05:17.710> songs

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
Little Brown Jug is one of those songs

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.720 
Little Brown Jug is one of those songs
that<00:05:18.580> gets<00:05:19.330> you<00:05:19.540> exercising<00:05:20.470> that<00:05:20.680> so<00:05:21.490> there

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
that gets you exercising that so there

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.360 
that gets you exercising that so there
are<00:05:21.790> definitely<00:05:22.330> finger<00:05:22.780> gymnastics<00:05:23.560> so

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
are definitely finger gymnastics so

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.520 
are definitely finger gymnastics so
where<00:05:24.850> we're<00:05:25.420> working<00:05:25.780> with<00:05:25.930> the<00:05:26.050> first<00:05:26.290> three

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
where we're working with the first three

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.980 
where we're working with the first three
fingers<00:05:26.920> on<00:05:27.160> this<00:05:27.400> we're<00:05:27.910> stretching<00:05:28.360> from

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
fingers on this we're stretching from

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.930 
fingers on this we're stretching from
the<00:05:29.770> e<00:05:30.490> on<00:05:31.360> the<00:05:31.900> D<00:05:31.930> string<00:05:32.110> all<00:05:32.740> the<00:05:33.310> way<00:05:33.400> up<00:05:33.640> to

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
the e on the D string all the way up to

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.640 
the e on the D string all the way up to
the<00:05:34.840> a<00:05:35.200> on<00:05:36.160> the<00:05:36.580> D<00:05:36.760> string<00:05:36.790> so<00:05:37.630> that's<00:05:37.810> quite<00:05:38.290> a

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
the a on the D string so that's quite a

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.950 
the a on the D string so that's quite a
stretch<00:05:39.100> for<00:05:39.400> these<00:05:39.580> old<00:05:39.820> fingers<00:05:40.330> it's<00:05:40.720> kind

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
stretch for these old fingers it's kind

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.380 
stretch for these old fingers it's kind
of<00:05:41.020> tough<00:05:41.290> and<00:05:41.530> then<00:05:42.400> they'll<00:05:42.820> have<00:05:43.060> you<00:05:43.210> go

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:43.390 
of tough and then they'll have you go

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.530 
of tough and then they'll have you go
from<00:05:43.660> that<00:05:43.810> E<00:05:44.110> and<00:05:44.430> then<00:05:45.430> the<00:05:45.520> first<00:05:45.790> finger<00:05:46.300> is

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
from that E and then the first finger is

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.600 
from that E and then the first finger is
going<00:05:46.630> to<00:05:46.750> go<00:05:46.960> over<00:05:47.290> onto<00:05:47.800> the<00:05:50.160> what<00:05:51.160> string<00:05:51.490> is

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
going to go over onto the what string is

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.190 
going to go over onto the what string is
that<00:05:51.790> a<00:05:52.770> string<00:05:53.770> with<00:05:54.670> the<00:05:54.850> B<00:05:55.090> placement<00:05:56.020> there

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
that a string with the B placement there

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.810

and<00:05:56.440> then<00:05:56.620> you're<00:05:56.770> still<00:05:56.980> stretching<00:05:57.430> forward

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
and then you're still stretching forward

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.450 
and then you're still stretching forward
so<00:05:58.000> it's<00:05:58.420> really<00:05:58.600> tricky<00:05:59.050> I'll<00:05:59.560> show<00:06:00.160> you<00:06:00.220> what

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
so it's really tricky I'll show you what

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.460 
so it's really tricky I'll show you what
it<00:06:00.550> you<00:06:01.300> know<00:06:01.390> what<00:06:01.690> it<00:06:01.750> sounds<00:06:01.930> like<00:06:02.140> it's

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
it you know what it sounds like it's

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.040 
it you know what it sounds like it's
pretty<00:06:02.710> bad<00:06:03.040> but<00:06:03.400> some<00:06:04.330> of<00:06:04.420> the<00:06:04.480> things<00:06:04.720> that

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
pretty bad but some of the things that

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.400 
pretty bad but some of the things that
you<00:06:05.140> have<00:06:05.320> to<00:06:05.470> go<00:06:05.620> through<00:06:05.920> who<00:06:06.100> knew<00:06:07.410> they

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
you have to go through who knew they

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.840 
you have to go through who knew they
might<00:06:08.680> not<00:06:08.890> have<00:06:09.010> started<00:06:09.250> playing<00:06:09.670> the

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
might not have started playing the

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.400 
might not have started playing the
violin<00:06:10.240> if<00:06:10.420> I<00:06:10.540> knew<00:06:10.720> it<00:06:10.840> was<00:06:10.930> really<00:06:11.200> going<00:06:11.350> to

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
violin if I knew it was really going to

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:12.770 
violin if I knew it was really going to
be<00:06:11.470> this<00:06:11.800> hard

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
be this hard

00:06:12.780 --> 00:07:01.460 
be this hard
I'm<00:06:13.780> trying

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.470 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:20.460 

stretch<00:07:16.620> yeah<00:07:17.620> not<00:07:18.340> so<00:07:18.550> great<00:07:18.850> but<00:07:19.300> if<00:07:20.169> you

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:20.470 
stretch yeah not so great but if you

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.490 
stretch yeah not so great but if you
could<00:07:20.710> have<00:07:20.860> seen<00:07:21.820> me<00:07:22.060> do<00:07:22.270> this<00:07:22.570> in<00:07:23.260> the

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:23.500 
could have seen me do this in the

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.400 
could have seen me do this in the
beginning<00:07:23.919> it<00:07:24.070> was<00:07:24.190> just<00:07:24.730> impossible<00:07:25.169> but<00:07:26.169> my

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:26.410 
beginning it was just impossible but my

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.080 
beginning it was just impossible but my
fingers<00:07:26.770> are<00:07:26.890> getting<00:07:26.980> used<00:07:27.370> to<00:07:27.490> it<00:07:27.760> and<00:07:27.970> with

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.090 
fingers are getting used to it and with

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.120 
fingers are getting used to it and with
practice<00:07:28.330> it's<00:07:28.840> coming<00:07:29.169> along<00:07:29.380> just<00:07:29.440> like<00:07:29.770> any

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:30.130 
practice it's coming along just like any

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.870 
practice it's coming along just like any
thing<00:07:30.460> you<00:07:31.000> do<00:07:31.390> that's<00:07:31.660> new<00:07:31.960> so<00:07:32.950> that's<00:07:33.460> a

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:33.880 
thing you do that's new so that's a

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.510 
thing you do that's new so that's a
general<00:07:33.910> idea<00:07:34.720> of<00:07:35.020> what<00:07:35.890> my<00:07:36.040> practice

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:36.520 
general idea of what my practice

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.330 
general idea of what my practice
sessions<00:07:36.940> are<00:07:37.120> like
