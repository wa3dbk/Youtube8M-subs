00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.680
 the twists is about the same 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.320
 thickness and we could see the doors 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.530
 that when we will create our possible I 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.380
 cut the bouquet and unsightly and I 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.490
 come and create a little circle like this 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.680
 and I leave the middle without anything so I 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.710
 leave a hole here after I 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:26.229
 slightly sunk with your fingers after 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:33.810

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.490
 thigh this really natural side so I 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.390
