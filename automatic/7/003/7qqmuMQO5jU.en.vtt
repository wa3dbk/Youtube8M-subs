we've<00:01:03.710> got<00:01:03.980> city<00:01:04.790> and<00:01:05.210> highway

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
we've got city and highway

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.469 
we've got city and highway
potentiometers<00:01:07.670> here<00:01:08.119> and<00:01:10.210> also<00:01:11.210> have<00:01:11.450> a

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
potentiometers here and also have a

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.230 
potentiometers here and also have a
relay<00:01:12.320> in<00:01:12.530> here<00:01:12.860> so<00:01:13.070> when<00:01:13.220> I<00:01:13.250> shut<00:01:13.580> my<00:01:13.729> cell<00:01:14.030> off

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
relay in here so when I shut my cell off

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.590 
relay in here so when I shut my cell off
I<00:01:15.220> short<00:01:16.220> out<00:01:16.430> both<00:01:16.729> my<00:01:17.000> math<00:01:17.990> and<00:01:18.320> my<00:01:18.440> efe

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
I short out both my math and my efe

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.100 
I short out both my math and my efe
control<00:01:20.600> signals<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:21.200> we<00:01:21.289> go<00:01:21.440> back<00:01:21.619> to<00:01:21.649> stock

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
control signals so we go back to stock

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.990 
control signals so we go back to stock
so<00:01:24.110> i<00:01:24.920> get<00:01:25.789> the<00:01:25.820> glare<00:01:27.640> turn<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.759> light<00:01:28.970> off

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
so i get the glare turn the light off

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.540 
so i get the glare turn the light off
here<00:01:29.630> so<00:01:30.259> we<00:01:30.380> can<00:01:30.560> see<00:01:30.770> what's<00:01:30.979> going<00:01:31.280> on<00:01:31.369> on

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
here so we can see what's going on on

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.450 
here so we can see what's going on on
the<00:01:31.700> oscilloscope<00:01:32.050> so<00:01:33.070> as<00:01:34.149> you<00:01:35.149> can<00:01:35.300> see<00:01:36.460> this

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
the oscilloscope so as you can see this

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.510 
the oscilloscope so as you can see this
is<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.670> output<00:01:38.000> of<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:39.320> oxygen<00:01:39.710> sensor<00:01:40.100> and

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
is the output of the oxygen sensor and

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.980 
is the output of the oxygen sensor and
you<00:01:40.640> can<00:01:40.820> see<00:01:41.679> waveform<00:01:42.679> that<00:01:43.960> computer<00:01:44.960> is

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
you can see waveform that computer is

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.800 
you can see waveform that computer is
actually<00:01:45.530> doing<00:01:45.920> here<00:01:46.250> so<00:01:46.550> I<00:01:46.759> have<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.390> cursor

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
actually doing here so I have the cursor

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:55.390 
actually doing here so I have the cursor
lines<00:01:48.140> set<00:01:48.770> there<00:01:49.720> at

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.680 

200<00:01:56.390> millivolts<00:01:56.870> for<00:01:57.080> division<00:01:57.850> so<00:01:58.850> those<00:01:59.480> two

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
200 millivolts for division so those two

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.830 
200 millivolts for division so those two
lines<00:01:59.960> are<00:02:00.290> between<00:02:00.730> 200<00:02:01.730> and<00:02:01.760> 400<00:02:02.330> and<00:02:02.510> 800

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
lines are between 200 and 400 and 800

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.020 
lines are between 200 and 400 and 800
millivolts<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:03.920> as<00:02:04.040> it<00:02:04.220> crosses<00:02:04.490> the<00:02:04.730> center

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
millivolts and as it crosses the center

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:14.130 
millivolts and as it crosses the center
line<00:02:05.390> is<00:02:06.160> the<00:02:07.160> value<00:02:07.850> that<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:10.090> 14<00:02:11.090> point<00:02:11.930> 7<00:02:12.200> 21

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
line is the value that the 14 point 7 21

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.750 
line is the value that the 14 point 7 21
air-fuel<00:02:15.140> mixture<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.710> it's<00:02:15.860> interesting<00:02:16.160> to

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
air-fuel mixture and it's interesting to

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.950 
air-fuel mixture and it's interesting to
see<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.590> ECU<00:02:19.480> kind<00:02:20.480> of<00:02:20.630> doesn't<00:02:20.870> do<00:02:21.320> enough

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
see the ECU kind of doesn't do enough

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.380 
see the ECU kind of doesn't do enough
oscillation<00:02:24.760> trying<00:02:25.760> to<00:02:25.820> keep<00:02:25.940> this<00:02:26.090> straight

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
oscillation trying to keep this straight

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.940 
oscillation trying to keep this straight
so<00:02:27.070> when<00:02:28.070> the<00:02:28.250> traces<00:02:28.850> at<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.690> top<00:02:29.959> that<00:02:30.590> means

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
so when the traces at the top that means

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.320 
so when the traces at the top that means
the<00:02:31.220> oxygen<00:02:31.670> output<00:02:32.180> is<00:02:33.250> low<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:35.060> fuel

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
the oxygen output is low and the fuel

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.480 
the oxygen output is low and the fuel
mixture<00:02:35.870> is<00:02:36.020> rich<00:02:36.290> when<00:02:36.590> it's<00:02:36.740> low<00:02:36.980> it's<00:02:37.010> the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
mixture is rich when it's low it's the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.180 
mixture is rich when it's low it's the
opposite<00:02:37.940> as<00:02:38.870> you<00:02:39.080> can<00:02:39.200> see<00:02:39.410> it<00:02:39.500> trace<00:02:39.770> across

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
opposite as you can see it trace across

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.620 
opposite as you can see it trace across
here<00:02:40.520> so<00:02:40.820> what<00:02:40.970> I'm<00:02:41.060> going<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.209> do<00:02:41.360> is<00:02:41.510> I'm

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
here so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.830 
here so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:41.780> flip<00:02:42.020> my<00:02:42.140> switch<00:02:42.170> on<00:02:42.709> here<00:02:43.130> and<00:02:45.700> I'm

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
going to flip my switch on here and I'm

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.990 
going to flip my switch on here and I'm
going<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:48.490> kick<00:02:49.490> in<00:02:49.700> both<00:02:50.000> my<00:02:50.270> EFV

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
going to kick in both my EFV

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.130 
going to kick in both my EFV
unfortunately<00:02:53.000> that's<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.420> noise<00:02:53.600> coming

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
unfortunately that's the noise coming

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.470 
unfortunately that's the noise coming
from<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.380> PWM<00:02:55.160> so<00:02:55.459> my<00:02:55.640> signals<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.120> little<00:02:56.150> bit

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
from the PWM so my signals a little bit

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.570 
from the PWM so my signals a little bit
distorted<00:02:56.870> but<00:02:57.230> you<00:02:57.350> can<00:02:57.500> still<00:02:57.740> basically

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
distorted but you can still basically

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.120 
distorted but you can still basically
see<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.240> waveform<00:02:59.420> so<00:03:00.110> now<00:03:00.500> you<00:03:00.560> can<00:03:00.830> see<00:03:00.860> it

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
see the waveform so now you can see it

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.949 
see the waveform so now you can see it
going<00:03:01.400> between<00:03:02.260> rich<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.290> lean<00:03:04.959> the

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
going between rich and lean the

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.050 
going between rich and lean the
interesting<00:03:06.530> thing<00:03:06.590> here<00:03:07.100> is<00:03:07.160> it's<00:03:07.970> just

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
interesting thing here is it's just

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
interesting thing here is it's just
showing<00:03:08.630> that<00:03:08.810> I<00:03:08.840> do<00:03:08.959> have<00:03:09.350> it<00:03:09.500> set<00:03:09.800> up<00:03:10.010> so<00:03:11.080> the

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
showing that I do have it set up so the

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.280 
showing that I do have it set up so the
ECU<00:03:12.620> is<00:03:12.650> happy<00:03:13.340> so<00:03:13.700> I'm<00:03:13.880> not<00:03:14.090> throwing<00:03:14.390> codes<00:03:14.870> I

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
ECU is happy so I'm not throwing codes I

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.800 
ECU is happy so I'm not throwing codes I
don't<00:03:16.010> think<00:03:16.100> I<00:03:16.580> think<00:03:16.820> I'm<00:03:16.970> still<00:03:17.330> closed

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
don't think I think I'm still closed

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.430 
don't think I think I'm still closed
loop<00:03:18.200> because<00:03:18.530> I<00:03:19.690> would<00:03:20.690> think<00:03:20.840> open<00:03:21.230> loop

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
loop because I would think open loop

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.940 
loop because I would think open loop
would<00:03:21.650> just<00:03:21.920> be<00:03:22.130> and<00:03:23.200> you<00:03:24.200> can<00:03:24.380> kind<00:03:24.590> of<00:03:24.739> see

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
would just be and you can kind of see

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.190 
would just be and you can kind of see
that<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.459> ECU<00:03:25.880> is<00:03:25.910> doing<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.420> same<00:03:26.660> kind<00:03:26.720> of

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
that the ECU is doing the same kind of

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.100 
that the ECU is doing the same kind of
thing<00:03:27.380> that<00:03:27.410> was

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
thing that was

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.270 
thing that was
or

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.370 

so<00:03:33.910> I<00:03:34.240> thought<00:03:34.780> that<00:03:34.930> was<00:03:35.050> kind<00:03:35.290> of

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
so I thought that was kind of

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.520 
so I thought that was kind of
interesting<00:03:39.090> time<00:03:40.090> based<00:03:40.330> here<00:03:40.690> is<00:03:40.870> 500

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
interesting time based here is 500

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.600 
interesting time based here is 500
milliseconds<00:03:43.590> so<00:03:44.590> here's<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.190> other<00:03:45.280> side<00:03:45.580> of

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
milliseconds so here's the other side of

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.729 
milliseconds so here's the other side of
my<00:03:45.910> control<00:03:46.780> panel<00:03:47.730> looking<00:03:48.730> at<00:03:48.910> the<00:03:49.739> output

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
my control panel looking at the output

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.150 
my control panel looking at the output
of<00:03:50.800> the<00:03:50.950> shunt<00:03:51.280> from<00:03:51.670> pwm<00:03:52.620> it's<00:03:53.620> not<00:03:53.830> quite

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
of the shunt from pwm it's not quite

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.490 
of the shunt from pwm it's not quite
calibrated<00:03:54.940> it's<00:03:55.180> really<00:03:55.569> drawn<00:03:55.810> about<00:03:56.110> 20

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
calibrated it's really drawn about 20

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.690 
calibrated it's really drawn about 20
amps<00:03:56.890> right<00:03:57.160> now<00:03:57.370> and<00:03:58.150> I<00:03:59.050> do<00:03:59.590> extend<00:04:00.220> a<00:04:00.370> probe

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
amps right now and I do extend a probe

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:27.220 
amps right now and I do extend a probe
lineout<00:04:03.209> see<00:04:04.209> the<00:04:06.120> o2<00:04:07.120> sensor<00:04:08.160> output<00:04:09.160> there

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.350 

I<00:04:27.350> think<00:04:27.950> the<00:04:28.040> other<00:04:28.160> interesting<00:04:28.820> thing<00:04:28.880> here

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
I think the other interesting thing here

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:36.180 
I think the other interesting thing here
is<00:04:29.420> i<00:04:30.230> can<00:04:30.590> take<00:04:30.830> my<00:04:31.100> math<00:04:32.440> control<00:04:33.440> here<00:04:33.980> and

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.559 

can<00:04:37.190> adjust<00:04:37.640> it

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:40.569 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:47.399 

you<00:04:41.169> can<00:04:41.349> actually<00:04:41.589> get<00:04:42.249> it

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:47.409 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:51.059 

you<00:04:47.979> know<00:04:48.129> is<00:04:48.459> staying<00:04:49.229> staying<00:04:50.229> lead<00:04:50.559> which

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:51.069 
you know is staying staying lead which

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:54.269 
you know is staying staying lead which
is<00:04:51.809> exactly<00:04:52.809> what<00:04:53.289> you<00:04:53.319> would<00:04:53.559> think<00:04:53.769> as<00:04:54.039> I

00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:54.279 
is exactly what you would think as I

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:59.969 
is exactly what you would think as I
increase<00:04:54.489> the<00:04:56.309> math<00:04:57.330> resistance<00:04:58.529> the<00:04:59.529> ECU

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
increase the math resistance the ECU

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.879 
increase the math resistance the ECU
believes<00:05:00.639> that<00:05:00.999> there's<00:05:01.319> less<00:05:02.319> throughput

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
believes that there's less throughput

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.089 
believes that there's less throughput
through<00:05:03.129> the<00:05:03.249> engine<00:05:03.399> and<00:05:03.819> therefore<00:05:05.099> reduces

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
through the engine and therefore reduces

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:09.059 
through the engine and therefore reduces
the<00:05:06.249> mixture<00:05:07.139> so<00:05:08.139> it's<00:05:08.289> kind<00:05:08.529> of<00:05:08.589> cool<00:05:08.800> and

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:09.069 
the mixture so it's kind of cool and

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:13.469 
the mixture so it's kind of cool and
then<00:05:09.189> when<00:05:09.309> I<00:05:09.339> turn<00:05:09.610> it<00:05:09.759> back<00:05:11.939> the<00:05:12.939> math<00:05:13.149> deck

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
then when I turn it back the math deck

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:18.229 
then when I turn it back the math deck
you<00:05:14.080> could<00:05:14.229> see<00:05:14.439> it<00:05:14.559> hang<00:05:16.169> rich<00:05:17.169> for<00:05:17.439> a<00:05:17.499> while

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:18.239 
you could see it hang rich for a while

00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:22.379 
you could see it hang rich for a while
so<00:05:19.239> i<00:05:19.809> move<00:05:20.319> the<00:05:20.499> scope<00:05:20.800> probe<00:05:21.159> and<00:05:21.550> i<00:05:22.300> know

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
so i move the scope probe and i know

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.600 
so i move the scope probe and i know
whether<00:05:22.659> you<00:05:22.899> can<00:05:22.929> see<00:05:23.110> that<00:05:23.349> here<00:05:23.979> but<00:05:24.219> now

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
whether you can see that here but now

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.219 
whether you can see that here but now
i'm<00:05:24.819> looking<00:05:25.029> actually<00:05:25.869> the<00:05:26.050> output<00:05:26.589> of<00:05:27.059> the

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
i'm looking actually the output of the

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:33.949 
i'm looking actually the output of the
oxygen<00:05:29.229> sensor<00:05:30.989> kind<00:05:31.989> of<00:05:32.079> before<00:05:32.469> the<00:05:32.679> efe<00:05:33.249> and

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:33.959 
oxygen sensor kind of before the efe and

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:39.479 
oxygen sensor kind of before the efe and
so<00:05:35.879> you<00:05:36.879> can<00:05:37.119> see<00:05:37.419> that<00:05:37.449> the<00:05:38.110> signal<00:05:38.889> from<00:05:39.399> the

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:39.489 
so you can see that the signal from the

00:05:39.489 --> 00:05:42.929 
so you can see that the signal from the
oxygen<00:05:40.119> sensor<00:05:40.329> is<00:05:41.219> probably<00:05:42.219> two<00:05:42.550> to<00:05:42.699> four

00:05:42.929 --> 00:05:42.939 
oxygen sensor is probably two to four

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:49.159 
oxygen sensor is probably two to four
hundred<00:05:43.029> millivolts<00:05:45.509> leaner

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:55.570 

you

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:02.379 

so<00:05:57.039> that<00:05:58.599> I'm<00:05:59.599> offsetting<00:06:00.379> the<00:06:01.210> oxygen<00:06:02.210> sensor

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
so that I'm offsetting the oxygen sensor

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:05.290 
so that I'm offsetting the oxygen sensor
I<00:06:02.599> think<00:06:02.900> about<00:06:02.990> 300<00:06:03.620> millivolts<00:06:04.240> try<00:06:05.240> to

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
I think about 300 millivolts try to

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:11.110 
I think about 300 millivolts try to
bring<00:06:06.050> it<00:06:06.169> back<00:06:06.349> to<00:06:06.889> the<00:06:07.009> normal<00:06:07.370> range<00:06:09.969> so<00:06:10.969> now

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
bring it back to the normal range so now

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.890 
bring it back to the normal range so now
the<00:06:11.180> big<00:06:11.449> question<00:06:11.479> is<00:06:12.020> is<00:06:13.000> the<00:06:14.000> eight<00:06:14.509> hundred

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
the big question is is the eight hundred

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.570 
the big question is is the eight hundred
fifty<00:06:15.199> milliliters<00:06:15.500> per<00:06:16.270> minute<00:06:17.270> of<00:06:18.400> hho<00:06:19.400> on

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
fifty milliliters per minute of hho on

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.149 
fifty milliliters per minute of hho on
producing<00:06:20.120> is<00:06:20.300> it<00:06:20.449> enough<00:06:20.750> for<00:06:20.990> four<00:06:21.949> liter

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:22.159 
producing is it enough for four liter

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:25.179 
producing is it enough for four liter
motor<00:06:23.409> certainly<00:06:24.409> low<00:06:24.560> would<00:06:24.680> like<00:06:24.889> to<00:06:25.069> get

00:06:25.179 --> 00:06:25.189 
motor certainly low would like to get

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:30.940 
motor certainly low would like to get
more<00:06:25.789> output<00:06:27.250> be<00:06:28.250> working<00:06:28.610> on<00:06:28.729> that
