00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.019
 there has 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.019
 After the First World War, the world was out of joint 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.819
 the world can be done 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:31.550
 promptly in various ways windows have the condition 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.730
 under which this world has collapsed and analyzed 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.200
 is so analyzed that you can describe it if she graced it 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.050
 good to describe 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.880
 and on Dresden's boulevards 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.010
 amputated war invalids 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.239
 later be with the hyperinflation 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.770
 unemployed person 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.370
 the appealing they picked up these is called tapering 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.480
 with the desire of this society in this time in the mirror vorzuhalten 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.189
 the main page exhibition is 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.940
 the most famous artists 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.560
 Dedicated to Porsche DAX and George Grosz who also stood at the beginning of the movement 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.270
 and the text 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.260
 Searching for a game scene, he chose the awesome topics he was looking for 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.860
 the crass characters the blatant types from customer one 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.620
 BT the tri at elections 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.500
 specifically it is time for that 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.500
 Had to provoke protest and produced until today 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.630
 Bonn 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.089
 the slightly younger artists like the Handelsblatt 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:14.049
 the less sought a thesis has a gross exaggeration 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.349
 to aggravate these 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.369
 they were more likely to create images 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.930
 it will express simple people and their hope 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:27.469
 on possible change of society 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.280
 in the garbage cabinet 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.329
 you can make many discoveries 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.449
 there are many artists exhibited by them even connoisseurs of the art of the Trieste 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:49.299
 not heard yet 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.239
 they are very different positions 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.509
 of elegant ladies portrait 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:54.929
 about the home 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:59.319
 painted still-life to landscapes that have a magical 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.319
 Hide the Hintersinn 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.489
 ca 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.489
 Vienna 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:18.889
 which in our stock he is very annoying to find new objectivity 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:20.780
 changed a lot 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.659
 is unknown and here in this 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:25.649
 Studies that call the waves now 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:29.109
 They also want to offer the viewer this opportunity 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.109
 to see shown paintings 

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:41.349
 what we open today is the new objectivity 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.399
 o2 Dix the important painters of the 20s 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:47.649
 that is something it seems to be in the present time even then 

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:52.569
 Problems of registration also existed at the end of financial economic 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:53.739
 alignment 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.499
 and I think at that time the artists are very much in favor of social life 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:03:58.329
 involved 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.370
 In the clearer view, confrontations have triggered off the 

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:04.199
 know in subsequent decades 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:08.039
 and I think that was a good example of today's casting time 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.789
 quite significant perhaps the most significant contribution to the new 

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:12.559
 objectivity 

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:15.719
 Art of the 20s made in Germany 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:18.350
 finally, at this moment, dive now 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.030
 most dangerous already painting from Trieste modest twenties again 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.110
 meets and 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.969
 the people fighting go on tour 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:28.969
 they are all really 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:39.039
 3 Nicolas Terol position 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.279
 had proof 

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:45.050
 considerable scientific research that had as an input and this 

00:04:45.049 --> 00:04:46.969
 To bring the exhibition to fruition 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:50.879
 and I think the result is clearly obvious you can say 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.750
 Dresden simply does not stand there Roman Wick and the bridge 

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:57.330
 -art 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:03.469
 Krestan has helped shape realism in the most authoritative way
