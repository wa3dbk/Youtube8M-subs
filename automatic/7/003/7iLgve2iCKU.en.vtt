00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
and the next thing about it okay

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.610 
and the next thing about it okay
is<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.609> having<00:02:39.209> having<00:02:39.719> ranks<00:02:40.169> basically

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
is that having having ranks basically

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.470 
is that having having ranks basically
allows<00:02:41.189> there<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:41.489> be<00:02:41.609> some<00:02:41.849> kind<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.090> goals

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
allows there to be some kind of goals

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.879 
allows there to be some kind of goals
so<00:02:42.569> take<00:02:42.749> taken<00:02:43.079> a<00:02:43.139> fall<00:02:43.319> for<00:02:43.439> example<00:02:43.500> wrap

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
so take taken a fall for example wrap

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.339 
so take taken a fall for example wrap
you<00:02:44.370> can<00:02:44.519> rank<00:02:44.669> up<00:02:44.849> to<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.150> SL<00:02:45.419> 130<00:02:45.780> but<00:02:46.230> that

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
you can rank up to you SL 130 but that

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.470 
you can rank up to you SL 130 but that
would<00:02:46.469> take<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.859> maybe<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.579> weaker<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.180> week<00:02:48.359> of

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
would take you maybe a weaker a week of

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.330 
would take you maybe a weaker a week of
game<00:02:48.629> playing<00:02:48.870> right<00:02:49.109> and<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.949> would<00:02:50.099> be<00:02:50.189> way

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
game playing right and it would be way

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.250 
game playing right and it would be way
too<00:02:50.370> fast<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:50.939> then<00:02:51.120> fired<00:02:51.780> by<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.019> first

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
too fast and then fired by the first

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.659 
too fast and then fired by the first
week<00:02:52.469> everyone's<00:02:52.889> at<00:02:53.010> some<00:02:53.129> 1:30<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.549> then

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:53.669 
week everyone's at some 1:30 and then

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:54.830 
week everyone's at some 1:30 and then
it's<00:02:53.790> kind<00:02:53.909> of<00:02:53.939> boring<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.269> you<00:02:54.540> don't<00:02:54.689> really

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
it's kind of boring and you don't really

is<00:04:11.099> very<00:04:11.280> much<00:04:11.340> set<00:04:11.669> in<00:04:11.699> stone<00:04:11.819> and<00:04:12.180> it's<00:04:12.299> kind

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:12.449 
is very much set in stone and it's kind

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:14.300 
is very much set in stone and it's kind
of<00:04:12.479> easy<00:04:12.599> to<00:04:12.689> understand<00:04:13.079> so<00:04:13.319> basically<00:04:13.739> what

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
of easy to understand so basically what

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.860 
of easy to understand so basically what
you<00:04:14.459> do<00:04:14.699> is<00:04:14.849> like<00:04:14.939> I<00:04:15.090> said<00:04:15.269> you<00:04:15.389> go<00:04:15.569> online<00:04:15.719> and

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
you do is like I said you go online and

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.539 
you do is like I said you go online and
search<00:04:16.349> for<00:04:16.530> playlist<00:04:16.919> drive<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:17.250> something

let's<00:04:29.430> take<00:04:29.550> an<00:04:29.670> example<00:04:29.760> of<00:04:30.120> a<00:04:30.210> free-for-all

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
let's take an example of a free-for-all

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.330 
let's take an example of a free-for-all
where<00:04:30.750> you've<00:04:30.840> got<00:04:30.990> John<00:04:31.230> George<00:04:31.680> Paul<00:04:32.040> Ringo

under level 5 right and at the end of

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.260 
under level 5 right and at the end of
the<00:04:37.890> game<00:04:38.040> John<00:04:38.340> comes<00:04:38.550> first<00:04:38.820> or<00:04:39.060> comes

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
the game John comes first or comes

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.640 
the game John comes first or comes

second George comes third America comes
forth<00:04:40.890> so<00:04:41.370> now<00:04:41.520> how<00:04:41.970> do<00:04:42.030> we<00:04:42.180> know<00:04:42.450> like<00:04:42.960> who

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
forth so now how do we know like who

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.230 
forth so now how do we know like who
ranks<00:04:43.470> up<00:04:43.620> who<00:04:43.920> benefits<00:04:44.520> what<00:04:44.670> how<00:04:44.880> much<00:04:45.060> does

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
ranks up who benefits what how much does

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.210 
ranks up who benefits what how much does
he<00:04:45.300> rank<00:04:45.420> up<00:04:45.630> etc<00:04:45.750> well<00:04:46.290> let<00:04:46.890> me<00:04:46.980> show<00:04:47.100> you<00:04:47.160> how

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
he rank up etc well let me show you how

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.040 
he rank up etc well let me show you how
I<00:04:47.250> calculate<00:04:47.610> that<00:04:47.640> so<00:04:48.000> there's<00:04:48.420> a<00:04:48.480> table<00:04:48.720> that

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
I calculate that so there's a table that

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.750 
I calculate that so there's a table that
and<00:04:49.320> this<00:04:49.650> table<00:04:49.890> is<00:04:50.130> broken<00:04:50.400> up<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:50.640> see

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
and this table is broken up and see

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.030 
and this table is broken up and see
thank<00:04:51.330> you<00:04:51.540> it<00:04:51.930> like<00:04:52.170> it<00:04:52.290> it<00:04:52.410> tells<00:04:52.590> you<00:04:52.740> how

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
thank you it like it it tells you how

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.560 
thank you it like it it tells you how
many<00:04:53.100> points<00:04:53.400> you<00:04:53.550> win<00:04:53.790> if<00:04:53.970> you're<00:04:54.330> higher

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
many points you win if you're higher

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.150 
many points you win if you're higher
than<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:54.840> person<00:04:55.170> how<00:04:55.560> many<00:04:55.770> points<00:04:56.040> you're

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
than the person how many points you're

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.890 
than the person how many points you're
win<00:04:56.310> if<00:04:56.490> you're<00:04:56.670> lower<00:04:56.850> than<00:04:57.060> the<00:04:57.120> person<00:04:57.510> how

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
win if you're lower than the person how

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.720 
win if you're lower than the person how
many<00:04:58.110> points<00:04:58.380> you<00:04:58.410> lose<00:04:58.470> if<00:04:59.130> you<00:04:59.160> loser<00:04:59.580> then

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
many points you lose if you loser then

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:00.860 
many points you lose if you loser then
and<00:04:59.910> you're<00:05:00.000> higher<00:05:00.180> and<00:05:00.450> how<00:05:00.510> many<00:05:00.660> points

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
and you're higher and how many points

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.120 
and you're higher and how many points
you<00:05:00.900> lose<00:05:00.960> if<00:05:01.350> you<00:05:01.410> lose<00:05:01.560> them<00:05:01.770> in<00:05:01.860> your<00:05:01.950> loan

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
you lose if you lose them in your loan

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.430 
you lose if you lose them in your loan
right<00:05:02.520> so<00:05:02.910> it<00:05:02.970> all<00:05:03.090> depends<00:05:03.360> on<00:05:03.540> who<00:05:04.080> you<00:05:04.230> lose

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
right so it all depends on who you lose

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.630 
right so it all depends on who you lose
again<00:05:04.590> so<00:05:04.860> what<00:05:04.980> rank<00:05:05.160> they<00:05:05.280> are<00:05:05.370> so<00:05:05.550> let's

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
again so what rank they are so let's

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.760 
again so what rank they are so let's
take<00:05:05.850> John<00:05:06.090> who<00:05:06.300> won<00:05:06.510> okay<00:05:06.720> he'll<00:05:07.350> be<00:05:07.470> Paul

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
take John who won okay he'll be Paul

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.410 
take John who won okay he'll be Paul
George<00:05:08.100> and<00:05:08.310> Ringo<00:05:08.430> so<00:05:08.850> forgetting<00:05:09.180> Paul

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
George and Ringo so forgetting Paul

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.090 
George and Ringo so forgetting Paul
because<00:05:09.990> these<00:05:10.080> three<00:05:10.440> levels<00:05:10.590> higher<00:05:10.890> than

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
because these three levels higher than

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.410 
because these three levels higher than
fold<00:05:11.310> he<00:05:11.430> gains<00:05:11.610> 85<00:05:12.030> points

competitive<00:05:24.360> but<00:05:24.750> so<00:05:25.260> let<00:05:25.380> me<00:05:25.470> add<00:05:25.620> all<00:05:25.740> these

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
competitive but so let me add all these

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.170 
competitive but so let me add all these
points<00:05:26.100> together<00:05:26.220> to<00:05:26.520> give<00:05:26.640> you<00:05:26.700> a<00:05:26.730> number<00:05:26.850> and

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
points together to give you a number and

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.640 
points together to give you a number and
you<00:05:27.450> divide<00:05:27.660> that<00:05:27.690> by<00:05:27.810> three<00:05:28.110> because<00:05:28.290> of<00:05:28.560> it

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
you divide that by three because of it

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.020 
you divide that by three because of it
there<00:05:28.800> was<00:05:28.860> three<00:05:29.100> opponents<00:05:29.610> and<00:05:29.700> that<00:05:29.850> gives

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
there was three opponents and that gives

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.360 
there was three opponents and that gives
you<00:05:30.150> ATP<00:05:30.510> so<00:05:31.020> John<00:05:31.290> goes<00:05:31.320> up<00:05:31.650> by<00:05:31.800> 83<00:05:32.190> points

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
you ATP so John goes up by 83 points

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.280 
you ATP so John goes up by 83 points
right<00:05:32.670> so<00:05:33.090> that's<00:05:33.150> pretty<00:05:33.270> cool<00:05:33.570> so<00:05:33.780> now<00:05:33.810> how

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
right so that's pretty cool so now how

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.750 
right so that's pretty cool so now how
do<00:05:34.350> we<00:05:34.470> know<00:05:34.560> like<00:05:35.190> you<00:05:35.370> know<00:05:35.400> the

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
do we know like you know the

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.130 
do we know like you know the
significance<00:05:36.210> of<00:05:36.300> that<00:05:36.420> what<00:05:36.570> is<00:05:36.690> 83<00:05:36.990> points

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
significance of that what is 83 points

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.260 
significance of that what is 83 points
even<00:05:37.380> need<00:05:37.620> well<00:05:37.890> you<00:05:38.580> have<00:05:38.700> a<00:05:38.730> set<00:05:39.000> number<00:05:39.120> of

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
even need well you have a set number of

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.060 
even need well you have a set number of
points<00:05:39.510> you<00:05:39.720> began<00:05:39.930> at<00:05:40.050> zero<00:05:40.290> and<00:05:40.590> you<00:05:40.830> became

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
points you began at zero and you became

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.920 
points you began at zero and you became
racking<00:05:41.610> up<00:05:41.670> these<00:05:41.820> points<00:05:42.150> okay<00:05:42.330> and<00:05:42.540> this

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
racking up these points okay and this

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.410 
racking up these points okay and this
table<00:05:43.140> shows<00:05:43.320> you<00:05:43.800> how<00:05:44.730> many<00:05:44.790> points<00:05:45.060> you<00:05:45.270> need

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 
table shows you how many points you need

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.300 
table shows you how many points you need
to<00:05:45.480> be<00:05:45.750> a<00:05:45.780> certain<00:05:46.020> level<00:05:46.440> so<00:05:46.620> you<00:05:46.830> can<00:05:46.980> see<00:05:47.160> to

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
to be a certain level so you can see to

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.740 
to be a certain level so you can see to
be<00:05:47.400> eight<00:05:47.520> level<00:05:47.820> 50<00:05:48.090> you<00:05:48.210> have<00:05:48.240> to<00:05:48.450> have<00:05:48.570> more

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
be eight level 50 you have to have more

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.290 
be eight level 50 you have to have more
than<00:05:48.930> 92,000<00:05:49.710> 250<00:05:50.280> points<00:05:50.580> which<00:05:50.700> is<00:05:50.730> I<00:05:50.910> have<00:05:50.940> a

than 92,000 250 points which is I have a

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.580 
than 92,000 250 points which is I have a
lot<00:05:51.450> of<00:05:51.570> points<00:05:51.870> it'll<00:05:51.990> take<00:05:52.140> you<00:05:52.230> a<00:05:52.260> hell<00:05:52.440> of<00:05:52.470> a

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
lot of points it'll take you a hell of a

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.650 
lot of points it'll take you a hell of a
long<00:05:52.710> time<00:05:52.980> so<00:05:53.580> if<00:05:53.700> John<00:05:53.940> was<00:05:54.180> until<00:05:54.450> two

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
long time so if John was until two

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.640 
long time so if John was until two
thousand<00:05:54.960> four<00:05:55.050> hundred<00:05:55.110> eighty<00:05:55.320> points

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
thousand four hundred eighty points

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.560 
thousand four hundred eighty points
before<00:05:55.770> the<00:05:55.950> game<00:05:56.190> daily<00:05:56.850> 83<00:05:57.210> points<00:05:57.360> would

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
before the game daily 83 points would

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.350 
before the game daily 83 points would
put<00:05:57.750> him<00:05:57.840> on<00:05:58.100> 2563<00:05:59.100> and<00:05:59.430> you<00:05:59.520> will<00:05:59.640> dust<00:05:59.850> horse

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
put him on 2563 and you will dust horse

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.260 
put him on 2563 and you will dust horse
to<00:06:00.870> 499<00:06:01.500> and<00:06:01.740> drove<00:06:01.920> to<00:06:02.070> level<00:06:02.310> 11<00:06:02.340> so<00:06:03.180> now

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
to 499 and drove to level 11 so now

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.790 
to 499 and drove to level 11 so now
let's<00:06:03.480> take<00:06:03.600> poor<00:06:04.080> for<00:06:04.290> example<00:06:04.320> who<00:06:04.650> came

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
let's take poor for example who came

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.860 
let's take poor for example who came
second<00:06:05.220> okay<00:06:05.460> to<00:06:05.850> keep<00:06:06.000> each<00:06:06.180> or<00:06:06.450> one<00:06:06.750> level

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
second okay to keep each or one level

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.510 
second okay to keep each or one level
higher<00:06:07.110> ei<00:06:07.530> into<00:06:07.620> y<00:06:07.680> plus<00:06:08.040> one<00:06:08.220> five<00:06:08.370> five

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
higher ei into y plus one five five

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.980 
higher ei into y plus one five five
there's<00:06:08.790> often<00:06:09.060> a<00:06:09.120> table<00:06:09.360> by<00:06:09.450> the<00:06:09.510> way<00:06:09.630> he

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
there's often a table by the way he

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.630 
there's often a table by the way he
needed<00:06:10.200> Ringo<00:06:10.440> to<00:06:10.650> levels<00:06:10.920> lower<00:06:11.130> than<00:06:11.340> him<00:06:11.460> so

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
needed Ringo to levels lower than him so

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.310 
needed Ringo to levels lower than him so
he<00:06:11.700> only<00:06:11.820> invites<00:06:12.180> coins<00:06:12.480> but<00:06:12.930> then<00:06:13.050> he<00:06:13.140> lost

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
he only invites coins but then he lost

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.080 
he only invites coins but then he lost
to<00:06:13.590> John<00:06:13.800> who<00:06:14.340> was<00:06:14.370> three<00:06:14.640> that<00:06:14.760> was<00:06:14.880> higher

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
to John who was three that was higher

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.150 
to John who was three that was higher
sitting<00:06:15.420> he<00:06:15.480> gets<00:06:15.630> a<00:06:15.690> minus<00:06:15.960> 55<00:06:16.530> for<00:06:16.800> losing<00:06:17.070> so

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
sitting he gets a minus 55 for losing so

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.040 
sitting he gets a minus 55 for losing so
that<00:06:17.280> one<00:06:17.430> person<00:06:17.610> you<00:06:17.970> can<00:06:18.240> see<00:06:18.360> the<00:06:18.480> minus<00:06:18.720> 55

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
that one person you can see the minus 55

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.090 
that one person you can see the minus 55
is<00:06:19.260> smaller<00:06:19.500> than<00:06:19.560> the<00:06:19.650> other<00:06:19.800> numbers

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
is smaller than the other numbers

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.440 
is smaller than the other numbers
because<00:06:20.340> John<00:06:20.550> was<00:06:20.580> higher<00:06:20.880> and<00:06:21.240> John

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
because John was higher and John

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.820 
because John was higher and John
should've<00:06:21.780> won<00:06:21.960> so<00:06:22.200> you<00:06:22.260> know<00:06:22.410> you<00:06:22.530> only<00:06:22.650> lose

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
should've won so you know you only lose

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.350 
should've won so you know you only lose
you<00:06:23.220> lose<00:06:23.370> less<00:06:23.580> believing<00:06:23.970> to<00:06:24.060> someone<00:06:24.270> in

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
you lose less believing to someone in

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.000 
you lose less believing to someone in
giggling<00:06:24.570> so<00:06:25.380> now<00:06:25.500> you<00:06:25.560> add<00:06:25.770> them<00:06:25.890> all

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
giggling so now you add them all

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.279 
giggling so now you add them all
together<00:06:26.130> including<00:06:26.580> the<00:06:26.760> miners<00:06:27.120> and<00:06:27.480> and<00:06:27.810> um

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:28.289 
together including the miners and and um

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:30.200 
together including the miners and and um
you<00:06:28.740> divide<00:06:28.949> by<00:06:29.099> three<00:06:29.279> and<00:06:29.550> then<00:06:29.849> you<00:06:29.969> see<00:06:30.119> the

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
you divide by three and then you see the

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.359 
you divide by three and then you see the
key<00:06:30.389> 1050<00:06:30.839> see<00:06:30.990> so<00:06:31.169> he<00:06:31.289> only<00:06:31.469> gains<00:06:31.740> 52<00:06:32.219> which

00:06:32.359 --> 00:06:32.369 
key 1050 see so he only gains 52 which

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:33.679 
key 1050 see so he only gains 52 which
is<00:06:32.399> not<00:06:32.610> advances<00:06:32.969> John<00:06:33.180> but<00:06:33.389> it's<00:06:33.509> still

00:06:33.679 --> 00:06:33.689 
is not advances John but it's still

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:35.510 
is not advances John but it's still
something<00:06:33.899> you<00:06:34.020> know<00:06:34.259> if<00:06:34.740> you<00:06:34.889> work<00:06:35.039> on<00:06:35.159> Ringo

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
something you know if you work on Ringo

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.739 
something you know if you work on Ringo
and<00:06:35.550> George<00:06:35.699> you'll<00:06:36.149> find<00:06:36.360> out<00:06:36.479> that<00:06:36.509> they

00:06:36.739 --> 00:06:36.749 
and George you'll find out that they

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:38.179 
and George you'll find out that they
actually<00:06:36.960> end<00:06:37.289> up<00:06:37.439> with<00:06:37.589> a<00:06:37.680> minus<00:06:37.889> number

00:06:38.179 --> 00:06:38.189 
actually end up with a minus number

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:39.799 
actually end up with a minus number
minus<00:06:38.610> the<00:06:38.699> T<00:06:38.819> to<00:06:38.939> the<00:06:39.029> N<00:06:39.089> minus<00:06:39.119> 30<00:06:39.539> if<00:06:39.689> you

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:39.809 
minus the T to the N minus 30 if you

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:42.260 
minus the T to the N minus 30 if you
work<00:06:39.960> it<00:06:40.080> out<00:06:40.199> that<00:06:41.099> means<00:06:41.339> that<00:06:41.849> after<00:06:42.059> that

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:55.979 
you rank up the only way to rank down is

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:58.249 
you rank up the only way to rank down is
if<00:06:56.159> you<00:06:56.309> get<00:06:56.490> under<00:06:56.909> the<00:06:57.059> midpoints<00:06:57.749> of<00:06:57.869> the

00:06:58.249 --> 00:06:58.259 
if you get under the midpoints of the

if you get under the midpoints of the
previous<00:06:58.649> rank<00:06:58.800> so<00:06:58.949> if<00:06:59.039> I<00:06:59.099> get<00:06:59.219> to<00:06:59.279> rank<00:06:59.430> 40<00:06:59.759> I

00:06:59.959 --> 00:06:59.969 
previous rank so if I get to rank 40 I

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:01.790 
previous rank so if I get to rank 40 I
have<00:07:00.300> to<00:07:00.419> write<00:07:00.569> down<00:07:00.689> all<00:07:01.020> the<00:07:01.289> way<00:07:01.439> to<00:07:01.469> the

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 
have to write down all the way to the

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.429 
have to write down all the way to the
midpoints<00:07:02.399> of<00:07:02.490> 39<00:07:03.029> to<00:07:03.449> rank<00:07:03.629> back<00:07:03.809> down<00:07:03.990> to<00:07:04.139> 39

00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:04.439 
midpoints of 39 to rank back down to 39

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:05.749 
midpoints of 39 to rank back down to 39
so<00:07:04.619> there's<00:07:04.800> this<00:07:04.919> consolidation<00:07:05.219> once
