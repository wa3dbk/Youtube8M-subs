see but I have found a trick that if I
cut<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.659> into<00:01:30.810> little<00:01:31.020> cubes<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:32.009> kind<00:01:32.520> of

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:32.609 
cut it into little cubes it kind of

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:34.879 
cut it into little cubes it kind of
works<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.030> same<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.659> creams<00:01:33.960> up<00:01:34.259> nice<00:01:34.499> and

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:34.889 
works the same it creams up nice and

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:37.849 
works the same it creams up nice and
easily<00:01:35.219> so<00:01:35.700> get<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:35.939> creaming<00:01:36.719> then<00:01:37.590> while

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:37.859
