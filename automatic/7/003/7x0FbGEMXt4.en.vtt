to admit a pert and sweet corn is is

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.780 
to admit a pert and sweet corn is is
tender<00:00:24.509> is<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.810> tender<00:00:25.619> vegetable<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.580> means

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:26.790 
tender is a tender vegetable so it means

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.700 
tender is a tender vegetable so it means
that<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.360> doesn't<00:00:27.599> cope<00:00:27.869> very<00:00:27.960> well<00:00:28.230> in<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
in rows you have to plant them in a

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.700 
in rows you have to plant them in a
block<00:01:16.490> so<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.030> where<00:01:18.270> your<00:01:18.749> times<00:01:19.109> table

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
block so this is where your times table

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.550 
block so this is where your times table
comes<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.159> very<00:01:20.429> very<00:01:20.729> useful<00:01:21.030> work<00:01:21.929> out<00:01:22.229> how

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
really really lovely roots grown on the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
bottom so what we need to do is we need

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.369 
bottom so what we need to do is we need
to<00:02:15.660> break<00:02:16.319> these<00:02:16.709> apart<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.489> be<00:02:18.379> fairly

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
to break these apart and be fairly

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.350 
to break these apart and be fairly
careful<00:02:19.920> with<00:02:20.430> them

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
careful with them

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.830 
careful with them
okay<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.260> may<00:02:22.590> sound<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:23.040> bit<00:02:23.180> cruel<00:02:24.180> as<00:02:24.480> you're

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
okay it may sound a bit cruel as you're

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.050 
okay it may sound a bit cruel as you're
ripping<00:02:25.230> them<00:02:25.380> apart<00:02:25.470> but<00:02:26.310> they<00:02:26.460> should<00:02:26.790> come

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
ripping them apart but they should come

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.900
