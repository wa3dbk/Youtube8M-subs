what's going on guys DMK android and in
this<00:00:02.399> video<00:00:02.669> we're<00:00:03.210> going<00:00:03.300> to<00:00:03.360> be<00:00:03.449> reviewing

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
this video we're going to be reviewing

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.289 
this video we're going to be reviewing
the<00:00:03.990> carbon<00:00:04.410> rom<00:00:04.560> for<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.890> Galaxy<00:00:05.310> Nexus<00:00:05.460> now

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
the carbon rom for the Galaxy Nexus now

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.000 
the carbon rom for the Galaxy Nexus now
carbon<00:00:06.629> ROM<00:00:06.779> is<00:00:06.930> based<00:00:07.170> off<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.350> four<00:00:07.649> point<00:00:07.859> two

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
carbon ROM is based off a four point two

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.740 
carbon ROM is based off a four point two
point<00:00:08.189> two<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.700> has<00:00:09.000> been<00:00:09.179> my<00:00:09.300> daily<00:00:09.599> driver

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
point two and has been my daily driver

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.810 
point two and has been my daily driver
for<00:00:10.139> around<00:00:10.500> two<00:00:10.800> months<00:00:10.980> now<00:00:11.280> so<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:11.700> think

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
for around two months now so I think

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.400 
for around two months now so I think
it's<00:00:12.150> safe<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.360> say<00:00:12.509> that<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:12.929> is<00:00:12.990> one<00:00:13.200> of<00:00:13.230> the

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
it's safe to say that this is one of the

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.259 
it's safe to say that this is one of the
best<00:00:13.769> stock<00:00:14.190> experiences<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.120> I've<00:00:15.240> ever

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
best stock experiences that I've ever

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.269

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
had during my time with the carbon rom

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.320 
had during my time with the carbon rom
I've<00:00:17.460> been<00:00:17.550> pairing<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:17.940> up<00:00:18.029> with<00:00:18.210> the

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
I've been pairing it up with the

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.420 
I've been pairing it up with the
franco.kernel<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.199> actually<00:00:20.189> run<00:00:20.400> a

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
franco.kernel and actually run a

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.310

quadrant benchmark and I actually got

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.009 
quadrant benchmark and I actually got
results<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.519> 3000's<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.600> for<00:00:24.990> a
