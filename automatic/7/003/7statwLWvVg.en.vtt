furniture is destructible loads of

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:37.580 
furniture is destructible loads of
physics<00:00:33.770> so<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.860> main<00:00:35.010> idea<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:36.180> RAM<00:00:37.050> smash

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
physics so the main idea is to RAM smash

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.120 
physics so the main idea is to RAM smash
these<00:00:37.860> felons<00:00:38.280> off<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.550> road<00:00:38.760> there's<00:00:39.060> also<00:00:39.300> a

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
these felons off the road there's also a

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.790 
these felons off the road there's also a
recharging<00:00:41.130> Ram<00:00:41.940> mechanic<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.380> Ram

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
recharging Ram mechanic and this Ram

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.940 
recharging Ram mechanic and this Ram
allows<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.910> really<00:00:45.180> smash<00:00:45.660> into<00:00:45.960> felon

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
allows you to really smash into felon

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.819 
allows you to really smash into felon
car<00:00:49.310> hit<00:00:50.310> them<00:00:50.489> on<00:00:50.550> side<00:00:50.989> get<00:00:51.989> quite<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.290> zoom

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
car hit them on side get quite a zoom

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.220 
car hit them on side get quite a zoom
and<00:00:53.250> Biggs<00:00:53.570> particular<00:00:54.570> smash<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:57.020> just<00:00:58.020> missed

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
and Biggs particular smash I just missed

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.910 
and Biggs particular smash I just missed
him

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.799 

so<00:01:02.920> it's<00:01:03.070> all<00:01:03.190> a<00:01:03.220> big<00:01:03.489> free-roaming<00:01:04.089> city<00:01:04.540> you

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
so it's all a big free-roaming city you

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:14.070 
so it's all a big free-roaming city you
can<00:01:04.989> go<00:01:05.140> any<00:01:05.290> direction<00:01:05.320> you<00:01:05.800> want<00:01:05.920> to<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.810> just

can go any direction you want to so just

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.900 
can go any direction you want to so just
do<00:01:14.320> one<00:01:14.680> more<00:01:16.950> okay<00:01:17.950> so<00:01:18.100> that<00:01:18.610> gives<00:01:18.790> you<00:01:18.880> a

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
do one more okay so that gives you a

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.040 
do one more okay so that gives you a
good<00:01:19.060> idea<00:01:19.150> how<00:01:19.420> it<00:01:19.660> works<00:01:19.900> on<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.290> iPad<00:01:20.440> now

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
good idea how it works on the iPad now

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.990 
good idea how it works on the iPad now
I'm<00:01:23.050> going<00:01:23.200> to<00:01:23.259> show<00:01:23.410> you<00:01:23.470> on<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.130> iPhone<00:01:24.550> all

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
I'm going to show you on the iPhone all

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.850 
I'm going to show you on the iPhone all
the<00:01:25.119> same<00:01:25.300> content<00:01:25.810> obviously<00:01:26.320> a<00:01:26.590> small

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
the same content obviously a small

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.670 
the same content obviously a small
screen<00:01:27.310> and<00:01:27.640> on<00:01:28.210> this<00:01:28.509> escape<00:01:28.990> mission<00:01:29.409> do<00:01:29.619> you

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
screen and on this escape mission do you

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.130 
screen and on this escape mission do you
have<00:01:29.800> to<00:01:29.950> get<00:01:30.130> two<00:01:30.460> checkpoints<00:01:31.300> so<00:01:31.900> that<00:01:32.020> your

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
have to get two checkpoints so that your

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.840 
have to get two checkpoints so that your
time<00:01:32.290> doesn't<00:01:32.619> run<00:01:32.770> out<00:01:32.890> you<00:01:33.130> need<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.430> get<00:01:33.610> to

time doesn't run out you need to get to

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.999 
time doesn't run out you need to get to
a<00:01:33.880> destination<00:01:34.030> really<00:01:34.750> quickly<00:01:35.140> really

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
a destination really quickly really

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.580 
a destination really quickly really
quick<00:01:36.190> cutscene<00:01:36.700> at<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:36.880> start<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:38.380> you<00:01:38.440> can

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
quick cutscene at the start and you can

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.050 
quick cutscene at the start and you can
see<00:01:38.710> these<00:01:38.800> blue<00:01:39.009> arrows<00:01:39.369> or<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.580> get<00:01:39.700> to<00:01:39.820> them

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
see these blue arrows or to get to them

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.389 
see these blue arrows or to get to them
to<00:01:40.960> try<00:01:41.259> and<00:01:41.350> avoid<00:01:41.410> as<00:01:41.740> much<00:01:41.920> traffic<00:01:42.190> as

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
to try and avoid as much traffic as

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.150 
to try and avoid as much traffic as
possible<00:01:42.940> I<00:01:43.680> also<00:01:44.680> have<00:01:45.399> in<00:01:45.850> this<00:01:46.060> mission

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
possible I also have in this mission

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.590 
possible I also have in this mission
some<00:01:48.160> felons<00:01:48.610> trying<00:01:48.910> to<00:01:49.000> ram<00:01:49.179> me<00:01:49.330> off<00:01:49.450> the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
some felons trying to ram me off the

some felons trying to ram me off the
road<00:01:52.259> there's<00:01:53.259> some<00:01:53.380> nice<00:01:53.619> tricks<00:01:53.950> you<00:01:54.130> can<00:01:54.190> do

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
road there's some nice tricks you can do

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.810 
road there's some nice tricks you can do
you<00:01:54.850> spin<00:01:55.149> 180s<00:01:55.690> to<00:01:55.869> sort<00:01:56.050> of<00:01:56.490> smash<00:01:57.490> them<00:01:57.729> off

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
you spin 180s to sort of smash them off

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.410 
you spin 180s to sort of smash them off
the<00:01:57.940> road<00:01:58.060> and<00:01:58.270> stop<00:01:58.539> here<00:02:00.000> without<00:02:01.000> slowing

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
the road and stop here without slowing

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.870 
the road and stop here without slowing
you<00:02:01.570> down<00:02:01.600> too<00:02:01.990> much<00:02:02.140> so<00:02:05.430> as<00:02:06.430> you<00:02:06.579> can<00:02:06.640> see<00:02:06.729> this

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
you down too much so as you can see this

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.580 
you down too much so as you can see this
is<00:02:07.030> a<00:02:07.060> completely<00:02:07.630> different<00:02:07.750> district<00:02:08.380> and

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
is a completely different district and

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.319 
is a completely different district and
the<00:02:08.799> one<00:02:09.130> I<00:02:09.160> just<00:02:09.250> showed<00:02:09.459> you<00:02:09.640> before<00:02:09.820> this

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:10.329 
the one I just showed you before this

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:14.789 
the one I just showed you before this
six<00:02:10.630> in<00:02:10.810> total<00:02:13.049> but<00:02:14.049> even<00:02:14.530> though<00:02:14.620> it's<00:02:14.769> a

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
six in total but even though it's a

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.830 
six in total but even though it's a
small<00:02:15.070> screen<00:02:15.519> the<00:02:15.820> iPad<00:02:16.209> that's<00:02:16.450> completely

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
small screen the iPad that's completely

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.900 
small screen the iPad that's completely
controllable<00:02:19.530> okay<00:02:20.530> so<00:02:20.920> if<00:02:21.190> this<00:02:21.459> gives<00:02:21.670> you<00:02:21.880> a

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
controllable okay so if this gives you a

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.100 
controllable okay so if this gives you a
