that we need an assault weapons ban okay
that<00:03:22.739> is<00:03:22.920> exactly<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.640> same<00:03:24.030> logic<00:03:24.829> there's

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
that is exactly the same logic there's

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.069 
that is exactly the same logic there's
really<00:03:26.100> no<00:03:26.340> Harshman<00:03:26.880> against<00:03:27.329> that<00:03:27.540> but

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
really no Harshman against that but

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.569 
really no Harshman against that but
unlike<00:03:28.320> i<00:03:28.500> said<00:03:28.739> earlier<00:03:28.890> i'm<00:03:29.160> not<00:03:29.340> going<00:03:29.519> to

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
unlike i said earlier i'm not going to

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.599 
unlike i said earlier i'm not going to
disable<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.090> comments<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:31.549> disable<00:03:32.549> the

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
disable the comments and disable the

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:33.650

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
ratings or anything like that because

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.120 
ratings or anything like that because
that<00:03:34.019> is<00:03:34.170> what<00:03:34.320> people<00:03:34.440> that<00:03:34.769> don't<00:03:34.950> have

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
that is what people that don't have

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.530 
that is what people that don't have
strong<00:03:35.370> arguments<00:03:35.910> do<00:03:36.000> like<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.329> Brady

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
strong arguments do like the Brady

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.930 
strong arguments do like the Brady
Campaign<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:37.489> that's<00:03:38.489> what<00:03:38.670> they'll<00:03:38.790> do<00:03:38.910> that

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
Campaign and that's what they'll do that

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.550 
Campaign and that's what they'll do that
though<00:03:39.239> well<00:03:39.810> they<00:03:39.900> won't<00:03:39.989> block<00:03:40.230> people<00:03:40.500> they

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
though well they won't block people they

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.569 
though well they won't block people they
just<00:03:40.680> want<00:03:40.829> a<00:03:40.859> lot<00:03:40.980> of<00:03:41.040> comments<00:03:41.430> because

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
just want a lot of comments because

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.460 
just want a lot of comments because
anything<00:03:42.060> that<00:03:42.269> isn't<00:03:42.660> agreeing<00:03:43.019> with<00:03:43.260> them

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
is wrong and most of the people don't

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.729 
is wrong and most of the people don't
agree<00:03:45.420> with<00:03:45.510> them<00:03:45.780> obviously<00:03:46.530> what<00:03:46.680> I'm
