00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
tactic that I like to use called the

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.259 
tactic that I like to use called the
leave<00:03:47.019> with<00:03:47.259> a<00:03:47.290> stun<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:47.919> I<00:03:48.669> usually<00:03:48.970> only<00:03:49.060> can

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
leave with a stun and I usually only can

set up like i'm using right now so it's

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.539 
set up like i'm using right now so it's
a<00:03:53.139> tactic<00:03:53.500> that<00:03:53.530> i<00:03:53.709> have<00:03:54.040> to<00:03:54.159> use<00:03:54.280> sparingly

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
a tactic that i have to use sparingly

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:55.920

recall<00:04:33.150> but<00:04:33.390> on<00:04:33.510> the<00:04:33.600> ps3<00:04:33.870> is<00:04:34.110> more<00:04:34.380> manageable

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
recall but on the ps3 is more manageable

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.310 
recall but on the ps3 is more manageable
than<00:04:34.920> it<00:04:35.160> is<00:04:35.280> on<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.520> xbox<00:04:36.030> not<00:04:36.930> that<00:04:37.080> that<00:04:37.140> are

than it is on the xbox not that that are
different<00:04:37.800> but<00:04:38.490> it's<00:04:38.700> just<00:04:38.910> that<00:04:39.090> I<00:04:39.210> can

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
different but it's just that I can

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.120 
different but it's just that I can
control<00:04:39.780> it<00:04:39.960> easier<00:04:40.290> with<00:04:40.590> a<00:04:40.650> ps3<00:04:40.920> controller

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
control it easier with a ps3 controller

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.220 
control it easier with a ps3 controller
then<00:04:41.550> I<00:04:41.670> can<00:04:41.850> an<00:04:41.940> Xbox<00:04:42.360> controller<00:04:42.450> for<00:04:43.110> those

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
then I can an Xbox controller for those
