follow<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.960> video<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.320> was<00:01:22.770> just<00:01:22.920> going<00:01:23.310> for<00:01:23.520> my

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
follow a video I was just going for my

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.999 
follow a video I was just going for my
own<00:01:23.790> mind<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.479> consider<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.290> did<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.740> I'm

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
own mind so consider I did that I'm

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.179 
own mind so consider I did that I'm
pretty<00:01:26.640> happy<00:01:26.880> with<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.390> results<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.229> probably

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
pretty happy with the results I probably

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.440 
pretty happy with the results I probably
could<00:01:29.490> have<00:01:29.520> done<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.790> better<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.270> easier

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
could have done it better and easier

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.960 
could have done it better and easier
it's<00:01:31.200> probably<00:01:31.470> much<00:01:31.860> better<00:01:31.920> ways<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.430> do<00:01:32.820> it

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
it's probably much better ways to do it

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.380 
it's probably much better ways to do it
than<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.270> way<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.630> did<00:01:33.810> but<00:01:34.909> the<00:01:35.909> way<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.060> did<00:01:36.299> it

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
than the way I did but the way I did it
