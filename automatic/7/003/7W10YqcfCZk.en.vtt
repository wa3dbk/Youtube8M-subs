00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.839

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.039
 start the game well so today I'm going to 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.520
 teach the first thing you have to do is 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.990

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.830

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.830
 description of the video 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.550

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:48.160

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.890
 advertising and opens us and well this 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.230

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.670
