some Canon 7d HDR bracketing tips that

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.509 
some Canon 7d HDR bracketing tips that
I've<00:00:09.269> come<00:00:09.570> up<00:00:09.690> with<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:10.250> overcome<00:00:11.250> the

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
I've come up with to overcome the

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.049 
I've come up with to overcome the
limitation<00:00:12.059> within<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.480> 7d<00:00:13.340> were<00:00:14.340> which<00:00:14.820> is

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
limitation within the 7d were which is

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.420 
limitation within the 7d were which is
you<00:00:15.570> can<00:00:15.719> only<00:00:15.870> capture<00:00:16.109> three<00:00:16.680> images<00:00:17.160> in<00:00:17.340> a

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
you can only capture three images in a

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.790 
you can only capture three images in a
bracketed<00:00:17.850> series

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
bracketed series

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.550 
bracketed series
unlike<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.949> comparable<00:00:20.789> Nikon<00:00:21.539> d300<00:00:21.960> which

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
unlike the comparable Nikon d300 which

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.040 
unlike the comparable Nikon d300 which
can<00:00:22.800> with<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.760> many<00:00:23.970> menu<00:00:24.390> setting<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.900> can

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
can with the many menu setting you can

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.320 
can with the many menu setting you can
shoot<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.949> know<00:00:26.039> up<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.250> five<00:00:26.640> or<00:00:27.000> seven

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
shoot you know up to five or seven

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.540 
shoot you know up to five or seven
bracketed<00:00:27.779> images<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.920> that's<00:00:29.010> important

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
bracketed images and that's important

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.640 
bracketed images and that's important
when<00:00:29.670> we're<00:00:29.820> out<00:00:29.910> shooting<00:00:30.420> during<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.470> day

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
when we're out shooting during the day

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.830 
when we're out shooting during the day
like<00:00:32.520> today<00:00:32.700> when<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.059> was<00:00:33.210> out<00:00:33.300> shooting<00:00:33.540> there

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
like today when I was out shooting there

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.639 
like today when I was out shooting there
was<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> real<00:00:34.350> bright<00:00:34.739> sky<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.399> shooting<00:00:36.390> some

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
was a real bright sky and shooting some

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.680 
was a real bright sky and shooting some
some<00:00:37.649> old<00:00:37.829> buildings<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.989> you<00:00:39.989> know<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.559> had<00:00:41.430> to

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
some old buildings and you know I had to

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.220 
some old buildings and you know I had to
increase<00:00:42.690> my<00:00:43.050> bracketing<00:00:43.920> range<00:00:44.239> to<00:00:45.239> account

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
increase my bracketing range to account

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.430 
increase my bracketing range to account
for<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:47.160> very<00:00:47.550> bright<00:00:47.850> sky<00:00:48.180> if<00:00:48.629> not<00:00:48.930> my<00:00:49.170> sky

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
for the very bright sky if not my sky

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.220 
for the very bright sky if not my sky
would<00:00:49.590> have<00:00:49.680> been<00:00:49.770> blown<00:00:49.980> out<00:00:50.360> so<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:52.050> way<00:00:52.170> to

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
would have been blown out so the way to

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.279 
would have been blown out so the way to
get<00:00:52.440> around<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.480> to<00:00:54.480> shoot<00:00:54.660> more<00:00:54.870> images

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
get around that is to shoot more images

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.930 
get around that is to shoot more images
in<00:00:55.649> your<00:00:55.710> bracketed<00:00:56.250> series

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
in your bracketed series

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.279 
in your bracketed series
you<00:00:57.899> know<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.140> expand<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.770> data<00:00:59.070> range<00:01:00.289> so

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
you know to expand that data range so

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.490 
you know to expand that data range so
like<00:01:01.770> today<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.070> know<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.309> was<00:01:03.290> some<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.379> my

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
like today you know I was some of my

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.429 
like today you know I was some of my
scenes<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.369> had<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.820> have<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.869> know<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.990> six

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
scenes I had to have a you know a six

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.590 
scenes I had to have a you know a six
top<00:01:07.740> seven<00:01:08.280> stop<00:01:08.520> eight<00:01:08.970> stop

top seven stop eight stop

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.890 
top seven stop eight stop
range<00:01:10.460> to<00:01:11.460> get<00:01:11.610> all<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.390> light<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.630> was

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
range to get all of the light that was

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.160 
range to get all of the light that was
in<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.170> scene<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:15.030> do<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.390> I've<00:01:15.869> come<00:01:16.110> up

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
in the scene and to do that I've come up

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.990 
in the scene and to do that I've come up
with<00:01:16.229> two<00:01:16.439> different<00:01:16.710> ways<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.670> first<00:01:17.850> way

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
with two different ways the first way

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.300 
with two different ways the first way
out<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.630> was<00:01:18.810> using<00:01:18.860> so<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:19.890> was<00:01:19.979> using<00:01:20.100> my

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
out that I was using so I was using my

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.880 
out that I was using so I was using my
mode<00:01:20.580> dial<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:22.759> I'm<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.210> 70<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.259> three

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
mode dial and I'm the 70 you have three

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.660 
mode dial and I'm the 70 you have three
slots<00:01:26.130> three<00:01:26.970> custom<00:01:27.330> slots<00:01:28.009> c1<00:01:29.009> c2<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.430> c3

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
slots three custom slots c1 c2 and c3

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.670 
slots three custom slots c1 c2 and c3
and<00:01:30.329> what<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.780> allows<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.259> do<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.470> you

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
and what this allows you to do is you

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.670 
and what this allows you to do is you
can<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.400> know<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.579> can<00:01:33.020> put<00:01:34.020> your<00:01:34.200> camera<00:01:34.409> in

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
can you know you can put your camera in

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.920 
can you know you can put your camera in
one<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.070> other<00:01:35.430> modes<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.090> set<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.869> up

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
one of the other modes and set it up

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.510 
one of the other modes and set it up
exactly<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.500> way<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.740> want<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.340> then<00:01:38.400> you

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
exactly the way you want it and then you

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.120 
exactly the way you want it and then you
can<00:01:38.820> register<00:01:39.240> those<00:01:39.720> settings<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.590> one<00:01:41.009> of

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
can register those settings to one of

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.480 
can register those settings to one of
these<00:01:41.189> three<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.390> then<00:01:42.740> any<00:01:43.740> time<00:01:44.009> thereafter

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
these three and then any time thereafter

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.090 
these three and then any time thereafter
you<00:01:45.180> can<00:01:46.110> flip<00:01:46.380> back<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.799> one<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.009> these

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
you can flip back to the one of these

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.870 
you can flip back to the one of these
custom<00:01:47.490> gold<00:01:47.670> spots<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.860> those<00:01:49.880> settings

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
custom gold spots and those settings

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.660 
custom gold spots and those settings
will<00:01:51.030> be<00:01:51.110> saved<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.470> can<00:01:52.680> just<00:01:53.310> take<00:01:53.490> off

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
will be saved and you can just take off

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.060 
will be saved and you can just take off
from<00:01:53.790> start<00:01:54.060> running<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.750> set<00:01:55.350> up<00:01:55.380> c1<00:01:55.860> for

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
from start running so I set up c1 for

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.219 
from start running so I set up c1 for
video<00:01:56.369> for<00:01:56.700> example<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.360> then<00:01:57.450> two<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.780> three

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
video for example and then two and three

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.010 
video for example and then two and three
and<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.560> was<00:01:58.740> left<00:01:58.920> with<00:01:59.189> so<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.119> set<00:02:00.329> up<00:02:00.360> two<00:02:00.840> and

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
and I was left with so I set up two and

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.300 
and I was left with so I set up two and
three<00:02:01.110> for<00:02:01.619> my<00:02:01.710> HDR<00:02:02.310> spots<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.979> by<00:02:04.979> default

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
three for my HDR spots and by default

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.930 
three for my HDR spots and by default
initially<00:02:06.270> what<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.450> did<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.899> set<00:02:07.140> up<00:02:07.640> c2<00:02:08.640> is

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
initially what I did is I set up c2 is

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.869 
initially what I did is I set up c2 is
my<00:02:09.090> default<00:02:09.330> HDR<00:02:10.259> which<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.770> negative<00:02:11.459> two<00:02:11.670> to

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
my default HDR which is negative two to

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.770 
my default HDR which is negative two to
two<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.120> F

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
two and F

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.610 
two and F
nice<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.940> 101<00:02:14.940> shot<00:02:15.330> auto<00:02:15.660> white<00:02:15.900> balance<00:02:15.930> two

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
nice the 101 shot auto white balance two

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.480 
nice the 101 shot auto white balance two
second<00:02:16.980> timer

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
second timer

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.820 
second timer
you<00:02:18.450> know<00:02:18.510> just<00:02:18.750> pretty<00:02:18.870> good<00:02:19.080> defaults<00:02:19.620> and

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
you know just pretty good defaults and

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.410 
you know just pretty good defaults and
then<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:19.980> can<00:02:20.400> always<00:02:20.610> tweak<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:21.000> in<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.120> field

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
then I can always tweak it in the field

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.830 
then I can always tweak it in the field
when<00:02:21.920> but<00:02:22.920> if<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.160> had<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.459> take<00:02:23.640> quick<00:02:24.270> HDR<00:02:24.780> shot

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
when but if I had to take quick HDR shot

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.430 
when but if I had to take quick HDR shot
I<00:02:25.260> know<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.440> could<00:02:25.709> just<00:02:25.740> flip<00:02:26.160> in<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.400> c2<00:02:26.819> and<00:02:27.440> and

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
I know I could just flip in a c2 and and

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.140 
I know I could just flip in a c2 and and
go<00:02:28.590> from<00:02:28.770> there

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
go from there

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.720 
go from there
then<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:31.290> know<00:02:31.380> there's<00:02:31.470> couples<00:02:31.920> situations

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
then you know there's couples situations

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.050 
then you know there's couples situations
where<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:32.970> wanted<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.420> increase<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:35.280> range<00:02:35.459> so

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
where I wanted to increase the range so

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.850 
where I wanted to increase the range so
what<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.239> did<00:02:36.300> is<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.600> registered<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.319> same

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
what I did is I registered the same

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.570 
what I did is I registered the same
exact<00:02:38.310> settings<00:02:38.819> on<00:02:39.319> c3<00:02:40.319> except<00:02:41.280> for<00:02:41.430> this

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
exact settings on c3 except for this

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.970 
exact settings on c3 except for this
time<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:42.000> just<00:02:42.209> changed<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.720> bracket<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.860> be

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
time I just changed the bracket to be

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.550 
time I just changed the bracket to be
negative<00:02:44.489> 1<00:02:44.700> 0<00:02:45.150> &amp;<00:02:45.390> 1<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:45.959> gave<00:02:46.170> me<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.290> total

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
negative 1 0 &amp; 1 so this gave me a total

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.680 
negative 1 0 &amp; 1 so this gave me a total
of<00:02:46.650> 5<00:02:46.890> bracket<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.459> images<00:02:47.820> from<00:02:48.060> negative<00:02:48.450> 2

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
of 5 bracket and images from negative 2

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.410 
of 5 bracket and images from negative 2
to<00:02:48.930> 2<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:50.430> know<00:02:50.519> give<00:02:50.730> me<00:02:50.760> some<00:02:50.820> extra<00:02:51.060> data

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
to 2 you know give me some extra data

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.360 
to 2 you know give me some extra data
and<00:02:51.840> I<00:02:52.320> found<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.709> I<00:02:52.769> was<00:02:52.830> getting<00:02:53.010> some

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
and I found that I was getting some

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.509 
and I found that I was getting some
better<00:02:53.519> results<00:02:53.610> with<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.269> head<00:02:55.370> while<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.400> was

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
better results with the head while I was

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:57.979 
better results with the head while I was
working<00:02:56.790> in<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:56.910> field<00:02:57.120> especially<00:02:57.239> when<00:02:57.630> it

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
working in the field especially when it

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.509 
working in the field especially when it
kind<00:02:58.170> of<00:02:58.290> reduced<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:58.739> greatly<00:02:59.459> reduces<00:02:59.690> noise

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
kind of reduced it greatly reduces noise

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.220 
kind of reduced it greatly reduces noise
you<00:03:02.519> know<00:03:02.550> but<00:03:03.060> it<00:03:03.150> ultimately<00:03:03.510> depends<00:03:04.140> on

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
you know but it ultimately depends on

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.680 
you know but it ultimately depends on
what<00:03:04.350> you're<00:03:04.500> shooting<00:03:04.530> but<00:03:05.069> I<00:03:05.790> like<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.540> shoot

have you know hard light and start
shadows<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.640> that<00:03:15.300> could<00:03:15.450> be<00:03:15.540> pretty

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
shadows and that could be pretty

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.580 
shadows and that could be pretty
challenging<00:03:16.019> with<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.850> HDR<00:03:17.850> so<00:03:19.040> anyways<00:03:20.040> the

that does do is it limits the Iceland

white balance when I'm shooting outdoors
I<00:04:06.000> always<00:04:06.239> set<00:04:06.390> the<00:04:06.480> cloudy<00:04:06.720> it<00:04:07.049> I<00:04:07.950> first<00:04:08.340> found

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
I always set the cloudy it I first found

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.360 
I always set the cloudy it I first found
that<00:04:08.730> to<00:04:08.850> give<00:04:09.090> me<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.269> best<00:04:09.420> results<00:04:09.570> for<00:04:10.370> the

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
that to give me the best results for the

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.460 
that to give me the best results for the
style<00:04:11.640> I<00:04:11.760> like<00:04:11.940> I<00:04:12.120> like<00:04:12.269> a<00:04:12.600> little<00:04:12.900> bit<00:04:13.019> more

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
style I like I like a little bit more

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.770 
style I like I like a little bit more
color<00:04:13.920> in<00:04:14.130> my<00:04:14.250> images<00:04:14.609> and<00:04:14.670> maybe<00:04:15.000> some<00:04:15.359> prefer

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
color in my images and maybe some prefer

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.159 
color in my images and maybe some prefer
what<00:04:17.329> so<00:04:18.329> while<00:04:18.419> you<00:04:18.570> say<00:04:18.750> whether<00:04:19.019> it's

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
what so while you say whether it's

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.930 
what so while you say whether it's
cloudy<00:04:19.410> or<00:04:19.530> not<00:04:19.739> I<00:04:19.769> just<00:04:20.400> like<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:20.669> way<00:04:20.789> that

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
cloudy or not I just like the way that

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.180 
cloudy or not I just like the way that
that<00:04:21.299> results

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
that results

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.110 
that results
of<00:04:22.910> that<00:04:23.180> setting<00:04:24.040> so<00:04:25.040> anyways<00:04:25.340> you<00:04:26.000> know<00:04:26.090> I

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
of that setting so anyways you know I

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.060 
of that setting so anyways you know I
take<00:04:26.300> my<00:04:26.480> first<00:04:26.750> breakfast<00:04:27.290> series<00:04:27.650> and<00:04:27.920> then

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
take my first breakfast series and then

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.770 
take my first breakfast series and then
instead<00:04:28.280> of<00:04:28.430> switching<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:29.000> mode<00:04:29.240> button<00:04:29.450> all

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
instead of switching the mode button all

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.940 
instead of switching the mode button all
I<00:04:29.810> would<00:04:30.050> do<00:04:30.230> is<00:04:30.580> just<00:04:32.020> click<00:04:33.020> three<00:04:33.710> times

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
I would do is just click three times

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.400 
I would do is just click three times
over<00:04:34.190> and<00:04:34.550> now<00:04:34.670> I'm<00:04:35.030> in<00:04:35.270> shooting<00:04:36.170> from

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
over and now I'm in shooting from

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.730 
over and now I'm in shooting from
negative<00:04:36.980> 3<00:04:37.730> to<00:04:38.030> negative<00:04:38.060> 1<00:04:38.540> to<00:04:38.720> 1<00:04:38.750> so<00:04:39.110> I've

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
negative 3 to negative 1 to 1 so I've

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.890 
negative 3 to negative 1 to 1 so I've
increased<00:04:40.010> my<00:04:40.220> bracketed<00:04:40.790> series<00:04:41.210> my<00:04:41.540> bracket

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
increased my bracketed series my bracket

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.820 
increased my bracketed series my bracket
range<00:04:42.890> now<00:04:43.690> from<00:04:44.690> negative<00:04:45.020> 3<00:04:45.290> all<00:04:45.560> the<00:04:45.680> way<00:04:45.710> up

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
range now from negative 3 all the way up

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.120 
range now from negative 3 all the way up
to<00:04:46.070> 2<00:04:46.480> which<00:04:47.480> is<00:04:47.630> great<00:04:47.840> so<00:04:48.020> now<00:04:48.140> I<00:04:48.170> can<00:04:48.410> get<00:04:48.560> 5

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
to 2 which is great so now I can get 5

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.220 
to 2 which is great so now I can get 5
images<00:04:49.910> out<00:04:50.120> of<00:04:50.150> that<00:04:50.390> that<00:04:50.600> I<00:04:50.690> can<00:04:50.870> use<00:04:51.020> in<00:04:51.200> my

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
images out of that that I can use in my

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.010 
images out of that that I can use in my
HDR<00:04:51.800> which<00:04:52.450> really<00:04:53.450> helps<00:04:53.810> when<00:04:53.900> you're

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
HDR which really helps when you're

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.100 
HDR which really helps when you're
shooting<00:04:54.140> outdoors<00:04:54.380> and<00:04:54.830> you<00:04:54.920> would<00:04:55.040> need<00:04:55.130> to

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
shooting outdoors and you would need to

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.500 
shooting outdoors and you would need to
step<00:04:57.110> down<00:04:57.140> to<00:04:57.830> keep<00:04:58.760> the<00:04:58.880> sky<00:04:59.090> from<00:04:59.270> being

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
step down to keep the sky from being

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.340 
step down to keep the sky from being
blown<00:04:59.720> out<00:04:59.900> when<00:05:00.740> today<00:05:00.890> there's<00:05:01.160> real<00:05:01.580> hard

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
blown out when today there's real hard

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.590 
blown out when today there's real hard
sky<00:05:03.350> is<00:05:03.410> you<00:05:03.710> know<00:05:03.800> it's<00:05:03.950> a<00:05:04.010> nice<00:05:04.550> blue<00:05:04.880> sky<00:05:05.180> but

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
sky is you know it's a nice blue sky but

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.520 
sky is you know it's a nice blue sky but
it<00:05:06.260> also<00:05:06.440> means<00:05:06.740> very<00:05:07.310> hard<00:05:07.580> light<00:05:07.820> midday<00:05:08.530> and

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
it also means very hard light midday and

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.290 
it also means very hard light midday and
in<00:05:09.740> a<00:05:09.800> couple<00:05:10.160> cases<00:05:10.190> I<00:05:10.610> had<00:05:10.850> to<00:05:11.000> step<00:05:11.270> down

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
in a couple cases I had to step down

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.580 
in a couple cases I had to step down
once<00:05:11.990> more<00:05:12.350> down<00:05:12.680> to<00:05:12.950> negative<00:05:13.310> 4<00:05:14.020> and<00:05:15.020> what

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
once more down to negative 4 and what

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:16.810 
once more down to negative 4 and what
this<00:05:15.740> allowed<00:05:15.980> me<00:05:16.010> to<00:05:16.160> do<00:05:16.340> is<00:05:16.460> it<00:05:16.580> you<00:05:16.640> know<00:05:16.730> it

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
this allowed me to do is it you know it

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.870 
this allowed me to do is it you know it
took<00:05:16.940> another<00:05:17.120> series<00:05:17.600> of<00:05:17.720> three<00:05:17.930> images<00:05:18.080> and

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
took another series of three images and

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.490 
took another series of three images and
at<00:05:19.880> the<00:05:20.000> end<00:05:20.120> of<00:05:20.240> this<00:05:20.330> I'm<00:05:20.600> left<00:05:20.840> with<00:05:21.020> seven

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
at the end of this I'm left with seven

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.220 
at the end of this I'm left with seven
usable<00:05:22.010> images<00:05:22.460> so<00:05:22.820> yeah<00:05:23.630> I<00:05:23.660> had<00:05:23.900> a<00:05:23.930> couple<00:05:24.080> of

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
usable images so yeah I had a couple of

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.750 
usable images so yeah I had a couple of
duplicates<00:05:24.680> like<00:05:24.920> you'll<00:05:25.040> see<00:05:25.220> I'm<00:05:25.340> negative

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
duplicates like you'll see I'm negative

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.020 
duplicates like you'll see I'm negative
4<00:05:25.970> negative<00:05:26.000> 2<00:05:26.450> &amp;<00:05:26.810> 0<00:05:26.840> so<00:05:27.710> out<00:05:28.040> of<00:05:28.070> this<00:05:28.250> series<00:05:28.730> I

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
threw away the negative 2 and the 0 just

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.090 
threw away the negative 2 and the 0 just
kept<00:05:31.910> the<00:05:31.970> negative<00:05:32.300> 4<00:05:32.770> so<00:05:33.770> what<00:05:33.860> I'm<00:05:33.950> left

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.900 
difference in the world I'm being able
to<00:05:49.910> recover<00:05:50.450> that<00:05:50.540> sky<00:05:51.020> without<00:05:51.910> introducing

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
to recover that sky without introducing

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.159 
to recover that sky without introducing
a<00:05:53.210> whole<00:05:53.390> bunch<00:05:53.600> of<00:05:53.690> noise<00:05:53.870> so<00:05:54.669> anyways<00:05:55.669> I<00:05:56.169> hope

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
a whole bunch of noise so anyways I hope

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:00.100 
a whole bunch of noise so anyways I hope
