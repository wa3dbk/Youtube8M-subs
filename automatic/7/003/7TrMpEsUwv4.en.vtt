with<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.659> four<00:01:54.869> aces<00:01:54.960> that's<00:01:55.409> going<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.680> be<00:01:55.770> a

with the four aces that's going to be a
little<00:01:55.950> harder<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.399> do<00:01:56.579> tough<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.360> get<00:01:57.450> those

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
little harder to do tough to get those

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.020 
little harder to do tough to get those
in<00:01:57.750> position<00:01:58.290> without<00:01:58.759> someone<00:01:59.759> knowing<00:01:59.880> it

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
in position without someone knowing it

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.789 
in position without someone knowing it
unless<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.259> pretty<00:02:01.409> good<00:02:01.590> slide

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
unless you this is a pretty good slide

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.120 
unless you this is a pretty good slide
of<00:02:01.890> hand<00:02:01.920> tricks<00:02:03.500> so<00:02:04.500> what<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.770> can<00:02:05.040> do

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
of hand tricks so what you can do

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.230 
of hand tricks so what you can do
instead<00:02:05.399> is<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.640> can<00:02:05.790> have<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.030> set<00:02:06.210> up

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
instead is you can have this set up

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.900 
instead is you can have this set up
ahead<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.600> time<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.049> do<00:02:07.829> this<00:02:07.950> trick<00:02:08.190> first<00:02:08.520> or

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
ahead of time and do this trick first or

ahead of time and do this trick first or
whatever<00:02:09.569> trick<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.110> want<00:02:10.289> this

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
whatever trick it is you want this

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.580 
whatever trick it is you want this
require<00:02:10.860> set<00:02:11.129> up

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
require set up

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.009

or<00:02:12.340> you<00:02:12.849> can<00:02:13.090> have<00:02:13.390> more<00:02:13.540> than<00:02:13.599> one<00:02:13.690> deck<00:02:13.900> of

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
or you can have more than one deck of

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.170 
or you can have more than one deck of
cards<00:02:14.349> do<00:02:14.950> couple<00:02:15.340> cartridge<00:02:15.700> for<00:02:15.849> somebody

cards do couple cartridge for somebody

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.500 
cards do couple cartridge for somebody
put<00:02:16.900> your<00:02:17.050> cards<00:02:17.290> away<00:02:17.730> do<00:02:18.730> a<00:02:18.760> coin<00:02:19.060> trick<00:02:19.360> or

put your cards away do a coin trick or

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.509 
put your cards away do a coin trick or
something<00:02:19.540> get<00:02:20.410> your<00:02:20.560> cards<00:02:20.800> back<00:02:20.980> out<00:02:21.250> and

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
something get your cards back out and

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.309 
something get your cards back out and
then<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:22.420> plot<00:02:22.629> your<00:02:22.690> other<00:02:23.019> deck<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:23.290> has

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
then you plot your other deck that has

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.800 
then you plot your other deck that has
the<00:02:23.470> aces<00:02:23.709> on<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:23.860> top<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:24.190> do<00:02:24.280> this<00:02:24.400> trip

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
the aces on the top and do this trip

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.589 
the aces on the top and do this trip
look<00:02:25.810> you<00:02:25.989> know<00:02:26.080> things<00:02:26.739> like<00:02:26.890> that<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:28.420> what

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
look you know things like that so what

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:29.940 
look you know things like that so what
you're<00:02:28.750> doing<00:02:28.780> is<00:02:29.080> when<00:02:29.349> you<00:02:29.410> shuffle<00:02:29.620> here

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
you're doing is when you shuffle here

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.059 
you're doing is when you shuffle here
just<00:02:30.760> make<00:02:30.940> sure<00:02:30.970> that<00:02:31.150> you<00:02:31.330> have<00:02:31.920> more<00:02:32.920> than

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
just make sure that you have more than

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.130 
just make sure that you have more than
four<00:02:33.280> cards<00:02:33.640> fall<00:02:33.970> on<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.230> on<00:02:35.440> that<00:02:35.500> top<00:02:35.920> side

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
four cards fall on the on that top side

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.170 
four cards fall on the on that top side
so<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.379> Aces<00:02:38.650> don't<00:02:38.890> get<00:02:39.040> disturbed<00:02:39.400> they

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
so the Aces don't get disturbed they

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.259 
so the Aces don't get disturbed they
stay<00:02:40.450> on<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.720> top<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:42.370> practice<00:02:43.090> that<00:02:43.120> a

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
stay on the top and practice that a

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:44.850 
stay on the top and practice that a
little<00:02:43.690> bit<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:44.110> make<00:02:44.200> sure<00:02:44.260> that<00:02:44.530> you<00:02:44.650> can<00:02:44.769> do

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
little bit to make sure that you can do

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.640 
little bit to make sure that you can do
it<00:02:44.950> reliably<00:02:45.370> not<00:02:46.090> screwing<00:02:46.420> it<00:02:46.540> up<00:02:46.630> if<00:02:47.560> you

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
it reliably not screwing it up if you

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.020 
it reliably not screwing it up if you
realize<00:02:47.860> you<00:02:47.980> did<00:02:48.130> screw<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:48.489> up<00:02:48.549> then<00:02:48.849> just

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
realize you did screw it up then just

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.490 
realize you did screw it up then just
move<00:02:49.180> on<00:02:49.329> to<00:02:49.510> a<00:02:49.540> different<00:02:49.630> trip<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.349> don't

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
move on to a different trip and don't

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.190 
move on to a different trip and don't
try<00:02:50.799> to<00:02:50.860> do<00:02:51.040> this<00:02:51.269> then<00:02:52.269> we<00:02:52.480> do<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:52.660> little<00:02:52.930> cut

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
try to do this then we do the little cut

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.860 
try to do this then we do the little cut
you<00:02:53.739> can<00:02:53.920> do<00:02:54.700> all<00:02:54.760> kinds<00:02:54.849> of<00:02:55.090> you<00:02:55.420> know<00:02:55.569> fancy

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
you can do all kinds of you know fancy

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.380 
you can do all kinds of you know fancy
stuff<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.379> mix<00:02:56.590> things<00:02:56.739> around<00:02:57.209> just<00:02:58.209> keep

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
stuff to mix things around just keep

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.059 
stuff to mix things around just keep
track<00:02:58.629> of<00:02:58.660> which<00:02:58.930> for<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.349> piles<00:02:59.560> was<00:02:59.890> the

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
track of which for the piles was the

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.890 
track of which for the piles was the
original<00:03:00.879> top<00:03:01.090> that<00:03:01.299> they<00:03:01.390> can<00:03:01.540> make<00:03:01.569> sure<00:03:01.780> you

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
original top that they can make sure you

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.860 
original top that they can make sure you
put<00:03:02.049> it<00:03:02.140> back<00:03:02.260> on<00:03:02.290> top<00:03:02.620> at<00:03:02.799> the<00:03:02.920> end<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:04.150> then

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
put it back on top at the end and then

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.360 
put it back on top at the end and then
so<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:05.739> have<00:03:05.950> a<00:03:05.980> spectator<00:03:06.549> cut<00:03:07.269> four<00:03:07.569> piles

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
so you have a spectator cut four piles

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.589 
so you have a spectator cut four piles
and<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.459> don't<00:03:09.610> have<00:03:09.670> to<00:03:09.790> try<00:03:09.970> memorize<00:03:10.390> that

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
and you don't have to try memorize that

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.020 
and you don't have to try memorize that
sequence<00:03:11.019> I<00:03:11.170> should<00:03:11.349> rather<00:03:11.590> everything<00:03:12.160> what

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
sequence I should rather everything what

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.280 
sequence I should rather everything what
you're<00:03:13.150> doing<00:03:13.390> is<00:03:13.450> you<00:03:13.569> just<00:03:13.750> you<00:03:13.989> know<00:03:14.019> you've

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
you're doing is you just you know you've

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.319 
you're doing is you just you know you've
got<00:03:14.319> the<00:03:14.950> four<00:03:15.190> aces<00:03:15.340> on<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.180> top<00:03:17.109> over<00:03:17.440> here

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
got the four aces on the top over here

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.140 
got the four aces on the top over here
so<00:03:19.329> just<00:03:19.739> make<00:03:20.739> it<00:03:20.950> up<00:03:21.160> as<00:03:21.280> you<00:03:21.340> go<00:03:21.459> that's<00:03:21.970> what

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
so just make it up as you go that's what

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.120 
so just make it up as you go that's what
I<00:03:22.180> just<00:03:22.239> did<00:03:22.630> a<00:03:22.690> second<00:03:23.139> ago<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:23.799> just<00:03:23.829> have

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
I just did a second ago and just have

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.020 
I just did a second ago and just have
them<00:03:24.160> move<00:03:24.430> some<00:03:24.609> cards<00:03:24.910> around<00:03:25.150> one<00:03:25.750> time

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
them move some cards around one time

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.750 
them move some cards around one time
just<00:03:28.030> you<00:03:28.269> know<00:03:28.620> whatever<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:29.829> want<00:03:29.920> to<00:03:30.220> make

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
just you know whatever you want to make

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.650 
just you know whatever you want to make
up<00:03:30.970> on<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.269> spot<00:03:31.389> I<00:03:33.150> just<00:03:34.150> kind<00:03:34.329> of<00:03:34.359> have<00:03:34.510> them

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
up on the spot I just kind of have them

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.430 
up on the spot I just kind of have them
move<00:03:35.319> a<00:03:35.380> bunch<00:03:35.560> of<00:03:35.680> stuff<00:03:35.769> around<00:03:36.190> and<00:03:37.440> just

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
move a bunch of stuff around and just

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.259 
move a bunch of stuff around and just
keep<00:03:38.620> track<00:03:38.859> where<00:03:39.099> those<00:03:39.280> four<00:03:39.819> aces<00:03:40.060> are<00:03:40.150> as

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
keep track where those four aces are as

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.610 
keep track where those four aces are as
you<00:03:40.389> have<00:03:40.510> a<00:03:40.540> move<00:03:40.780> and<00:03:41.049> then<00:03:41.200> when<00:03:41.530> you're

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
you have a move and then when you're

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.250 
you have a move and then when you're
ready<00:03:42.120> have<00:03:43.120> them<00:03:43.239> turn<00:03:43.389> the<00:03:43.480> top<00:03:43.660> cards<00:03:43.989> over

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
ready have them turn the top cards over

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.039 
ready have them turn the top cards over
and<00:03:45.480> they'll<00:03:46.480> have<00:03:46.599> no<00:03:46.750> idea<00:03:47.049> how<00:03:47.139> that<00:03:47.169> worked

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
and they'll have no idea how that worked

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.020 
and they'll have no idea how that worked
you<00:03:50.049> can<00:03:50.169> even<00:03:50.319> like<00:03:50.590> you<00:03:51.400> move<00:03:51.579> an<00:03:51.700> ace<00:03:51.790> and

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
you can even like you move an ace and

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.280 
you can even like you move an ace and
haven't<00:03:52.239> put<00:03:52.329> another<00:03:52.480> car<00:03:52.750> on<00:03:52.780> top<00:03:53.079> of<00:03:53.260> it

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
haven't put another car on top of it

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.229 
haven't put another car on top of it
just<00:03:54.220> remember<00:03:54.459> that<00:03:54.549> you<00:03:54.639> got<00:03:54.790> any<00:03:54.940> second

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
just remember that you got any second

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.460 
just remember that you got any second
from<00:03:55.359> the<00:03:55.389> top<00:03:55.569> here<00:03:55.810> and<00:03:55.900> at<00:03:55.989> some<00:03:56.139> point<00:03:56.380> you

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
from the top here and at some point you

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.720 
from the top here and at some point you
just<00:03:56.500> move<00:03:56.829> it<00:03:56.950> out<00:03:57.099> of<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.190> way<00:03:57.340> so<00:03:57.370> now

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
just move it out of the way so now

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.050 
just move it out of the way so now
you've<00:03:57.849> got<00:03:57.970> an<00:03:58.030> ace<00:03:58.120> on<00:03:58.299> top<00:03:58.480> again<00:03:59.819> so<00:04:00.819> that's

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
you've got an ace on top again so that's

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.509 
you've got an ace on top again so that's
a<00:04:01.329> nice<00:04:02.019> simple<00:04:02.290> spectator<00:04:02.859> cuts<00:04:03.069> to<00:04:03.190> ace<00:04:03.280> is

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
a nice simple spectator cuts to ace is

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.670 
a nice simple spectator cuts to ace is
there<00:04:03.700> that<00:04:03.959> requires<00:04:04.959> almost<00:04:05.169> no<00:04:05.319> skill

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
there that requires almost no skill

skills if you want a very simple version

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.470

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
time the top part over you'll have to

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:21.610 
time the top part over you'll have to
remember<00:04:20.540> anything<00:04:20.810> that<00:04:20.960> way<00:04:21.260> it's<00:04:21.440> a<00:04:21.500> lot

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
remember anything that way it's a lot

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.880 
remember anything that way it's a lot
easier<00:04:21.650> and<00:04:22.480> that<00:04:23.480> actually<00:04:23.840> a<00:04:24.020> lot<00:04:24.710> of<00:04:24.770> people

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
easier and that actually a lot of people

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.320 
easier and that actually a lot of people
won't<00:04:25.100> realize<00:04:25.580> that<00:04:25.790> they're<00:04:25.940> doing<00:04:26.150> if<00:04:26.240> the

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
won't realize that they're doing if the

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.090 
won't realize that they're doing if the
vid<00:04:26.510> just<00:04:26.690> taking<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:27.020> crunch<00:04:27.650> from<00:04:27.710> the<00:04:27.890> top

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
vid just taking the crunch from the top

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.120 
vid just taking the crunch from the top
of<00:04:28.280> it<00:04:28.400> that<00:04:28.430> the<00:04:28.850> deck<00:04:29.060> every<00:04:29.330> time<00:04:29.540> I<00:04:29.980> know<00:04:30.980> it

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
of it that the deck every time I know it

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.070 
of it that the deck every time I know it
seems<00:04:31.310> ridiculous<00:04:32.150> but<00:04:32.180> that<00:04:32.750> will<00:04:32.900> for

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
seems ridiculous but that will for

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.100 
seems ridiculous but that will for
people<00:04:33.350> a<00:04:33.380> lot<00:04:33.440> of<00:04:33.560> times<00:04:33.770> not<00:04:34.100> as<00:04:34.750> reliable<00:04:35.750> as

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
people a lot of times not as reliable as

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.380 
people a lot of times not as reliable as
the<00:04:36.350> other<00:04:36.500> one<00:04:36.940> where<00:04:37.940> you<00:04:38.030> move<00:04:38.180> them<00:04:38.300> all

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
the other one where you move them all

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.510 
the other one where you move them all
around<00:04:38.450> by<00:04:39.110> definitely<00:04:39.620> easier<00:04:40.010> so<00:04:40.280> there's

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
around by definitely easier so there's

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.740 
around by definitely easier so there's
another<00:04:40.700> option<00:04:40.940> if<00:04:41.180> you<00:04:41.240> want<00:04:41.390> to<00:04:41.450> use<00:04:41.570> that

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
another option if you want to use that

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.640 
another option if you want to use that
so<00:04:42.440> that<00:04:42.560> spectator<00:04:43.010> cuts<00:04:43.280> to<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:43.520> east
