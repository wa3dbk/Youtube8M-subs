beads this is actually a minnow rig but
what<00:00:54.539> we're<00:00:54.719> doing<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:55.170> just<00:00:55.230> putting<00:00:55.710> on<00:00:55.829> a

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
what we're doing is just putting on a

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.910 
what we're doing is just putting on a
thin<00:00:56.329> strip<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.510> fresh-cut<00:00:58.079> sucker<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.800> we're

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
thin strip of fresh-cut sucker and we're

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.650 
thin strip of fresh-cut sucker and we're
putting<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.280> through<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.579> corner<00:01:00.329> just<00:01:00.359> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
putting it through the corner just the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.290 
putting it through the corner just the
tip<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:02.070> it's<00:01:02.280> real<00:01:02.520> fluid<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
tip of it so it's real fluid in the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.000 
tip of it so it's real fluid in the
water<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:03.989> actually<00:01:04.500> just<00:01:04.650> lapping

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
water and this is actually just lapping
