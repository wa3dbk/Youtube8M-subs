00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.200
 of course to present the update 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.580
 who just came out about ten 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.900
 seconds so the new unit that 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.460
 was planned that you presented with 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.140
 a gameplay the creature called 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.880
 so in French the molosse of afsset 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.439
 flying creatures of stones and the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.420
 France can well absorb damage 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.019
 to the other three bones and tusks 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.980
 antiaircraft 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.990
 they are wrong in the heart of the village 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.320
 and protects other units the others 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.560
 units 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.610
 once destroyed it is slow in 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.380
 direction to release a swarm of 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.820
 little calves quest for life who 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.270
 continues the fight a little bit like a 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.649
 golem what I did good see her 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.020
 I will explain after why so 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.270
 so here we have also the barbarians who 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.530
 was expected the level 7 archers the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.590
 archives as his days do they 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.570
 have named in fact following he was doing 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.789
 no archives no I 'm not 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.379
 fame who therefore have a lot more 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.789
 points of life apparently while 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.859
 walking level is almost level 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.969
 6 with the mastiffs and I will explain 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.210
 why am I welcome this 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.060
 morning so four hours 5 hours ago 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.110
 I sent my market tour level 11 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.880
 which cost me 5 million 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.680
 alas it costs more than four million 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.030
 five hundred thousand so I'm a little 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.200
 crazy and so it got me a little bit 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.670
 disgusted but hey it's okay it's 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.840
 that 500 miles there I'm waiting to have 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.159
 fed and free to send 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.159
 ramparts with the experts because I have 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:31.229
 too much dxy currently and then so it goes 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.790
 to be in tomorrow then apparently there is 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.079
 a new thing we can put poses on 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.909
 the waters must be attacked 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.020
 you know what are we going to look for 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:43.619
 quickly made a troop 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.000
 here we are going to attack like a dish that 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.560
 I do not have a pair either 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.729
 looking apparently we can we can 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.070
 pause on slow motion or there in 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.360
 the more I'm going to attack him 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.770
 no, I'll take his offer since 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.409
 a lot of gold yes that's more 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.479
 nickel so that allows me to it's like 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.619
 that we easily win kyodo 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.560
 I will also take the mines and 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.750
 reserve to be able to have much more 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.770
 in the successes of delicious prices but 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.420
 good god did not learn much from 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.819
 dexia and I will take editions 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.109
 black quickly and we will send the queen 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.129
 also what I'm going to soon at level 7 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:15.569
 I just had reasons 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.200
 but with the black cloakroom already harvested 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.329
 game can already send it level 7 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:26.489
 here we send everything is going to be fast 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:30.959
 with the heroes here then apparently 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.219
 we can pause on a slow motion 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.349
 will see if that's really true what they 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:36.480
 have said ah yes that's right it's really 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.650
 well done look not this fight we see 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.010
 what I have expenses can be put 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.810
 pause 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.730
 there we say look here we can see the 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.439
 it's really gonna be pretty good I 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.510
 think with my breaks is what we 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.709
 can do more than x 4 no we can see 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.540
 the troops available at the bottom left 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.329
 so what I have not used yet 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.469
 not bad to watch if I accelerate 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.629
 see all this fabric that we can put 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:55.199
 pause to everyone anytime we 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.449
 can put pause 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:58.949
 and then here it is really cool cool 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:01.049
 we can do little things 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:02.969
 nice with that for valentines 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.409
 video then what else do we have 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:06.989
 me because the healer who 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.549
 attack the troops try them and 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.310
 healer who attacks the troops 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.659
 the most things at the base it's not 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.000
 for the archers it's for the giants 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.590
 and so it was legal and focuses 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.759
 now on large groups of 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.239
 large groups invited to the big 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:20.040
 groups 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.889
 ok you can expel the troops 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:29.519
 needless of your criteria and your leader 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:30.030
 clan ah well that's it 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:35.310
 really good 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.479
 there really was it worked well I 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.169
 do not want the game not do it one of your 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:46.739
 military camp but is that what we 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:48.599
 reports 2 x canceled to Cairo have 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.680
 validated everything went really well 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.109
 update was pretty frankly 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.840
 boom in production can 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:57.329
 to be removed without water flows to that it 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.159
 will be good that is to say that if we 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.560
 lose not 50 anything decidedly a spell 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.239
 it's not at least 5 like that does not make that 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.109
 half of that cancels so that's 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:09.120
 really a good thing too 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:14.340
 it's really we have I think possibility 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:16.669
 to see the enemy army wait for us 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.669
 see this 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.260
 the army and a half that is to say maybe 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 what awaits her as a troop wait i 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.080
 go find out in hd maybe go this 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.130
 who remains as trouble in his castle 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.870
 in these stuff 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.919
 I do not want to attack gold I can 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.290
 attack the uimm but hey it's okay 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:37.530
 we will see a guy who will come playing 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.480
 still not bad a small hdv 9 for 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.530
 see if we can see his his troops 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.970
 because he marks we can see what he 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.010
 there are surely in military camps if 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.480
 I understand and we will see that in 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.020
 right now so the trophies upap 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.710
 this initials came looking for a hdv 9 lo 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.370
 I could take towards the resources 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.350
 but i 'll do that later go hdv 9th 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.210
 db9 houba all that bangs then i'm going 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.030
 to attack because there I can not 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.820
 let's miss that 230 miles of 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:06.389
 every game we'll see if we see 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:11.630
 something or not I do not care about 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:11.630
 succeed on this one then we're going to leave 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.690
 200,000 so pretty is what we can see 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.539
 his army but I 'll sometimes I'll 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.640
 frankly informs because 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:25.830
 apparently it's not that and I'm 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.850
 informs to know what it is then 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.990
 now we're going to watch another one 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:32.610
 times opportunity improvement videos 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.560
 possibility to see the enemy army 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.780
 time will stay officiated on the videos of 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.169
 your live here's that's it for the 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.880
 GDC 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:42.150
 but I think he speaks high level 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.410
 videos i think there is talking about jdc this 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.360
 that there is still no hdc 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.700
 after having to do what I want 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.330
 find or law I am because I have 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.830
 there but I'm happy look at that 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.120
 that's when I told you to have 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.200
 gold and easily elixir a language 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.250
 which is called this idea that is going to be 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.780
 quite disgusted when he looked at this 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.590
 video 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:05.070
 hey it's okay that's how a 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:07.050
 day my castle here 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.890
 it's true it's really cool there I 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:13.470
 I will not complain about what I give 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:14.460
 to see if I calculate I had to take no 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.130
 badly still time to the elixir in 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.630
 this video 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.860
 another 200 miles to see forming the 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.440
 troops and we still try to 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.360
 watch do I show you between 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.500
 others it's okay I do not know 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.960
 because there is nothing unfair high 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.890
 hurry no I'll try to tell you that 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.290
 in a future video 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:35.780
 then we 'll still check details that 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.780
 stay we went around 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.760
 changing the ratio 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.900
 you can improve your ranks by the 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.220
 level 6 higher with gold 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.230
 elections and rich and a row of 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.780
 rampart at once at ok that's hop and we 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:49.230
 improves for we are he has 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:51.090
 really well done I find that everything 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.560
 it just allows us to improve 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.150
 here in fact I think they did 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.550
 that because they saw that you galley and 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:58.050
 improve their ramparts and that's normal 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.360
 since it's true that we're having trouble with our 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.970
 ramparts i agree with that a 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.810
 month I distorted and then so here 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.980
 I hope this video shows you 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.780
 remember it's not sharing it to your 

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.970
 friends who have not yet been able to try 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.140
 this swell to show your friends have 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.280
 not down this update then me I 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.380
 would you say next I would have it 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.610
 can be pretty quickly at least one 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.530
 hour after the release of the update 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.310
 so here are the outputs at 10 minutes the 

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.830
 update then I would tell you 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.420
 next bah everyone peas and no 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:24.080
 I do not copy a squeeze like me 

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.080
 said it twice already
