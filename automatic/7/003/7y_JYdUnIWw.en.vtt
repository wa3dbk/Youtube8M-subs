00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
via micro USB so that I think is pretty

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.199

nice you know just need one cord not the
actual<00:03:57.540> power<00:03:57.780> cord<00:03:58.109> and<00:03:58.230> then<00:03:58.440> also<00:03:58.620> a<00:03:58.769> USB

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
actual power cord and then also a USB

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.910 
actual power cord and then also a USB
cord<00:03:59.459> for<00:03:59.900> syncing<00:04:00.900> data<00:04:01.579> the<00:04:02.579> hdmi<00:04:03.560> c<00:04:04.560> I<00:04:04.590> guess

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920
