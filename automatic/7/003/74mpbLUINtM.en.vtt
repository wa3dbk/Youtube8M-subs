let's<00:01:11.049> open<00:01:11.350> up<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:11.590> box<00:01:11.799> now<00:01:12.159> and<00:01:12.520> let's<00:01:12.790> see

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
let's open up the box now and let's see

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.030 
let's open up the box now and let's see
what<00:01:13.210> we<00:01:13.509> have<00:01:13.540> in<00:01:13.990> there

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.760 

the<00:01:18.670> first<00:01:18.940> thing<00:01:19.180> we<00:01:19.300> get<00:01:19.480> inside<00:01:20.050> the<00:01:20.200> box<00:01:20.440> is

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
the first thing we get inside the box is

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.520 
the first thing we get inside the box is
the<00:01:21.220> instruction<00:01:21.580> manual<00:01:21.790> which<00:01:22.720> I<00:01:23.020> don't

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
the instruction manual which I don't

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.560 
the instruction manual which I don't
think<00:01:23.890> will<00:01:24.010> be<00:01:24.130> useful<00:01:24.160> as<00:01:24.700> this<00:01:25.030> is<00:01:25.180> just<00:01:25.420> a

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
think will be useful as this is just a

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.430 
think will be useful as this is just a
crime<00:01:25.840> mount<00:01:27.060> up<00:01:28.060> next<00:01:28.600> we<00:01:28.720> have<00:01:28.750> to<00:01:28.930> come<00:01:29.290> on

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
crime mount up next we have to come on

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.560 
crime mount up next we have to come on
itself<00:01:29.770> and<00:01:30.070> i<00:01:30.490> must<00:01:30.670> say<00:01:30.760> that<00:01:30.850> it<00:01:31.060> feels<00:01:31.330> a

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
itself and i must say that it feels a

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.200 
itself and i must say that it feels a
bit<00:01:31.720> heavy<00:01:32.440> for<00:01:32.620> car<00:01:33.070> mount<00:01:33.280> since<00:01:33.880> it's<00:01:34.030> made

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
bit heavy for car mount since it's made

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.890 
bit heavy for car mount since it's made
out<00:01:34.390> of<00:01:34.420> metal<00:01:34.720> and<00:01:35.020> a<00:01:35.170> plastic<00:01:36.180> up<00:01:37.180> next<00:01:37.780> we

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
out of metal and a plastic up next we

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.050 
out of metal and a plastic up next we
have<00:01:37.930> two<00:01:38.830> metal<00:01:39.100> rings<00:01:39.460> which<00:01:39.640> are<00:01:39.670> the

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
have two metal rings which are the

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.150 
have two metal rings which are the
neodymium<00:01:40.270> magnets<00:01:42.870> we<00:01:43.870> also<00:01:44.020> have<00:01:44.440> two<00:01:44.800> extra

smallest common out there I mean like

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.910 
smallest common out there I mean like
why<00:01:57.400> not<00:01:57.570> literally<00:01:58.570> this<00:01:58.869> is<00:01:58.930> small<00:01:59.350> as<00:01:59.680> you

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
why not literally this is small as you

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.190 
why not literally this is small as you
can<00:02:00.040> see<00:02:00.190> compared<00:02:00.580> to<00:02:00.729> my<00:02:00.850> hand<00:02:01.210> on<00:02:01.420> my<00:02:01.750> palm

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
can see compared to my hand on my palm

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.280 
can see compared to my hand on my palm
actually<00:02:03.210> really<00:02:04.210> is<00:02:04.300> small<00:02:04.600> it's<00:02:04.960> the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
actually really is small it's the

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.030 
actually really is small it's the
smallest<00:02:05.590> car<00:02:06.009> I've<00:02:06.040> ever<00:02:06.460> seen<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:07.300> used<00:02:08.040> so

smallest car I've ever seen and used so

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.060 
smallest car I've ever seen and used so
that<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:10.450> my<00:02:10.630> opinion<00:02:10.780> it<00:02:11.230> really<00:02:11.620> is<00:02:11.770> the

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
that in my opinion it really is the

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.560

of the adhesive from the two metal rings
actually<00:02:19.780> from<00:02:19.989> one<00:02:20.230> of<00:02:20.350> them<00:02:20.530> can<00:02:21.010> apply<00:02:21.310> it

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
actually from one of them can apply it

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.630 
actually from one of them can apply it
on<00:02:21.640> your<00:02:21.670> phone<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.650> also<00:02:23.650> recommend<00:02:24.070> that<00:02:24.459> you

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.479 
on your phone I also recommend that you
do<00:02:24.790> this<00:02:24.940> on<00:02:25.120> your<00:02:25.180> case<00:02:25.540> but<00:02:26.140> as<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:27.250> tried

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
do this on your case but as I tried

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.270 
do this on your case but as I tried
doing<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.910> on<00:02:28.120> my<00:02:28.150> case<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.900> didn't<00:02:29.830> really

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
doing it on my case it didn't really

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.090 
doing it on my case it didn't really
stick<00:02:31.150> onto<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:32.019> tried<00:02:32.560> with<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:32.830> first

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
stick onto it I tried with the first

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.890 
stick onto it I tried with the first
rank<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.730> file<00:02:34.060> with<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.209> second<00:02:34.570> one<00:02:34.690> too

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
rank and file with the second one too

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.190 
rank and file with the second one too
and<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:36.220> didn't<00:02:36.549> work<00:02:36.790> I<00:02:37.030> thrive<00:02:37.540> with<00:02:37.780> three

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
and it didn't work I thrive with three

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.770 
and it didn't work I thrive with three
different<00:02:38.410> cases<00:02:38.650> as<00:02:39.010> you<00:02:39.250> can<00:02:39.400> see<00:02:39.670> and<00:02:39.850> it

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
different cases as you can see and it

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.180 
different cases as you can see and it
didn't<00:02:41.290> get<00:02:42.040> stuck<00:02:42.580> to<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:42.880> so<00:02:43.290> I'm<00:02:44.290> kind<00:02:45.100> of

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
didn't get stuck to it so I'm kind of

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.640 
didn't get stuck to it so I'm kind of
risking<00:02:45.580> it<00:02:45.790> putting<00:02:46.600> it<00:02:46.840> on<00:02:46.989> my<00:02:47.170> phone<00:02:47.440> like

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
risking it putting it on my phone like

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.890 
risking it putting it on my phone like
that<00:02:47.950> because<00:02:48.130> it<00:02:48.280> doesn't<00:02:48.820> have<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.239> single

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
that because it doesn't have a single

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.009 
that because it doesn't have a single
scratch<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:51.090> fulfil<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.209> off<00:02:52.360> who<00:02:52.690> knows<00:02:52.840> what

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
scratch and fulfil it off who knows what

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.710 
scratch and fulfil it off who knows what
it<00:02:53.110> takes<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.769> peel<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:54.430> off<00:02:54.580> actually

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
it takes to peel it off actually

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.350 
it takes to peel it off actually
you<00:02:56.350> can<00:02:56.500> see<00:02:56.680> when<00:02:56.890> you<00:02:56.920> put<00:02:57.520> in<00:02:58.530> move<00:02:59.530> d<00:03:00.360> come

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
you can see when you put in move d come

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.570 
you can see when you put in move d come
