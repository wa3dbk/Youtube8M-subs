00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.749 
do things their own way and in fact it's
really<00:01:56.399> hard<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.750> sort<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.200> nail<00:01:58.979> down<00:01:59.310> what<00:01:59.670> an

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
really hard to sort of nail down what an

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.600 
really hard to sort of nail down what an
Aquarius<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.509> because<00:02:01.110> there's<00:02:01.979> such<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.310> broad

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
Aquarius is because there's such a broad

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
range of what the possibilities are just

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.850 
range of what the possibilities are just
the<00:02:05.369> one<00:02:05.670> common<00:02:06.299> denominator<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:07.020> none<00:02:07.829> of

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
the one common denominator is none of

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.949 
the one common denominator is none of
them<00:02:08.160> are<00:02:08.280> normal

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
them are normal

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.429 
them are normal
we<00:02:09.590> all<00:02:09.799> have<00:02:10.129> a<00:02:10.579> part<00:02:11.359> to<00:02:11.659> them<00:02:11.840> that's<00:02:12.049> quite
