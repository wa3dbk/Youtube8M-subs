00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
don't like doses because they're really

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.710 
don't like doses because they're really
annoying<00:02:27.450> rapid<00:02:27.930> spin<00:02:28.410> blockers<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.720> i'm

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
annoying rapid spin blockers and i'm

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.840 
annoying rapid spin blockers and i'm
planning<00:02:31.020> to<00:02:31.050> use<00:02:31.200> rotem<00:02:31.560> format<00:02:32.190> someday<00:02:32.580> but

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
planning to use rotem format someday but

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.160 
planning to use rotem format someday but
um<00:02:33.090> uh<00:02:34.010> when<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.100> comes<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.430> like<00:02:35.580> 4th<00:02:36.000> gen<00:02:36.420> you

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
um uh when it comes to like 4th gen you

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.540 
um uh when it comes to like 4th gen you
can't<00:02:37.440> really<00:02:37.710> use<00:02:37.830> one<00:02:37.860> from<00:02:38.250> us<00:02:38.400> while

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
can't really use one from us while

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.790 
can't really use one from us while
hacking<00:02:38.850> your<00:02:39.450> DS<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.260> all<00:02:40.350> that<00:02:40.470> stuff<00:02:40.620> so

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
hacking your DS and all that stuff so

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.540 
hacking your DS and all that stuff so
I'm<00:02:41.490> 5th<00:02:41.970> gen<00:02:42.240> in<00:02:42.510> 15<00:02:43.140> or<00:02:43.350> blue<00:02:43.830> or<00:02:44.100> at<00:02:44.400> least

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
I'm 5th gen in 15 or blue or at least

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.940 
I'm 5th gen in 15 or blue or at least
eventually<00:02:45.210> use<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.390> Rotom<00:02:45.780> format<00:02:46.140> so<00:02:46.740> there

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
eventually use a Rotom format so there

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.710 
eventually use a Rotom format so there
you<00:02:47.040> have<00:02:47.070> it<00:02:47.190> um<00:02:48.800> so<00:02:49.800> anyways<00:02:50.520> I<00:02:50.880> decided<00:02:51.630> to

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
you have it um so anyways I decided to

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.560 
you have it um so anyways I decided to
speed<00:02:52.020> this<00:02:52.170> up<00:02:52.380> four<00:02:52.740> times<00:02:53.010> speed<00:02:53.820> is<00:02:54.090> four

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
speed this up four times speed is four

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.470 
speed this up four times speed is four
times<00:02:54.810> speed<00:02:55.230> um<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:56.459> video<00:02:56.730> originally<00:02:57.360> is

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
times speed um the video originally is

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.300 
times speed um the video originally is
because<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.530> takes<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:58.950> long<00:02:59.490> time<00:02:59.550> trying<00:03:00.450> to

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
because it takes a long time trying to

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.100 
because it takes a long time trying to
pull<00:03:02.310> off<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.490> crowd<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:03.000> Lisa<00:03:03.300> because<00:03:03.600> Kelly

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
pull off a crowd to Lisa because Kelly

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.570 
pull off a crowd to Lisa because Kelly

right he he really underestimate or

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.009 
right he he really underestimate or
should<00:03:48.930> I<00:03:48.989> said<00:03:49.580> overestimate<00:03:50.580> the<00:03:51.090> power<00:03:51.360> the

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
should I said overestimate the power the

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
power of super effective moves because

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.030 
power of super effective moves because
just<00:03:54.660> because<00:03:54.959> it's<00:03:55.290> super<00:03:55.440> fact<00:03:55.769> it<00:03:55.860> doesn't

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
just because it's super fact it doesn't

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.979

being frozen it just it's just basically

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.850 
being frozen it just it's just basically
the<00:04:41.550> equivalent<00:04:41.669> of<00:04:42.240> sleep<00:04:42.749> without<00:04:43.499> and

the equivalent of sleep without and
without<00:04:44.460> a<00:04:44.520> limit<00:04:44.909> basically<00:04:45.449> so<00:04:45.840> you<00:04:45.900> can<00:04:46.080> be

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139
