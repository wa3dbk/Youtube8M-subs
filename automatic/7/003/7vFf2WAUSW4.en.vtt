 they are going to cut into pieces and this is 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.199
 let's put a cup of lemon juice 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:13.340
 the lemon makes the kitchen function 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.159
 addicted to this we are going to put a point 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.530
 of salt 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.980
 remember that acidity always requires 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.670
 more salt than normal 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.410
 and this I'm going to mix it a little bit 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.150
 they usually put all the 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.490
 single ingredients and leave it 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.400
 marinating I prefer to put this to 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.760
 stand for two hours so I'm going to 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.760

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.190

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.280
