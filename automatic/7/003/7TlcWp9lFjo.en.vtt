00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.730
 hello system friends sum in this 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:17.539
 chance let's see how to change the 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:21.310
 keyboard of a laptop mx and well 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.310
 we'll start at the bottom 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:37.730
 and here I'll get off the battle and we'll do 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:42.360
 the insurance that is objected on a keyboard 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:45.800
 in this case as he had from another 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.800
 the keyboard here I 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.270
 here we are 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.320
 good for greater community 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.260
 when working we recommend them 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
 vital 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.100
 good one 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.820
 besides recording live 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:21.280
 well we must remove this stage 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.280
 or cover two screws 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.009
 and that 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.369
 ok let's see the connector 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.380
 and that 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.070
 to release the keyboard the connector 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:57.750
 pressure 4 for the plan cable has two 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:01.320
 sure one here I'm going here to see what 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:05.010
 child that we are going to make is 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.500
 pull it lightly and gently with 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:12.240
 be careful not to break it 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:15.010
 once we do it we activate 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.890
 and we are the keyboard 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.819
 we have the new the new one we are going to 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.819
 accommodate first 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:28.120
 here 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.120
 we will accommodate it on the deck 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.849
 let's introduce 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.650
 stable 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.180
 I do here 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.799
 Y 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.960
 be very careful that it is 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:52.760
 perfectly aligned and in fact 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.760
 the rest 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.870
 let's press 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:04.910
 the eyes 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:08.380
 there it is today we are going to put the cover 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.380
 toni arrived 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:17.400
 and we put back the keyboard that 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.460
 just enter first diagonally and 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.680
 then under pressure 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.770
 if they do not fit correctly 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.710
 just come back 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.510
 I recommend 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.780
 to avoid having to go back up to 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:35.100
 do a test 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.020
 without a screw and without holding anything 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.660
 if it does not work properly 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:43.790
 keyboard turn off the computer and they come back 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:46.640
 to connect the important ones to maintain 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.560
 or push in the cable in 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.930
 increase among those we are placing 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.920
 well that's all in terms of what 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.510
 is the change of documented keyboard 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.500
 these keyboards are usually achieved 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:04.430
 in the guarantee centers and the 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.349
 mx equipment 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.989
 if they are good then they can be 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:12.620
 sell directly and if not then in this 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:14.000
 case is usually in these cases is 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.639
 on request 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.609
 yes and obviously they are going to take a while 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:22.280
 little time and delivered well then 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.840
 that's all in regards to the ones regarding 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.600
 what is the keyboard change of a 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.070
 laptop mx this video that we had 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.580

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.570
