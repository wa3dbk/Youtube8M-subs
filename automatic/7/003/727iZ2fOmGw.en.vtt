channel<00:01:18.939> so<00:01:19.939> let's<00:01:20.810> have<00:01:21.170> a<00:01:21.229> look<00:01:21.439> how<00:01:21.799> it

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
channel so let's have a look how it

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.840 
channel so let's have a look how it
works<00:01:22.039> I<00:01:23.020> have<00:01:24.020> here<00:01:24.320> my<00:01:24.369> transmitter<00:01:25.369> it's<00:01:25.729> a

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
works I have here my transmitter it's a

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.429 
works I have here my transmitter it's a
Futaba<00:01:26.659> for<00:01:26.990> PL<00:01:27.469> and<00:01:27.880> I<00:01:28.880> use<00:01:29.119> this<00:01:29.719> switch<00:01:30.049> here

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
Futaba for PL and I use this switch here

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.200 
Futaba for PL and I use this switch here
for<00:01:31.219> the<00:01:31.369> 4th<00:01:31.640> channel<00:01:32.149> so<00:01:32.960> I<00:01:33.229> push<00:01:33.649> and<00:01:34.210> it

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
for the 4th channel so I push and it

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.520 
for the 4th channel so I push and it
works<00:01:35.420> light<00:01:35.990> goes<00:01:36.289> on<00:01:37.390> push<00:01:38.390> again<00:01:38.750> light

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
works light goes on push again light

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.560 
works light goes on push again light
goes<00:01:39.890> up

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
goes up

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.630 
goes up
so<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.840> third<00:01:43.380> channel<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.890> use<00:01:44.070> for<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.430> gear

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
so the third channel I use for the gear

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.469 
so the third channel I use for the gear
shift<00:01:45.200> here<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.619> see<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:47.040> server<00:01:48.030> is

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
shift here you can see this server is

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.469 
shift here you can see this server is
from<00:01:48.869> for<00:01:49.170> gear<00:01:49.409> shift<00:01:49.820> nice<00:01:50.820> which<00:01:51.149> owns

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
from for gear shift nice which owns

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.310 
from for gear shift nice which owns
first<00:01:52.140> gear<00:01:52.500> second<00:01:53.399> gear<00:01:53.780> third<00:01:54.780> gear

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
first gear second gear third gear

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.980 
first gear second gear third gear
I<00:01:56.119> use<00:01:57.119> on<00:01:57.329> my<00:01:57.830> transmitter<00:01:58.830> here<00:01:59.750> this<00:02:00.750> button

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
I use on my transmitter here this button

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.429 
I use on my transmitter here this button
for<00:02:01.409> first<00:02:02.159> gear<00:02:03.049> second<00:02:04.049> gear<00:02:04.110> third<00:02:04.530> gear<00:02:06.439> so

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
for first gear second gear third gear so

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.190 
for first gear second gear third gear so
it's<00:02:07.860> very<00:02:08.039> easy<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.429> do<00:02:08.729> these<00:02:08.970> things<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.539> hope

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
it's very easy to do these things I hope

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.890 
it's very easy to do these things I hope
it<00:02:10.380> was<00:02:10.560> helpful<00:02:11.060> maybe<00:02:12.060> see<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.450> next<00:02:12.720> time
