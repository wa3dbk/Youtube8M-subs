smoother<00:00:42.370> what<00:00:43.120> was<00:00:43.300> it<00:00:49.050> what<00:00:50.050> was<00:00:50.080> the<00:00:50.200> IPS

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.480 

this<00:00:54.310> is<00:00:54.400> that<00:00:54.550> what<00:00:54.640> the<00:00:54.700> average<00:00:54.850> was<00:00:56.490> that's

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.490 
this is that what the average was that's

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.600 
this is that what the average was that's
that<00:00:58.350> electrical<00:00:59.350> stop<00:00:59.590> is<00:00:59.830> closed<00:01:00.190> now<00:01:00.580> and

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
that electrical stop is closed now and

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.220 
that electrical stop is closed now and
that<00:01:00.940> was<00:01:01.090> one<00:01:01.240> full<00:01:01.510> turn<00:01:01.720> from<00:01:01.930> where<00:01:02.080> it<00:01:02.140> was

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
that was one full turn from where it was

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.490 
that was one full turn from where it was
before<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.550> it<00:01:03.700> was<00:01:03.790> 1:21<00:01:04.630> so<00:01:04.990> it's<00:01:05.140> exactly

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
before and it was 1:21 so it's exactly

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.370 
before and it was 1:21 so it's exactly
100<00:01:05.980> rpm<00:01:06.340> turn<00:01:06.850> okay<00:01:07.330> one<00:01:07.540> turn<00:01:07.870> on<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:08.140> flat

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:15.990 
100 rpm turn okay one turn on the flat
is<00:01:08.560> 100<00:01:08.980> rpm<00:01:11.190> good<00:01:12.190> to<00:01:12.310> know<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:15.100> this<00:01:15.730> is<00:01:15.880> what

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
is 100 rpm good to know and this is what

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.130 
is 100 rpm good to know and this is what
we're<00:01:16.120> talking<00:01:16.270> about<00:01:16.450> right<00:01:16.720> here<00:01:16.990> on<00:01:17.050> the

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.140 
temps close I want to take the I might
bring<00:01:43.540> it<00:01:43.690> another<00:01:43.890> half<00:01:44.890> a<00:01:45.070> flat<00:01:45.310> right<00:01:45.970> or

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.440 

I<00:01:52.430> would<00:01:53.430> run<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.790> at<00:01:53.880> 2300<00:01:54.570> for<00:01:54.690> the<00:01:54.780> balance

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
I would run it at 2300 for the balance

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.130 
I would run it at 2300 for the balance
because<00:01:57.450> that's<00:01:57.630> where<00:01:57.780> you're<00:01:57.869> gonna<00:01:58.020> want
