00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hi all today the list and i the 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.350
 instagram tag 'is a tag conceived by 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.120
 our big sister Serena and they are already 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.120
 done and we take over now 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.800
 well we have some questions 12 about 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.840
 to be precise and we go into this in this 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.520
 video for you answer question 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.460
 number 1 what is your instagram 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.380
 username and why 3 years 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.170
 well my instagram slow is just 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.980
 garden or bomb under me so hot for me 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.660
 thought of 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.020
 yes with me that is also true there is one 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.880
 linked how many photos you post on average 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.610
 a little depends on me 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.020
 usually something of one or two a day out 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.430
 light up when people have a whole 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.660
 nice things to wait with but a lot 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.309
 more photo's 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.020
 yes I have that sometimes I leave it 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.700
 I sometimes sinned him nothing 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.579
 but generally choose to place 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.559
 3 3 to 4 photos in one day to the 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.300
 next question is let your favorite 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.680
 see instagram photos 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.149
 Well I am here alone when used 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.829
 are very many favorites that I have 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.539
 but I can do it very slowly 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.559
 happy mean score by scrolling for free 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.030
 are going to win 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.710
 so I have the first best 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.590
 unpacked and that's this one 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.659
 this is me with such luminous glasses 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.700
 to the wash during the MTV 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.130
 just a great experience guess that 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.290
 have experienced in our own country 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.689
 and was just a really nice evening 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.340
 then my favorite photos one of them 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.930
 already almost a year ago it is one 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.090
 picture of mine there is in some atmosphere 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.470
 affect how it had just arrived 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.450
 it's just a very nice vacation 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.000
 which we rode together with our big sister 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.619
 have made and work still have a whole 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.520
 nice memory I just find one 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.030
 very cool photo where both stand up in the 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.890
 length with a little depth behind it 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.409
 nice sunshine was a wonderful time 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.390
 also my favorite song 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.259
 four shows your instagram false with the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.320
 most likes 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.909
 well for me this photo is black 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.759
 white legs that I like the people 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.000
 SLR camera take a photo for 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.829
 Ipads and this one threw my photos 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.360
 or picture of mine there is something in which 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.729
 let us pose in the woods 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.860
 it is my photos duel made from 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.460
 article on our blog that quite a lot 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.399
 I hear money pictures so I guess 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.770
 also received a lot of luster from the 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.810
 question is which apps do you use in 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.370
 combination with instagram 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.959
 well i'm really instagram addicted 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.430
 I wanted even more fun to really be the nicest 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.870
 to post photos online I use 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.700
 the best apps for that 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.530
 I will once read on which I 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.940
 mainly use it more but 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.440
 these are the apps that i like the most 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:32.680
 use more pictures and photo grads 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.420
 up rent knife 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.930
 well and i actually use it mainly 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.630
 of a british and otherwise photos person 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.130
 grabber to make a square that it 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.420
 or human also use but 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.010
 I don't have enough memory for my 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.330
 phone this moment to be at all 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.280
 download from 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.709
 so a really nice one for now 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.560
 milk particles with my photo grab 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.090
 number 6 which bib is you follow now 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.000
 I think we followed quite a lot 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.769
 anyway the kardashians are all the 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.660
 deceived geese then make kylie and 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:06.220
 kendall and shrink and lord is me and 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.080
 chloe and I also add kourtney 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.019
 Kardashians, by the way 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:15.579
 and furthermore I add even more ra 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:17.500
 naturally share that model and skrillex 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.390
 very bad 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.980
 I also follow those for kitchen I 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.720
 feel way of training for kitchen yes 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.850
 actually is not too bad how much store 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.450
 duty of oh anyway and ladies of course 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.130
 those for coca don't follow it further 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.019
 are just fashion bloggers 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.430
 so I don't know if I really want to succeed 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.570
 so in small boats for us people 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.690
 I think so neurotic 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.850
 yes that was already a little 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.799
 well the next question is which instagram 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.959
 filter you use the most 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.420
 and for me that amaro that is the 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.700
 second from the left 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.700
 and for me it's that I jumped 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.130
 or hello fact number 8 which hashtags 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.690
 use you the most 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.359
 well for me i use i think this is 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.220
 cupcakes it right and just paint ink 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:06.250
 very nice to really have the stupidest high stakes 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.989
 to be rescuers really just what 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.430
 people on the street or that is way too long 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.440
 but that's really just a joke 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.320
 Well the next question is and leave 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.739
 see last outreach video 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:21.280

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.090
