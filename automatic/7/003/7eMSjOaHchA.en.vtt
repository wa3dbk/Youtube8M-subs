I thought today we would look at the

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.560 
I thought today we would look at the
sulfur<00:00:12.809> dioxide<00:00:13.349> machine<00:00:13.769> from<00:00:14.009> Hannah<00:00:14.570> the

sulfur dioxide machine from Hannah the
age<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:17.190> 4<00:00:17.760> 100<00:00:18.660> sulfur<00:00:19.050> dioxide<00:00:19.529> machine<00:00:19.890> I

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
age I a 4 100 sulfur dioxide machine I

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.670 
age I a 4 100 sulfur dioxide machine I
got<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.730> use<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.060> yesterday<00:00:21.439> because<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.590> was

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
got to use this yesterday because it was

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.820 
got to use this yesterday because it was
time<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.890> UM<00:00:23.960> to<00:00:24.960> add<00:00:25.080> some<00:00:25.260> sulfur<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.710> my

wines<00:00:26.099> i<00:00:26.340> found<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.640> machine<00:00:26.939> quite<00:00:27.869> easy<00:00:28.050> to

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
wines i found the machine quite easy to

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.209 
wines i found the machine quite easy to
use<00:00:28.470> i'll<00:00:28.830> give<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.519> quick<00:00:30.359> demo<00:00:31.219> basically

use i'll give you a quick demo basically
it<00:00:32.520> has<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:33.510> try<00:00:34.260> trader<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.309> use

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
it has a try trader that that you use

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.770 
it has a try trader that that you use
right<00:00:35.850> here<00:00:36.620> there's<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.980> reagent<00:00:38.640> right<00:00:39.450> here

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
right here there's a reagent right here

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.410 
right here there's a reagent right here
there's<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.890> stabilizer<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.239> little

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
there's a stabilizer and it's a little

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.950 
there's a stabilizer and it's a little
package<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.290> see<00:00:43.530> here<00:00:44.000> and<00:00:45.000> use<00:00:45.840> all

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
package that you see here and use all

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.750 
package that you see here and use all
this<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.289> conjunction<00:00:46.500> with<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.129> wine<00:00:47.309> so

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
this in conjunction with the wine so

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.850 
this in conjunction with the wine so
doing<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.510> test<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.870> quite<00:00:49.110> easy<00:00:49.140> i<00:00:49.440> already

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
doing a test is quite easy i already

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.029 
doing a test is quite easy i already
have<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> wine<00:00:50.309> sample<00:00:50.879> here<00:00:51.440> so<00:00:52.440> we<00:00:52.770> take<00:00:53.010> a

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
have a wine sample here so we take a

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.930 
have a wine sample here so we take a
little<00:00:53.370> beaker<00:00:54.210> here<00:00:55.340> and<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:56.489> are<00:00:56.610> going<00:00:56.789> to

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
little beaker here and we are going to

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.810 
little beaker here and we are going to
fill<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.800> to<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.829> 50<00:00:59.489> millimeter<00:00:59.910> mark<00:01:01.820> i'm

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
fill it to the 50 millimeter mark i'm

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.800 
fill it to the 50 millimeter mark i'm
only<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.149> camera<00:01:03.570> while<00:01:03.750> i<00:01:03.780> do<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:06.600> I'm

it's beautiful okay so now we take our

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.860 
it's beautiful okay so now we take our
reagent<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:33.900> we<00:02:34.020> drop<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.380> in<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:36.690> has<00:02:36.840> a

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
reagent and we drop it in that has a

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.750 
reagent and we drop it in that has a
little<00:02:37.020> chemical<00:02:37.440> reaction<00:02:38.070> thing<00:02:38.340> going<00:02:38.610> on

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
little chemical reaction thing going on

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.080 
little chemical reaction thing going on
okay<00:02:41.060> excellent<00:02:42.170> all<00:02:43.170> right<00:02:43.320> we'll<00:02:43.440> put

okay excellent all right we'll put

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.540 
okay excellent all right we'll put
sample<00:02:45.090> in<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.180> machine<00:02:45.950> we<00:02:46.950> drop<00:02:47.220> in<00:02:47.430> a

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
sample in the machine we drop in a

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:57.110 
sample in the machine we drop in a
little<00:02:48.470> stir<00:02:49.470> bar<00:02:49.650> give<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.700> quick<00:02:55.820> get<00:02:56.820> into

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
little stir bar give it a quick get into

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.170 
little stir bar give it a quick get into

have<00:03:16.320> had<00:03:16.470> my<00:03:16.730> my<00:03:17.730> probe<00:03:18.090> already<00:03:18.510> out<00:03:18.720> here

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
have had my my probe already out here

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.650 
have had my my probe already out here
and<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.380> don't<00:03:19.880> know<00:03:20.880> i'm<00:03:21.000> working<00:03:21.360> with<00:03:21.390> one

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.070 
hand so that's not going to be easy so
let<00:03:23.430> me<00:03:23.519> i<00:03:23.970> have<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:24.900> clean<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.350> SPRO<00:03:26.959> I'll<00:03:27.959> be

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
let me i have to clean the SPRO I'll be

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:52.580 
let me i have to clean the SPRO I'll be
right<00:03:28.260> back<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.650> you

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.970 

yeah<00:03:53.590> they're<00:03:58.020> okay<00:03:59.020> then<00:03:59.410> we're<00:03:59.560> back<00:03:59.800> from

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
yeah they're okay then we're back from

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.370 
yeah they're okay then we're back from
that<00:04:00.220> silliness<00:04:00.580> I'm<00:04:01.540> have<00:04:02.050> to<00:04:02.110> clean<00:04:02.200> that

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
that silliness I'm have to clean that

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.940 
that silliness I'm have to clean that
probe<00:04:02.830> so<00:04:03.640> we<00:04:03.760> can<00:04:03.880> start<00:04:04.090> our<00:04:04.270> probe<00:04:04.770> into<00:04:05.770> the

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
probe so we can start our probe into the

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:15.150 
probe so we can start our probe into the
machine<00:04:06.340> here<00:04:08.070> and<00:04:10.530> give<00:04:11.530> our<00:04:11.830> dowser<00:04:12.370> in<00:04:14.160> and

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
machine here and give our dowser in and

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:38.480 
machine here and give our dowser in and
we<00:04:15.520> hit<00:04:15.730> start

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:48.540 

right<00:04:39.060> there

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.940 

if<00:04:49.210> you<00:04:49.630> guys<00:04:49.870> in<00:04:50.170> who<00:04:50.410> you<00:04:50.440> are<00:04:50.680> and<00:04:51.520> we've<00:04:52.090> got

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
if you guys in who you are and we've got

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.000 
if you guys in who you are and we've got
18<00:04:53.950> parts<00:04:54.460> per<00:04:55.090> million<00:04:55.300> in<00:04:56.140> this<00:04:56.380> sample<00:04:56.650> so

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
18 parts per million in this sample so

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.000 
18 parts per million in this sample so
not<00:04:57.250> quite<00:04:57.430> what<00:04:58.390> I<00:04:58.420> was<00:04:58.480> hoping<00:04:58.720> to<00:04:58.990> get<00:04:59.140> but<00:04:59.980> I

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
not quite what I was hoping to get but I

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.530 
not quite what I was hoping to get but I
was<00:05:00.160> very<00:05:00.310> conservative<00:05:00.910> with<00:05:01.030> what<00:05:01.150> I<00:05:01.180> put<00:05:01.420> in

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
was very conservative with what I put in

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.480 
was very conservative with what I put in
because<00:05:01.690> I<00:05:01.900> didn't<00:05:02.560> want<00:05:02.590> to<00:05:02.770> go<00:05:02.890> over<00:05:03.360> so<00:05:04.360> um

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
because I didn't want to go over so um

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.470 
because I didn't want to go over so um
you<00:05:06.490> know<00:05:06.610> that<00:05:06.640> means<00:05:06.790> i'll<00:05:07.000> be<00:05:07.120> adding<00:05:07.300> some

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
you know that means i'll be adding some

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.620 
you know that means i'll be adding some
more<00:05:08.070> but<00:05:09.070> that<00:05:09.670> was<00:05:09.790> it<00:05:09.940> that's<00:05:10.270> all<00:05:10.390> the<00:05:10.480> West

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
more but that was it that's all the West

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.850 
more but that was it that's all the West
to<00:05:10.720> it<00:05:10.810> I<00:05:10.930> mean<00:05:11.080> there's<00:05:11.230> really<00:05:11.380> nothing<00:05:11.830> that

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
to it I mean there's really nothing that

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.700 
to it I mean there's really nothing that
if<00:05:12.490> it<00:05:12.670> wasn't<00:05:12.880> because<00:05:12.970> I<00:05:13.150> have<00:05:13.300> to<00:05:13.510> hold<00:05:13.720> the

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
if it wasn't because I have to hold the

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.110 
if it wasn't because I have to hold the
camera<00:05:14.920> with<00:05:15.130> one<00:05:15.280> hand<00:05:15.490> it's<00:05:15.700> tested<00:05:16.000> and

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
camera with one hand it's tested and

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.440 
camera with one hand it's tested and
then<00:05:16.240> a<00:05:16.270> long<00:05:16.510> long<00:05:16.690> time<00:05:16.870> ago<00:05:17.010> so<00:05:18.090> you<00:05:19.090> know<00:05:19.180> it

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
then a long long time ago so you know it

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.760 
then a long long time ago so you know it
looks<00:05:19.630> like<00:05:19.690> I'm<00:05:19.810> gonna<00:05:19.930> have<00:05:20.020> to<00:05:20.170> put<00:05:20.560> another

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
looks like I'm gonna have to put another

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.600 
looks like I'm gonna have to put another
18<00:05:21.250> parts<00:05:21.520> or<00:05:21.640> so<00:05:22.050> in<00:05:23.050> there<00:05:23.970> easy<00:05:24.970> to<00:05:25.120> do<00:05:25.560> and

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
18 parts or so in there easy to do and

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.690 
18 parts or so in there easy to do and
then<00:05:27.610> run<00:05:27.790> my<00:05:27.910> tests<00:05:28.270> again<00:05:28.420> another<00:05:28.600> 24<00:05:29.020> hours

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
then run my tests again another 24 hours

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.010 
then run my tests again another 24 hours
so<00:05:30.700> it's<00:05:30.850> a<00:05:30.910> nice<00:05:31.000> machine<00:05:31.210> if<00:05:31.720> you<00:05:31.750> can<00:05:31.930> afford

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
so it's a nice machine if you can afford

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.530 
so it's a nice machine if you can afford
it<00:05:32.290> boy<00:05:32.950> it<00:05:33.010> sure<00:05:33.130> is<00:05:33.550> nice<00:05:33.700> because<00:05:34.360> you're

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
not guessing it what to do with the SLT

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.520 
not guessing it what to do with the SLT
measurements<00:05:37.110> that's<00:05:38.110> it<00:05:38.230> for<00:05:38.260> now<00:05:38.520> Cheers
