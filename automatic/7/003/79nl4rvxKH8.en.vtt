SMG you could even run oh what the

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.340 
SMG you could even run oh what the
hemlock<00:01:05.269> or<00:01:05.420> maybe<00:01:05.570> even<00:01:05.660> the<00:01:05.900> carmine<00:01:06.260> the

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
primary weapon isn't really important I

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.390 
primary weapon isn't really important I
just<00:01:08.960> found<00:01:09.050> that<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:09.320> car<00:01:09.470> SMG<00:01:09.920> does<00:01:10.220> what

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
just found that the car SMG does what

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.160 
just found that the car SMG does what
what<00:01:10.730> I<00:01:10.760> wanted<00:01:11.120> to<00:01:11.180> do<00:01:11.360> at<00:01:11.510> close<00:01:11.689> range<00:01:11.990> and

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
what I wanted to do at close range and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.719 
what I wanted to do at close range and
even<00:01:12.320> a<00:01:12.380> medium<00:01:12.680> range<00:01:12.890> and<00:01:13.130> it<00:01:13.369> does<00:01:13.460> it<00:01:13.549> very

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
even a medium range and it does it very

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.460 
even a medium range and it does it very
well<00:01:13.790> it<00:01:13.970> has<00:01:14.090> a<00:01:14.119> lot<00:01:14.450> of<00:01:14.479> stopping<00:01:14.960> power<00:01:15.079> with

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
well it has a lot of stopping power with

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.600 
well it has a lot of stopping power with
that<00:01:15.500> counterweight<00:01:16.100> it's<00:01:16.220> can<00:01:16.310> allow<00:01:16.430> you<00:01:16.490> to

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
that counterweight it's can allow you to

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.819 
that counterweight it's can allow you to
hipfire<00:01:16.939> very<00:01:17.240> effectively<00:01:17.689> making<00:01:18.350> a<00:01:18.500> really

dot system again I am running iron
sights<00:01:28.040> on<00:01:28.189> this<00:01:28.310> you<00:01:28.520> can<00:01:28.670> run<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:28.909> red<00:01:29.030> dot

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
sights on this you can run the red dot

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.639 
sights on this you can run the red dot
if<00:01:29.270> you<00:01:29.329> want<00:01:29.509> to<00:01:29.659> early<00:01:30.020> on<00:01:30.140> of<00:01:30.259> course<00:01:30.290> you'll

if you want to early on of course you'll

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:31.780 
if you want to early on of course you'll
be<00:01:30.770> running<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.100> iron<00:01:31.280> sights<00:01:31.460> because

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
be running the iron sights because

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.069 
be running the iron sights because
you'll<00:01:31.939> have<00:01:31.970> to<00:01:32.090> unlock<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.600> red<00:01:32.720> dot<00:01:32.930> so

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
you'll have to unlock the red dot so

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:34.870 
you'll have to unlock the red dot so
either<00:01:33.259> way<00:01:33.439> the<00:01:33.890> primary<00:01:34.280> in<00:01:34.369> this<00:01:34.490> class<00:01:34.700> is

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
either way the primary in this class is

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.270 
either way the primary in this class is
pretty<00:01:35.360> much<00:01:35.509> interchangeable<00:01:35.829> but<00:01:36.829> again<00:01:36.920> I

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
pretty much interchangeable but again I

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.069 
pretty much interchangeable but again I
think<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.790> car<00:01:37.969> really<00:01:38.240> fits<00:01:38.630> what<00:01:38.960> you're

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
think the car really fits what you're

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:40.630 
think the car really fits what you're
going<00:01:39.200> to<00:01:39.259> be<00:01:39.350> doing<00:01:39.469> with<00:01:39.770> this<00:01:39.950> class<00:01:40.280> once

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
going to be doing with this class once

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.679 
going to be doing with this class once
we<00:01:40.790> a<00:01:40.820> little<00:01:40.880> bit<00:01:41.060> further<00:01:41.180> than<00:01:41.299> the<00:01:41.450> build

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
we a little bit further than the build

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.090 
we a little bit further than the build
so<00:01:42.200> moving<00:01:42.409> on<00:01:42.500> we<00:01:42.619> can<00:01:42.740> take<00:01:42.829> a<00:01:42.860> look<00:01:42.950> at<00:01:43.070> our

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
so moving on we can take a look at our

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.770 
so moving on we can take a look at our
anti<00:01:43.460> Titan<00:01:43.850> weapon<00:01:44.090> we<00:01:44.180> have<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.509> mag

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
anti Titan weapon we have the mag

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.929 
anti Titan weapon we have the mag
launcher<00:01:44.990> which<00:01:45.320> fires<00:01:45.590> magnetic<00:01:46.189> Renee's<00:01:46.430> it

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
launcher which fires magnetic Renee's it

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.179 
launcher which fires magnetic Renee's it
fires<00:01:47.149> five<00:01:47.479> rounds<00:01:48.020> I<00:01:48.170> find<00:01:48.680> that<00:01:48.770> this<00:01:49.009> is<00:01:49.159> a

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
fires five rounds I find that this is a

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:50.950 
fires five rounds I find that this is a
lot<00:01:49.490> better<00:01:49.640> for<00:01:49.880> doing<00:01:50.149> quick<00:01:50.450> damage<00:01:50.659> and

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
lot better for doing quick damage and

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.810 
lot better for doing quick damage and
getting<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.229> hell<00:01:51.530> out<00:01:51.680> of<00:01:51.710> Dodge<00:01:52.009> this<00:01:52.700> is

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
getting the hell out of Dodge this is

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.249 
getting the hell out of Dodge this is
really<00:01:52.939> a<00:01:53.030> class<00:01:53.270> that's<00:01:53.450> about<00:01:53.689> engaging<00:01:53.990> the

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
really a class that's about engaging the

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.770 
really a class that's about engaging the
Titans<00:01:54.680> at<00:01:54.890> a<00:01:54.950> very<00:01:55.460> close<00:01:55.759> distance<00:01:56.270> it<00:01:56.689> was

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
Titans at a very close distance it was

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.029 
Titans at a very close distance it was
something<00:01:57.049> like<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.289> Sidewinder<00:01:57.799> that<00:01:57.920> has

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
something like the Sidewinder that has

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:59.410 
something like the Sidewinder that has
30<00:01:58.340> rounds<00:01:58.700> that<00:01:58.789> you<00:01:58.880> have<00:01:59.000> to<00:01:59.090> dump<00:01:59.299> out

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
30 rounds that you have to dump out

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.639 
30 rounds that you have to dump out
before<00:01:59.719> you<00:01:59.780> can<00:01:59.899> really<00:01:59.990> do<00:02:00.200> any<00:02:00.350> amount<00:02:00.590> of

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
before you can really do any amount of

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:01.959 
before you can really do any amount of
damage<00:02:00.979> you're<00:02:01.340> going<00:02:01.460> to<00:02:01.520> be<00:02:01.579> exposed<00:02:01.820> for

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
really use it as a booster class to get

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.009 
really use it as a booster class to get
to<00:03:15.799> your<00:03:15.860> Titan<00:03:16.220> even<00:03:16.760> quicker<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.720> satchel

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
to your Titan even quicker the satchel

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.720 
to your Titan even quicker the satchel
charges<00:03:18.230> are<00:03:18.440> really<00:03:18.769> great<00:03:19.010> for<00:03:19.220> taking<00:03:19.519> out

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730

those on ground in the center of a group
of<00:03:23.060> grunts<00:03:23.329> you're<00:03:23.420> probably<00:03:23.569> going<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:23.810> get

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900

down your Titan time and allow you to

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.210 
down your Titan time and allow you to
call<00:03:34.819> it<00:03:34.940> an<00:03:35.150> even<00:03:35.480> quicker<00:03:36.079> let's<00:03:36.980> go<00:03:37.069> ahead

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
call it an even quicker let's go ahead

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.500 
call it an even quicker let's go ahead
and<00:03:37.340> take<00:03:37.430> a<00:03:37.489> look<00:03:37.639> at<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:37.850> second<00:03:38.209> half<00:03:38.239> of

00:04:49.549 --> 00:04:49.559 
electricity again the fact that exams

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:50.989 
electricity again the fact that exams
across<00:04:49.919> multiple<00:04:50.189> targets<00:04:50.729> is<00:04:50.819> going<00:04:50.939> to

00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:50.999 
across multiple targets is going to

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:52.279 
across multiple targets is going to
allow<00:04:51.089> you<00:04:51.149> to<00:04:51.209> take<00:04:51.419> down<00:04:51.569> specters<00:04:52.079> and

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
allow you to take down specters and

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.109 
allow you to take down specters and
grunts<00:04:52.589> very<00:04:52.769> quickly<00:04:53.039> you<00:04:53.519> can<00:04:53.639> also<00:04:53.789> take

00:04:54.109 --> 00:04:54.119 
grunts very quickly you can also take

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:56.359 
grunts very quickly you can also take
down<00:04:54.269> multiple<00:04:54.839> pilots<00:04:55.469> if<00:04:55.949> you<00:04:56.069> happen<00:04:56.279> to

00:04:56.359 --> 00:04:56.369 
down multiple pilots if you happen to

00:04:56.369 --> 00:04:57.679 
down multiple pilots if you happen to
find<00:04:56.489> two<00:04:56.699> of<00:04:56.849> them<00:04:56.999> running<00:04:57.209> a<00:04:57.329> little<00:04:57.509> bit

00:04:57.679 --> 00:04:57.689 
find two of them running a little bit

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:59.689 
find two of them running a little bit
too<00:04:57.869> close<00:04:58.169> to<00:04:58.229> each<00:04:58.469> other<00:04:58.679> on<00:04:58.949> the<00:04:59.309> defensive

too close to each other on the defensive
side<00:04:59.849> of<00:04:59.909> things<00:05:00.089> are<00:05:00.269> going<00:05:00.389> to<00:05:00.569> using<00:05:00.809> the

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:01.019 
side of things are going to using the

00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:02.989 
side of things are going to using the
electric<00:05:01.469> smoke<00:05:01.739> system<00:05:02.129> I<00:05:02.279> find<00:05:02.819> that<00:05:02.939> this

00:05:02.989 --> 00:05:02.999 
electric smoke system I find that this

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:04.399 
electric smoke system I find that this
is<00:05:03.179> a<00:05:03.209> great<00:05:03.419> tool<00:05:03.629> for<00:05:03.689> something<00:05:04.169> like<00:05:04.259> the

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:04.409 
is a great tool for something like the

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:05.839 
is a great tool for something like the
ogre<00:05:04.649> that<00:05:04.829> doesn't<00:05:05.099> actually<00:05:05.219> have<00:05:05.579> that

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
ogre that doesn't actually have that

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:08.749 
ogre that doesn't actually have that
much<00:05:06.059> speed<00:05:06.509> or<00:05:06.989> dodge<00:05:07.319> capability<00:05:08.069> you<00:05:08.610> can

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 
much speed or dodge capability you can

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:10.100 
much speed or dodge capability you can
really<00:05:08.909> kind<00:05:09.059> of<00:05:09.149> take<00:05:09.329> the<00:05:09.449> offensive<00:05:09.779> with

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
really kind of take the offensive with

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.069 
cover on them on the ordinance signs of
things<00:05:29.909> we're<00:05:30.089> using<00:05:30.209> the<00:05:30.389> multi-target

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:31.079 
things we're using the multi-target

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:33.439 
things we're using the multi-target
missile<00:05:31.559> system<00:05:31.860> this<00:05:32.369> again<00:05:32.729> adds<00:05:32.969> that

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449 
missile system this again adds that

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:35.179 
missile system this again adds that
whole<00:05:33.749> sort<00:05:34.110> of<00:05:34.199> mind<00:05:34.439> games<00:05:34.679> factor<00:05:35.099> the

whole sort of mind games factor the
great<00:05:35.309> thing<00:05:35.459> about<00:05:35.489> the<00:05:35.879> multi-target

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719 
great thing about the multi-target

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:37.879 
great thing about the multi-target
missile<00:05:37.139> system<00:05:37.439> is<00:05:37.559> that<00:05:37.649> you<00:05:37.739> can<00:05:37.860> actually

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
missile system is that you can actually

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.100 
missile system is that you can actually
paint<00:05:38.339> a<00:05:38.610> certain<00:05:39.239> number<00:05:39.360> of<00:05:39.539> missiles<00:05:39.929> on

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
be using something like the shield

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.919 
be using something like the shield
ability<00:05:44.399> you're<00:05:45.179> gonna<00:05:45.300> be<00:05:45.419> able<00:05:45.509> to<00:05:45.629> outsmart
