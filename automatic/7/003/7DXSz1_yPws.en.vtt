knocking<00:00:32.790> out<00:00:32.910> an<00:00:33.000> expansion<00:00:33.829> knocking<00:00:34.829> out

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
knocking out an expansion knocking out

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.060 
knocking out an expansion knocking out
two<00:00:35.399> expansions<00:00:35.940> actually<00:00:36.440> so<00:00:37.440> what<00:00:37.800> we<00:00:37.920> got

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
two expansions actually so what we got

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.610 
two expansions actually so what we got
left<00:00:38.280> we've<00:00:38.579> got<00:00:38.820> Protoss<00:00:39.540> on<00:00:39.719> one<00:00:39.989> very

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
left we've got Protoss on one very

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.170 
left we've got Protoss on one very
depleted<00:00:40.950> expansion<00:00:41.340> yet<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.670> second

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
depleted expansion yet a second

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.510 
depleted expansion yet a second
expansion<00:00:42.420> up<00:00:42.719> here<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.200> third<00:00:43.469> one<00:00:43.649> on<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
expansion up here and a third one on the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.700 
expansion up here and a third one on the
way<00:00:44.670> meantime<00:00:45.360> Terran<00:00:45.780> are<00:00:45.930> done<00:00:46.440> two

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
way meantime Terran are done two

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.950 
way meantime Terran are done two
expansions<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.520> things<00:00:48.210> looking<00:00:48.420> fairly<00:00:48.570> even

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
expansions so things looking fairly even

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.630 
expansions so things looking fairly even
but<00:00:49.200> flashes<00:00:49.710> every<00:00:49.800> float<00:00:50.070> flow<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.550> this

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
but flashes every float flow of this

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.369 
but flashes every float flow of this
expansion<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.690> expansion<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.260> it's

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
expansion and this expansion so it's

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.600 
expansion and this expansion so it's
going<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.559> catch<00:00:52.829> up<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.129> two<00:00:53.219> expansions

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
going to catch up and two expansions

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.880 
going to catch up and two expansions
right<00:00:53.730> here<00:00:53.989> big<00:00:54.989> number<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.410> forces<00:00:55.620> here

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
right here big number of forces here

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.650 
right here big number of forces here
ready<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.250> either<00:00:56.489> defend<00:00:56.910> these<00:00:57.149> both<00:00:57.449> these

ready to either defend these both these

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.510 
ready to either defend these both these
expansions<00:00:58.260> or<00:00:58.469> just<00:00:59.129> pushed<00:00:59.340> straight

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
expansions or just pushed straight

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.799 
expansions or just pushed straight
through<00:00:59.820> aggressively<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.420> knock<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.660> one

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
through aggressively and knock this one

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.630 
through aggressively and knock this one
out<00:01:00.870> before<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.859> guy's<00:01:02.070> an<00:01:02.219> opportunity<00:01:02.579> to

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
out before that guy's an opportunity to

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.670 
out before that guy's an opportunity to
get<00:01:02.730> up<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.969> three<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.840> will<00:01:03.960> put<00:01:04.140> flash<00:01:04.500> on

photon cannons coming down in defence

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:09.899 
photon cannons coming down in defence
but<00:01:09.009> they're<00:01:09.219> not<00:01:09.310> gonna<00:01:09.460> be<00:01:09.579> up<00:01:09.670> quick<00:01:09.880> enough

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
but they're not gonna be up quick enough

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.749 
but they're not gonna be up quick enough
these<00:01:10.329> tanks<00:01:10.859> easily<00:01:11.859> able<00:01:11.950> to<00:01:12.130> stop<00:01:12.429> us<00:01:12.579> at

these tanks easily able to stop us at
night<00:01:13.090> I<00:01:13.299> like<00:01:13.479> the<00:01:13.630> positioning<00:01:14.079> of<00:01:14.140> exact

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
night I like the positioning of exact

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.639 
night I like the positioning of exact

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:21.609 
causeway here as well and he still got

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:24.179 
causeway here as well and he still got
this<00:01:21.759> whole<00:01:22.030> ridge<00:01:22.659> there's<00:01:23.649> this<00:01:23.799> wall<00:01:24.039> of
