the<00:00:09.480> past<00:00:09.719> we've<00:00:10.110> been<00:00:10.290> getting<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:10.530> lot<00:00:10.590> of

racing the full-size cars with the RC
cars<00:00:15.089> so<00:00:16.080> we<00:00:16.619> wanted<00:00:16.859> even<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.220> playing<00:00:17.400> field

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520

a<00:00:17.760> little<00:00:17.820> bit<00:00:17.970> today<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:18.690> we're<00:00:19.050> racing<00:00:19.560> an

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
laughing what happened to the model we

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.420 
laughing what happened to the model we
had<00:02:17.560> budget<00:02:17.950> issues<00:02:18.310> sorry<00:02:18.819> huh<00:02:19.620> ready<00:02:20.620> three

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
had budget issues sorry huh ready three

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:46.520 
had budget issues sorry huh ready three
two<00:02:21.870> one

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.960 

Wow<00:02:47.530> we<00:02:47.770> just<00:02:47.920> got<00:02:48.070> done<00:02:48.280> racing<00:02:48.550> these<00:02:48.760> two

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
Wow we just got done racing these two

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.850 
Wow we just got done racing these two
cars<00:02:49.270> together<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.990> mad<00:02:50.200> speed<00:02:50.500> is<00:02:50.650> really

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
cars together the mad speed is really

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.590 
cars together the mad speed is really
quick<00:02:51.220> however<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.790> test<00:02:51.970> has<00:02:52.120> just<00:02:52.300> got<00:02:52.420> so

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
quick however the test has just got so

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.120 
quick however the test has just got so
much<00:02:52.750> torque<00:02:53.080> with<00:02:53.230> that<00:02:53.350> brushless<00:02:53.590> motor<00:02:53.920> I

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
much torque with that brushless motor I

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.980 
much torque with that brushless motor I
think<00:02:54.550> with<00:02:54.670> a<00:02:54.700> little<00:02:54.850> tuning<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.570> mad<00:02:55.750> speed

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
think with a little tuning the mad speed

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.510 
think with a little tuning the mad speed
could<00:02:56.170> definitely<00:02:56.320> take<00:02:56.740> it<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.040> want<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.460> thank

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
could definitely take it I want to thank

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.010

the<00:03:22.870> MADD<00:03:23.020> drift<00:03:23.290> is<00:03:23.440> really<00:03:23.740> fast<00:03:23.980> today<00:03:24.280> we

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
the MADD drift is really fast today we

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.310 
the MADD drift is really fast today we
raced<00:03:24.700> it<00:03:24.850> against<00:03:25.090> a<00:03:25.180> Tesla<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:25.870> it<00:03:26.170> wasn't

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
raced it against a Tesla and it wasn't

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.840 
raced it against a Tesla and it wasn't
performing<00:03:26.770> at<00:03:26.890> its<00:03:26.920> peak<00:03:27.190> we<00:03:27.580> brought<00:03:27.760> it

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
performing at its peak we brought it

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.430 
performing at its peak we brought it
back<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.120> shop<00:03:28.330> to<00:03:28.540> do<00:03:28.660> some<00:03:28.810> diagnosis

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
back to the shop to do some diagnosis

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.410 
back to the shop to do some diagnosis
and<00:03:29.920> we<00:03:30.040> realized<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.880> packs<00:03:31.120> that<00:03:31.330> we

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
and we realized that the packs that we

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.740 
and we realized that the packs that we
were<00:03:31.540> using<00:03:31.959> in<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.470> MADD<00:03:32.890> drift<00:03:33.730> were<00:03:34.120> brand

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
were using in the MADD drift were brand

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.240 
were using in the MADD drift were brand
new<00:03:34.840> packs<00:03:35.170> they<00:03:35.350> hadn't<00:03:35.590> been<00:03:35.650> broken<00:03:35.830> in<00:03:36.100> yet

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
new packs they hadn't been broken in yet

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.490 
new packs they hadn't been broken in yet
so<00:03:36.700> we<00:03:36.850> threw<00:03:37.030> in<00:03:37.180> a<00:03:37.300> couple<00:03:37.330> gems<00:03:37.810> ace<00:03:38.020> packs

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
so we threw in a couple gems ace packs

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.080 
so we threw in a couple gems ace packs
that<00:03:38.650> we've<00:03:38.770> already<00:03:38.980> used<00:03:39.100> before<00:03:39.459> and<00:03:39.940> we

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
that we've already used before and we

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.970 
that we've already used before and we
immediately<00:03:40.660> noticed<00:03:41.020> the<00:03:41.080> performance<00:03:41.560> now

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
immediately noticed the performance now

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.070 
immediately noticed the performance now
we<00:03:42.430> think<00:03:42.580> we<00:03:42.700> can<00:03:42.910> take<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.209> Tesla<00:03:43.630> so<00:03:43.930> we're

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
we think we can take the Tesla so we're

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.860 
we think we can take the Tesla so we're
looking<00:03:44.320> for<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.500> rematch
