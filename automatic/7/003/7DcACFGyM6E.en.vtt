00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.610
 we have here now a suit thickness of 10 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.710
 millimeters with the inscription wind winter 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.690
 smooth performance this option 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.710
 costume is very preferred for 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.379
 cold winters 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.140
 that is how it all works when 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.689
 low temperatures and the hunter commits 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.369
 long transitions between these transitions 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.160
 when it is on the surface 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.560
 Naturally he will be in a suit 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.830
 there is water even if it rises 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.760
 on the boat and makes trips from the place 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.590
 into place and then given water on this 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.730
 suit will just merge and 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.559
 in just a few moments 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.170
 the suit will already be dry 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.300
 that is, if we have a duggar won 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.180
 on top of the fabric that gives more 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.480
 mechanical strength here protects 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.760
 him from any gross damage it 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.039
 on such a suit with a cloth the water will be 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.750
 linger longer naturally 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.840
 travel time is longer 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.739
 weathered and select the precious 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:08.310
 warm in suits with a smooth surface 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:12.150
 this moment is taken into account and you kind 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.580
 conditional deficiency is excluded that is here 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.770
 we look at this model that is the same 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.990
 like all pinnacle costumes for 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.430
 spearfishing 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.740
 ergonomic pattern ie sleeves 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.159
 made with a certain fold the same 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.840
 our very then 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:33.829
 here we see around the waist gain 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:36.500
 cloth dubbing here we dress them 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:39.350
 and for my belt any higher 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.789
 loads this fabric and it protects against 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:47.020
 rapid wear of such vulnerable here 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:53.959
 places on trousers 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:02:01.159
 groin we see the same gain from 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:02:05.299
 tissue that is at the junction of the panel we see 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.099
 stressful circles that is, places where 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:12.190
 there will be an increased voltage given 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:16.160
 mugs they hold back the load 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.980
 the material in these places given this is its 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.910
 kind of like a tray she when we dress 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.220
 suit here we have a host where 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.819
 possible friction from this place will have 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:34.310
 we strenuously kneecaps and suprotec with 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.799
 You, too, have a weak point 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.849
 in this way according to the generally accepted 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:44.510
 hunting suits most of them 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:46.370
 of five millimeter cuffs suit 10 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.169
 millimeters cuff 5 millimeters and 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:53.450
 which we turn away doing 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:56.480
 additional roller around the waist then 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.109
 there is doing the most sealed here 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.099
 and our famous yamamoto 38 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:05.630
 that is, the material is really 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:08.470
 produced in Japan with major 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.470
 balanced characteristics 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.310
 compression neoprene pad 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.410
 which is not imposed and it is glued 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.800
 directly into the suit flush with 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.500
 the inner part of her cloth backing 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.400
 which prevents unnecessary 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:32.670
 slip while dressing out 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.670
 loading a gun 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:47.410
 Here is another version of the costume 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:49.690
 that is, it may be we consider 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.380
 that is, we are watching the version 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.959
 professional 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:57.070
 that is, its main difference is that 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.720
 on top and goes the mouse covering the mouse that is 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.750
 it's not sip neoprene 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.209
 and he kinda like a rolling mouse 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.870
 translates as a grid to 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:12.760
 clear surface like a file then 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.680
 there is what it gives it from above and such 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.049
 surface 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.479
 the manufacturer made the outer part 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.930
 several times stronger than if it 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:26.380
 there was a sleek naples this is exceptional 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:29.380
 for the mechanical strength of materials 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.840
 this costume this costume is made 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:37.510
 its main difference from the material 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:40.180
 Yamamoto 45 and that we understand it already 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:43.750
 refers to the elite segment of this 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.910
 material and thermal conductivity lower by 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:54.160
 in relation to 38 mute 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:57.880
 at 7 percent and stretch it at 41 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.820
 percent more than yamamoto mind 38 then 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:04.419
 there is not a very minor moment 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:07.180
 when we buy a fat suit and we 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:10.510
 have any say but not that 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.940
 flaws need it more accurate 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.010
 body fit and somewhere 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.680
 some places he should more 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.760
 stretch then in the 10 millimeter version 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.790
 we will immediately 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.960
 peep suit which is made and winter 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:28.230
 fashion 45 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:31.780
 you can almost say no data 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.760
 the nuances that is, he really is almost not 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.890
 there is an objective opinion of hunters 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.530
 who had experience using this 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.370
 the material of the suit is actually on the body not 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.590
 felt 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.650
 naturally as it were within reason 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:48.390
 if the person wears and the size xl wears 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.390
 he will feel it anyway 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:02.020
 on the reverse side, too, is the texture on 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.020
 fabric reinforcement 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:10.270
 efforts that he was not eager 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.919
 front cuffs to sleeves
