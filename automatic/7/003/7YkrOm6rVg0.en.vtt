the<00:03:00.569> grand<00:03:00.840> exchange<00:03:01.139> had<00:03:01.829> updated<00:03:02.129> then<00:03:02.700> I

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
the grand exchange had updated then I

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.520 
the grand exchange had updated then I
probably<00:03:03.090> would<00:03:03.329> a<00:03:03.359> flip<00:03:03.599> shit<00:03:03.900> but<00:03:04.200> right<00:03:04.379> now
