00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:11.480
 hello today we will learn 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.500
 close loops in front of us sample 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.860
 gum 1 on 1 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.650
 so that this gum remains 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.720
 elastic and extreme was strapped we 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.210
 we will close the hinges for the front wall 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.950
 knit together 2 loops for the front 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.950
 front wall 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:43.320
 remove the loop then we knit the loop 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:48.210
 again we put on the left knitting needle again two 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:56.760
 tying together for the front loop 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:01:02.640
 remove the face from the spokes and dress again 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:09.119
 on the left needle of the loop again for the front 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:12.210
 we knit the front wall and remove 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.170
 again we put on the front list with us 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:20.450
 already visible part of the loop on closed 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:27.810
 continue 2 loops together knit 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:31.439
 face and remove again put on their knitting needle 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:37.649
 this loop to the left knitting needle and again 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:42.020
 provyazyvaem two together facial such here 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.020
 way these things 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.810
 continue 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.660
 such a loop closure can us 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.160
 need if we knit for example 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.360
 blouse 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:18.510
 raglan and start to cut it for the neck 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:22.650
 then sleeves that end 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.770
 rubber band we will need to close and bottom 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:34.820
 products also we will need to close 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:34.820
 What's the loop here in this way 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:51.560
 constantly knitting 2 loops together 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.560
 facial 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:24.300
 we can see 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.290
 last two loops 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.290
 advance payments 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:07.320
 we only have one loop 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:11.570
 the key to this is the way we have 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.570
 it turns out such a closing loop 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:18.799
