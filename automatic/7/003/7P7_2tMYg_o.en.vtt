00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.769

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.490
 be well and listen to me that's fine 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.960
 very very good 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.379
 so today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.449
 little tutorial on the rise file especially 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.910
 that I will teach you how you 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.150
 can block websites 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.789
 several sites to infinity but thanks to 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.640
 this post then it's very very simple 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.439
 will take you 2 2 small minutes 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.140
 if you follow well what I'm doing there 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.420
 there is no problem then already you 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.940
 so sees your notepad you type the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.379
 notepad 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.510
 you are doing well executed like 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.860
 day administrator does not repeat it if you 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.520
 do not do this well it will not work 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:52.289
 not to avoid as illustrator yes 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:54.270
 notebook will be open that's it then I 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.579
 am on windows 8 if you are on 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.170
 windows 7 it works too it's the concern 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.980
 it's not the same way we find 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.410
 the notepad etc 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.820
 finally you'll have your notepad 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.199
 in the cade minister at her once 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.080
 to go to this file up to 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.510
 left you after you open 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.189
 go into computer you click on 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.090
 10 kolokol and on windows 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.900
 then you look for the folder 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:26.130
 system32 so the sumps the end we got it 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:30.540
 also to search for the file drivers 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.979
 tc isle to you are going to have no element 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.659
 does not match your search 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:39.439
 so for that you go to where there is 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.180
 marked file name with text file 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:45.630
 with a little trick 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.770
 a star basically for a text actually 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.479
 all the files and there you find 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.000
 your post file you click on 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.630
 host file and it will appear to you 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.500
 then it has to be apparent 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.969
 we do not care we're not going to tell you 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.659
 you do not waste your time 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:06.310
 so to go to the line after the sharp 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:09.140
 last diez and you type 127.0.0.1 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.630
 makes you a little space and you put 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.010
 the site you want to block everything 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.370
 know for all here so me by 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.950
 example I blocked then youtube have 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.910
 lifted for youtube dot com then I 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.489
 will register 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.209
 I close and there normally it's good 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.220
 but then to prove to me 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.280
 how it works marc listen I have 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.690
 took three different browsers already 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.519
 google chrome explore and safari 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.319
 but it's not the browsers if it's 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:46.519
 the search engine for example age 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:49.400
 and google france age is that in 8th 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:52.370
 age and bing and you'll see that that 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.220
 block because no the site on your 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.920
 computer it has nothing to do with them 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:01.609
 with just the ones to July one 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.079
 little hassle it does not have anything to do 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.959
 with your browsers or anything 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.590
 it's really you your computer that 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.200
 block this site 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.720
 so you're going to type fresh I'm going 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.870
 to type daddy as for his 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.340
 walk the site from youtube google type 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.130
 www.youtube.com and there you see it does not 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.359
 not want a file well we are on 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:26.769
 google then after on safari 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:31.489
 we are on blood make you type 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:34.910
 www.youtube.com and it does not work 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.440
 do not want there files too is about 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.139
 year 8 safari 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.510
 an exploit trees that will be sharp w 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:43.850
 points like he's not going to the displayed no 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.350
 more so that was it just for 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.489
 show as why it works it's going 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.049
 maybe not much but when 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.050
 even 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:53.840
 so after if you want 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.400
 if you want removed if you want 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.230
 to unblock the site is very very easy 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.570
 it's exactly the same thing suits 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.750
 to actually such film 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.040
 you show them you type notepad 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.580
 still run as an administrator 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.580
 Its very important 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:15.709
 vdans open files and actually like 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:19.860
 thaler then windows local disk 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:25.430
 then you are looking for system32 from 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:30.030
 files from our systems 32 driver's ptc 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:33.390
 there you do all the files you 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.520
 make host open there find you 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:39.360
 like bob will also notice that you have 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.850
 blocked here to block it he does not 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.140
 just just removed I'm just when 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.320
 you take away what you have better 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.320
 previously 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.670
 Here you register and you 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.110
 can leave 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.270
 so if you want to block several 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.350
 websites it's very simple you have me 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:02.310
 to mark his independence 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:06.720
 includes a site space that you 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:09.120
 want to block points like and savor 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:15.870
 actually look several times by 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:17.400
 example if I do like that against the 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.280
 here you can put several 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.670
 several times we wanted and that 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.960
 walk 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.830
 we are just registering and 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:28.800
 that's what I had to say 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.080
 I think that's all it was my all 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.430
 first video on youtube so that 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.680

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.860

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.340
 continue etc. do not hesitate to 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.400
