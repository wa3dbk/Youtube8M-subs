which have not received a whole lot of
investigation<00:02:00.200> that<00:02:00.230> I<00:02:00.380> think<00:02:00.620> you've<00:02:00.710> been

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
investigation that I think you've been

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.560 
investigation that I think you've been
happening<00:02:01.340> in<00:02:01.550> other<00:02:01.820> words<00:02:02.090> I<00:02:02.180> think<00:02:02.360> there's

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
happening in other words I think there's

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.800 
happening in other words I think there's
been<00:02:02.810> a<00:02:03.100> program<00:02:04.100> in<00:02:04.250> place<00:02:04.570> some<00:02:05.570> of<00:02:05.720> you

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
been a program in place some of you

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.360 
been a program in place some of you
familiar<00:02:06.080> with<00:02:06.410> something<00:02:06.680> called<00:02:06.770> project

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
familiar with something called project

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.410 
familiar with something called project
moondust<00:02:09.399> probably<00:02:10.399> other<00:02:10.580> programs<00:02:11.180> as<00:02:11.390> well

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
moondust probably other programs as well

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.020 
moondust probably other programs as well
they're<00:02:11.900> designed<00:02:12.320> to<00:02:12.530> achieve<00:02:13.000> what<00:02:14.000> we

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
they're designed to achieve what we

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.140 
they're designed to achieve what we
would<00:02:14.270> call<00:02:14.390> UFOs<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:15.790> sequester<00:02:16.790> them<00:02:16.940> away
