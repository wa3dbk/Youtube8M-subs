though<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.900> was<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.110> think<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.619> was<00:01:19.890> actually

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
though it was I think I was actually

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.770 
though it was I think I was actually
thinking<00:01:20.220> at<00:01:20.549> one<00:01:20.580> point<00:01:20.850> wanted<00:01:21.299> because<00:01:21.570> of

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
thinking at one point wanted because of

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.810 
thinking at one point wanted because of
a<00:01:21.869> pet<00:01:22.110> dragon<00:01:22.320> or<00:01:22.650> something<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.729> think

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
a pet dragon or something but I think

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.330 
a pet dragon or something but I think
that<00:01:24.090> might<00:01:24.240> be<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.390> bit<00:01:24.570> too<00:01:24.720> extreme<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.340> yeah

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
that might be a bit too extreme but yeah

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.740
