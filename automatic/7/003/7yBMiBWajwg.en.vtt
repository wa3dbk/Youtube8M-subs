00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
better than absolutely loving it I'm

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.199 
better than absolutely loving it I'm
actually<00:03:11.590> wearing<00:03:11.859> it<00:03:12.040> on<00:03:12.190> my<00:03:12.459> lower<00:03:12.790> lashes

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
actually wearing it on my lower lashes

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.640 
actually wearing it on my lower lashes
right<00:03:13.599> now<00:03:13.750> so<00:03:14.519> it's<00:03:15.519> really<00:03:15.579> subtle<00:03:16.060> and<00:03:16.650> you

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
right now so it's really subtle and you

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.409 
right now so it's really subtle and you
think<00:03:17.829> it's<00:03:17.950> going<00:03:18.099> to<00:03:18.220> be<00:03:18.400> super<00:03:18.639> super<00:03:18.970> blue

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:19.419 
think it's going to be super super blue

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:20.520 
think it's going to be super super blue
and<00:03:19.630> that<00:03:19.720> it's<00:03:19.900> not<00:03:20.019> going<00:03:20.139> to<00:03:20.230> be<00:03:20.319> wearable

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
and that it's not going to be wearable

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.690 
and that it's not going to be wearable
but<00:03:20.709> it's<00:03:20.859> actually<00:03:20.980> not<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:21.370> can<00:03:21.489> see<00:03:21.669> right

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
but it's actually not you can see right

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.479
