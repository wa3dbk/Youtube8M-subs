 precious in photoshop installs it 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.580
 Many people have asked me how it is 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.649

 Most of his would like to use quax 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.729

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.780

 I'll show you now it's the same 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.009

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.990
 Santos is coming today on Saturday 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.360
 just did not feel so much 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.710
 but I know this tutorial briefly 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.390
 and well, like google and needs 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:55.210
 of course photoshop is in the slave 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:55.210
 google and a search of a photoshop 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.479
 disrespectful photoshop version is depending on 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:09.110
 no matter we go to ultimate 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:10.280
 photoshop speck 5 I really can 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.770
 there nothing 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.250
 I really can not tell you there 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:19.489
 which is really good where to snowden 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.260
 I can do it myself then 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.310
 make smart and yes I say but 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.260
 one adds, I believe that now 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.580
 takes four seconds 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.819
 it should also be on what that is 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:36.140
 this does not catch viruses and yes it does 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:38.120
 Lasts like a short time now 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.349

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.800
 can already become more finished 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.380

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.870

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.580
 look at 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:53.840
