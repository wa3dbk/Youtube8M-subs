00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
ventilation here and in the summertime

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.450 
ventilation here and in the summertime
because<00:01:24.110> it<00:01:24.229> can<00:01:24.320> get<00:01:24.440> kind<00:01:24.680> of<00:01:24.830> warm<00:01:25.070> in<00:01:25.250> here

up to a peak and then directly above

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.509 
up to a peak and then directly above
here<00:02:26.660> is<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:27.110> way<00:02:27.769> you<00:02:27.860> can<00:02:28.010> see<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.280> floor

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
here is the way you can see the floor

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.360 
here is the way you can see the floor
and<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.000> joists<00:02:29.299> for<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.049> loft<00:02:30.320> I'll<00:02:30.950> be

or<00:03:04.800> three<00:03:04.920> weeks<00:03:05.100> I've<00:03:05.670> decided<00:03:06.000> not<00:03:06.300> to<00:03:06.360> do

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
or three weeks I've decided not to do

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.820 
or three weeks I've decided not to do
that<00:03:06.780> myself

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
that myself

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.160 
that myself
worried<00:03:08.460> about<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.850> leak<00:03:09.090> of<00:03:09.300> carbon

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
worried about the leak of carbon

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.570 
worried about the leak of carbon
monoxide<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.950> all<00:03:11.010> that<00:03:11.250> sort<00:03:11.490> of<00:03:11.520> stuff

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
monoxide and all that sort of stuff

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.280 
monoxide and all that sort of stuff
although<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.060> plan<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.420> have<00:03:12.720> a<00:03:12.750> carbon

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
although I plan to have a carbon

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.520 
although I plan to have a carbon
monoxide<00:03:13.320> smoke<00:03:14.100> detector<00:03:14.640> in<00:03:14.790> here<00:03:15.030> but<00:03:15.270> I

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
monoxide smoke detector in here but I

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.170 
monoxide smoke detector in here but I
still<00:03:16.530> would<00:03:16.710> like<00:03:16.740> to<00:03:16.890> have<00:03:17.100> it<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.280> chimney

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
still would like to have it the chimney

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.420 
still would like to have it the chimney
and<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.570> stove<00:03:18.840> installed<00:03:19.500> professionally<00:03:19.860> I

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
and the stove installed professionally I

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.180 
and the stove installed professionally I
think<00:03:20.550> so<00:03:21.060> that<00:03:21.990> will<00:03:22.140> be<00:03:22.260> done<00:03:22.410> as<00:03:22.650> soon<00:03:22.830> as<00:03:23.010> I

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
think so that will be done as soon as I

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.150 
think so that will be done as soon as I
get<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.670> rest<00:03:24.360> of<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.660> boards<00:03:25.290> on<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.530> wall<00:03:25.830> I

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
get the rest of the boards on the wall I

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.590 
get the rest of the boards on the wall I
went<00:03:26.880> with<00:03:27.290> wide<00:03:28.290> pine<00:03:29.040> boards<00:03:29.670> on<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.060> floor

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
went with wide pine boards on the floor

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.480 
went with wide pine boards on the floor
it<00:03:31.080> was<00:03:31.230> ashamed<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.860> paint<00:03:32.070> them<00:03:32.250> they<00:03:32.430> were

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
it was ashamed to paint them they were

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.610 
it was ashamed to paint them they were
really<00:03:33.060> beautiful<00:03:33.570> but<00:03:33.690> I<00:03:33.810> think<00:03:34.080> unpainted

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
really beautiful but I think unpainted

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.710 
really beautiful but I think unpainted
or<00:03:34.980> whatever<00:03:35.459> they<00:03:35.640> would<00:03:35.760> have<00:03:35.880> shown<00:03:36.360> much

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
or whatever they would have shown much

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.230 
or whatever they would have shown much
more<00:03:36.990> dirt<00:03:37.290> than<00:03:37.530> they're<00:03:37.680> showing<00:03:38.070> now<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.610> put
