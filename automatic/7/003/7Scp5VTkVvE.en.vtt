Australian but little switzerland and I

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.630 
Australian but little switzerland and I
thought<00:02:12.500> on<00:02:12.680> that<00:02:12.709> day<00:02:12.980> that<00:02:13.129> I'd<00:02:13.220> be<00:02:13.400> great

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
thought on that day that I'd be great

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.240 
thought on that day that I'd be great
challenge<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.209> cycle<00:02:14.630> just<00:02:14.840> one<00:02:15.230> stage<00:02:15.829> to<00:02:15.859> see

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
challenge to cycle just one stage to see

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.550 
challenge to cycle just one stage to see
if<00:02:16.340> I<00:02:16.430> could<00:02:16.489> do<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:16.819> it<00:02:17.269> was<00:02:17.389> a<00:02:17.420> long<00:02:17.660> stage<00:02:18.139> I

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
if I could do it it was a long stage I

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.620 
if I could do it it was a long stage I
very<00:02:18.769> quickly<00:02:18.889> and<00:02:19.250> letting<00:02:19.519> the<00:02:19.609> France<00:02:19.880> but

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
very quickly and letting the France but

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.210 
very quickly and letting the France but
I<00:02:20.690> was<00:02:20.810> able<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:21.049> do<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:21.350> I<00:02:21.470> thought<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:21.950> can

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
I was able to do it I thought you can

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.039 
I was able to do it I thought you can
move<00:02:22.340> one<00:02:22.519> stage<00:02:22.850> then<00:02:23.180> maybe<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:23.540> could<00:02:23.600> do<00:02:23.810> two

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
move one stage then maybe I could do two

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.590 
move one stage then maybe I could do two
or<00:02:24.170> three<00:02:24.410> so<00:02:24.769> the<00:02:25.400> next<00:02:25.549> year<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:25.819> did<00:02:26.060> three

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
or three so the next year I did three

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.390 
or three so the next year I did three
stages<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.680> year<00:02:27.799> after<00:02:27.829> that<00:02:28.040> I<00:02:28.160> thought

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
stages and the year after that I thought

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.470 
stages and the year after that I thought
like<00:02:28.489> hell<00:02:28.730> I'm<00:02:28.880> going<00:02:29.000> to<00:02:29.090> try<00:02:29.239> and<00:02:29.269> do<00:02:29.389> the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
like hell I'm going to try and do the

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.360 
like hell I'm going to try and do the
whole<00:02:29.630> lot<00:02:29.840> so<00:02:30.079> yeah<00:02:30.319> two<00:02:30.590> years<00:02:30.769> ago<00:02:30.920> did<00:02:31.250> the

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
whole lot so yeah two years ago did the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.819 
whole lot so yeah two years ago did the
entire<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.060> France<00:02:32.329> and<00:02:32.930> then<00:02:33.440> last<00:02:33.650> year

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
entire to the France and then last year

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.160 
entire to the France and then last year
I<00:02:33.980> did<00:02:34.160> this<00:02:34.310> euro<00:02:34.609> and<00:02:35.600> this<00:02:35.780> year<00:02:35.959> I<00:02:35.989> thought

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
I did this euro and this year I thought

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.750 
I did this euro and this year I thought
the<00:02:36.290> next<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.739> obvious<00:02:37.160> challenge<00:02:37.579> was

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
the next the obvious challenge was

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.640 
the next the obvious challenge was
trying<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.180> all<00:02:38.299> three<00:02:38.569> in<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.959> same<00:02:39.170> season

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
trying to all three in the same season

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.819 
trying to all three in the same season
and<00:02:39.799> if<00:02:39.859> only<00:02:40.269> 23<00:02:41.269> pro<00:02:42.109> cyclists<00:02:42.739> have

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
and if only 23 pro cyclists have

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.140 
and if only 23 pro cyclists have
actually<00:02:43.099> done<00:02:43.250> that<00:02:43.310> you<00:02:43.700> know<00:02:43.819> now<00:02:43.970> they're

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
actually done that you know now they're

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.640

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
time shop was it's a much different

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.700 
time shop was it's a much different
position<00:06:07.310> beyond<00:06:08.090> the<00:06:08.360> time<00:06:08.599> trial<00:06:08.900> by<00:06:09.080> such<00:06:09.680> a

position beyond the time trial by such a

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.140 
position beyond the time trial by such a
long<00:06:09.949> period<00:06:10.189> of<00:06:10.370> time<00:06:10.430> it's<00:06:10.789> about<00:06:10.939> an<00:06:11.000> hour

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
long period of time it's about an hour

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.179 
long period of time it's about an hour
and<00:06:11.300> a<00:06:11.330> quarter<00:06:11.539> at<00:06:11.810> least<00:06:12.050> the<00:06:12.680> riders<00:06:13.069> on

00:06:13.179 --> 00:06:13.189

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:14.920 
and a quarter at least the riders on
that<00:06:13.400> bike<00:06:13.639> I<00:06:13.879> think<00:06:14.120> he<00:06:14.210> was<00:06:14.300> just<00:06:14.449> some<00:06:14.719> ring

when the cold and wet as well coming
into<00:06:18.979> florence<00:06:19.400> he<00:06:20.000> was<00:06:20.300> all<00:06:20.419> right<00:06:20.449> on<00:06:20.689> the

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:20.779 
into florence he was all right on the

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:22.450 
into florence he was all right on the
longer<00:06:21.139> client<00:06:21.529> when<00:06:21.710> it<00:06:21.800> came<00:06:21.979> to<00:06:22.099> the<00:06:22.189> shore

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
longer client when it came to the shore

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.189 
longer client when it came to the shore
declines<00:06:22.909> to<00:06:23.120> finish<00:06:23.449> they<00:06:23.659> were<00:06:23.750> going<00:06:24.020> that

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 
declines to finish they were going that

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:26.140 
declines to finish they were going that
bit<00:06:24.409> harder<00:06:24.800> just<00:06:25.339> didn't<00:06:25.610> have<00:06:25.729> the<00:06:25.759> power<00:06:26.089> to

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
bit harder just didn't have the power to

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.570 
bit harder just didn't have the power to
keep<00:06:26.389> up<00:06:26.629> there<00:06:27.110> quite<00:06:27.319> a<00:06:27.349> good<00:06:27.650> limit<00:06:28.430> of

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
keep up there quite a good limit of
