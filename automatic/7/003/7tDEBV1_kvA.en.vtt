00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 it 's okay, yes, little girls 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.450
 dressed and shortcuts the way 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.740
 madam small shortcuts so the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.599
 instructions are not only useful 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.179
 Original video huh it's not because 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.220
 we're going to get screwed 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.390
 an email that must be typed faster and 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.779
 can not also save a little time 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.740
 when a laureate on the internet 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.269
 so this is a small list of 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.939
 shortcuts compatible with normally 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.619
 all browsers 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.330
 I can not guarantee that everything works 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.790
 are reached explore because it's 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.750
 something I will not risk myself 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.489
 to make a 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.730
 I hold my sanity so we go 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.550
 start with a shortcut that allows you to 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.520
 automatically start a search in 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.239
 done so everything will actually be designed these 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.770
 controls they control the pam and that 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.440
 automatically puts the focus of the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.969
 mouse in there in fact I'm 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.469
 the agent this normally finally now 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.149
 they changed little thanks to chrome 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.710
 everybody clap his research the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:07.619
 last and a year but if I do against 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.570
 the stuff so then the stuff there I 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.159
 did my search for tricks images lodges 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.560
 young people looking for stuff and more 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.320
 I'm doing a search for something I'm doing 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.360
 check the checkbook thing there in there 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.630
 does if I do in training he gets 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.750
 pass I have more my search for stuff 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.680
 tic 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.780
 thin then previous page or the 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.950
 use the mouse thing I can do 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.960
 previous page the center but if we 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.479
 click to erase it works too but 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.530
 not all the time my brief I use 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.790
 black and concise mouse thing if you 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.200
 usually have one or two buttons in 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.259
 more than the cliques it's sometimes 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.700
 stand not the one in which it's not then 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.880
 so we're going to find his thing 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.149
 so if i press alt entered bim 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.229
 word to a new tab so use 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.329
 tabs when making 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.020
 research it's essential we 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.750
 explain why 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.070
 in fact when we click there every time 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.899
 the object of expectations that load the page 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.950
 before you can read and get 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.259
 account they are not very effective 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.490
 that we can already say tie fighter 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.649
 I watched all these things there 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.190
 I actually want to see what 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.560
 happens on the thing thing 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.800
 in all things ah yeah is that too in 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.880
 thing is not bad and after we 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.920
 can go see everything that's going on 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.470
 in these tabs so there are some 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.520
 shortcuts to navigate between 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.290
 tabs so already we realized 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.180
 that finally the stuff we did not care 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.260
 stolen names of stuff so to close 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.030
 the thing 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.580
 instead of trying to aim for the small 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.050
 cross that does not even appear there 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.600
 I use the casters on 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.580
 clicquot let bat the tab is closed i 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.480
 do not want to change 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.450
 sorry we see that I have a lot of stuff 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.160
 john machin john does not want john 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.220
 john hop thing thing one can do it 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.320
 it is practiced following the shortcut 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.660
 which allows you to go directly 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.910
 a tab is control plus the number 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.200
 of the tab even honestly I'm 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.750
 never serve alone are not happy and then 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.240
 that's the tab a god and three 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.740
 guns but my little one intact and that's 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.270
 a little good I give you just so I 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.080
 do against 9 that brings me directly to 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.580
 last tabs that's good frankly 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.890
 I never use it I use 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.390
 control table here against tobacco 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.470
 against the tarbes match back in 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:14.020
 back and stop machin thing that's it 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.750
 then then closed to English assets or 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.830
 the window these controls wrs practices 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.239
 we have a lot of stuff against the double 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.580
 of him and it works will be full of 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.780
 stuff and on mike actually tom w that's 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.110
 the equivalent a bit of high tech 4 2 2 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.670
 pc 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.020
 except that it will not leave completely 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.150
 the application just knew closed the same 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.540
 the active window is it's still 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.090
 convenient 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:39.250
 so what else a little shortcut 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.450
 that I could give you to the actually 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.880
 to open tabs I do not know 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.280
 use the click hoop have to open 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.980
 in a new tab or else we can 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.360
 have control over click or dummies 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.380
 funds right click open in a new 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.570
 tab but since these two clicks it's 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.060
 for the big dummies what we can also 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.890
 start another search in 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.150
 selecting a piece of stuff that we 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.790
 forbid a dish I will search 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.130
 pictures of thing thing on google 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.470
 just a thing there we who 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.350
 intervene 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.710
 here I made my selection he me 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.990
 just missed the high-place of re 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.090
 try to sort it cleanly if we 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.200
 press the shift key and the arrow on the 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.450
 pop side 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.100
 he'll say hello I know it's 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.320
 a little too much I can reduce his life by 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.880
 my little practical thing I still do 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.430
 you read right on it and search 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.170
 google for thing thing we're always 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.520
 this option actually allows you to 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.690
 to say is to open a new tab you have 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.740
 a hop search you can is closed 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.600
 the one before if you do not want to keep 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.920
 and then we say mas I closed my 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.770
 looking for something I have not yet 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.100
 search for unchecked stuff that 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.200
 saves life control maj + t who you 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:50.340
 so lets cycle and in your 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:54.480
 tab history closed here I 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.560
 control buy me can do that in 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.900
 train of it's a great story of 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.310
 family ben here is that so 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.790
 check yours on a new tab 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.550
 Virgin 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.350
 so in fact that allows you to if you 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.530
 have some stuff there we may have 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:10.020
 practice control n opens a new 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.090
 window w control even allows to close 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.290
 a window so now I was showing 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:18.120
 we are here ah well I want to 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:20.580
 tea so I was interrupted tellers my 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.860
 video will be forgotten a detail to the con 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.640
 I actually forgot that at last I did not 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.350
 did not know but firefox have disabled the 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.700
 shortcut that I wanted you to 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.180
 speak by default so you can the 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.460
 reactivate 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.169
 in fact it will have to access your 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.780
 config maybe a vote confine there 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.140
 in entrance and that brings you to this 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.250
 page 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:46.979
 and here in fact we're going to get his 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:48.240
 click bumps save 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:50.070
 Here he is then we both bases 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.040
 in front do not know why 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.950
 hop on active and now we do so 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.169
 if I go on my dear things better 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.450
 that in truth so I can look for a 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.790
 watt thing 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.440
 so I click on the data sheet 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.760
 so the normal clique he opens to me the 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.650
 technical sheet like that if we want the 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.600
 download directly without going to do 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.380
 right click save the cdu link itself 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.120
 made to click 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.380
 and after control j to display the 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.650
 trick so here I already had teichmann 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.870
 appears directly 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.190
 So here it is really practical 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:25.230
 wants to close this window with against 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:27.430
 forgetfulness also what notes so 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:29.170
 imagine nothing to see but I will 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.270
 talk about another little navigation trick 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.980
 which is practical we're going to say tonight I'm going 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.420
 I want to download subtitles my 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.350
 parents this is a site it is very 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:39.940
 well except that navigation 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.010
 she's great where the opposition makes a 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.710
 list to the con where there are all the stuff 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:48.340
 so it takes 15 years is what you 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:50.770
 can do is that you type 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.240
 directly the beginning of how 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.560
 is called my age for you know 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.480
 maybe already but I would have I write 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.040
 game up chained to his game of 

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.700
 thrones enter but would select 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.720
 this season 16 years old I do not know why 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.950
 he does not walk then like the one to 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:07.050
 to start conch in the final between 

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:07.050
 ibiza in the last episode 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:20.039
 90 5 1 and avoid it here is brief it's a 

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:22.289
 example of small useful manips if you 

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:29.159
 do not know it's very handy 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:35.899
 to save time on this beautiful you are 

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:35.899
 beautiful you are placement navigation internet
