00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.040
 if I tell you that riot games sometimes pulls 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.279
 champions that are not open like you 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.279
 you stay 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.460
 what's up, guys, god, do a lot 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.990
 plane went up for a review of a hero 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.910
 well, it's been a long time since 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.160
 video the truth that I've had between 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.960
 this look to tell it while I'm leaving 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.840
 to start with a three position pot 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.910
 normally it is always fast 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.620
 wind for me as a bible 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.890
 sandra new skin this base is the list 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.629
 with flat skin and red sadistic mountain 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:40.079
 healthy is pretty pretty cool 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:41.940
 the exquisite perfect good that has 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.039
 past let's see let's see why 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.129
 between this first imminent triumph 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:50.010
 studios then the holidays I was there 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.109
 that know a little but it is and then what 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.179
 more important the mess of accounts that 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.899
 I had my first account first 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:56.159
 baled 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.589
 then believe me another account upload it from 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.269
 level 30 and I was shot also go to 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.649
 fags those of the court is that it is 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.329
 like in the video this one that went up the 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.210
 last thing I went up is that it's like that 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.890
 these data punish are ladybugs 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.409
 to the luck 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.090
 total that I had to do a third 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.590
 has got it to level 30 and of 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.840
 she with that I 'm already being 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.360
 being an exemplary player who meets the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.130
 Summoner code with two balls with 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.390
 two cojones I keep it and endured back 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.040
 endures the whole world what you have to 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.780
 do 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.119
 but good and let's go there what 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.649
 does what this hero does is first 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.090
 the passive I will say a little the passive 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.710
 the passive what makes every 18 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.149
 seconds 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.100
 you have a free skill the 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.140
 Free personality as if they were 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.200
 1 the ability of seven in one only 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.740
 every time is before and more seriously 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.740
 macció the q 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:57.299
 mt 70 to 75 at level 1 plus a 0 8% escape 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.040
 and slow down to a 16 by against lentito 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.439
 a little bit also to increase the 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.289
 slowing down and that's just a 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.430
 skill that goes through units is not 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.430
 it is in the first and they go through 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.440
 we arrived at level 2 we will see the w the 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.130
 life of what it does is that in the area 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.130
 what are you seeing right now 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.800
 of ice 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.660
 and above 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.750
 believe me I feel 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:48.230
 w you can see that it's a little bit ope 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.230
 the time of the hooks that 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.500
 the thing is calmly going 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.890
 on-line 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.819
 the strips for your house your house does not 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:11.160
 I kill for courtesy because I still do not forget 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.150
 and what he does is all of the chords 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.420
 of nocturnal 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.370
 I think the blades have to be launched 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.880
 as a kind of hand the same the 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:25.410
 week in one direction and what it does is 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:28.319
 that if you press the key again while 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.790
 is on the way the skill is active 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.650
 while he is running his hand in the 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.630
 battlefield that you transport yourself to 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.630
 where that hand is now going to see 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.640
 the same 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.270
 and now let's see 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:54.890
 you have to go to a five-second cb 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.890
 approximately 18 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:05.640
 The little arrow comes out and threw the hand 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.900
 is 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:20.239
 to a post small little details graphics 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.239
 as for example when 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.950
 below this one 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.560
 pretty good and this is a serious 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.610
 good enough the snake with 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.610
 too much mind 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.360
 because it is very difficult to whiten so 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.360
 easy 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.710
 and so 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:22.189
 but 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.889
 enough of this champion and now see 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.810
 yes i am at level 6 again 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:27.430
 and we can see what the latest the 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.960
 last principle has two types of 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.229
 effects basically the effect is equal 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.539
 just to explain me a little when 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:37.090
 that you are in an enemy, you turn it into 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.550
 a block of ice salts tunisia during 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.110
 15 seconds and on top you create around 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.900
 that block of ice which is the 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:47.409
 enemy character that is an area that 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.750
 it hurts to be 150 plus 30 same 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:50.460
 I have 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.040
 of magical damage to those who are at their 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:57.290
 around is already offered to be 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.290
 an ink with meat fat for example 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.800
 what barberá has told me 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.669
 down 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.669
 efe 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.240
 as I do 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:21.499
 low since May 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:23.030
 and that what he does in the enemy has 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:25.400
 another effect that is when you see yourself 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.409
 same that note itself is a kind 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.879
 of sonia is like having a free zone is 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:30.979
 say you read yourself and you make yourself 

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:33.139
 you become invulnerable for 15 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:38.229
 seconds can not move you and over 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:38.229
 you have the same area that comes out when 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:49.460
 so I hope it's good because it's going to be 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.460
 very well 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.530
 this property more roll study that 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.530
 crime head a cabin 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.660
 and well now let's see the wing the very 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.090
 good william i think the footprint 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.430
 here the one that transposed was quite 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.889
 well I put at the beginning obviously not at 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:15.010
 principle I see more well then and andriy 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:16.990
 for what is the best and the w the 

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:19.990
 it is more honest talk me more too 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.490
 an engraving in fixed fixed I think that it is 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.960
 almost essential moron and with 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.310
 you need a lot 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.040
 cd correction because the rooms 

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:29.550
 very much yields and then already the typical 

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.550
 new recordings 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.039
 tijuana with work that did not comment either 

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:44.220
 and good boy this has been all for this 

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.430
 review 

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.430
 no no no no 

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.110
 class 

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:58.860
 to take the fuck this side does not 

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.880
 can play 200 ping 

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.500
 thanks guys for watching the video 

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.090
 You already know how to like it 

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.090
