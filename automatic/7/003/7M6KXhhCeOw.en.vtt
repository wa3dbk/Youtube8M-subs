00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.279
 once the graft is made it is 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.310
 verified the engraftment of the march 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.930
 your task did not end there 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.939
 are in fact some tricks from 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.890
 take because the march develops into 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.380
 optimal way 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.420
 first of all, after taking root, yes 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.760
 will have to proceed with the elimination of the 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.940
 part of port graft that is above 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.160
 in the graft itself in some cases 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.310
 you can leave a piece called 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.240
 hock that will support the new shoot 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.940
 in its development 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.340
 otherwise you will have to apply a support 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.050
 external for example a straw 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.050
 vegetable or plastic 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.280
 be careful that the ligation at the 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.409
 support does not create bottlenecks on the point 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:34.340
 of insertion when it is still 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.340
 tender therefore prefer an 8- fold ligature 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.890
 since the new sprout when it starts 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.600
 to develop uses the resources first 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.510
 of the march and then those of the 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.270
 rootstock and well eliminate on both 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.459
 the other competing shoots to do 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.970
 yes that the development of the latter is not 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.970
 yes it has affected
