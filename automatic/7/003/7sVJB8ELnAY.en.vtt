00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.670 
I'm here today because there's still not
too<00:00:02.909> late<00:00:02.939> for<00:00:03.360> people<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:03.929> speak<00:00:04.140> up<00:00:04.380> and<00:00:04.589> be

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
too late for people to speak up and be

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.160 
too late for people to speak up and be
heard<00:00:04.770> on<00:00:05.190> health<00:00:05.460> care<00:00:05.609> I<00:00:06.029> think<00:00:06.810> we<00:00:06.960> need<00:00:07.109> to

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
heard on health care I think we need to

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.919 
heard on health care I think we need to
send<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.620> message<00:00:08.010> that<00:00:08.540> we<00:00:09.540> don't<00:00:09.660> agree

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
send the message that we don't agree

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.440

with<00:00:10.550> single-payer<00:00:11.550> system<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.330> think

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
with single-payer system and I think

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.370 
with single-payer system and I think
that's<00:00:12.599> where<00:00:12.719> everything<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.139> headed<00:00:13.349> right

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380
