00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.369
 dairy farmers are available all spring and 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.460
 the summer busy with the construction of a 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:30.400
 roughage stock for the winter 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.439
 a time-consuming activity, now the food 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.120
 Leeuwarden Center takes it daily 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.659
 completely taking care of the cows 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.659
 from the farmer 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.470
 the feeding center is originally one 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.880
 foreign idea the cattle farmer who 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.810
 uses the services of it 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.700
 feeding center 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.700
 is accompanied by a bovino lye 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.180
 the front center delivers weekly know 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.070
 numbers to give the farmer a good 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.340
 keeps an eye on its profitability 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.340
 company 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.270
 yes we get so we get there quite 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.850
 many of those farmers get that 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.190
 you see inside that they run this 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.420
 is a pit image of 24 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.160
 dairy farmers 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.330
 we mix that roughage with others 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.460
 products to make it as good 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.930
 possible chance to make for that milk 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.090
 oh we have one to see now and and 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.920
 above all , above all about that 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.960
 guides our dairy farmers and the 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.860
 minutes the Chinese input center 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.630
 and ensures that it is forever 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.660
 so the nutrisan is who made one 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.620
 riddle based on the roughage and that 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.030
 look for other raw materials and those 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.910
 then we can continue with his press pulp 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.320
 its the farmer's fibers call it it 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.690
 water but is available in the market 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.810
 so we make a good ration for ours 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.810
 cows 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.380
 the financial benefit 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.120
 is between 0 and 3 cents per liter 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.709
 as an additional benefit there is none 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.990
 silage grass in the yard of the 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.160
 cattle farmer and the labor speak around it 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.160
 silage is no longer there 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.980
 The conducting center is a successful one 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.750
 project based on joint knowledge 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.910
 input from the dairy farmer 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.380
 forage trade to the contractor 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.380
 and an agricultural consultancy company 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.260
 the savings offered makes this way 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.850
 of working commercially interesting and there 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.380
 There is also a lot of interest in it 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.380
 this concept among dairy farmers 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.730
 yes convenience serves people absolutely it is 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.270
 the easy thing they do every day 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.100
 To accomplish the same time to 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.220
 cows responding that you know a whole 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.780
 car is coming our food is coming and 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.670
 it's just a good thing about sun and 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.450
 so just too good at it 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.450
 that is the most important 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.720
 above all logical and cattle specialist 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.250
 he ensures after sometimes 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.950
 composed what 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.810
 and he monitors he is watching what to do 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.810
 the cows with the ration 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.640
 if things don't go well like the 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.710
 provide too little milk for cooling 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.300
 the protein fat and crying tests were too low 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.340
 arranging is not good and what is added 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.290
 sent so he goes to all companies 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.290
 and he grabs what happens
