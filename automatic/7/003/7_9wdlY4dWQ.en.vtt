area as well

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.149 
area as well
we<00:01:04.820> use<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.570> shoes<00:01:05.810> based<00:01:06.080> on<00:01:06.320> a<00:01:06.380> lunar

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
we use the shoes based on a lunar

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.910 
we use the shoes based on a lunar
midsole<00:01:08.060> platform<00:01:08.690> so<00:01:09.140> uses<00:01:09.500> Luna<00:01:09.770> long

through to the forefoot you can see this

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.780 
through to the forefoot you can see this
cut<00:01:14.030> out<00:01:14.240> through<00:01:14.660> the<00:01:14.780> midsole<00:01:15.110> as<00:01:15.290> well<00:01:15.790> it's

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
cut out through the midsole as well it's

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.430 
cut out through the midsole as well it's
the<00:01:17.119> first<00:01:17.360> time<00:01:17.570> we've<00:01:17.630> really<00:01:17.930> offered<00:01:18.260> this

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
the first time we've really offered this

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.260 
the first time we've really offered this
in<00:01:18.710> a<00:01:19.540> mileage<00:01:20.950> shoe<00:01:21.950> but<00:01:22.340> also<00:01:22.520> in<00:01:23.000> a<00:01:23.090> shoe

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
in a mileage shoe but also in a shoe

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.749 
in a mileage shoe but also in a shoe
that<00:01:23.300> offers<00:01:23.750> a<00:01:23.930> neutral<00:01:24.500> neutral<00:01:25.430> platform

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
that offers a neutral neutral platform

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.240 
that offers a neutral neutral platform
as<00:01:26.750> well<00:01:26.960> so<00:01:27.140> you<00:01:27.229> can<00:01:27.380> kind<00:01:27.560> of<00:01:27.619> see<00:01:27.800> if<00:01:28.070> I

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
as well so you can kind of see if I

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.300 
as well so you can kind of see if I
squeeze<00:01:28.990> around<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.259> lunar<00:01:30.470> you<00:01:30.890> can<00:01:31.040> see<00:01:31.190> how

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
squeeze around the lunar you can see how

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.969 
squeeze around the lunar you can see how
much<00:01:31.490> softer<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:32.000> is<00:01:32.150> than<00:01:32.390> our<00:01:32.509> normal<00:01:32.979> firmer

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
much softer it is than our normal firmer

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.180 
much softer it is than our normal firmer
carrier<00:01:34.460> foam<00:01:34.759> that<00:01:34.940> we<00:01:35.060> use<00:01:35.470> and<00:01:36.470> it<00:01:36.979> really

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
carrier foam that we use and it really

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.820 
carrier foam that we use and it really
gives<00:01:37.340> a<00:01:37.490> soft<00:01:37.729> responsive<00:01:38.660> kind<00:01:39.380> of<00:01:39.470> springy

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
gives a soft responsive kind of springy

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.670 
gives a soft responsive kind of springy
feel<00:01:40.160> when<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:40.670> when<00:01:41.149> the<00:01:41.350> run-up<00:01:42.350> puts<00:01:42.560> the

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
feel when the when the run-up puts the

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.060 
feel when the when the run-up puts the
shoe<00:01:42.860> off<00:01:43.479> we've<00:01:44.479> also<00:01:44.660> cut<00:01:45.080> out<00:01:45.289> areas<00:01:45.860> of

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
shoe off we've also cut out areas of

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.730 
shoe off we've also cut out areas of
firmer<00:01:46.399> foam<00:01:46.759> again<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.660> reduce<00:01:47.960> weight<00:01:48.229> but

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
firmer foam again to reduce weight but

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.680 
firmer foam again to reduce weight but
also<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:49.130> add<00:01:49.399> to<00:01:49.670> that<00:01:49.700> kind<00:01:50.030> of<00:01:50.210> springy

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
also to add to that kind of springy

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.630 
also to add to that kind of springy
responsive<00:01:51.410> feel<00:01:51.680> and<00:01:51.920> it<00:01:52.250> gives<00:01:52.399> you<00:01:52.490> a<00:01:52.520> great

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640

great kind of foot foot to ground

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.910 
great kind of foot foot to ground
contact<00:01:55.369> as<00:01:55.880> well<00:01:56.350> so<00:01:57.350> that's<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.680> sort<00:01:57.860> of

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
contact as well so that's the sort of

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.260 
contact as well so that's the sort of
technology<00:01:58.460> we're<00:01:58.789> looking<00:01:59.030> at<00:01:59.119> in<00:01:59.210> the

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
technology we're looking at in the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.930 
technology we're looking at in the
midsole<00:01:59.570> in<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.649> upper<00:02:01.009> is<00:02:01.430> where<00:02:01.789> we're

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
midsole in the upper is where we're

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.370 
midsole in the upper is where we're
really<00:02:02.179> talking<00:02:02.390> about<00:02:02.630> this<00:02:02.899> flying<00:02:03.229> in

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
really talking about this flying in

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.090 
really talking about this flying in
technology<00:02:04.479> so<00:02:05.479> flying<00:02:05.840> it<00:02:06.050> is<00:02:06.289> all<00:02:06.979> about

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
technology so flying it is all about

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.190 
technology so flying it is all about
creating<00:02:07.250> a<00:02:07.700> completely<00:02:07.970> seamless<00:02:08.509> upper

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
creating a completely seamless upper

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.979 
creating a completely seamless upper
that<00:02:09.830> has<00:02:10.220> support<00:02:10.910> breathability<00:02:11.750> and

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
that has support breathability and

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.190 
that has support breathability and
flexibility<00:02:12.890> all<00:02:13.160> built<00:02:13.489> in<00:02:13.930> ok<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:14.989> a

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
flexibility all built in ok to a

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.100 
flexibility all built in ok to a
malleable<00:02:16.330> 11<00:02:17.330> layers<00:02:17.890> upper<00:02:18.890> material<00:02:20.110> the

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
malleable 11 layers upper material the

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.170 
malleable 11 layers upper material the
upper<00:02:21.500> of<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.709> flyknit<00:02:22.070> lunar<00:02:22.100> one<00:02:22.459> uses<00:02:22.880> four

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
upper of the flyknit lunar one uses four

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.539 
upper of the flyknit lunar one uses four
threads<00:02:23.660> which<00:02:24.500> itself<00:02:24.860> is<00:02:25.070> made<00:02:25.220> up<00:02:25.400> of<00:02:25.489> three

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
threads which itself is made up of three

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.720 
threads which itself is made up of three
different<00:02:25.910> types<00:02:26.239> of<00:02:26.360> yarn<00:02:26.709> okay<00:02:27.709> we<00:02:28.220> use<00:02:28.489> a

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
different types of yarn okay we use a

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.729 
different types of yarn okay we use a
core<00:02:28.970> polyester<00:02:29.630> yarn<00:02:29.840> which<00:02:30.380> is<00:02:30.500> really

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
core polyester yarn which is really

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.430 
core polyester yarn which is really
tightly<00:02:31.100> woven<00:02:31.459> in<00:02:32.120> areas<00:02:32.600> that<00:02:32.630> need<00:02:33.019> quite<00:02:33.410> a

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
tightly woven in areas that need quite a

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.710 
tightly woven in areas that need quite a
lot<00:02:33.590> of<00:02:33.650> support<00:02:34.040> so<00:02:34.519> in<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:34.880> around<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.540> heel

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
lot of support so in and around the heel

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.039 
lot of support so in and around the heel
counter<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.890> also<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.760> toe<00:02:37.910> box<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.690> can<00:02:38.840> see

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
counter and also the toe box you can see

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.050 
counter and also the toe box you can see
really<00:02:39.320> tightly<00:02:39.709> woven<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.370> that<00:02:40.850> really

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
really tightly woven and that really

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.449 
really tightly woven and that really
stops<00:02:41.510> you<00:02:41.720> from<00:02:41.930> rolling<00:02:42.380> off<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.829> midsole

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
stops you from rolling off the midsole

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.100 
stops you from rolling off the midsole
gives<00:02:44.060> you<00:02:44.120> a<00:02:44.180> little<00:02:44.360> bit<00:02:44.600> of<00:02:44.690> support<00:02:44.840> in

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
gives you a little bit of support in

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.290 
gives you a little bit of support in
that<00:02:45.230> area

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
that area

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.510 
that area
we<00:02:46.840> also<00:02:47.050> have<00:02:47.260> another<00:02:47.500> type<00:02:47.740> of<00:02:47.770> yarn<00:02:48.070> so<00:02:48.430> we

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
we also have another type of yarn so we

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.340 
we also have another type of yarn so we
use<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:48.730> stretch<00:02:49.180> yarn<00:02:49.570> throughout<00:02:50.200> the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
use a stretch yarn throughout the

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.290 
use a stretch yarn throughout the
mid-foot<00:02:50.710> so<00:02:51.340> this<00:02:51.490> stretch<00:02:51.790> yarn<00:02:52.090> is

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
mid-foot so this stretch yarn is

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.200 
mid-foot so this stretch yarn is
incorporated<00:02:53.200> with<00:02:53.320> the<00:02:53.380> dynamic<00:02:53.770> flywire

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
incorporated with the dynamic flywire

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.730 
incorporated with the dynamic flywire
which<00:02:55.210> gives<00:02:55.600> a<00:02:55.810> little<00:02:55.930> bit<00:02:56.050> of<00:02:56.170> stretch<00:02:56.500> and

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
which gives a little bit of stretch and

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.320 
which gives a little bit of stretch and
stretch<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.400> flexibility<00:02:57.910> through<00:02:58.180> the

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
stretch and flexibility through the

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.930 
stretch and flexibility through the
mid-foot<00:02:58.660> we're<00:02:59.170> also<00:02:59.380> great<00:02:59.860> locked<00:03:00.130> down<00:03:00.370> in

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
mid-foot we're also great locked down in

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.520 
mid-foot we're also great locked down in
there<00:03:01.270> so<00:03:01.510> when<00:03:01.690> you<00:03:01.780> pull<00:03:01.990> on<00:03:02.020> those<00:03:02.230> laces

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
there so when you pull on those laces

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.860 
there so when you pull on those laces
those<00:03:03.430> that<00:03:03.700> dynamic<00:03:04.180> flywire<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:04.780> the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
those that dynamic flywire and the

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.020 
those that dynamic flywire and the
stretch<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.590> stretch<00:03:05.620> yarn<00:03:06.160> interact<00:03:06.760> and

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
stretch the stretch yarn interact and

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.640 
stretch the stretch yarn interact and
work<00:03:07.090> together<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.870> really<00:03:08.050> give<00:03:08.260> you<00:03:08.350> a<00:03:08.380> great

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
work together to really give you a great

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.350 
work together to really give you a great
lockdown<00:03:09.190> fit<00:03:09.490> through<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.300> mid<00:03:10.450> phone

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
lockdown fit through the mid phone

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.330 
lockdown fit through the mid phone
we<00:03:13.360> also<00:03:13.540> use<00:03:13.870> what<00:03:14.200> we<00:03:14.290> call<00:03:14.320> a<00:03:14.500> fusible<00:03:15.010> yarn

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
we also use what we call a fusible yarn

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.090 
we also use what we call a fusible yarn
so<00:03:15.820> this<00:03:16.000> fusible<00:03:16.450> yar<00:03:16.780> sits<00:03:17.410> in<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.710> toe<00:03:17.920> box

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
so this fusible yar sits in the toe box

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.510 
so this fusible yar sits in the toe box
the<00:03:18.970> majority<00:03:19.510> of<00:03:19.540> it<00:03:19.750> sits<00:03:19.960> in<00:03:20.080> the<00:03:20.170> toe<00:03:20.320> box

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
the majority of it sits in the toe box

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.070 
the majority of it sits in the toe box
the<00:03:21.520> fusion<00:03:21.910> wheel<00:03:22.000> allows<00:03:22.480> for<00:03:22.660> a<00:03:22.690> great<00:03:22.900> deal

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
the fusion wheel allows for a great deal

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.780 
the fusion wheel allows for a great deal
of<00:03:23.170> breathability<00:03:23.560> because<00:03:24.130> of<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.310> space<00:03:24.550> is

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
of breathability because of the space is

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.720 
of breathability because of the space is
a<00:03:25.000> little<00:03:25.750> bit<00:03:25.840> of<00:03:25.930> flexibility<00:03:26.500> as<00:03:26.740> well<00:03:26.770> but

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
a little bit of flexibility as well but

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.080 
a little bit of flexibility as well but
also<00:03:28.230> reacts<00:03:29.230> with<00:03:29.350> steam<00:03:29.650> so<00:03:30.490> the<00:03:30.760> shoe<00:03:30.940> is<00:03:31.060> a

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
also reacts with steam so the shoe is a

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.190 
also reacts with steam so the shoe is a
great<00:03:31.390> fitting<00:03:31.630> shoe<00:03:31.870> anyway<00:03:32.340> but<00:03:33.340> by

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
great fitting shoe anyway but by

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.760 
great fitting shoe anyway but by
steaming<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.500> shoe<00:03:35.710> we<00:03:37.020> the<00:03:38.020> fusible<00:03:38.470> yarn

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
steaming the shoe we the fusible yarn

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.460 
steaming the shoe we the fusible yarn
stretches<00:03:39.340> it<00:03:39.580> expands<00:03:40.270> and<00:03:40.690> it<00:03:40.840> drops<00:03:41.170> down<00:03:41.320> a

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
stretches it expands and it drops down a

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.400 
stretches it expands and it drops down a
little<00:03:41.740> in<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.010> toe<00:03:42.190> box<00:03:42.690> we<00:03:43.690> take<00:03:44.110> the<00:03:44.230> shoe

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
little in the toe box we take the shoe

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.810 
little in the toe box we take the shoe
out<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.770> steaming<00:03:45.010> machine<00:03:45.400> and<00:03:45.520> we<00:03:45.580> slide

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
out the steaming machine and we slide

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.610 
out the steaming machine and we slide
that<00:03:45.940> foot<00:03:46.120> back<00:03:46.180> in<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:46.660> then<00:03:47.200> I've<00:03:47.350> foot

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
that foot back in and then I've foot

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.100 
that foot back in and then I've foot
pushes<00:03:47.980> out<00:03:48.130> on<00:03:48.310> that<00:03:48.490> yarn<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:49.000> allows<00:03:49.810> the

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
pushes out on that yarn and allows the

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.520 
pushes out on that yarn and allows the
the<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:51.850> yarn<00:03:52.090> to<00:03:52.240> really<00:03:52.510> mold<00:03:52.750> and<00:03:53.110> conform

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
the the yarn to really mold and conform

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.040 
the the yarn to really mold and conform
to<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:53.800> shape<00:03:53.830> of<00:03:54.130> our<00:03:54.250> foot<00:03:54.570> okay<00:03:55.570> we<00:03:55.720> give<00:03:55.900> it

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
to the shape of our foot okay we give it

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.650 
to the shape of our foot okay we give it
about<00:03:56.200> 30<00:03:56.560> seconds<00:03:57.130> to<00:03:57.220> 45<00:03:57.700> seconds<00:03:58.060> to<00:03:58.270> to

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
about 30 seconds to 45 seconds to to

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.200 
about 30 seconds to 45 seconds to to
mold<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.140> actually<00:03:59.740> fit<00:03:59.980> to<00:04:00.100> the<00:04:00.220> foot<00:04:00.430> if<00:04:01.090> you

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 
mold and actually fit to the foot if you

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.430 
mold and actually fit to the foot if you
took<00:04:01.360> your<00:04:01.510> foot<00:04:01.690> out<00:04:01.810> then<00:04:02.020> you<00:04:02.200> would<00:04:02.290> see
