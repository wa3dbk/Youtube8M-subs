00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
that a little click right there see if I

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.190 
that a little click right there see if I
can't<00:02:58.440> make<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.590> happen<00:02:58.829> again<00:02:59.040> listen<00:03:00.200> that

click<00:03:01.409> right<00:03:01.590> there<00:03:01.620> up<00:03:02.540> you<00:03:03.540> know<00:03:03.629> can<00:03:03.900> work

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
click right there up you know can work

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.610 
click right there up you know can work
as<00:03:04.349> a<00:03:05.030> kickstand<00:03:06.030> as<00:03:06.209> well<00:03:06.390> so<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.379> have<00:03:07.530> it

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
as a kickstand as well so you have it

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.670 
as a kickstand as well so you have it
right<00:03:07.709> there<00:03:07.980> give<00:03:08.489> it<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:09.319> 180<00:03:10.319> degrees<00:03:10.560> you

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
right there give it a 180 degrees you

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.240 
right there give it a 180 degrees you
have<00:03:10.739> 360<00:03:11.459> degrees<00:03:11.760> range<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.329> motion<00:03:13.159> so<00:03:14.159> you

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
have 360 degrees range of motion so you

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.750 
have 360 degrees range of motion so you
operate<00:03:14.670> like<00:03:14.790> this<00:03:19.160> can<00:03:20.160> work<00:03:20.340> as<00:03:20.609> a

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
operate like this can work as a

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.729 
operate like this can work as a
kickstand<00:03:21.950> like<00:03:22.950> so<00:03:24.380> but<00:03:25.380> you<00:03:25.470> have<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.680> have

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
kickstand like so but you have to have

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.580 
kickstand like so but you have to have
that<00:03:25.889> tap<00:03:26.160> down<00:03:26.430> holds<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.060> down<00:03:27.090> flat<00:03:27.569> so<00:03:28.440> now

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
that tap down holds it down flat so now

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.259 
that tap down holds it down flat so now
you<00:03:28.650> can<00:03:28.829> look<00:03:28.950> at<00:03:29.160> look<00:03:29.549> at<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:29.879> straight<00:03:30.209> on

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
you can look at look at it straight on

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.710 
you can look at look at it straight on
you<00:03:31.169> maybe<00:03:31.349> have<00:03:31.620> an<00:03:31.739> eye<00:03:31.859> level<00:03:32.129> or<00:03:32.540> you<00:03:33.540> want

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
you maybe have an eye level or you want

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.819 
you maybe have an eye level or you want
to<00:03:33.780> give<00:03:33.900> yourself<00:03:33.959> a<00:03:34.290> different<00:03:34.590> viewing

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
to give yourself a different viewing

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.940 
to give yourself a different viewing
angle<00:03:35.280> have<00:03:36.180> it<00:03:36.359> you<00:03:36.480> know<00:03:36.599> come<00:03:36.959> up<00:03:37.650> like<00:03:37.889> this

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
angle have it you know come up like this

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.879 
angle have it you know come up like this
or<00:03:38.430> like<00:03:40.010> so<00:03:41.180> have<00:03:42.180> it<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.419> smaller<00:03:42.810> angle<00:03:43.319> you

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
or like so have it a smaller angle you

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:44.990 
or like so have it a smaller angle you
just<00:03:44.069> have<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.220> play<00:03:44.430> with<00:03:44.639> it<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:44.819> get<00:03:44.970> the

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
just have to play with it and get the

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.330 
just have to play with it and get the
angles<00:03:45.389> right<00:03:45.569> you<00:03:46.260> know<00:03:46.349> maybe<00:03:46.530> this<00:03:46.799> is<00:03:47.040> I'm

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
angles right you know maybe this is I'm

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.800 
angles right you know maybe this is I'm
a<00:03:47.430> taller<00:03:47.669> guy<00:03:47.790> this<00:03:47.970> would<00:03:48.359> be<00:03:48.449> a<00:03:48.480> good<00:03:48.660> angle
