00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 yes hello friends in times of saturated 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.649
 markets you have to come up with something 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.809
 let the people buy again 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.280
 that has philips senseo too 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.389
 done with a new cnc and 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.170
 you can do this very nice 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.640
 comprehend 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.230
 we'll see what's going on right now 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.199
 changed what has been improved 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.230
 is different just times and you look old 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.019
 Senseo new look what of course 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.179
 that has just changed seriously 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.120
 here the design you can see it 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.010
 that has become much fancier than 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.829
 earlier this simple story so he 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.460
 Did you do something right in the direction 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.120
 design here also the distribution times in 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.149
 chrome 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.170
 that is, and above all, too 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.000
 height adjustable 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.890
 if we now come thus higher in the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.570
 Keys heard a nuisance was at the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.789
 You have to say old machine 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.559
 Let's take a look at it now 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.109
 after I start the on what has 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.550
 not changed 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:02.039
 unfortunately still small disadvantage is 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.449
 this water tank when you can 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.180
 So are the hire on the wall has 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.100
 i always find it terrible i have 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.049
 bought this story for the office 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.869
 for my staff who would like such a 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.770
 cnc and I drink untenable 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.240
 it's just too fiddly for me in the future 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.549
 love people at philips what speaks 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.060
 but at least optional here 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.860
 intervene to do it only on the edge 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.020
 so the machine has to what has 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.720
 we have changed 800 milliliters 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.869
 water and here in the 9th 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.820
 Almost exactly one liter of pure water 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.280
 that's an improvement 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.259
 next improvement is not so 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.630
 that nothing was done here at the 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.180
 Water tank is that's at least 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.079
 once clearly easier here 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.220
 it goes 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.490
 by saying he has one here 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.829
 always the form that is below 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.610
 It had to be loud on it was always a 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.219
 a bit fuller 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.790
 Today, as I said, the whole thing is still mine 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.920
 even easier, there are so and you 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.670
 have here again such a small lock 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.379
 which is good to pull out once 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.260
 In my opinion, quite a few 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.879
 improvement for the big ones for the 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.540
 girlfriend of the great speaker 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:20.430
 you can the old education was her 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.680
 end means you have all the more 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.500
 once in and then when the cup is full 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.400
 was that was was always fully grafted 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:33.360
 the ever therefore get this makes 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.569
 not really what he sees that and 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.950
 they even have air upstairs so well 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.290
 that is of course just for the 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.959
 people just said that okay with here 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.580
 the double filter big cup is there 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.660
 really good you see so there we have 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.430
 still air upwards 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.290
 I measure is then write as 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.840
 drive 3 which now customize ago 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.830
 it is feasible to the naked eye you can 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.360
 already recognize that the stock below 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.700
 the excavation area again clearly 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.250
 Enlarged here now accordingly 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.840
 at the new machine and what also 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.879
 it has been done below 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.760
 you have our portal story 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.540
 her the impression container in the 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.430
 collecting container 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.569
 You always have to be so fiddly here 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:19.230
 while we're touching this way or yes 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:21.750
 somewhere always pure coffee contain him so 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.360
 often the possibility quite simply too 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.269
 actually go two or so here 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.959
 many of you can do it all 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.209
 take out 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.730
 here, too, small improvements piece 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.440
 Tighten lead by piece and is 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.659
 the average stayed something 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.510
 rounded here but still find 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:41.459
 of course the design is here already 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.049
 much nicer and looks too 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.970
 Substantially high quality selection of 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.890
 history here yes I can find the 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.480
 it then makes the sum of all small things 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.730
 finally infinite for that reason 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.560
 the heating time tomorrow we clear again 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.349
 have this flap automatic 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.239
 that had to lift it up so high then 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.920
 in fact, it also stops today 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.989
 we have that much easier we fixes 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.450
 Open once and is a mistake 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.709
 Inside the thing is right up there 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.360
 I personally if you still with day 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.450
 otherwise his hand has more to do with something 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.690
 just want to set it up absolutely 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.100
 class 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.080
 So here again a clear 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.600
 Improvement of the writing instruments recently 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.060
 but was not a 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.530
 we'll finish a movement 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.520
 a little last test and that 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.290
 once from a to z on the spot once 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.350
 From close you can see it that way 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.240
 Toni is very nice supple Sun 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:38.150
 then we turn down we look 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:41.060
 time to warm up extra tv I have 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.590
 By the way, everywhere 2 patch in there and what 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.960
 I've got something up again 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.290
 very positive sign later through 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.290
 are 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.190
 hear this machine here is simmering 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.190
 much louder 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.490
 Here it is also on the ground 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:03.199
 if i adjust when i feel that 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.910
 but much quieter so you hear 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.240
 actually nothing more with her after 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.240
 the 9th 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.110
 such boards now you want live 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.380
 I have extra transparent cups 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.000
 taken here so was one 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:25.250
 little bit what the café result looks like 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.260
 is a bit boring right 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.010
 there are also links on the left side 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.590
 changed 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.590
 ok double that prohibits that 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.009
 So here through 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:44.009
 again from 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.660
 noise level 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.350
 no difference 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.590
 but no difference 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.590
 spahn 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:06.030
 fine water tank until stop 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.030
 so filled like the 800 milliliters 3000 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:15.090
 Here we see again the usual 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:18.509
 problem with the old senseo the 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:21.150
 pourer runs with mega 4 1 or away 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:22.680
 We do not have the pourer here 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.599
 you can do something quite the opposite 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:29.879
 you can pull up something zero 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:32.699
 he lays the exact problems the bauma 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:35.430
 I my that he something so out 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:36.659
 Often you have something about so freezes 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.939
 that is much better here 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:40.349
 I 've just got a power outlet 

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:44.279
 then the machines are both out 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:47.939
 foam from the café so that's here 

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:49.529
 with absolutely okay and also here with 

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:50.759
 absolutely okay here it can be that one 

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:53.150
 a little more play in it 

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:56.819
 is in the glass but you know that otherwise 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:59.550
 I think both are really good 

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:01.830
 So there is no deterioration 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:05.039
 so you have to always very s.der 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:08.279
 place or no improvement so 

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:09.749
 in my opinion that is completely the same 

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:11.939
 the Krämers better but again me 

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:13.770
 think it will feel a bit here 

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:17.339
 We have been the water glass or 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:22.169
 that's usually the ground looking times 

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:24.960
 after the bed here that looks neat 

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:27.210
 out and not worked through and here 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.039
 it looks a little better because 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:32.399
 this new machine presses itself a bit 

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:33.509
 more ran so there is the possible pressure 

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:35.399
 a little higher 

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:39.029
 they can also engage her but 

00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:40.800
 otherwise no improvement no 

00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:42.629
 deterioration in the matter many 

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.969
 small improvements that I find 

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:46.139
 from my side I have that time 

00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:48.180
 also not recommended 

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:50.009
 if the coffee is not so right 

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:53.939
 taste omit approx 

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:55.740
 but who senseo coffee mark is the one 

00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:57.659
 clear purchase recommendation a bit more 

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.999
 water in it new design here 

00:07:57.659 --> 00:08:03.270
 height adjustment and and points I have 

00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:05.430
 all of you called that yes of mine 

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:07.949
 page from I wish you all the best 

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:11.629
 stay healthy until then until the next one 

00:08:07.949 --> 00:08:11.629
 review minister probably fish
