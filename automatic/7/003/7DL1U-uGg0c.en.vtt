long this one is it was like really in
depth<00:06:02.670> and<00:06:03.420> I<00:06:03.480> kept<00:06:03.690> skipping<00:06:04.410> around<00:06:04.650> because

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:04.980 
depth and I kept skipping around because

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.160 
depth and I kept skipping around because
it's<00:06:05.130> too<00:06:05.310> much<00:06:05.460> nip<00:06:05.730> and<00:06:06.270> I<00:06:06.420> kept<00:06:06.660> losing<00:06:06.840> like

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.170 
it's too much nip and I kept losing like

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.070 
it's too much nip and I kept losing like
where<00:06:07.770> I<00:06:07.860> was
