00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
to go in door air flow regulator fan

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.689 
to go in door air flow regulator fan
three<00:00:20.189> legs<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.820> hopper<00:00:21.570> late<00:00:21.920> as<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.640> is

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
three legs and hopper late as it is

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.670 
three legs and hopper late as it is
super<00:00:24.000> fast<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.480> put<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:24.840> together<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.260> I

super fast to put this together so I

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.009 
super fast to put this together so I
would<00:00:26.099> start<00:00:26.310> by<00:00:26.430> lifting<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.910> up<00:00:27.060> this<00:00:27.810> way

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
would start by lifting it up this way

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:39.619 
would start by lifting it up this way
and<00:00:29.779> scroll<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.810> legs<00:00:31.769> in<00:00:31.949> like<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:38.629> last

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
and scroll the legs in like this last

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.280 
and scroll the legs in like this last
one<00:00:41.989> here<00:00:42.989> we<00:00:43.020> go

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
one here we go

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.569 
one here we go
there's<00:00:43.649> all<00:00:43.890> securely<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.940> deck<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:46.579> I've

already with the door handle on so

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.500 
already with the door handle on so
that's<00:00:50.309> just<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.640> matter<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.940> putting<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.480> a

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
that's just a matter of putting in a

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.380 
that's just a matter of putting in a
couple<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.989> screws<00:00:52.230> screw<00:00:52.980> through<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.390> like

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
couple of screws screw through it like

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.680 
couple of screws screw through it like
this<00:00:54.539> door<00:00:55.410> goes<00:00:55.590> on<00:00:55.829> next<00:00:56.340> up<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.180> burner

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
this door goes on next up is the burner

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.860 
this door goes on next up is the burner
unit<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.859> has<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.219> cradle<00:00:59.760> inside<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.690> and

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
unit so this has a cradle inside it and

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.540 
unit so this has a cradle inside it and
that<00:01:01.199> goes<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:01.980> have<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.309> lower

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
that goes so that you have the lower

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.640 
that goes so that you have the lower
part<00:01:02.969> kind<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.359> pointing<00:01:03.719> towards<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.350> oven

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
part kind of pointing towards the oven

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.530 
part kind of pointing towards the oven
itself<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.460> what<00:01:05.549> I'll<00:01:05.670> do<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.850> I'll<00:01:06.060> put<00:01:06.090> half

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
itself so what I'll do is I'll put half

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.399 
itself so what I'll do is I'll put half
of<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.840> inside<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.650> then<00:01:08.150> place<00:01:09.409> place

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
of it inside this and then place place

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.789 
of it inside this and then place place
it<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.939> from<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> back<00:01:12.590> like<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.740> and

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
it in from the back like that and

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.820 
it in from the back like that and
securely<00:01:14.460> just<00:01:15.030> slide<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.450> down<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:15.689> it's<00:01:16.680> got

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
securely just slide it down so it's got

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.740

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
battery pack and that's how you assemble

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.950 
battery pack and that's how you assemble
an<00:02:07.469> only
