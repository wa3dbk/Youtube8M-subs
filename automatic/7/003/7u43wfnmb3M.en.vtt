instead of one side it's got two and

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.660 
instead of one side it's got two and
then<00:03:36.959> this<00:03:37.170> actually<00:03:37.410> came<00:03:37.680> in<00:03:37.799> a<00:03:37.890> set<00:03:38.070> of<00:03:38.280> four

then this actually came in a set of four
there's<00:03:39.090> one<00:03:39.420> a<00:03:39.630> little<00:03:39.930> smaller<00:03:40.200> than<00:03:40.470> this

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
there's one a little smaller than this

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.830 
there's one a little smaller than this
one<00:03:40.709> it<00:03:41.130> comes<00:03:41.310> about<00:03:41.459> two<00:03:41.730> here<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.209> then<00:03:42.810> a

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
one it comes about two here and then a

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.400
