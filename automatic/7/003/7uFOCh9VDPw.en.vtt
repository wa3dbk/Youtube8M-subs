00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:07.460
 just continue the theme of massage 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.580
 I almost all my clients 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.950
 recommend 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.300
 exercise 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.400
 highly recommend it 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.650
 gymnastics because 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.140
 only they improve quality improve 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:24.150
 blood circulation during gymnastics 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:27.840
 exercise is the load on your back with 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.619
 to improve the elasticity of ductile 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.710
 muscle carcass properties that holds 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.989
 spine because in people who have 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:41.129
 who often sit sedentary 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:47.550
 life is formed let's say so krepatura 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.969
 the muscles holding the spine are these 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.420
 muscles 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:55.030
 compressed and physically squeezed 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.730
 vessels feeding the brain and 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.379
 nourishing hair follicle therefore 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.160
 best gymnastic exercises 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:05.940
 this is yoga fitness pilates swimming but 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.310
 nothing 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.050
 gym weight lifting this 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.870
 There is a certain load on these muscles 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.960
 they are compacted even more 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.840
 increase in volume and improve 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.300
 blood circulation of the brain and 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.720
 scalp 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:28.990
 so when choosing what kind of 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.140
 I recommend sports very much 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.510
 gymnastics yoga 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.800
 pretty good at helping 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:41.620
 In this regard, because this is the maximum 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.480
 maximum working muscles and those muscles 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.750
 who are little involved in our movement 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.820
 in our daily life also yoga 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.330
 so normalizes blood circulation 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.900
 the brain that passes and 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:58.600
 symptoms somewhere vascular dystonia 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:02.490
 improving the situation of osteochondrosis 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.830
 there is improved mobility of the vertebrae 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.580
 thus, we still improve the overall 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.480
 hair health and it â€™s still our kind 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.430
 inside this hair is all the same 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.320
 manifestation of our outer manifestation 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.320
 our inner health
