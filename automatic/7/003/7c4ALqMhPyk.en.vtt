thing<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.670> need<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.850> do<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.899> need<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.109> know

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
thing you need to do is you need to know

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.600 
thing you need to do is you need to know
how<00:01:02.309> wide<00:01:02.789> your<00:01:03.210> Locker<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.830> door<00:01:05.070> from

how wide your Locker is on the door from

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.840 
how wide your Locker is on the door from
inside<00:01:06.570> here<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.170> inside<00:01:07.740> over<00:01:08.040> here<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.820> I

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
inside here to inside over here so I

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.210 
inside here to inside over here so I
have<00:01:09.090> my<00:01:09.270> ruler<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.840> I'm<00:01:10.500> going<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:11.010> measure

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
have my ruler and I'm going to measure

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.940 
have my ruler and I'm going to measure
and<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:12.510> one<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.409> just<00:01:14.369> under<00:01:15.240> 9<00:01:15.840> inches<00:01:16.500> and

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
and this one is just under 9 inches and

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.179 
and this one is just under 9 inches and
so<00:01:17.549> I'll<00:01:17.909> probably<00:01:18.180> just<00:01:18.509> cut<00:01:19.140> eight<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.100> a

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
so I'll probably just cut eight and a

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.679 
so I'll probably just cut eight and a
half<00:01:20.840> just<00:01:21.840> because<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.619> doesn't<00:01:22.860> really

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
half just because it doesn't really

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.230 
half just because it doesn't really
matter<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:24.840> much<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.890> know<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.670> I'm<00:01:26.909> gonna

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
matter so much so I know that I'm gonna

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.230 
matter so much so I know that I'm gonna
do<00:01:27.570> eight<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> half<00:01:28.250> so<00:01:29.250> what<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:29.939> have<00:01:30.210> here

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
do eight and a half so what I have here

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.510 
do eight and a half so what I have here

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520
