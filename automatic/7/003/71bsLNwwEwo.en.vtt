00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.170
 today we are going to talk about a topic 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.679
 exciting what is the theme of the 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.860
 doctor-patient relationship you know 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.519
 that when a patient approaches a 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.210
 doctor's office waits for help 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:24.210
 solution and the approach to the problem that 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.150
 what afflicts that makes the doctor what 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.789
 receive with all the desire to collaborate in 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.940
 this situation but there is a relationship 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.910
 between them that is sometimes called chemistry 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.840
 of the doctor-patient relationship that 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.469
 alters for reasons either of the patient or of the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:48.180
 medical and that generates interference in 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.510
 this situation and cause a let's say a 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.770
 perverse sequel to the relationship 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.039
 altering the results of what one 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.079
 is really waiting for it is 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.899
 took the studies of a famous 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.180
 English researcher called bÃ¡lint that 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.040
 in his famous book 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:12.300
 the doctor the disease and his patient 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:15.210
 explains how the same medicine given to 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.690
 several cardiologists from england for 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.750
 that gave me their ability to effect 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.150
 therapeutic they had very different 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.540
 therapeutic effects on one and other 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.930
 doctors and when he met all the whole 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.060
 the study and it was done it was seen that there was 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.440
 a problem in the relationship 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.570
 doctor-patient of certain colleagues with 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.990
 his patients who did not have the effect 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.600
 therapeutic medication in this 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.960
 antihypertensive case is to say for 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.140
 treat high blood pressure and that's 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.170
 It was because he had not acted with that 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.440
 favorable chemistry that allowed the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:03.030
 therapeutic result was the best 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:06.210
 this led to studies being done with 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.580
 cameras in which in a doctor's office 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.590
 you see what is happening with the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.590
 consult but the patient and the doctor do not 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.170
 they see the person who is watching and 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.980
 then call hessel camera that 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.400
 place then you observe the problem is 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.830
 say the patient comes to the office and 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.230
 apart from his illness he brings his 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.530
 personality and the doctor in addition to 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.140
 want to help has his personality but 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.110
 if there are irritative factors towards 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.050
 personality the doctor or the doctor 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.590
 to the personality of the patient 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.020
 totally alter what he came to look for 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.470
 the patient who is improving their 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.850
 symptoms and begin to emerge 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.880
 situations totally unrelated to the 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.640
 situation is to say that if this is not 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.490
 well studied well analyzed the 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.640
 final result of the therapy will be 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.700
 absolutely bad 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.760
 in the case of children know that the 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.120
 Pediatrician activity and attitude about 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.220
 the child is through the mother if he does not 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.480
 has an excellent mother 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.850
 relationship 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.000
 an excellent positive factor in the 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:23.209
 doctor-patient relationship the child is going to 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.440
 indirectly feel that situation for 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:29.360
 that is absolutely necessary that the 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.630
 doctor have towards the mother a 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.120
 positive ascendant have an attitude 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.850
 in which the mother feels that 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.850
 doctor wants to help her and the child goes to 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.670
 receive directly or indirectly that 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.190
 situation that we try to 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.950
 possible our queries to create 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.100
 always climates of affect of positivity 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.130
 of questions 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.530
 clear to clarify what parents do not 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.239
 they understand because many times the doctor 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.470
 speaks in terms that the father does not 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:05.000
 understands then is fundamental 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.770
 tell you you understood is the term 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.650
 know what I meant 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:14.300
 or not good if it is not I will clarify with 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:17.060
 more with more words at your fingertips what 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.130
 that I am explaining and that makes 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.950
 the mother leaves with the idea that 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.140
 doctor is really a positive being that 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.120
 he wants to help us we must 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.640
 understand this from the first moment 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.730
 those who do medicine because every time 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.520
 that we have our own problems 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:37.640
 personal we never take it to the 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.330
 consult and try to take out that 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.280
 Situation outside is outside of us 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.560
 for the woman to take only 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.290
 our positive side and let's leave 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.560
 eliminated in the basket the part 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.560
 negative
