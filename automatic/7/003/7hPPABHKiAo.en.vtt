I'm going to do today is talk you
through<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.040> machine<00:00:35.339> right<00:00:35.610> back<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.940> basics

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
through the machine right back to basics

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.700 
through the machine right back to basics
because<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.570> think<00:00:36.750> once<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.019> understand<00:00:37.530> your

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
because I think once you understand your

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.860 
because I think once you understand your
machine<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.730> can<00:00:38.879> then<00:00:38.970> move<00:00:39.150> on<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.329> stitches

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
machine we can then move on to stitches

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.020 
machine we can then move on to stitches
and<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.650> will<00:00:40.769> have<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> confidence<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.909> do

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
and you will have the confidence to do

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.750 
and you will have the confidence to do
this<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.510> any<00:00:42.720> of<00:00:42.900> your<00:00:43.050> projects

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
this in any of your projects

now we've got a regular foot on here so

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.090 
now we've got a regular foot on here so
the<00:00:47.670> first<00:00:47.879> thing<00:00:48.089> we<00:00:48.180> need<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.510> do<00:00:48.860> is<00:00:49.860> take

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:53.369 
that off and you'll see these teeth now

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:54.920 
that off and you'll see these teeth now
when<00:00:53.519> we<00:00:53.640> do<00:00:53.760> ordinary<00:00:54.119> sewing<00:00:54.360> those<00:00:54.629> teeth

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
when we do ordinary sewing those teeth

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.570 
when we do ordinary sewing those teeth
work<00:00:55.229> with<00:00:55.439> that<00:00:55.559> foot<00:00:55.799> to<00:00:55.949> push<00:00:56.189> the<00:00:56.400> fabric

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
work with that foot to push the fabric

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.729 
work with that foot to push the fabric
through<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.390> controls<00:00:57.869> the<00:00:58.080> speed<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.619> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
through that controls the speed of the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.100 
through that controls the speed of the
fabric<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.460> length<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.760> your<00:00:59.850> stitch<00:01:00.180> now

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
fabric and the length of your stitch now

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.719 
fabric and the length of your stitch now
what<00:01:01.350> we're<00:01:01.500> doing<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.739> disengaging<00:01:02.220> that<00:01:02.430> and

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:02.729 
what we're doing is disengaging that and

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:03.979 
what we're doing is disengaging that and
that's<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.970> only<00:01:03.390> difference<00:01:03.540> between

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
that's the only difference between

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.920 
that's the only difference between
normal<00:01:04.409> sewing<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.009> free<00:01:05.519> machining<00:01:06.030> nothing

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
normal sewing and free machining nothing

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.840 
normal sewing and free machining nothing
to<00:01:07.049> be<00:01:07.140> frightened<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.619> first<00:01:08.549> thing<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:08.729> have

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
to be frightened of first thing we have

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.969 
to be frightened of first thing we have
to<00:01:08.939> do<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.299> disengage<00:01:09.780> these<00:01:10.290> or<00:01:10.500> lower<00:01:10.710> them

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
to do is disengage these or lower them

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.460 
to do is disengage these or lower them
now<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.670> my<00:01:11.850> machine<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.990> button<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
now on my machine it's a button on the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.740 
now on my machine it's a button on the
side<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.890> probably<00:01:14.159> someone<00:01:14.400> go<00:01:14.549> down<00:01:14.790> on

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
side you probably someone go down on

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.210 
side you probably someone go down on
some<00:01:16.140> machines<00:01:16.470> as<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> lever<00:01:16.890> at<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.130> front

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
some machines as a lever at the front

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.340 
some machines as a lever at the front
and<00:01:17.700> some<00:01:18.360> machines<00:01:18.659> there's<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.960> lever<00:01:19.140> at<00:01:19.320> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
and some machines there's a lever at the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.980 
and some machines there's a lever at the
back<00:01:19.909> you<00:01:20.909> need<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.150> look<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.360> your<00:01:21.510> handbook

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
back you need to look in your handbook

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.899 
back you need to look in your handbook
for<00:01:22.140> your<00:01:22.350> machine<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.740> see<00:01:23.100> how<00:01:23.550> you<00:01:23.610> lower

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
for your machine to see how you lower

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.630 
for your machine to see how you lower
the<00:01:24.090> feed<00:01:24.300> dogs<00:01:24.330> on<00:01:24.990> some<00:01:25.530> very<00:01:26.010> old<00:01:26.100> machines

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
the feed dogs on some very old machines

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.220 
the feed dogs on some very old machines
you<00:01:26.790> can't<00:01:27.030> do<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.510> we<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.750> darning

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
you can't do that and we have a darning

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.140 
you can't do that and we have a darning
plate<00:01:28.260> that<00:01:28.740> covers<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.250> stitch<00:01:29.490> plate<00:01:29.760> and

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
plate that covers this stitch plate and

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.399 
plate that covers this stitch plate and
so<00:01:30.810> those<00:01:31.050> feet<00:01:31.350> are<00:01:32.280> covered<00:01:32.580> up<00:01:33.260> once<00:01:34.260> you've

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
so those feet are covered up once you've

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.770 
so those feet are covered up once you've
done<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.700> we<00:01:35.700> then<00:01:35.880> put<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.420> special

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
done that we then put on a special

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.110 
done that we then put on a special
embroidery<00:01:37.590> foot<00:01:40.550> and<00:01:41.550> the<00:01:41.700> difference<00:01:42.000> with

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
embroidery foot and the difference with

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.490 
embroidery foot and the difference with
this<00:01:42.240> foot<00:01:42.510> and<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.720> regular<00:01:43.020> foot<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.350> it's

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
this foot and the regular foot is it's

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.980 
this foot and the regular foot is it's
on<00:01:43.620> a<00:01:43.650> spring<00:01:44.390> sometimes<00:01:45.390> it's<00:01:45.750> called<00:01:45.840> a

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
on a spring sometimes it's called a

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.110 
on a spring sometimes it's called a
darning<00:01:46.380> foot<00:01:46.409> but<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.549> same<00:01:47.729> thing<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
darning foot but it's the same thing the

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.270 
darning foot but it's the same thing the
idea<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.930> spring<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.979> just

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
idea is of the spring is that it just

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.100 
idea is of the spring is that it just
hits<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.729> fabric<00:01:51.150> when<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.360> needle<00:01:51.690> goes<00:01:51.720> in

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
hits the fabric when the needle goes in

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.410 
hits the fabric when the needle goes in
so<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:52.530> not<00:01:52.799> stopping<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.760> movement<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.360> you

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
so it's not stopping the movement so you

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.830 
so it's not stopping the movement so you
have<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.780> complete<00:01:55.290> freedom<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.979> movement

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
have that complete freedom of movement

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.149 
have that complete freedom of movement
so<00:01:57.840> that's<00:01:58.020> your<00:01:58.170> machine<00:01:58.440> set<00:01:58.680> up<00:01:58.830> for<00:01:59.010> free

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
so that's your machine set up for free

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.780 
so that's your machine set up for free
machining<00:01:59.670> that's<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.210> only<00:02:00.510> difference

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
machining that's the only difference

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.810 
machining that's the only difference
we<00:02:02.790> do<00:02:02.940> have<00:02:03.150> tension<00:02:03.630> dials<00:02:04.200> as<00:02:04.380> well<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.979> so

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
we do have tension dials as well and so

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.820 
we do have tension dials as well and so
most<00:02:06.630> machines<00:02:06.780> there<00:02:07.140> at<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.350> top<00:02:07.530> somewhere

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
most machines there at the top somewhere

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.780 
most machines there at the top somewhere
and<00:02:08.190> they're<00:02:08.819> numbered<00:02:09.560> with<00:02:10.580> usually<00:02:11.580> from

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
and they're numbered with usually from

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.770 
and they're numbered with usually from
about<00:02:12.030> 1<00:02:12.239> up<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.540> 9<00:02:12.720> or<00:02:12.930> 10<00:02:13.580> normal<00:02:14.580> tension<00:02:15.299> for

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
about 1 up to 9 or 10 normal tension for

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.660 
about 1 up to 9 or 10 normal tension for
the<00:02:15.810> top<00:02:16.110> thread<00:02:16.439> is<00:02:16.620> about<00:02:16.830> number<00:02:17.099> 4<00:02:17.310> or<00:02:17.430> 5

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
the top thread is about number 4 or 5

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.030 
the top thread is about number 4 or 5
and<00:02:18.000> on<00:02:18.780> my<00:02:19.080> machine<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.500> has<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.620> little<00:02:19.769> red

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
and on my machine it has a little red

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.920 
and on my machine it has a little red
dial<00:02:20.519> on<00:02:20.760> most<00:02:21.030> machines<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.510> has<00:02:21.629> an<00:02:21.750> area

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
dial on most machines it has an area

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.350 
dial on most machines it has an area
where<00:02:22.290> it's<00:02:22.439> on<00:02:22.560> normal

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
where it's on normal

where it's on normal
for<00:02:24.140> free<00:02:24.320> machining<00:02:24.830> we<00:02:24.950> take<00:02:25.250> that<00:02:25.430> down<00:02:25.700> a

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
for free machining we take that down a

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.400 
for free machining we take that down a
little<00:02:25.850> bit<00:02:26.090> but<00:02:26.390> once<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:26.660> start<00:02:26.960> showing<00:02:27.320> you

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
little bit but once I start showing you

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.910 
little bit but once I start showing you
the<00:02:27.560> stitches<00:02:27.980> you'll<00:02:28.550> understand<00:02:29.060> why<00:02:29.920> and

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
the stitches you'll understand why and

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.350 
the stitches you'll understand why and
apart<00:02:31.190> from<00:02:31.250> that<00:02:31.370> everything's<00:02:31.910> fine<00:02:32.120> now

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
apart from that everything's fine now

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.880 
apart from that everything's fine now
but<00:02:32.510> before<00:02:32.660> we<00:02:32.870> get<00:02:33.050> started<00:02:33.110> there<00:02:33.710> are<00:02:33.740> one

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
but before we get started there are one

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.110 
but before we get started there are one
or<00:02:34.010> two<00:02:34.040> other<00:02:34.130> little<00:02:34.550> things<00:02:34.730> to<00:02:34.940> know<00:02:35.090> about

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
or two other little things to know about

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.430 
or two other little things to know about
the<00:02:35.450> machine<00:02:36.310> cleaning<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.580> now<00:02:38.540> I<00:02:38.840> sometimes

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
the machine cleaning it now I sometimes

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.930 
the machine cleaning it now I sometimes
teach<00:02:39.800> classes<00:02:40.280> and<00:02:40.310> people<00:02:40.520> have<00:02:40.730> never

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
teach classes and people have never

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:41.980 
teach classes and people have never
cleaned<00:02:41.180> their<00:02:41.420> machines<00:02:41.750> because<00:02:41.960> they

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
cleaned their machines because they

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.750 
cleaned their machines because they
don't<00:02:42.230> know<00:02:42.320> they<00:02:42.440> have<00:02:42.560> to<00:02:42.710> do<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:43.010> when<00:02:43.520> we<00:02:43.640> do

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
don't know they have to do it when we do

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.940 
don't know they have to do it when we do
free<00:02:43.970> machining<00:02:44.450> you<00:02:44.540> get<00:02:44.660> a<00:02:44.690> lot<00:02:44.990> of<00:02:45.350> fibers

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
free machining you get a lot of fibers

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.280 
free machining you get a lot of fibers
and<00:02:45.980> threads<00:02:46.520> come<00:02:46.760> on<00:02:46.910> so<00:02:47.180> we<00:02:47.810> need<00:02:47.960> to<00:02:48.050> take

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
and threads come on so we need to take

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.950 
and threads come on so we need to take
off<00:02:48.470> this<00:02:48.710> stitch<00:02:48.950> plate<00:02:49.220> again<00:02:50.120> mine<00:02:50.540> lifts

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
off this stitch plate again mine lifts

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.310 
off this stitch plate again mine lifts
up

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
up

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.950 
up
sometimes<00:02:51.740> it's<00:02:51.950> screw<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.790> take<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.120> off<00:02:53.300> you

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
sometimes it's screw to take it off you

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.960 
sometimes it's screw to take it off you
need<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.200> look<00:02:54.290> in<00:02:54.410> your<00:02:54.500> handbook<00:02:54.860> and<00:02:55.820> that

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
need to look in your handbook and that

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.160 
need to look in your handbook and that
will<00:02:56.060> show<00:02:56.210> you<00:02:56.270> how<00:02:56.420> to<00:02:56.450> remove<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:56.960> I'm

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
will show you how to remove that I'm

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.130 
will show you how to remove that I'm
just<00:02:57.320> gonna<00:02:57.410> press<00:02:57.650> that<00:02:57.830> here<00:02:58.660> now<00:02:59.660> you<00:02:59.960> will

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
just gonna press that here now you will

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.280 
just gonna press that here now you will
see<00:03:00.440> there's<00:03:01.280> a<00:03:01.340> lot<00:03:01.640> of<00:03:01.880> fluff<00:03:02.240> and<00:03:02.540> muck<00:03:03.080> in

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
see there's a lot of fluff and muck in

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.620 
see there's a lot of fluff and muck in
there<00:03:03.470> can<00:03:03.740> you<00:03:03.830> think<00:03:04.330> because<00:03:05.330> I've<00:03:05.450> been

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
there can you think because I've been

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.630 
there can you think because I've been
very<00:03:05.870> bad<00:03:06.110> and<00:03:06.410> not<00:03:06.560> cleaned<00:03:06.890> it<00:03:07.070> this<00:03:07.160> week<00:03:07.459> we

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
very bad and not cleaned it this week we

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.910 
very bad and not cleaned it this week we
really<00:03:07.970> should<00:03:08.180> clean<00:03:08.420> machines<00:03:08.840> every<00:03:09.440> 5<00:03:09.890> or

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
really should clean machines every 5 or

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.670 
really should clean machines every 5 or
6<00:03:10.250> hours<00:03:10.520> of<00:03:10.610> use<00:03:11.050> so<00:03:12.050> I'm<00:03:12.230> just<00:03:12.350> gonna<00:03:12.440> brush

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
6 hours of use so I'm just gonna brush

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.500 
6 hours of use so I'm just gonna brush
it<00:03:12.830> out<00:03:12.890> I'm<00:03:13.220> not<00:03:13.459> gonna<00:03:13.610> blow<00:03:13.850> it<00:03:14.090> because<00:03:14.420> if

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
it out I'm not gonna blow it because if

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.380 
it out I'm not gonna blow it because if
I<00:03:14.600> blow<00:03:14.870> it<00:03:14.990> it'll<00:03:15.230> push<00:03:15.500> it<00:03:15.620> back<00:03:15.770> in<00:03:15.980> so<00:03:16.190> it

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
I blow it it'll push it back in so it

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:24.490 
I blow it it'll push it back in so it
just<00:03:22.330> now<00:03:23.330> I<00:03:23.360> can't<00:03:23.780> get<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:24.080> some<00:03:24.260> of<00:03:24.350> it

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
just now I can't get to some of it

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.320 
just now I can't get to some of it
because<00:03:24.950> some<00:03:25.100> of<00:03:25.130> its<00:03:25.310> down<00:03:25.610> here<00:03:25.880> in<00:03:26.150> the

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
because some of its down here in the

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.250 
because some of its down here in the
bobbin<00:03:26.630> race<00:03:26.840> so<00:03:28.570> I'm<00:03:29.570> also<00:03:29.750> going<00:03:29.989> to<00:03:30.080> take

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
bobbin race so I'm also going to take

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.570 
bobbin race so I'm also going to take
all<00:03:30.410> that<00:03:30.530> apart<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:30.980> there's<00:03:31.160> no<00:03:31.250> need<00:03:31.459> to

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
all that apart and there's no need to

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.710 
all that apart and there's no need to
worry<00:03:31.790> that<00:03:31.880> you<00:03:32.060> won't<00:03:32.150> get<00:03:32.300> it<00:03:32.450> back<00:03:32.480> in

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
worry that you won't get it back in

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.190 
worry that you won't get it back in
again<00:03:32.900> because<00:03:33.050> you<00:03:33.260> will<00:03:34.690> we<00:03:35.690> just<00:03:35.900> give<00:03:36.019> that

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
again because you will we just give that

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.660 
again because you will we just give that
a<00:03:36.410> bit<00:03:36.860> of<00:03:36.920> a<00:03:37.040> brush<00:03:37.280> there<00:03:39.370> all<00:03:40.370> sorts<00:03:40.519> of

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
a bit of a brush there all sorts of

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.650 
a bit of a brush there all sorts of
threads<00:03:41.000> coming<00:03:41.390> out<00:03:41.510> now<00:03:43.360> so<00:03:44.360> that's<00:03:44.570> the

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
threads coming out now so that's the

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.390 
threads coming out now so that's the
first<00:03:44.930> thing<00:03:45.140> we<00:03:45.200> really<00:03:45.590> need<00:03:45.739> to<00:03:45.860> do<00:03:46.010> is<00:03:46.220> make

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
first thing we really need to do is make

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.120 
first thing we really need to do is make
sure<00:03:46.430> your<00:03:46.790> machines<00:03:47.180> are<00:03:47.360> nice<00:03:47.480> and<00:03:47.690> clean

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
have to get down here where I can see

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.729

let me put that back I'm all set you're

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.180 
let me put that back I'm all set you're
on<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:21.169> other<00:04:21.199> little<00:04:21.500> thing<00:04:21.709> we<00:04:21.829> need<00:04:21.979> is

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
on the other little thing we need is

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.500 
on the other little thing we need is
obviously<00:04:22.490> our<00:04:22.610> other<00:04:22.790> equipment<00:04:23.240> we<00:04:23.300> need<00:04:23.449> to

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
obviously our other equipment we need to

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.270 
obviously our other equipment we need to
think<00:04:23.630> about<00:04:23.750> our<00:04:24.080> needles<00:04:24.530> or<00:04:24.979> something

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
think about our needles or something

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.270 
think about our needles or something
quite<00:04:25.430> important<00:04:25.910> as<00:04:26.000> well<00:04:26.180> I<00:04:26.860> think<00:04:27.860> probably

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
quite important as well I think probably

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.000 
quite important as well I think probably
I'm<00:04:28.639> just<00:04:29.449> as<00:04:29.570> guilty<00:04:29.690> as<00:04:29.900> most<00:04:30.199> people<00:04:30.590> but<00:04:30.860> we

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
I'm just as guilty as most people but we

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.650 
I'm just as guilty as most people but we
only<00:04:31.220> ever<00:04:31.490> change<00:04:31.850> our<00:04:32.060> needles<00:04:32.389> when<00:04:32.540> they

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
only ever change our needles when they

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.629 
only ever change our needles when they
break<00:04:32.960> you<00:04:33.770> think<00:04:33.919> I<00:04:33.979> would<00:04:34.100> be<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:34.280> problem

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
break you think I would be the problem

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.310 
break you think I would be the problem
and<00:04:34.790> it<00:04:34.850> breaks<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:35.210> we<00:04:35.300> change<00:04:35.540> them<00:04:35.690> again

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
and it breaks and we change them again

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.629 
and it breaks and we change them again
we<00:04:36.470> should<00:04:36.530> really<00:04:36.830> change<00:04:37.070> them<00:04:37.280> regularly

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
we should really change them regularly

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.689 
we should really change them regularly
and<00:04:38.830> ideally<00:04:39.830> if<00:04:40.040> you're<00:04:40.220> working<00:04:40.460> on<00:04:40.639> a

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
and ideally if you're working on a

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:42.490 
and ideally if you're working on a
project<00:04:41.210> and<00:04:41.449> you're<00:04:41.660> changing<00:04:42.139> a<00:04:42.229> thread

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
project and you're changing a thread

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.719 
project and you're changing a thread
that's<00:04:43.010> when<00:04:43.220> you<00:04:43.310> should<00:04:43.460> change<00:04:43.610> your

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
that's when you should change your

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.000 
that's when you should change your
needle<00:04:44.120> so<00:04:44.270> if<00:04:44.600> I've<00:04:44.720> spent<00:04:45.110> four<00:04:45.740> or<00:04:45.860> five

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
needle so if I've spent four or five

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.370 
needle so if I've spent four or five
hours<00:04:46.400> using<00:04:46.760> a<00:04:46.820> metallic<00:04:47.300> thread<00:04:47.630> that

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
hours using a metallic thread that

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.170 
hours using a metallic thread that
thread<00:04:48.680> will<00:04:48.740> rub<00:04:49.130> a<00:04:49.280> groove<00:04:49.550> in<00:04:49.760> the<00:04:49.850> needle

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
thread will rub a groove in the needle

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.590 
thread will rub a groove in the needle
it<00:04:50.780> makes<00:04:51.229> its<00:04:51.410> own<00:04:51.530> mark<00:04:51.889> as<00:04:52.340> it<00:04:52.400> were<00:04:52.610> so<00:04:52.880> then

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
it makes its own mark as it were so then

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.270 
it makes its own mark as it were so then
if<00:04:53.720> I<00:04:53.840> change<00:04:54.110> to<00:04:54.260> a<00:04:54.289> different<00:04:54.440> thread<00:04:54.860> like<00:04:55.250> a

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
if I change to a different thread like a

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.969 
if I change to a different thread like a
cotton<00:04:55.729> that<00:04:56.449> won't<00:04:56.690> sit<00:04:57.050> in<00:04:57.350> that<00:04:57.410> mark<00:04:57.860> that

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
cotton that won't sit in that mark that

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.500 
cotton that won't sit in that mark that
the<00:04:58.190> metallic<00:04:58.580> thread<00:04:58.820> has<00:04:58.940> made<00:04:59.150> and<00:04:59.389> that

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
the metallic thread has made and that

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.870 
the metallic thread has made and that
rubs<00:04:59.840> it<00:05:00.050> so<00:05:00.440> one<00:05:00.949> of<00:05:00.979> the<00:05:01.130> biggest<00:05:01.430> problems

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
rubs it so one of the biggest problems

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.340 
rubs it so one of the biggest problems
you<00:05:02.000> often<00:05:02.300> get<00:05:02.419> with<00:05:02.570> free<00:05:02.750> machining<00:05:03.229> is

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
you often get with free machining is

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.980 
you often get with free machining is
thread<00:05:03.740> shredding<00:05:04.190> and<00:05:04.340> breaking<00:05:04.850> and<00:05:05.330> that

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
thread shredding and breaking and that

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.020 
thread shredding and breaking and that
usually<00:05:06.169> is<00:05:06.470> you<00:05:06.919> need<00:05:07.070> a<00:05:07.100> new<00:05:07.280> needle<00:05:07.520> it's

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
usually is you need a new needle it's

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.520 
usually is you need a new needle it's

that simple so we need fresh needle I

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.290 
that simple so we need fresh needle I
actually<00:05:12.979> buy<00:05:13.250> them<00:05:13.430> in<00:05:13.550> boxes<00:05:13.699> of<00:05:13.880> a<00:05:13.970> hundred

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
actually buy them in boxes of a hundred

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.520 
actually buy them in boxes of a hundred
because<00:05:14.389> then<00:05:14.660> you're<00:05:14.960> not<00:05:14.990> Precious<00:05:15.440> about

long<00:05:17.240> time<00:05:17.479> I<00:05:18.310> use<00:05:19.310> a<00:05:19.520> universal<00:05:21.430> 9090<00:05:22.430> is<00:05:22.520> the

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
long time I use a universal 9090 is the

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:24.219 
long time I use a universal 9090 is the
size<00:05:22.880> and<00:05:22.910> the<00:05:23.270> universal<00:05:23.810> is<00:05:23.870> the<00:05:23.990> type<00:05:24.200> of

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
needle it used to be a size 14 I tend to

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.320 
needle it used to be a size 14 I tend to
use<00:05:28.099> nothing<00:05:28.310> else<00:05:28.520> other<00:05:28.760> than<00:05:28.910> that<00:05:28.970> you<00:05:29.180> can

use nothing else other than that you can
buy<00:05:29.539> specialist<00:05:30.110> needles<00:05:30.440> and<00:05:30.530> you<00:05:30.620> can<00:05:30.740> pay

types of needles and some people prefer
to<00:05:33.950> use<00:05:34.250> them<00:05:34.430> but<00:05:34.550> I<00:05:34.610> find<00:05:34.880> that<00:05:35.030> works<00:05:35.270> for<00:05:35.510> me

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
to use them but I find that works for me

to use them but I find that works for me
if<00:05:36.050> I<00:05:36.260> have<00:05:36.410> a<00:05:36.440> problem<00:05:36.860> I<00:05:36.979> might<00:05:37.280> go<00:05:37.430> up<00:05:37.639> and

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
if I have a problem I might go up and

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.589 
if I have a problem I might go up and
take<00:05:38.060> a<00:05:38.120> size<00:05:38.690> 100<00:05:39.260> that's<00:05:39.740> all

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:40.599 
take a size 100 that's all

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.930 
take a size 100 that's all
so--that's<00:05:41.599> needles<00:05:42.610> the<00:05:43.610> other<00:05:43.729> thing

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
so--that's needles the other thing

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.210 
so--that's needles the other thing
fabrics<00:05:44.450> and<00:05:44.599> threads<00:05:44.870> right<00:05:45.860> now<00:05:46.039> you'll<00:05:46.190> see

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
fabrics and threads right now you'll see

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:56.539 
machine embroidery but it's so nice to

machine embroidery but it's so nice to
have<00:05:56.599> some<00:05:56.810> of<00:05:56.870> these<00:05:56.960> are<00:05:57.080> any<00:05:57.169> special<00:05:57.470> shiny

ones<00:05:58.630> the<00:05:59.630> one<00:05:59.780> that<00:06:00.050> I<00:06:00.080> probably<00:06:00.289> use<00:06:00.560> most<00:06:00.740> of

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
ones the one that I probably use most of

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.770 
ones the one that I probably use most of
all<00:06:01.039> is<00:06:01.190> a<00:06:01.220> rayon<00:06:01.610> thread<00:06:01.970> I<00:06:02.180> don't<00:06:02.479> use<00:06:02.599> any

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
all is a rayon thread I don't use any

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.150 
all is a rayon thread I don't use any
particular<00:06:03.289> make<00:06:03.470> I've<00:06:03.680> got<00:06:03.800> lots<00:06:04.039> of

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
particular make I've got lots of

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.190 
particular make I've got lots of
different<00:06:04.430> makes<00:06:04.610> here<00:06:04.970> the<00:06:05.660> one<00:06:05.840> thing<00:06:06.080> I

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
different makes here the one thing I

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.740 
different makes here the one thing I
will<00:06:06.470> say<00:06:06.500> is<00:06:07.070> you<00:06:08.000> get<00:06:08.270> what<00:06:08.419> you<00:06:08.510> pay<00:06:08.720> for

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
will say is you get what you pay for

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.290 
will say is you get what you pay for
with<00:06:09.349> your<00:06:09.530> threads<00:06:09.800> threads<00:06:10.490> can<00:06:10.760> seem<00:06:11.060> quite

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
with your threads threads can seem quite

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.779 
with your threads threads can seem quite
expensive<00:06:11.720> but<00:06:12.110> it's<00:06:12.229> worth<00:06:12.310> paying<00:06:13.310> more

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789 
expensive but it's worth paying more

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:15.339 
expensive but it's worth paying more
because<00:06:14.060> you<00:06:14.300> get<00:06:14.419> a<00:06:14.449> better<00:06:14.599> quality<00:06:14.810> thread

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:15.349 
because you get a better quality thread

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:17.439 
because you get a better quality thread
so<00:06:16.250> these<00:06:16.400> are<00:06:16.580> rayons<00:06:16.910> and<00:06:17.180> they've<00:06:17.300> got<00:06:17.419> a

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449 
so these are rayons and they've got a

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:19.450 
so these are rayons and they've got a
lovely<00:06:17.660> shine<00:06:18.260> to<00:06:18.530> them<00:06:18.650> they're<00:06:18.919> not<00:06:18.949> twisted

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
lovely shine to them they're not twisted

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.130 
lovely shine to them they're not twisted
as<00:06:19.580> much<00:06:19.729> as<00:06:19.880> your<00:06:20.000> regular<00:06:20.150> sewing<00:06:20.870> threads

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.140 
as much as your regular sewing threads

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.420 
as much as your regular sewing threads
they're<00:06:22.130> also<00:06:22.250> some<00:06:22.610> beautiful<00:06:23.000> metallics

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
they're also some beautiful metallics

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.380 
they're also some beautiful metallics
lovely<00:06:25.430> sparkle

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:26.390 
lovely sparkle

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.150 
lovely sparkle
some<00:06:26.540> are<00:06:26.660> easier<00:06:26.960> to<00:06:27.020> use<00:06:27.170> than<00:06:27.500> others<00:06:27.800> but

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
some are easier to use than others but

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.860 
some are easier to use than others but
once<00:06:28.370> we<00:06:28.550> get<00:06:28.670> sewing<00:06:28.910> I'll<00:06:29.180> talk<00:06:29.420> about<00:06:29.660> that

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
once we get sewing I'll talk about that

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.490 
once we get sewing I'll talk about that
and<00:06:30.080> how<00:06:30.140> we<00:06:30.260> can<00:06:30.500> make<00:06:30.650> it<00:06:30.800> easier

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
and how we can make it easier

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.960 
and how we can make it easier
shiny<00:06:33.500> threads<00:06:33.770> you<00:06:33.890> can<00:06:33.950> even<00:06:34.190> I<00:06:34.280> get<00:06:34.340> right

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970 
shiny threads you can even I get right

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.720 
shiny threads you can even I get right
like<00:06:35.180> this<00:06:35.470> wool<00:06:36.470> which<00:06:37.130> gives<00:06:37.340> a<00:06:37.370> nice<00:06:37.490> matte

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:37.730 
like this wool which gives a nice matte

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.090 
like this wool which gives a nice matte
texture<00:06:38.120> so<00:06:38.510> again<00:06:38.830> lots<00:06:39.830> of<00:06:40.040> different

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 
texture so again lots of different

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.780 
texture so again lots of different
variety<00:06:40.730> with<00:06:40.910> our<00:06:41.060> threats<00:06:42.160> and<00:06:43.160> then

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:43.790 
variety with our threats and then

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.060 
variety with our threats and then
fabrics<00:06:44.270> what<00:06:44.480> can<00:06:44.630> we<00:06:44.720> stitch<00:06:44.960> into<00:06:45.320> fabrics

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
fabrics what can we stitch into fabrics

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.920 
fabrics what can we stitch into fabrics
now<00:06:46.160> if<00:06:46.340> you've<00:06:46.730> only<00:06:46.790> done<00:06:47.030> dress<00:06:47.300> making<00:06:47.720> or

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.020 
now if you've only done dress making or
perhaps<00:06:48.650> made<00:06:48.950> curtains<00:06:49.160> you'll<00:06:49.760> just<00:06:49.940> think

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030 
perhaps made curtains you'll just think

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.310 
perhaps made curtains you'll just think
it's<00:06:50.240> like<00:06:50.300> Cotton's<00:06:50.750> and<00:06:50.990> things<00:06:51.110> like<00:06:51.230> that

oh we can't stitch into Cotton's and

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.290 
oh we can't stitch into Cotton's and
silk<00:06:53.770> probably<00:06:54.770> but<00:06:55.010> also<00:06:55.190> we<00:06:55.970> can<00:06:56.120> stitch

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:56.300
