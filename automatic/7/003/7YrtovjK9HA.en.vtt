00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.100 
looking for the market and it's caught
BNC<00:03:00.900> inputs<00:03:01.440> it's<00:03:01.769> got<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.310> be<00:03:02.519> NC<00:03:02.720> inputs<00:03:03.720> and

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
BNC inputs it's got to be NC inputs and

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.310 
BNC inputs it's got to be NC inputs and
outputs<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:05.070> two<00:03:06.000> audio<00:03:06.450> inputs<00:03:07.049> and<00:03:07.260> outputs

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
outputs and two audio inputs and outputs

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:17.240 
outputs and two audio inputs and outputs
says<00:03:10.320> it<00:03:10.470> can<00:03:10.620> do<00:03:10.739> NTSC<00:03:11.730> or<00:03:12.590> PL<00:03:15.650> so<00:03:16.650> there's<00:03:16.920> the

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
says it can do NTSC or PL so there's the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.690 
says it can do NTSC or PL so there's the
the<00:03:18.000> monitor<00:03:18.650> this<00:03:19.650> problem<00:03:20.100> it<00:03:20.160> was<00:03:20.280> designed

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
the monitor this problem it was designed

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.180 
the monitor this problem it was designed
to<00:03:20.790> be<00:03:20.880> used<00:03:21.150> as<00:03:21.360> a<00:03:21.390> security<00:03:22.230> monitor<00:03:22.440> but<00:03:23.160> it

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
to be used as a security monitor but it

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.280 
to be used as a security monitor but it
works<00:03:23.489> really<00:03:23.610> good<00:03:24.090> with<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.200> DTV<00:03:25.590> receiver
