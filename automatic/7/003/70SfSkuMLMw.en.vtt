00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.970
 hi everyone is saying that at 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.250
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.830
 new glitch video on gta 5 in 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.780
 line to be able to fly with your bmx 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.680
 So supplication is really super simple 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.270
 and for me it's one of my 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.550
 favorite on gta because it's really 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.750
 epic so to start this blick and 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.940
 Well, I advise you to go on 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.720
 mount shiga d go in the activity of 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.820
 bike race 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.890
 so I advise you to start with 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.449
 this to start taking the glitch 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.640
 and will not have done that you are in 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:38.140
 this activity to start eh ben I 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.370
 advise you those in the solo sphere 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.640
 ch'ti bike you want to do it all 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.469
 only 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.239
 or otherwise if you want to type 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.920
 really a lot of delirium with your friends 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.989
 and I advise you to imitate 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.950
 in the activity and not once in 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.469
 this famous race 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.399
 well you have to take a bmx and 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:51.820
 they only have once the race 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.649
 start 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.960
 well you have to throw yourself into the 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.760
 empty is pretty much like I show it 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.840
 in the video at this tournament if it can 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.610
 walk to any place even 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.110
 on any building in the game but 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.730
 I would rather recommend the place as 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.019
 lé I do in the video and when you 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.389
 go jump in the void so in the 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.119
 tunes and ben you will have to backed down to your 

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:11.920
 bike at 90 degrees so me the first 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.779
 time I got myself but the second 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.270
 time well you'll see that it's 

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:18.249
 really a huge glitch because there a 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.229
 time that just the tunes I put my 

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:21.880
 bike back so you will have to bit 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.340
 close m like me in the video so at 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.899
 90 ° and so once you have me well 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.670
 rise like me well you're going 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.060
 to see that I'm going around 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.770
 the map 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.840
 so I'm going to stick to maps with 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.849
 my bike being in the sky so me 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.079
 for my part I really laughed when 

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:35.679
 I saw this glitch because it is really 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.090
 huge 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.069
 it's pretty simple enough but when 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.179
 even 20 minutes to get there but for 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:42.130
 tell you once that you have little 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.079
 near the manipulation and ben you go 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.549
 really have fun flying in all 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.840
 the map with your bmx 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.889
 so me for myself I really 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.869
 laughed as I told you he is 

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:51.819
 really hyper fun it's a favorite 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.679
 on gta because it's really huge 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:54.669
 it's really a crazy glitch 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.529
 case I advise you greatly it is 

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:57.819
 really quite simple and once 

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:59.559
 you have the manipulation that you 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.759
 arrive about the first you from 

00:01:59.559 --> 00:02:02.289
 down the activity 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.819
 well you can even do it in 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.349
 free mode so it's not walking 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:06.819
 anytime anywhere 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:08.110
 no need to be in a race to 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.819
 others you will be able to do it in 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.500
 free mode but I advise you to 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.690
 start doing it in a race for 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.700
 get in the habit of getting there 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.710
 and so also if you see that your 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.660
 character will land me on the floor 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.100
 I also advise you to lean 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.020
 even more back a little bit 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.730
 and normally he will go even more 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.930
 fast and even higher so that's 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.940
 a little technique that I found 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.560
 to pass the mountains because otherwise you 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.790
 will you take the mountains so 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.990
 here I really hope that this little 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.580
 click will have pleased you it is really 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.870
 amnesia which you start from my 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.380
 favorite this result because it is really 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.180
 huge 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.060
 in passing we do with the update 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.800
 1.13 rockstar have patches and the 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.300
 glitch allowing to do whatever 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.190
 kind of stones that allowed to go 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.050
 further and ben as they have 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.090
 patches and well we are left with this 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.010
 famous geeks that will allow you to 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.330
 fly to the other end of the map with 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.470
 your bmx is still pretty 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.550
 quickly 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.960
 so here I really hope this 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.490
 little says that you will have pleased and especially 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.900
 that he would have helped you if that's the case 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.920
 do not hesitate to put a little 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.990
 green thumb that will make me extremely 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.640
