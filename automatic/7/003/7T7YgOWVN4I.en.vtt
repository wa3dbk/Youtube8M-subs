00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.140
 the experience I mean garcilaso 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.140
 so 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.120
 you have to see what happens with 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.980
 crystal really because although it is 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.870
 true starts the matches being very 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.750
 superior very much superior to rivals 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.720
 then he is wasting away and returns them 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.770
 happen to roberto the same as in the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.380
 previous encounter brings out his two 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.869
 players from 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.060
 of the best touch that most carranza clears 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.400
 and normal the goal here 90 percent of 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.290
 Guilt has the boy Carranza 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.270
 the auction that came from the stream was very 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.100
 strong but it was not very strong and the 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.170
 merit was that crystal came driving 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.989
 the game playing the botarga on the floor 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.120
 I think that meaning 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.530
 mosquera gambled defended what 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.809
 I had been making glass before 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.730
 although I did not notice now that they represented 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.059
 the chances scored the goals of 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.100
 advantage but then the confusion came 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.739
 when the changes came and there 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.110
 happened to dominate the team of garcilazo 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.180
 but without specifying what defines well 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.550
 grabbed from skinny to ya without habilitation 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.830
 of aguilar and the previous play is 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.010
 spectacular look he is not very big no 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.300
 let's say to win by physical but 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.760
 has the power is well worked 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.890
 team is strong rotates perfectly for 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.540
 the left sector and leave it enabled 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.850
 and just practically to gamble it 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.350
 against carranza later I think what 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.360
 most important of the game are the three 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.260
 points for sport enlisting and if there 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.159
 someone who has to be 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.250
 also celebrating the agent 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.920
 university because they are not shot 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.150
 the garcilaso now almost tie lacks a 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.159
 match against science we talked about 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.390
 a while ago but he also jumps the 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.930
 how much is party rival 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.140
 direct 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.720
 in curved this week in such a way that 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.610
 the same is in their hands they and they depend 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.450
 of themselves to try that that 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.759
 Advantage do not miss out on procedural part 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.799
 for good times from the point of view 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.299
 of this very tactical technician because he 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.640
 they know the technicians and they tried 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.380
 void if these plays the second 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.630
 time already when still crystal 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.219
 pressed a little bit but then it 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.039
 remains and aggressive to be left with two sentences 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.869
 with said two players of the 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.119
 different teams one with the archer 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.489
 carranza when he says we went out to play 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.230
 equal to equal and that cost us the game 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.299
 there you have to see I 'm not going to see it with 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.760
 tweezers what I did and in the other the 15k 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.709
 you what surprised me says that 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.709
 this game is good because we have it at 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.920
 we managed to fight and because we have left 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.599
 of some personal issues that and 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.599
 it stayed there we have not left some 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.480
 personal issues that had in the 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.769
 group what he meant but I do not know 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.319
 you have to make crystal with this 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:39.180
 equipment rich in capacity in quality 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.180
 individual is to return
