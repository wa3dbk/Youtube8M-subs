00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.870
 Spring can enter spring can 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:10.509
 End 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.109
 Actual delivery 

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:16.000
 Is it today? 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 We are persistently popular 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.960
 First time 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.580
 Medicinal hepatitis is strongly provided even official content 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.310
 I wonder if I'm doing tanka 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.050
 1. 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.910
 It is Katakana language 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.330
 It is said that k-1 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.900
 I have finished seeing it 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.050
 so 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.670
 It is fishing result information and when you use with a person who is fishing after 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.210
 If everyone is using it 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.860
 I'm asking for it, though 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.140
 Yes it is very well done 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.090
 This is also the moon's second son 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.270
 but 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.299
 If it is always the best with this other machine 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.920
 It is not absolutely so 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.369
 When the wind is coming up more strongly 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.220
 later 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.710
 After this there are three bands and fish 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.869
 I do not want to be very wide and want to spread such a few fish 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.470
 It's also good to have a call 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.400
 I need an appeal 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.660
 At that time, too small and unpaid 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.070
 If you can not do fishing efficiently because you do not have enough appeal 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.870
 It seems like this is already the case 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.800
 If you are a large person 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.800
 I am sure that I will be taken a lot 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.960
 This series 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.580
 For this leader 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.040
 Vertically or horizontally 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.110
 Mini pass 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.620
 From the deep place I wonder whether I'm going to leverage 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.319
 I will leave it for exchange 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.579
 Also at that time also let the fish notice the exchange rate 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:13.199
 To Ritto- 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:15.539
 I can cover it very much 

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:18.389
 It is a heroine 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:21.409
 When you want to get to your juniors 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.359
 Just waiting for that 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.389
 It is natural to continue fishing if all the cast numbers are also efficient 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:28.929
 I'm going up 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:32.939
 At the time of equipment, it's such a big unpaid increase and it's up to here 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:36.949
 I want to do a good high-pitched action 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:38.849
 It is not necessary 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.379
 Naturally even one day in the jacking 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.389
 I do wonderful things, but even Katsuta Tamashiro 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:47.359
 If you read this far 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:50.659
 This is a strength, so for example, when you can not find a place 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.779
 The temple that keeps on going round the circle is not efficient 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:55.509
 Though 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:58.509
 We are picking up from such a place 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:08.099
 It feels like I'm moving to a dull that is likely to be unpaid 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.099
 I will not let you 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:51.479
 Agreement size 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.399
 Mr. Imai 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:59.399
 I think i can win 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.519
 I asked if I could make it 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.759
 On the other hand, this can not be avoided 

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:12.759
 It was firm 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.059
 The reason is elusive 

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:29.159
 It is the same age after graduation 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.870
 This works with google bus 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.580
 Vigilance 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.580
 US start stall 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.080
 One shot of the morning market 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.229
 It is now 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.090
 It is a ghost story working there 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.960
 It is the immediate thing 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.080
 The left side has no hit 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.490
 After all it is a problem though it is open 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.090
 The market 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.620
 Misaki's 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.650
 In the fault 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.539
 Yeah 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.650
 Some distance from the stairs 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.150
 It was possible 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.280
 We use the above method, but from the bottom 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.289
 Has raised 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:13.229
 Speak this is 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.069
 Talks 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:18.210
 The deep place continues but 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.449
 Let me have a pasmo in that deep place 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:23.849
 It is power 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.849
 It is withdrawal It is this 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.639
 This is from a web browser 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:37.689
 This is good I will not be able to get the difference in Shinto power quite easily 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:39.860
 2 or 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.819
 Yes 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:45.759
 Let's do our best and do our best 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:49.990
 pitcher 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.029
 Takano Ren in the prefecture's violence 

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:53.529
 After all appeared 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:54.360
 I understood 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.249
 Hello 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:58.080
 It is Sakai Industry 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.659
 I considered this 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:04.179
 I am relieved with this record deficiency problem 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:09.520
 It is Nissin Electric 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.919
 You can also make a diary on this page by gender 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:16.490
 Great improvement 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.629
 normal version 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:19.620
 graphic 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.990
