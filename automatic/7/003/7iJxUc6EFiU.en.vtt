 the wall which you are shown in Damascus 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.730

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.800
 really stick to the chestnuts add the 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.440
 butter that's when it starts 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.900

 little flour at the end that allows us to 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.979
 there it was necessary to put in ball that does not

 penetrate the mixture into the leavened dough 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.980

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.050
 holes in the dough it's really at the bottom 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.420
