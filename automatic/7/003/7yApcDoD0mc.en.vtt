00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.440
 Pictures are to be read in their context 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.390
 how they came into existence 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.690
 So that was a little bit of time 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:47.070
 where I then from film to photography 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.780
 put as warning so old reflexes 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.539
 I always do everything very fast one 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.940
 sequence and that we have done with it 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:58.050
 christian brändli that of the present

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:07.620
 six pictures are added in one moment 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.430
 show how to get to this so-called 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.430
 icon has come 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.100
 the citizens are unique to them 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.440
 will be much better still much 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.330
 more interesting if you have your stories 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.250
 to experience and we bring 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.680
 have recorded all these stories 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.140
 to every single picture and in ours 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.750
 digital archive and museum point ch 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.490
 are now all images of this unique 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.850
 donation accessible but also 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.890
 promis originalton pull this would not 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.149
 if trovato I do not know if all this 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.490
 actually are that way 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.890
 They have also completed 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.780
 the pictures in a unique way the year 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.670
 again the short moment but of course 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:58.490
 will run at 8 film but that 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:01.340
 is just a moment they greeted that 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.160
 only look at me when you look at yourself 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:08.960
 imagine is someday before him at some point 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.850
 you will be there as much as possible 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.480
 I've had a lot on my travels 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.700
 industry in the whole world photography 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.300
 and next to it is still fast 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.870
 so make time to a sideways glance 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.350
 and had taken seven years to complete that 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.320
 to sort wheat from the sport 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.750
 to come to this solution a bude 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.490
 This year was 80 years old and we 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.920
 owe him a lot of sadness is yes 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.360
 a former student of Zurich 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.040
 college of arts on the one hand 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.220
 On the other hand, we are very strong for him 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.200
 connected across several projects and also 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.120
 many great donations for 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.830
 So our collection has given the 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.330
 relationships are manifold and we 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.710
 Of course, he hopes that with his 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.580
 exhibition with his work too 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.740
 will inspire future students 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.560
 I'm still positive and I would 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:04.370
 say the glass is half full for me 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.180
 and no longer a young photographer 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.180
 keep going
