00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:05.759 
today is Thursday December 13th and over
the<00:00:04.540> last<00:00:04.720> weekend<00:00:05.290> we<00:00:05.439> had<00:00:05.470> some

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:05.769 
the last weekend we had some

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:07.440 
the last weekend we had some
temperatures<00:00:06.310> that<00:00:06.490> were<00:00:06.609> really<00:00:06.879> cold<00:00:07.149> that

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:07.450 
temperatures that were really cold that

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.680 
temperatures that were really cold that
got<00:00:07.990> down<00:00:08.200> to<00:00:08.410> below<00:00:08.980> 0<00:00:09.339> degrees<00:00:09.759> and<00:00:10.240> so<00:00:10.540> we

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:10.690 
got down to below 0 degrees and so we

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.480 
got down to below 0 degrees and so we
did<00:00:11.080> whatever<00:00:11.259> we<00:00:11.469> could<00:00:11.620> to<00:00:11.799> try<00:00:12.040> to<00:00:12.099> protect

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490 
did whatever we could to try to protect

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:15.009 
the food that we still had in the veggie

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.130 
the food that we still had in the veggie
tunnel<00:00:15.339> and<00:00:15.519> in<00:00:16.150> the<00:00:16.360> gardens<00:00:16.690> that<00:00:16.840> we've<00:00:16.990> got

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
tunnel and in the gardens that we've got

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.560 
tunnel and in the gardens that we've got
here<00:00:17.380> also<00:00:17.590> so<00:00:18.519> today<00:00:18.939> we're<00:00:19.150> going<00:00:19.240> to<00:00:19.330> take<00:00:19.539> a

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
here also so today we're going to take a

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.269 
here also so today we're going to take a
look<00:00:19.779> at<00:00:19.960> and<00:00:20.080> see<00:00:20.320> how<00:00:20.470> the<00:00:20.529> carrots<00:00:20.980> did<00:00:21.250> I

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279 
look at and see how the carrots did I

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.519 
look at and see how the carrots did I
haven't<00:00:21.670> uncovered<00:00:21.849> the<00:00:22.330> carrots<00:00:22.720> yet<00:00:22.960> and

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
haven't uncovered the carrots yet and

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.070 
haven't uncovered the carrots yet and
I'm<00:00:23.740> going<00:00:23.890> to<00:00:23.949> explain<00:00:24.310> some<00:00:24.609> ways<00:00:24.820> that<00:00:25.539> we

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
I'm going to explain some ways that we

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.070 
I'm going to explain some ways that we
take<00:00:26.380> to<00:00:27.009> ensure<00:00:28.000> that<00:00:28.029> our<00:00:28.300> carrots<00:00:28.750> make<00:00:28.929> it

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
take to ensure that our carrots make it

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.929 
take to ensure that our carrots make it
through<00:00:29.230> the<00:00:29.349> cold<00:00:29.529> weather<00:00:29.769> month<00:00:30.130> so<00:00:30.820> that

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
through the cold weather month so that

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.270 
through the cold weather month so that
way<00:00:31.060> we<00:00:31.210> can<00:00:31.300> enjoy<00:00:31.599> fresh<00:00:31.990> garden<00:00:32.290> carrots<00:00:32.800> as

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
way we can enjoy fresh garden carrots as

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.389 
way we can enjoy fresh garden carrots as
long<00:00:33.700> through<00:00:34.180> the<00:00:34.210> winter<00:00:34.480> time<00:00:34.660> as<00:00:34.840> we<00:00:34.960> can

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
long through the winter time as we can

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.740 
long through the winter time as we can
all<00:00:36.399> the<00:00:36.610> carrots<00:00:36.910> are<00:00:37.030> underneath<00:00:37.360> here

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
all the carrots are underneath here

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.479 
all the carrots are underneath here
we're<00:00:38.320> going<00:00:38.410> to<00:00:38.500> try<00:00:38.649> to<00:00:38.710> uncover<00:00:38.920> them<00:00:39.370> and

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
we're going to try to uncover them and

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:40.709 
we're going to try to uncover them and
then<00:00:39.579> I'll<00:00:39.700> explain<00:00:39.730> some<00:00:40.270> different<00:00:40.600> ways

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
then I'll explain some different ways

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:43.619 
then I'll explain some different ways
that<00:00:40.750> you<00:00:41.260> can<00:00:41.620> take<00:00:41.890> to<00:00:42.460> protect<00:00:42.879> carrots<00:00:43.480> if

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
that you can take to protect carrots if

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:44.850 
that you can take to protect carrots if
you've<00:00:43.809> got<00:00:43.989> carrots<00:00:44.350> growing<00:00:44.559> in<00:00:44.710> your

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
you've got carrots growing in your

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.060 
you've got carrots growing in your
garden<00:00:44.920> too<00:00:45.399> because<00:00:46.239> honestly<00:00:46.600> after<00:00:47.070> going

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
garden too because honestly after going

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.830 
garden too because honestly after going
through<00:00:48.100> a<00:00:48.309> frost<00:00:48.730> or<00:00:49.059> something<00:00:49.329> like<00:00:49.420> that

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
through a frost or something like that

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.630 
through a frost or something like that
carrots<00:00:50.199> tend<00:00:50.530> to<00:00:50.620> concentrate<00:00:51.129> their<00:00:51.280> sugars

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
carrots tend to concentrate their sugars

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.150 
carrots tend to concentrate their sugars
and<00:00:51.850> taste<00:00:52.420> a<00:00:52.629> lot<00:00:52.870> better<00:00:53.170> than<00:00:53.800> they<00:00:53.980> do<00:00:54.039> in

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
and taste a lot better than they do in

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.069 
and taste a lot better than they do in
the<00:00:54.370> summertime<00:00:54.699> so<00:00:55.090> let's<00:00:55.570> take<00:00:55.719> a<00:00:55.750> look<00:00:55.960> and

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
the summertime so let's take a look and

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:02.240 
the summertime so let's take a look and
see<00:00:56.260> how<00:00:56.350> it<00:00:56.500> all<00:00:56.590> works

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.740 

the<00:01:02.670> only<00:01:02.820> reason<00:01:03.180> palates<00:01:03.960> around<00:01:04.290> here

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.070 

is<00:01:10.620> to<00:01:10.830> hold<00:01:11.070> down<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.610> leaves<00:01:12.600> keep<00:01:12.990> them

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
is to hold down the leaves keep them

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.860 
is to hold down the leaves keep them
from<00:01:13.200> blowing<00:01:13.410> away

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.490 

you<00:01:17.800> can<00:01:17.980> see<00:01:18.190> that<00:01:18.990> well<00:01:19.990> I<00:01:20.020> don't<00:01:20.350> know<00:01:20.410> if

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
you can see that well I don't know if

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.900 
you can see that well I don't know if
you<00:01:20.560> can<00:01:20.650> see<00:01:20.860> it<00:01:20.950> or<00:01:21.040> not<00:01:21.100> but<00:01:21.220> underneath<00:01:21.670> the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
you can see it or not but underneath the

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.630 
you can see it or not but underneath the
leaves<00:01:22.180> there<00:01:22.780> straw<00:01:23.200> we<00:01:23.500> had<00:01:23.650> put<00:01:23.890> down<00:01:24.130> a

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
leaves there straw we had put down a

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.170 
leaves there straw we had put down a
thick<00:01:25.000> layer<00:01:25.180> of<00:01:25.240> straw<00:01:25.720> and<00:01:25.990> hay<00:01:26.700> before<00:01:27.700> the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
thick layer of straw and hay before the

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.910 
thick layer of straw and hay before the
cold<00:01:28.390> weather<00:01:28.600> but<00:01:28.930> then<00:01:29.290> when<00:01:29.470> that<00:01:29.560> cold

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
cold weather but then when that cold

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.410 
cold weather but then when that cold
weather<00:01:30.070> was<00:01:30.340> coming

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
weather was coming

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.410 
weather was coming
you<00:01:31.900> know<00:01:31.990> below<00:01:32.290> freezing<00:01:32.560> temperatures

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
you know below freezing temperatures

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.660 
you know below freezing temperatures
below<00:01:34.420> zero<00:01:34.960> temperatures<00:01:35.530> I<00:01:35.830> thought<00:01:36.490> that

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
below zero temperatures I thought that

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.310 
below zero temperatures I thought that
we<00:01:36.760> needed<00:01:37.030> some<00:01:37.210> more<00:01:37.360> insulation<00:01:37.780> so<00:01:38.080> we<00:01:38.170> put

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
we needed some more insulation so we put

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.470 
we needed some more insulation so we put
the<00:01:38.410> leaves<00:01:38.590> down<00:01:38.920> and<00:01:39.550> like<00:01:39.970> I<00:01:40.090> say<00:01:40.270> I'm<00:01:40.450> not

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
the leaves down and like I say I'm not

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.180 
the leaves down and like I say I'm not
sure<00:01:40.660> if<00:01:40.960> this<00:01:41.050> protected<00:01:41.620> them<00:01:41.740> or<00:01:41.860> not<00:01:41.980> we're

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
sure if this protected them or not we're

00:01:42.190 --> 00:02:18.880 
sure if this protected them or not we're
going<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.340> find<00:01:42.940> out<00:01:43.120> here<00:01:43.270> in<00:01:43.390> a<00:01:43.450> second

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.370 

well<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:19.700> can<00:02:19.820> see<00:02:20.000> we<00:02:20.120> got<00:02:20.270> I<00:02:20.960> actually

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
well you can see we got I actually

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.530 
well you can see we got I actually
picked<00:02:21.770> several<00:02:22.070> but<00:02:22.910> we've<00:02:23.000> got<00:02:23.150> some<00:02:23.300> really

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
picked several but we've got some really

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.690 
picked several but we've got some really
nice<00:02:23.690> ones<00:02:24.020> that<00:02:24.560> have<00:02:24.920> made<00:02:25.100> it<00:02:25.220> through<00:02:25.370> in

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
nice ones that have made it through in

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.820 
nice ones that have made it through in
the<00:02:25.940> garden<00:02:26.240> and<00:02:26.480> one<00:02:27.290> of<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.440> ways<00:02:27.560> that<00:02:27.740> you

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
the garden and one of the ways that you

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.970 
the garden and one of the ways that you
can<00:02:27.980> tell<00:02:28.160> whether<00:02:28.370> or<00:02:28.730> not<00:02:28.970> they're<00:02:29.780> so<00:02:30.710> good

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
can tell whether or not they're so good

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.020 
can tell whether or not they're so good
number<00:02:31.850> one<00:02:32.090> is<00:02:32.420> is<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.530> ground<00:02:33.800> frozen<00:02:34.430> and

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
number one is is the ground frozen and

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.210 
number one is is the ground frozen and
in<00:02:35.240> this<00:02:35.330> case<00:02:35.570> the<00:02:35.780> ground<00:02:35.990> wasn't<00:02:36.260> frozen<00:02:36.800> it

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
in this case the ground wasn't frozen it

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.480 
in this case the ground wasn't frozen it
was<00:02:37.370> cold<00:02:37.640> but<00:02:38.500> there<00:02:39.500> wasn't<00:02:39.650> any<00:02:39.890> frost<00:02:40.220> in

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
was cold but there wasn't any frost in

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.830 
was cold but there wasn't any frost in
the<00:02:40.580> ground<00:02:40.760> or<00:02:40.880> anything<00:02:41.030> like<00:02:41.240> that<00:02:41.300> so<00:02:41.660> the

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
the ground or anything like that so the

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.020 
the ground or anything like that so the
carrot<00:02:42.110> should<00:02:42.380> be<00:02:42.560> protected<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.880> other

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
carrot should be protected and the other

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.699 
carrot should be protected and the other
way<00:02:44.240> is<00:02:44.540> if<00:02:44.570> you<00:02:44.840> look<00:02:45.020> carefully<00:02:45.230> at<00:02:45.590> the

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
way is if you look carefully at the

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.940 
way is if you look carefully at the
carrots<00:02:46.240> if<00:02:47.240> they've<00:02:47.510> been<00:02:47.720> frozen<00:02:48.140> then

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
carrots if they've been frozen then

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.720 
carrots if they've been frozen then
they're<00:02:49.190> going<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.340> have<00:02:51.100> lines<00:02:52.100> that<00:02:52.490> run

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
they're going to have lines that run

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.370 
they're going to have lines that run
perpendicular<00:02:53.630> to<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.959> length<00:02:54.140> of<00:02:54.320> the

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
perpendicular to the length of the

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.040 
perpendicular to the length of the
carrot<00:02:54.740> carrot<00:02:55.040> going<00:02:55.970> like<00:02:56.150> this<00:02:56.420> real<00:02:56.690> small

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
carrot carrot going like this real small

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.070 
carrot carrot going like this real small
just<00:02:57.290> like<00:02:57.890> little<00:02:58.310> tiny<00:02:58.520> razor<00:02:59.420> cuts<00:02:59.810> and

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
just like little tiny razor cuts and

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.410 
just like little tiny razor cuts and
that<00:03:00.980> means<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.340> carrots<00:03:01.610> been<00:03:01.760> frozen<00:03:02.030> then

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
that means the carrots been frozen then

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.540 
that means the carrots been frozen then
it's<00:03:02.570> it's<00:03:03.020> thawed<00:03:03.560> again<00:03:04.010> or<00:03:04.220> maybe<00:03:04.400> it's

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
it's it's thawed again or maybe it's

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.940 
it's it's thawed again or maybe it's
even<00:03:04.670> still<00:03:05.060> frozen<00:03:05.270> and<00:03:05.660> frozen<00:03:06.500> carrots

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
even still frozen and frozen carrots

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.979 
even still frozen and frozen carrots
taste<00:03:07.190> terrible<00:03:07.520> but<00:03:08.330> when<00:03:08.630> you<00:03:08.720> pick<00:03:08.870> them

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
taste terrible but when you pick them

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.110 
taste terrible but when you pick them
right<00:03:09.200> out<00:03:09.320> of<00:03:09.380> a<00:03:09.440> garden<00:03:09.709> like<00:03:09.800> this<00:03:10.120> here

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
right out of a garden like this here

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.790 
right out of a garden like this here
like<00:03:11.330> in<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.510> middle<00:03:11.720> of<00:03:11.810> December<00:03:12.350> when

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
like in the middle of December when

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.140 
like in the middle of December when
there's<00:03:12.980> been<00:03:13.100> a<00:03:13.130> frost<00:03:13.459> every<00:03:13.730> now<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.060> then

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
there's been a frost every now and then

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.650 
there's been a frost every now and then
or<00:03:14.360> some<00:03:15.140> really<00:03:15.350> cold<00:03:15.530> weather<00:03:15.970> these<00:03:16.970> taste

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
or some really cold weather these taste

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.830 
or some really cold weather these taste
great<00:03:18.380> like<00:03:18.980> this<00:03:19.250> so<00:03:20.030> let's<00:03:20.330> talk<00:03:20.450> about<00:03:20.510> some

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
great like this so let's talk about some

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.090 
great like this so let's talk about some
other<00:03:20.989> ways<00:03:21.170> that<00:03:21.200> you<00:03:21.410> can<00:03:21.620> protect<00:03:21.980> your

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
other ways that you can protect your

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.890 
other ways that you can protect your
carrots<00:03:22.400> if<00:03:22.520> you<00:03:23.120> don't<00:03:23.299> want<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.540> just<00:03:23.660> leave

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
carrots if you don't want to just leave

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:41.610 
carrots if you don't want to just leave
them<00:03:24.019> in<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.260> ground

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.350 

so<00:03:42.620> one<00:03:43.220> thing<00:03:43.400> that<00:03:43.580> you<00:03:43.700> can<00:03:43.850> do<00:03:43.970> is<00:03:44.090> you<00:03:44.210> can

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
so one thing that you can do is you can

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.390 
so one thing that you can do is you can
just<00:03:44.390> dig<00:03:44.780> a<00:03:44.810> trench<00:03:45.170> now<00:03:45.470> I<00:03:45.500> just<00:03:45.830> dug<00:03:46.040> a<00:03:46.070> hole

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
just dig a trench now I just dug a hole

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.970 
just dig a trench now I just dug a hole
just<00:03:46.700> to<00:03:46.850> keep<00:03:47.600> this<00:03:47.810> brief<00:03:48.200> so<00:03:48.650> that<00:03:48.680> you<00:03:48.860> can

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
just to keep this brief so that you can

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.560 
just to keep this brief so that you can
see<00:03:49.160> what<00:03:49.280> we're<00:03:49.400> doing<00:03:49.490> but<00:03:50.060> you<00:03:50.210> could<00:03:50.360> just

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
see what we're doing but you could just

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.220 
see what we're doing but you could just
dig<00:03:50.780> a<00:03:50.810> trench<00:03:51.880> dig<00:03:52.880> a<00:03:52.910> big<00:03:53.150> line<00:03:53.360> I<00:03:53.660> would<00:03:54.050> make

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
dig a trench dig a big line I would make

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.220 
dig a trench dig a big line I would make
it<00:03:54.350> at<00:03:54.470> least<00:03:54.500> a<00:03:55.010> foot<00:03:55.280> eat<00:03:55.520> this<00:03:56.270> looks<00:03:56.510> like

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
it at least a foot eat this looks like

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.990 
it at least a foot eat this looks like
it's<00:03:57.560> probably<00:03:57.740> about<00:03:57.980> 10<00:03:58.310> inches<00:03:58.490> deep<00:03:58.640> at

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
it's probably about 10 inches deep at

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.760 
it's probably about 10 inches deep at
the<00:03:59.120> bottom<00:03:59.450> of<00:03:59.570> it<00:03:59.690> you<00:03:59.870> probably<00:04:00.350> want<00:04:00.620> to<00:04:00.650> go

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
the bottom of it you probably want to go

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.890 
the bottom of it you probably want to go
deeper<00:04:01.190> than<00:04:01.340> that<00:04:01.370> and<00:04:01.790> then<00:04:02.210> just<00:04:02.450> take<00:04:02.690> your

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
deeper than that and then just take your

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:09.190 
deeper than that and then just take your
carrot<00:04:06.640> then<00:04:07.640> take<00:04:07.880> the<00:04:08.060> Greens<00:04:08.390> off<00:04:08.810> of<00:04:09.050> them

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
carrot then take the Greens off of them

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.380 
carrot then take the Greens off of them
don't<00:04:09.440> leave<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:09.800> Greens<00:04:10.040> on<00:04:10.310> them<00:04:10.520> just<00:04:11.120> feed

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
don't leave the Greens on them just feed

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.990 
don't leave the Greens on them just feed
those<00:04:11.630> to<00:04:11.660> your<00:04:11.960> goats<00:04:12.320> or<00:04:13.070> your<00:04:13.310> chickens<00:04:13.700> or

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
toss them in the trench and then when

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.630 
toss them in the trench and then when
you're<00:04:23.600> all<00:04:23.750> done<00:04:23.960> you<00:04:24.320> know<00:04:25.160> you<00:04:25.280> get<00:04:25.430> a<00:04:25.460> nice

you're all done you know you get a nice
big<00:04:25.880> stack<00:04:26.240> of<00:04:26.480> them<00:04:26.570> then<00:04:27.320> just<00:04:27.350> go<00:04:27.620> ahead<00:04:27.710> and

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
big stack of them then just go ahead and

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.600 
big stack of them then just go ahead and
cover<00:04:28.190> them<00:04:28.400> back<00:04:28.580> up<00:04:29.560> now<00:04:30.560> I<00:04:30.620> would<00:04:30.980> not<00:04:31.190> cover

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
cover them back up now I would not cover

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.520 
cover them back up now I would not cover
them<00:04:32.380> with<00:04:33.380> dirt<00:04:33.680> I<00:04:34.930> would<00:04:35.930> cover<00:04:36.170> them<00:04:36.410> with

here<00:04:47.800> yeah

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.929 

just<00:04:54.840> cover<00:04:55.110> it<00:04:55.259> up<00:04:55.319> with<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:56.550> organic

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:56.939 
just cover it up with the organic

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:59.119 
just cover it up with the organic
material<00:04:57.629> because<00:04:58.319> that's<00:04:58.529> going<00:04:58.680> to<00:04:58.770> act<00:04:58.949> as

00:04:59.119 --> 00:04:59.129 
material because that's going to act as

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:02.439 
material because that's going to act as
a<00:04:59.219> better<00:04:59.400> insulator<00:04:59.990> than<00:05:00.990> the<00:05:01.139> dirt<00:05:01.379> will

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
a better insulator than the dirt will

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.049 
a better insulator than the dirt will
then<00:05:03.449> you<00:05:03.599> can<00:05:03.779> just<00:05:03.930> take<00:05:04.139> dirt<00:05:04.439> and<00:05:05.309> put<00:05:05.849> dirt

00:05:06.049 --> 00:05:06.059 
then you can just take dirt and put dirt

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:16.750 
then you can just take dirt and put dirt
on<00:05:06.240> top<00:05:06.479> of<00:05:06.689> it

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.270 

that<00:05:17.390> way<00:05:17.540> keeps<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:18.290> organic<00:05:18.800> matter<00:05:18.980> from

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
that way keeps the organic matter from

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.270 
that way keeps the organic matter from
blowing<00:05:19.790> away<00:05:20.440> of<00:05:21.440> course<00:05:21.680> doing<00:05:21.920> what<00:05:22.190> we

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
blowing away of course doing what we

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.680 
blowing away of course doing what we
were<00:05:22.400> doing<00:05:22.610> in<00:05:22.730> the<00:05:22.760> garden<00:05:23.150> is<00:05:23.330> going<00:05:23.600> to

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
were doing in the garden is going to

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.090 
were doing in the garden is going to
mean<00:05:23.900> that<00:05:23.930> you're<00:05:24.200> going<00:05:24.320> to<00:05:24.350> have<00:05:24.440> to<00:05:24.590> go<00:05:24.710> dig

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
mean that you're going to have to go dig

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.770 
mean that you're going to have to go dig
the<00:05:25.280> carrots<00:05:25.640> out<00:05:25.790> of<00:05:25.910> the<00:05:25.970> ground<00:05:26.210> one<00:05:26.510> way<00:05:26.660> or

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
the carrots out of the ground one way or

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.090 
the carrots out of the ground one way or
the<00:05:26.840> other<00:05:26.960> whether<00:05:27.380> they're<00:05:27.650> in<00:05:27.770> the<00:05:27.800> trance

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
the other whether they're in the trance

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.950 
the other whether they're in the trance
or<00:05:28.310> whether<00:05:28.460> they're<00:05:28.670> still<00:05:28.970> in<00:05:29.210> the<00:05:29.720> spot

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
or whether they're still in the spot

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.960 
or whether they're still in the spot
where<00:05:30.140> they<00:05:30.260> grew<00:05:30.530> you've<00:05:31.220> got<00:05:31.460> to<00:05:31.640> dig<00:05:31.820> them

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
where they grew you've got to dig them

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.600 
where they grew you've got to dig them
up<00:05:32.500> so<00:05:33.500> I<00:05:33.530> guess<00:05:33.800> an<00:05:34.010> option<00:05:34.370> if<00:05:34.490> you<00:05:34.580> don't

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
up so I guess an option if you don't

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.070 
up so I guess an option if you don't
want<00:05:34.880> to<00:05:34.940> have<00:05:35.030> to<00:05:35.120> do<00:05:35.270> that<00:05:35.450> you<00:05:35.690> want<00:05:35.870> to<00:05:35.960> be

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
want to have to do that you want to be

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.400 
want to have to do that you want to be
able<00:05:36.200> to<00:05:36.320> just<00:05:36.560> go<00:05:36.680> get<00:05:37.010> the<00:05:37.190> carrots<00:05:37.550> is<00:05:38.410> you

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
able to just go get the carrots is you

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:52.260 
able to just go get the carrots is you
could<00:05:39.560> have<00:05:39.650> a<00:05:39.710> root<00:05:39.950> cellar

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.320 

now<00:05:53.310> you<00:05:54.310> can<00:05:54.490> see<00:05:54.669> that<00:05:54.880> we<00:05:54.970> got<00:05:55.060> a<00:05:55.120> nice

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
now you can see that we got a nice

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.270 
now you can see that we got a nice
collection<00:05:55.599> of<00:05:56.020> carrots<00:05:56.710> here<00:05:56.889> in<00:05:57.009> the<00:05:57.069> middle

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
collection of carrots here in the middle

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.360 
collection of carrots here in the middle
of<00:05:57.340> December<00:05:57.660> fresh<00:05:58.660> out<00:05:58.870> of<00:05:58.900> the<00:05:59.080> garden<00:05:59.370> this

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
of December fresh out of the garden this

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.309 
of December fresh out of the garden this
is<00:06:00.430> just<00:06:00.759> a<00:06:00.849> small<00:06:01.180> portion<00:06:01.690> of<00:06:01.750> what<00:06:01.930> we<00:06:01.960> still

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 
is just a small portion of what we still

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:05.870 
is just a small portion of what we still
got<00:06:02.530> in<00:06:02.770> the<00:06:02.949> ground<00:06:03.250> but<00:06:04.440> these<00:06:05.440> are<00:06:05.590> going<00:06:05.680> to

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
got in the ground but these are going to

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.700 
got in the ground but these are going to
service<00:06:06.880> us<00:06:07.060> well<00:06:07.330> for<00:06:07.660> the<00:06:07.720> next<00:06:07.870> I<00:06:08.259> don't

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
service us well for the next I don't

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:16.980 
service us well for the next I don't
know<00:06:08.889> next<00:06:09.520> couple<00:06:09.789> days<00:06:12.599> and<00:06:15.720> one<00:06:16.720> for<00:06:16.930> the

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
know next couple days and one for the

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:24.760 
know next couple days and one for the
goat

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.710 

we<00:06:25.770> planted<00:06:26.160> a<00:06:26.310> probably<00:06:26.940> a<00:06:27.000> few<00:06:27.240> thousand

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
we planted a probably a few thousand

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.110 
we planted a probably a few thousand
carrots<00:06:28.310> and<00:06:29.310> so<00:06:29.520> you<00:06:29.580> might<00:06:29.790> be<00:06:29.820> wondering

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
carrots and so you might be wondering

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.330 
carrots and so you might be wondering
well<00:06:30.510> what<00:06:31.260> in<00:06:31.350> the<00:06:31.410> world<00:06:31.650> would<00:06:31.890> you<00:06:31.920> do<00:06:32.190> with

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
well what in the world would you do with

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.670 
well what in the world would you do with
all<00:06:32.490> of<00:06:32.640> those<00:06:32.760> carrots<00:06:33.180> we<00:06:33.990> group<00:06:34.200> cabbage

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
all of those carrots we group cabbage

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.400 
all of those carrots we group cabbage
stew<00:06:34.980> so<00:06:35.970> on<00:06:36.120> the<00:06:36.240> next<00:06:36.450> post<00:06:36.810> what<00:06:37.170> we'll<00:06:37.290> do

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.410 
stew so on the next post what we'll do

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.380 
stew so on the next post what we'll do
is<00:06:37.560> we'll<00:06:37.680> explain<00:06:38.010> to<00:06:38.190> you<00:06:38.280> what<00:06:38.910> you<00:06:39.060> can<00:06:39.240> do

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:39.390 
is we'll explain to you what you can do

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:45.440 
is we'll explain to you what you can do
with<00:06:40.020> all<00:06:40.500> the<00:06:40.770> cabbage<00:06:41.420> carrots<00:06:42.420> and<00:06:42.660> onions
