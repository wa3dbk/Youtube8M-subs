00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:57.039

let's<00:01:55.549> put<00:01:55.700> in<00:01:55.820> in<00:01:56.000> real<00:01:56.479> world<00:01:56.689> that<00:01:56.840> most<00:01:56.929> of

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
let's put in in real world that most of

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.779 
let's put in in real world that most of
us<00:01:57.170> would<00:01:57.320> understand<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.890> CRT<00:01:58.310> picture<00:01:58.640> tube

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
us would understand the CRT picture tube

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:59.859 
us would understand the CRT picture tube
that<00:01:58.939> we've<00:01:59.030> had<00:01:59.149> in<00:01:59.299> our<00:01:59.359> house<00:01:59.509> for<00:01:59.719> the<00:01:59.780> last

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
that we've had in our house for the last

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.899 
that we've had in our house for the last
50<00:02:00.289> years<00:02:00.320> half<00:02:00.859> life<00:02:01.100> and<00:02:01.310> that's<00:02:01.429> roughly

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
50 years half life and that's roughly

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.569 
50 years half life and that's roughly
ten<00:02:02.210> years<00:02:02.479> so<00:02:03.259> this<00:02:03.380> that's<00:02:03.619> actually<00:02:04.310> three

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
ten years so this that's actually three

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:05.740 
ten years so this that's actually three

quality now plasma is roughly 170
degrees<00:03:24.650> which<00:03:24.889> means<00:03:25.099> you<00:03:25.250> basically<00:03:25.430> can

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
degrees which means you basically can

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.759

the<00:04:39.470> other<00:04:39.620> picture<00:04:40.010> so<00:04:40.490> it's<00:04:40.610> a<00:04:40.670> much<00:04:40.850> more

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.410 
which is very strong and then we have
what's<00:05:03.620> called<00:05:03.710> dynamic<00:05:04.010> contrast<00:05:04.790> ratio<00:05:04.880> of

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
what's called dynamic contrast ratio of

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.840 
what's called dynamic contrast ratio of
a<00:05:05.600> million<00:05:06.110> to<00:05:06.290> one<00:05:06.410> and<00:05:07.130> if<00:05:07.250> there<00:05:07.400> for<00:05:07.580> you<00:05:07.670> is

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
a million to one and if there for you is

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:08.890 
a million to one and if there for you is
there's<00:05:08.060> a<00:05:08.090> lot<00:05:08.210> of<00:05:08.240> shades<00:05:08.510> of<00:05:08.660> gray<00:05:08.840> in

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
there's a lot of shades of gray in

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.420 
there's a lot of shades of gray in
between<00:05:08.990> a<00:05:09.470> lot<00:05:09.860> of<00:05:09.950> different<00:05:10.160> color

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
between a lot of different color

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.550 
between a lot of different color
variations<00:05:10.690> so<00:05:11.690> it's<00:05:11.810> going<00:05:11.900> to<00:05:11.990> produce<00:05:12.290> a

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
variations so it's going to produce a

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.590 
variations so it's going to produce a
much<00:05:12.890> more<00:05:13.250> true-to-life<00:05:13.550> picture<00:05:14.240> and<00:05:14.420> then

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
much more true-to-life picture and then

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.890 
much more true-to-life picture and then
we<00:05:14.960> talked<00:05:15.350> about<00:05:15.640> we<00:05:16.640> have<00:05:16.850> our<00:05:17.360> new<00:05:17.510> AR

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900
