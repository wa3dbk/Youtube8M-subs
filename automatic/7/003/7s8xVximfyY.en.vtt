00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 minecraft a game that at first glance is 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.259
 look very innocent is a game in which 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.120
 you create your own story but do not know 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.639
 knows how many secrets it can contain 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.009
 this game so interesting his fame has 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.199
 increased since May 2009 when 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.180
 preliminary versions were released 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.490
 your final version on computers 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.580
 compatible with java was released on 18 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.130
 November 2011 in the main with 2011 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.769
 this game was created by markus notch 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.019
 I'm not sure what intentions he made 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.420
 this game so subliminally diabolical 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.550
 a few days ago I found a 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.290
 article in a very strange web page 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.870
 whose link or link I will not reveal 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.300
 security of the public because the article 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.489
 was narrated by a 13 year old boy the 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.260
 which had an IQ and 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.239
 a very developed maturity to 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.730
 Then I will read what the article 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.649
 I said hello I came to write this 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.379
 article because this is probably 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.030
 my last day of life three weeks ago 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.219
 I was playing minecraft very 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.989
 I quietly had a game of a 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.090
 only player in which I dedicated myself to 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.729
 daily had a big house full of 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.450
 traps a farm diamond armor 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.600
 weapons 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.880
 etcetera that day I decided to go find 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.189
 obsidian obsidian is a material in 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.679
 Minecraft very hard to get but 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.600
 not to find to get obsidian 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:21.240
 had to have a diamond peak the 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.340
 which I already had then I got a little bit for 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.929
 to create an enchantment table 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.479
 to be able to improve my weapons and 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.429
 tools then I finished crafter the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.140
 or build it and I was very happy 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.509
 since I could improve my things with 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.340
 points when I placed the table 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.500
 enchantments in my room 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.580
 house in minecraft I placed my sword for 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.470
 can improve it 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.299
 the strange thing started when I noticed that the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.819
 letters that were there were not like 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.799
 should normally be those letters not 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.810
 they are legible since they are written in 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.689
 some language that should not have created 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.060
 the weird thing is that the letters did not come out that way 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.319
 the letters were completely legible but 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.360
 they were in English 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.369
 the first option said fifth motel that 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.200
 means the kingdom of hell 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.119
 the second said you bite is weak 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.220
 what it means to kill the devil and the 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.920
 third said ghost is not my lord what 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.509
 means god is not my lord I stayed 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.269
 a while thinking and I started to investigate 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.840
 this on the internet after three hours of 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.700
 to be 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.310
 giving answers I did not find 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.349
 absolutely nothing which seemed to me 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.870
 weird because I had the premium version 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.730
 why I paid and it was totally 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.650
 original then I went back into the game 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.200
 hoping that those writings 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.660
 have changed and miraculously happened 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.160
 the scriptures were not like this now 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.049
 they were as they should 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.390
 I was glad and then I improved my sword 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.459
 I went to the inventory and I noticed that when 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.620
 the cursor on the sword the name of 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.780
 the sword was written as the letters 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.880
 from the table of enchantments and they seemed 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.230
 be written in blood what is very 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.079
 weird since no weapon or tool 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.940
 it would have to be written so I ignored it 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.730
 thinking that I improve it so much that it was 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.650
 well they spent three days inside 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.540
 minecraft and I remembered that I still had 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.640
 something obsidian I remembered there was 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.530
 seen a video on youtube of how to open 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.629
 a portal to put that is to hell 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.319
 to open it I just needed to flint in 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.510
 destination 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.760
 I can not translate it into Spanish because I do not 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.980
 I know how it is said and I also needed 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.200
 obsidian because I already had those two things 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.420
 so I went to work I finished 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.370
 make the portal in less than a minute and 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.830
 I was anxious to get in because in the 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.020
 half could find 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.880
 courses that are only there 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.950
 normally when going through the portal the 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.290
 camera starts to wobble or move 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.270
 a little and the camera turns purple 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.040
 in my case the same thing happened but after 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.810
 to wait three seconds to be 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.490
 teleported to the never I started 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.270
 hear a very sharp wail and 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.400
 disturbing 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.380
 after hearing this annoying noise 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.780
 five seconds it stopped and it was 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.880
 transported by denying at that time 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.160
 I felt it was so real minecraft 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.230
 done I felt inside the game could 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.210
 feel the warmth of the negev I started to 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.970
 walk thinking of absolutely nothing 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.280
 since I could not believe it I was really 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.650
 inside of minecraft in the never me 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.750
 I scared too much I wanted to throw myself 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.360
 to the ground but I even felt that the 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.220
 feet were burning me little by little I was a 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.110
 little later on until you reach a 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.510
 door which was neither iron nor 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.970
 wood was a totally new material 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.190
 then I had no choice but to enter 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.440
 when opening the door slowly with 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.480
 curiosity running in my veins not 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.120
 I could believe what my eyes witnessed 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.280
 it was Satan himself watching 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.190
 amazed that satan creature 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.680
 he looked up and told me you have fun 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.110
 you have come to my world I did not answer 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.420
 nothing because I wanted to cry I felt 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.100
 a lump in the throat approached 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.230
 slowly to me in a very 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.930
 strange stealing my cheek with his 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.240
 huge claws whispered in my ear 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.000
 welcome to the neder now you will be my hand 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.830
 right after that I woke up sitting 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.230
 in front of my computer watching the menu 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.420
 of minecraft startup was more than 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.250
 sure I would never play this again 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.380
 diabolical game keep me away from the 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.210
 computer and acting on impulse I took 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.980
 my computer and whip against 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.320
 I floor until I leave it totally 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.510
 destroyed I picked up all the pieces of the 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.700
 computer to go to burn but at 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.800
 open the door of my house I discovered that 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.710
 I was still in the middle but now this one 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.840
 it looked like the real hell 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.970
 totally real since that day I've been 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.890
 trying to survive from the monsters 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.990
 that terrify me day and night I do not know what 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.940
 I tried to commit suicide of many 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.130
 ways I throw myself from high places 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.230
 I tried to let the monsters 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.180
 they will kill and throw me to the lava but that 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.670
 it only caused me more pain and suffering 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.410
 now I'm just here waiting for you 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.830
 someone read this and take me out of play 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.830
 infernal
