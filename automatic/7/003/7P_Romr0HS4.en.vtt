00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
we've got a couple of eggs boom so you

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.450 
we've got a couple of eggs boom so you
hear<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.229> sound<00:01:19.560> that's<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.070> sound<00:01:20.340> of

moisture it's boiling and it's keeping

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.700 
moisture it's boiling and it's keeping
the<00:01:23.670> eggs<00:01:23.909> off<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.990> steel<00:01:25.229> pan<00:01:25.500> it's

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
the eggs off of the steel pan it's

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.620 
the eggs off of the steel pan it's
preventing<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.430> from<00:01:26.460> sticking<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.150> heat<00:01:27.420> is

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
preventing it from sticking the heat is

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.420 
preventing it from sticking the heat is
preventing<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.290> from<00:01:28.350> from<00:01:28.799> becoming<00:01:29.070> stuck

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
preventing it from from becoming stuck

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.420 
preventing it from from becoming stuck
this<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.360> exactly<00:01:30.840> what<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.170> want<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:32.130> start

this is exactly what you want you start
peeling<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.880> back<00:01:35.180> spread<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.270> around<00:01:38.540> find

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
peeling it back spread it around find

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.300 
peeling it back spread it around find
out<00:01:39.689> where<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.170> know<00:01:40.290> where<00:01:40.860> it's<00:01:40.979> developed

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
out where you know where it's developed

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.120 
out where you know where it's developed
a<00:01:41.340> little<00:01:41.490> crust<00:01:42.680> spread<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> rest<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
all right I'm going to let it set here

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.930 
all right I'm going to let it set here
for<00:01:53.960> a<00:01:54.200> second<00:01:54.680> get<00:01:54.980> really<00:01:55.280> rigid<00:01:55.700> then<00:01:55.880> I'm

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
for a second get really rigid then I'm

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.550 
for a second get really rigid then I'm
going<00:01:56.060> to<00:01:56.120> flip<00:01:56.420> it<00:01:56.450> first<00:01:57.080> I'm<00:01:57.230> going<00:01:57.320> to<00:01:57.410> pull

going to flip it first I'm going to pull

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:14.580 
going to flip it first I'm going to pull
it'll<00:01:57.740> salt<00:02:01.330> there<00:02:05.380> a<00:02:06.380> little<00:02:07.220> pepper<00:02:09.190> good

all right here we go right here a little
bit<00:02:32.980> of<00:02:33.070> a<00:02:33.130> retarded<00:02:33.580> flip<00:02:33.940> because<00:02:34.300> I'm

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
bit of a retarded flip because I'm

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.800 
bit of a retarded flip because I'm
holding<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.840> camera<00:02:34.870> with<00:02:35.260> one<00:02:35.410> hand<00:02:36.810> all
