00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
we would want to get it boiled down to

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.609 
we would want to get it boiled down to
the<00:01:05.040> real<00:01:05.450> UFOs<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.110> we<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> work

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619

the real UFOs and so we have a work
underway<00:01:08.040> right<00:01:08.220> now<00:01:08.280> by<00:01:08.850> our<00:01:09.000> Science<00:01:09.299> Review

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
underway right now by our Science Review

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.330 
underway right now by our Science Review
Board<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:10.320> actually<00:01:10.530> call<00:01:10.740> through<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.250> eight

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
Board to actually call through the eight

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.830 
Board to actually call through the eight
hundred<00:01:11.670> or<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:11.790> reports<00:01:12.270> would<00:01:12.420> get<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> month

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
hundred or so reports would get a month

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.899 
hundred or so reports would get a month
and<00:01:12.990> boil<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.560> down<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.010> significant<00:01:14.610> few

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
and boil it down to the significant few

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.719 
and boil it down to the significant few
so<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.570> can<00:01:15.689> actually<00:01:15.830> make<00:01:16.830> those<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.460> center

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
so we can actually make those the center

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.060 
so we can actually make those the center
point<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.060> MUFON<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:19.470> really<00:01:19.710> need<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.920> take

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
point of MUFON we really need to take

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.249 
point of MUFON we really need to take
away<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.369> stigma<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:21.060> MUFON<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:22.020> this

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
away the stigma that MUFON is this

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.140 
away the stigma that MUFON is this
somehow<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.710> secretive<00:01:23.340> organizations<00:01:24.030> that

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
somehow the secretive organizations that

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.359 
somehow the secretive organizations that
hides<00:01:24.420> things<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.200> we<00:01:25.290> need<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.560> really<00:01:26.040> do<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
hides things so we need to really do the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.249 
hides things so we need to really do the
analysis<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.270> that's<00:01:27.720> what's<00:01:27.930> being<00:01:28.080> done

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
analysis and that's what's being done

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.170 
analysis and that's what's being done
right<00:01:28.290> now<00:01:28.500> by<00:01:29.220> our<00:01:29.369> science<00:01:29.670> review<00:01:29.909> aboard

strange and very consistent but we have

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.830 
strange and very consistent but we have
a<00:03:28.140> good<00:03:28.770> working<00:03:29.040> relationship<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:30.300> I<00:03:30.390> think

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
a good working relationship and I think

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.170 
a good working relationship and I think
that<00:03:31.140> they<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:32.010> French<00:03:32.280> guys<00:03:32.580> who<00:03:32.850> were<00:03:32.970> part

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
that they the French guys who were part

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.150 
that they the French guys who were part
of<00:03:33.270> Japan<00:03:33.690> as<00:03:33.959> long<00:03:34.440> as<00:03:34.620> they<00:03:34.739> feel<00:03:34.950> that

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
of Japan as long as they feel that

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.190 
of Japan as long as they feel that
they're<00:03:35.400> dealing<00:03:35.850> with<00:03:35.880> people<00:03:36.810> you<00:03:37.080> know

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.380 
they're dealing with people you know
firmly<00:03:37.860> rooted<00:03:38.190> in<00:03:38.370> science<00:03:38.880> I<00:03:39.060> think<00:03:39.239> their

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
firmly rooted in science I think their

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.280 
firmly rooted in science I think their
company<00:03:39.840> with

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
company with

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.979
