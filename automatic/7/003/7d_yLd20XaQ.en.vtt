about 20 1500 pounds of potatoes an hour

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.820 
about 20 1500 pounds of potatoes an hour
it<00:00:48.340> comes<00:00:49.030> out<00:00:49.210> to<00:00:49.420> several<00:00:49.690> million<00:00:50.140> pounds

it comes out to several million pounds

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.760 
it comes out to several million pounds
per<00:00:51.070> week<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:52.180> takes<00:00:52.390> about<00:00:52.570> four<00:00:53.140> pounds<00:00:53.440> of

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770
