 two cold since 2008 this winter again 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:13.869
 will begin 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:15.299
 let's freeze 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.980
 warm 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:16.880
 for January 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.859
 and most importantly the engine breaks higher 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.279
 abbey mates 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.550
 Spartak Moscow from 3 to 10 percent 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.880
 in the message 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.550
 let's go show 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.550
 expert 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.370
 in 2011 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.060
 to forge 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.990
 why didnâ€™t the blanket see begin in which 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.760
 volumes if this is an uneasy matter clever and 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.160
 called Falun Dafa in Pyatigorsk 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.670
 or will need to contain the engine 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.880
 Japan is the most severe frosts 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.960
 all day crazy 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.210
 supervised redistribution experiment with the account 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.630
 along with the machine nothing like he 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.150
 no longer pop it is made of super 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.260
 of materials 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.450
 gradually fiber Yakutia in making 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.240
 your hotel 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.540
 more important the book is red dollars analytics all the more 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.230
 why do I need it at all 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.330
 but I repeat for hours on end 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.980
 slower you go on 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.590
 and you do not consider fuel not to save 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.950
 it turned out that the engine is not warm 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.680
 fuel consumption is more than heated hell 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.350
 auto heat reduces fuel consumption by 20 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.280
 percent to reduce warm-up time 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.520
 car engine several times 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.650
 slows down the alignment process 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.679
 engine 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:40.369
 provides great 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.689
 Domodedovo clean 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.070
 product not seen 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.130
 its like something specially fixed 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.130
 okay and no effort needed 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.750
