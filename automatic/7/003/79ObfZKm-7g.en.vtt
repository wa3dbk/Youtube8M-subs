00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.420
 good people from youtube are welcome 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.160
 once again to a new video of mine in the 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.990
 which I will tell you about those who are my 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.709
 look like the worst thorns of the 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.619
 video game 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:17.590
 first and foremost that is a spin-off 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:19.660
 a spin-off is a kind of extra that 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.390
 they usually do for video games and 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.700
 TV series and those things so 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.340
 general are not very long are not very 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.320
 complexes are timeless in the sense 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.270
 that what happens in them does not affect 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.399
 no way to the series or video game 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.399
 original and also usually the 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.289
 spin-off are extremely bad xd and 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.960
 good knowing that they are the spin-off 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:43.929
 let's go straight to position number 5 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.559
 at number 5 we have the mega 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:47.199
 man soccer 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.960
 This spin-off is just as 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.539
 good as its title is to say super bad 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.329
 x of this game is a slop in several 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.309
 senses as you will always know 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.469
 soccer games for the nes for 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.690
 cell phones and all those 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.249
 platforms are always difficult to 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.920
 play for its bad and justified 

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:06.760
 gameplay then what can you 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.830
 wait for one 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.990
 football made by developers of 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.420
 platform games obviously a 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.520
 fiasco although aesthetically good 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.830
 achieved its gameplay and errors what 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.810
 they put in this place besides me 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.610
 It seems stupid to make someone like 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.620
 megaman who is always in charge of 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.260
 stop the evil plans of this from 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.270
 here is ridiculed and denigrated of that 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.090
 form only for a spin-off that is not worth 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.520
 worth playing and as extra data at the end 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.650
 when I completed the game because of an error 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.020
 of programming instead of showing you the 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.640
 final scene and the game credits you 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.640
 sent back to the home screen 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.400
 in position number 2 we have hey 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.800
 picachu this game consisted of 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.620
 get a pikachu and take care of it is to say 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.750
 a total kitsch has no more 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.790
 simply a game where we have a 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.040
 pikachu as a pet we have to 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.410
 feed him and take him for a walk play 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.540
 with him go to parties of other pokemones 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.520
 in the future when our pikachu 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.860
 if we were older we should leave it in 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.840
 freedom and then in theory we should of 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.570
 get another pikachu to take care of him and 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.300
 well in the end is that there is more to say 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.250
 of this game in my opinion of the 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.160
 million thorns that pokemon has 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.900
 this is one of the most ridiculous but 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.910
 well there's not much to say about this 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.910
 game let's go to the next 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.830
 at number 3 we have mario mario hotel 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.170
 Bros is another of the games that has 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.540
 thousands and thousands of spin-offs to his credit of 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.610
 which many are very ridiculous but 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.980
 personally I think that this is the most 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.890
 fool of all who have played 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.320
 they will know why those who have not played this 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.540
 game so very simple it's about 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.670
 puzzle- like screens where our 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.730
 goal is to make boxer can pass 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.680
 It's as simple as this game, just like its 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.680
 simplicity the boredom that we 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.630
 provides when playing it is unimaginable 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.760
 likewise we should be grateful that 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.650
 it was never an official game of nintendo 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.380
 since you could not even play in your 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.880
 consoles but well really there's no 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.250
 a lot to talk about this game 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.250
 just go to the next 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.980
 at number 2 we have our 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.930
 dear sonic which also has some 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.300
 so many spin-off of disgust to his credit 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.150
 maybe they think I'm going to talk about this 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.460
 game but even if this one is pretty bad 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.160
 there is one that in my opinion is in aspects 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.200
 specific worse than that of shadow no 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.180
 I remember exactly what the name is called 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.190
 sonic game but the game consists of 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.530
 escape from the island where you were 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.480
 and the way to do it was surpassing 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.150
 levels that dealt with logic challenges 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.130
 grammatical knowledge riddles and 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.590
 mathematical challenges all in 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.170
 time trial because he placed this game 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.660
 in this high part of the top 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.120
 for various reasons for me in what 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.370
 I suppose that because I'm raised by 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.740
 word video games and studies could not 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.870
 be in the same sentence is to say that 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.150
 when I was studying I could not even think of 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.220
 the video games and when I played then 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.110
 obviously because of my mind I was not passing 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.360
 absolutely for nothing the word 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.520
 studies or anything related to it already 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.290
 that playing was a way to forget about 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.639
 the multiplications and divisions and 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.710
 things of those 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.020
 this is why this game seems so 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.030
 fucking bored but know that 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.159
 the video game is fine that to us 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.080
 today having passed through that stage 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:41.300
 of life more than a decade ago 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.580
 this game is very good to improve 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.650
 our mental acuity and it is very complete 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.110
 in terms of the number of challenges of 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.360
 all type that contains but in spite of 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.550
 that remember that this is my top and it's my 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.590
 opinion and although I understand that this game 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.199
 It is ideal for teenage children 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.479
 and sometimes even adults less applied 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:02.000
 improve your mental acuity for me as 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:04.250
 I hate him, I could play the 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.500
 three games that I mentioned before but 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.529
 this sonic game yes I would not play it 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:13.419
 for nothing simply for how am I xd 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:13.419
 so let's move on to number one on the top 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.370
 in the position number 1 I have decided to put 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.650
 which in my opinion is without a doubt and 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.470
 by far the worst spin-off of all 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.630
 or at least of those that I have knowledge 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:31.180
 the number one spot is taken by pokemon 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.850
 channel the game is that we are 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.610
 with pickup up the television and now 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:39.040
 that's all we have next to pikachu and 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.990
 in front of a television in which 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.720
 we can choose between different channels 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.240
 of television to see some were 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.830
 blocked and there were actually few is 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.470
 say the channels were not too much 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.090
 precisely and in some channels it 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.970
 could interact with the channel 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.730
 answering questions and things like that but 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:00.370
 really nothing else is like buying 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:03.460
 the gta 4 or gta 5 to see 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.380
 television and it's silly is a 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.510
 game that maybe a very small boy 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.850
 Pokemon fan and very innocent without 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.430
 more nothing to do could perhaps like 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:15.070
 but wait for this game to entertain 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:18.010
 your audience of all ages is a 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:20.020
 complete idiocy that is to say he does not have 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.060
 playability have programs that are 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.409
 they do repetitive and you can see all 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.809
 the game programs 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:27.729
 now how much is a game that 

00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:30.009
 it lacks everything necessary for a 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:32.019
 game is at least playable and over 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:34.809
 being a spin-off is for me 

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:37.269
 knowledge the worst spin-off done well 

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:39.219
 So, nothing this was my top remember 

00:06:37.269 --> 00:06:40.989
 that if you liked you can leave your like and 

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:43.089
 If you do not agree, you can leave your 

00:06:40.989 --> 00:06:45.039
 dislike without any problem and also 

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:47.050
 remember to comment on that spin-off that 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:49.749
 they think I should be in this top 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:53.610
 so then nothing a taste and see you 

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:53.610
 in the next video to diosito
