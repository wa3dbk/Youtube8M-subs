Hi everyone from AC News!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Let's see the today's trailer,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
cinema news is coming up!

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Fan's of movie The Avengers have not particularly reacted

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
with great enthusiasm when finally the original trailer came out.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
They got the impression of not eyeing any surprise,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
nothing more than the photos that are on the web since

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Iron Man in 2007 came out in theatres.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Even if the cast is prestigious and with the most in stars of Hollywood,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
like Robert Downey Junior, Scarlett Johansson and Chris Evans,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
we presume the film will be a blockbuster flop.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Lone Ranger movie after being left aside for budget problems

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
is back on the track with sponsor Walt Disney Pictures and

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
will be directed by Gore Verbinski from the script of Justin Haythe.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
It's not clear if the movie will make it for the first programmed released date,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
21st December 2012, but the cast is still the same of the first project:

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, James Badge Dale and many others.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
That's all for today,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
see you soon with AC News!
