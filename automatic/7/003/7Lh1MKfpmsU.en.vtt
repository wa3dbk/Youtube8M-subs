with<00:03:00.060> Nerlens<00:03:00.720> Noel<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.440> basically<00:03:02.220> there

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
with Nerlens Noel and basically there

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.309 
with Nerlens Noel and basically there
are<00:03:02.670> two<00:03:02.970> scenarios<00:03:03.360> we<00:03:03.840> could<00:03:04.049> have<00:03:04.140> gone

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
are two scenarios we could have gone

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.400 
are two scenarios we could have gone
with<00:03:04.620> scenario<00:03:05.280> one<00:03:05.640> finding<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.630> big<00:03:06.959> that

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
with scenario one finding a big that

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.590 
with scenario one finding a big that
already<00:03:07.709> has<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.190> long<00:03:08.489> term<00:03:08.760> contract<00:03:09.060> and

already has a long term contract and

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.050 
already has a long term contract and
figure<00:03:10.170> out<00:03:10.290> if<00:03:10.530> we<00:03:10.709> can<00:03:10.739> find<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.519> trade<00:03:11.760> for

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
figure out if we can find a trade for

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.360 
figure out if we can find a trade for
that<00:03:12.180> guy<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:13.110> second<00:03:13.530> scenario<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:14.310> to

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
that guy and the second scenario is to

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.229 
that guy and the second scenario is to
find<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:15.150> raw<00:03:15.660> talent<00:03:16.079> find<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:17.100> rookie<00:03:17.700> with<00:03:18.060> the

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
find a raw talent find a rookie with the

Nerlens<00:05:28.080> the<00:05:28.530> well<00:05:29.009> he<00:05:29.279> is<00:05:29.430> most<00:05:29.699> definitely

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:29.969 
Nerlens the well he is most definitely

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:33.890 
Nerlens the well he is most definitely
not<00:05:30.960> the<00:05:31.319> same<00:05:31.560> player<00:05:31.919> like<00:05:32.430> he<00:05:32.610> was<00:05:32.819> in<00:05:33.090> 2k<00:05:33.569> 14

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
not the same player like he was in 2k 14

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.999 
not the same player like he was in 2k 14
he<00:05:34.740> is<00:05:34.860> much<00:05:35.370> more<00:05:35.940> of<00:05:36.240> a<00:05:36.569> raw<00:05:36.840> player<00:05:37.259> and<00:05:37.590> we

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
he is much more of a raw player and we

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:39.559 
he is much more of a raw player and we
will<00:05:38.250> have<00:05:38.460> to<00:05:38.639> spend<00:05:38.909> a<00:05:39.029> lot<00:05:39.240> more<00:05:39.300> time

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569 
will have to spend a lot more time

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:42.320 
will have to spend a lot more time
developing<00:05:40.259> him<00:05:40.830> to<00:05:41.279> be<00:05:41.460> the<00:05:41.759> same<00:05:42.000> player

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
developing him to be the same player

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.010 
developing him to be the same player
like<00:05:42.810> he<00:05:42.990> was<00:05:43.199> in<00:05:43.500> 2k<00:05:43.979> 14<00:05:44.310> so<00:05:45.060> that<00:05:45.090> means<00:05:45.479> more

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
like he was in 2k 14 so that means more

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.260 
like he was in 2k 14 so that means more
minutes<00:05:46.500> most<00:05:46.800> likely<00:05:47.310> for<00:05:47.580> mr.<00:05:47.849> Bismack

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
minutes most likely for mr. Bismack

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.200 
minutes most likely for mr. Bismack
Biyombo<00:05:48.380> who<00:05:49.380> is<00:05:49.529> also<00:05:50.009> turning<00:05:50.340> out<00:05:50.639> to<00:05:50.669> be<00:05:50.880> an
