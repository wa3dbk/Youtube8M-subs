more<00:02:24.780> modern<00:02:25.200> design<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:26.400> just<00:02:26.580> pull<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.180> up

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
more modern design you just pull it up

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.550 
more modern design you just pull it up
and<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.630> has<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.780> bunch<00:02:27.990> of<00:02:28.110> different<00:02:28.170> settings

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
and it has a bunch of different settings

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.440 
and it has a bunch of different settings
and<00:02:29.130> that<00:02:30.000> tilts<00:02:30.360> down<00:02:30.390> I<00:02:30.900> didn't<00:02:31.500> have<00:02:31.650> a

and that tilts down I didn't have a

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.940 
and that tilts down I didn't have a
thing<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.510> stand<00:02:33.870> these<00:02:34.050> things<00:02:34.290> up<00:02:34.500> on<00:02:34.680> so<00:02:34.890> I

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
thank you supposed to hook the positive

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.720 
thank you supposed to hook the positive
up<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.560> positive<00:02:58.770> up<00:02:59.220> first

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
up to positive up first

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
test this bad boy you're not supposed to

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.920 
test this bad boy you're not supposed to
test<00:03:12.720> these<00:03:12.930> things<00:03:13.170> out<00:03:13.410> of<00:03:13.560> water<00:03:14.840> but<00:03:15.840> I'm

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
test these things out of water but I'm

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.590 
test these things out of water but I'm
gonna<00:03:16.140> because<00:03:18.020> that's<00:03:19.020> just<00:03:19.820> because<00:03:20.820> these

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
gonna because that's just because these

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.960 
gonna because that's just because these
motors<00:03:22.080> heat<00:03:22.320> up<00:03:22.530> as<00:03:23.280> long<00:03:23.460> as<00:03:23.550> you<00:03:23.640> don't<00:03:23.760> run

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
motors heat up as long as you don't run

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.640 
motors heat up as long as you don't run
them<00:03:24.150> for<00:03:25.310> two<00:03:26.310> or<00:03:26.490> three<00:03:27.020> minutes<00:03:28.020> you're<00:03:28.470> not

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
them for two or three minutes you're not

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.320 
them for two or three minutes you're not
going<00:03:28.770> to<00:03:28.830> have<00:03:29.010> an<00:03:29.100> issue<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.910> reason<00:03:30.240> why

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
going to have an issue the reason why

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.060 
going to have an issue the reason why
they<00:03:30.510> say<00:03:30.690> that<00:03:30.720> is<00:03:30.990> because<00:03:31.140> when<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.800> put<00:03:31.980> it

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
they say that is because when you put it

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.610 
they say that is because when you put it
in<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.250> water<00:03:32.460> it<00:03:32.820> cools<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.330> motor<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:33.960> it's

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
in the water it cools the motor and it's

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.670 
in the water it cools the motor and it's
just<00:03:34.950> it's<00:03:35.550> kind<00:03:35.670> of<00:03:35.790> like<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:35.970> lawnmower<00:03:36.300> oh<00:03:36.870> no

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
just it's kind of like a lawnmower oh no

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.530 
just it's kind of like a lawnmower oh no
it's<00:03:37.860> not<00:03:37.980> it's<00:03:38.340> like<00:03:38.430> a<00:03:38.520> boat<00:03:38.820> motor<00:03:39.000> you're

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
it's not it's like a boat motor you're

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.390 
it's not it's like a boat motor you're
supposed<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:39.870> run<00:03:40.020> it<00:03:40.140> in<00:03:40.260> water<00:03:40.500> or<00:03:40.770> it'll

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
supposed to run it in water or it'll

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.170 
supposed to run it in water or it'll
heat<00:03:41.790> up<00:03:41.820> and<00:03:42.150> die<00:03:42.950> same<00:03:43.950> principle<00:03:44.460> but<00:03:44.490> for

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
heat up and die same principle but for

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.780 
heat up and die same principle but for
this<00:03:45.330> test<00:03:45.900> sake<00:03:46.230> it's<00:03:46.440> not<00:03:46.620> gonna<00:03:46.740> hurt<00:03:46.980> so

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
this test sake it's not gonna hurt so

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.460 
this test sake it's not gonna hurt so
basically<00:03:48.480> we're<00:03:48.720> gonna<00:03:48.810> put<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:49.080> in<00:03:49.170> forward

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
basically we're gonna put it in forward

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.690 
basically we're gonna put it in forward
and<00:03:50.040> we're<00:03:50.160> gonna<00:03:50.250> turn<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:51.030> dial<00:03:51.350> to<00:03:52.350> one<00:03:52.700> you

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
and we're gonna turn the dial to one you

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.970 
and we're gonna turn the dial to one you
can<00:03:53.820> see<00:03:54.000> it's<00:03:54.150> running<00:03:55.640> too<00:03:56.959> and<00:03:57.980> there's

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
can see it's running too and there's

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.680 
can see it's running too and there's
three<00:03:59.280> this<00:03:59.820> one<00:04:00.030> doesn't<00:04:00.209> have<00:04:00.330> a<00:04:00.420> whole<00:04:00.660> lot

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
three this one doesn't have a whole lot

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.620 
three this one doesn't have a whole lot
of<00:04:01.200> power<00:04:01.380> but<00:04:02.310> when<00:04:02.880> you<00:04:02.940> use<00:04:03.240> these<00:04:03.420> two

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
of power but when you use these two

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.760 
of power but when you use these two
together<00:04:03.810> use<00:04:04.560> this<00:04:04.830> one<00:04:05.040> for<00:04:05.190> steering<00:04:06.770> off

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
together use this one for steering off

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.280 
together use this one for steering off
and<00:04:08.190> then<00:04:08.480> reverse<00:04:09.480> where<00:04:09.750> it's<00:04:09.870> just<00:04:10.080> the

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
and then reverse where it's just the

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
and then reverse where it's just the
same

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.800 

and<00:04:14.680> pretty<00:04:15.680> much<00:04:15.800> it<00:04:16.010> for<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.400> MinnKota<00:04:16.700> 15

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
and pretty much it for the MinnKota 15

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.480 
and pretty much it for the MinnKota 15
so<00:04:18.590> let's<00:04:18.889> unhook<00:04:19.190> it<00:04:19.430> and<00:04:20.950> hook<00:04:21.950> up<00:04:22.100> the<00:04:22.310> bad

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
so let's unhook it and hook up the bad

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.250 
so let's unhook it and hook up the bad
boy<00:04:24.580> game<00:04:25.580> Fisher<00:04:26.030> this<00:04:26.570> joker<00:04:26.840> here<00:04:27.110> will

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:56.260 
little trash can over all right so we
got<00:04:50.169> positive<00:04:51.520> and<00:04:52.520> negative<00:04:54.730> and<00:04:55.730> on<00:04:55.910> this

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
got positive and negative and on this

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.690 
got positive and negative and on this
particular<00:04:56.600> model<00:04:57.169> this<00:04:57.680> one<00:04:57.890> was<00:04:58.070> made<00:04:58.280> for

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
particular model this one was made for

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.650 
particular model this one was made for
going<00:04:58.940> up<00:04:59.030> front

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
going up front

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.020 
going up front
actually<00:05:00.530> most<00:05:00.740> both<00:05:01.130> of<00:05:01.340> these<00:05:01.460> though<00:05:01.760> I

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
actually most both of these though I

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.180 
actually most both of these though I
think<00:05:02.090> someone<00:05:02.660> has<00:05:02.810> repositioned<00:05:03.740> the

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
think someone has repositioned the

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.620 
think someone has repositioned the
motors<00:05:04.550> because<00:05:04.760> if<00:05:05.030> you're<00:05:05.150> gonna<00:05:05.210> put<00:05:05.510> these

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
motors because if you're gonna put these

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.500 
motors because if you're gonna put these
up<00:05:05.690> front<00:05:06.400> then<00:05:07.400> the<00:05:07.430> motors<00:05:08.090> need<00:05:08.270> to<00:05:08.390> be

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
up front then the motors need to be

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.400 
up front then the motors need to be
faced<00:05:08.979> the<00:05:09.979> other<00:05:10.100> way<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:10.520> opposite<00:05:10.940> of<00:05:11.090> the

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
faced the other way the opposite of the

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.260 
faced the other way the opposite of the
handle<00:05:12.410> or<00:05:12.800> they<00:05:12.979> need<00:05:13.100> to<00:05:13.160> be<00:05:13.280> faced<00:05:13.580> in<00:05:14.060> the

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
handle or they need to be faced in the

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.760 
handle or they need to be faced in the
same<00:05:14.450> direction<00:05:14.630> of<00:05:15.020> the<00:05:15.080> handle<00:05:15.470> and<00:05:15.590> these

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
same direction of the handle and these

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.600 
same direction of the handle and these
are<00:05:15.919> the<00:05:16.190> opposite<00:05:16.639> so<00:05:17.180> these<00:05:17.330> were<00:05:17.540> made<00:05:17.810> or

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
are the opposite so these were made or

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.730 
are the opposite so these were made or
repositioned<00:05:19.610> so<00:05:19.940> they<00:05:20.120> will<00:05:20.300> work<00:05:20.510> on<00:05:20.810> the

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
repositioned so they will work on the

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.100 
repositioned so they will work on the
back<00:05:21.919> of<00:05:22.070> a<00:05:22.100> boat<00:05:22.250> which<00:05:22.910> that's<00:05:23.570> what<00:05:23.720> we<00:05:23.930> did

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
back of a boat which that's what we did

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.680 
back of a boat which that's what we did
and<00:05:24.169> use<00:05:24.470> them<00:05:24.680> forth<00:05:24.950> on<00:05:25.760> this<00:05:25.970> thing<00:05:26.240> here<00:05:26.479> we

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
and use them forth on this thing here we

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.750 
and use them forth on this thing here we
had<00:05:26.870> a<00:05:26.900> little<00:05:27.260> bit<00:05:27.590> of<00:05:28.010> a<00:05:28.160> problem<00:05:28.430> with<00:05:28.669> this

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
had a little bit of a problem with this

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.469 
had a little bit of a problem with this
dial

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
dial

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.230 
dial

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240

smoke<00:05:32.510> coming<00:05:32.810> out<00:05:32.900> of<00:05:32.960> it<00:05:33.110> because<00:05:33.289> it<00:05:33.410> just

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
smoke coming out of it because it just

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.550 
smoke coming out of it because it just
didn't<00:05:33.830> have<00:05:33.979> a<00:05:34.010> really<00:05:34.400> good<00:05:34.669> contact
