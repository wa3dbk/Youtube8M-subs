00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.950 
HD effect in terms of Chang's like prior
to<00:01:23.400> YouTube's<00:01:23.759> currently<00:01:24.240> broadcast<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.780> HD

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
to YouTube's currently broadcast in HD

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.260 
to YouTube's currently broadcast in HD
and<00:01:25.560> there's<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.979> scanned<00:01:26.280> output<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.150> if<00:01:27.210> you

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
and there's a scanned output so if you

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.640 
and there's a scanned output so if you
have<00:01:27.360> an<00:01:27.479> old<00:01:27.630> or<00:01:27.810> television<00:01:28.259> here<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.530> can

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
have an old or television here you can

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.410 
have an old or television here you can
connect<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:28.920> with<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.100> spare<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.970> boxer

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
connect it with a spare and this boxer

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.640 
connect it with a spare and this boxer
she<00:01:30.570> comes<00:01:30.750> with<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.960> down<00:01:31.140> scaler

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
she comes with a down scaler

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.260 
she comes with a down scaler
so<00:01:31.950> it'll<00:01:32.130> actually<00:01:32.159> down<00:01:32.579> scale<00:01:32.970> will<00:01:33.180> say

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
so it'll actually down scale will say

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.760 
so it'll actually down scale will say
the<00:01:33.390> HD<00:01:33.780> channels<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.350> could<00:01:34.590> actually

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
the HD channels so you could actually

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.440 
the HD channels so you could actually
use<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.280> conjunction<00:01:35.340> with<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:36.090> standard

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450

box<00:02:01.829> you'll<00:02:02.189> notice<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.610> single<00:02:02.969> RF<00:02:03.719> input<00:02:03.960> in

it and the reason that after that is

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.180 
it and the reason that after that is
there's<00:02:06.719> actually<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:07.049> splitter<00:02:07.439> inside<00:02:07.979> this

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
that splits it into two independent and

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.949 
that splits it into two independent and
terrestrial<00:02:11.250> inputs<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.270> reason<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.900> I

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
terrestrial inputs and the reason that I

possible that up to four boxes will be

broadcast from two different boxes it

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.170 
broadcast from two different boxes it
would<00:02:34.140> limit<00:02:34.320> you<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:34.950> extent<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:36.150> can

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
would limit you to extent that you can

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.720 
would limit you to extent that you can
only<00:02:36.480> look<00:02:36.840> if<00:02:37.650> you're<00:02:37.800> recording<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.400> channel

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
only look if you're recording a channel

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.250 
only look if you're recording a channel
off<00:02:38.850> of<00:02:38.970> certain<00:02:39.120> looks<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.810> can<00:02:39.930> only<00:02:40.050> look

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
off of certain looks you can only look

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.200 
off of certain looks you can only look
at<00:02:40.440> channels<00:02:40.740> from<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.040> same<00:02:41.250> MUX<00:02:41.550> so<00:02:42.000> we'll

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
at channels from the same MUX so we'll

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.120 
at channels from the same MUX so we'll
say<00:02:42.420> if<00:02:42.540> TV<00:02:42.750> tree<00:02:43.110> was<00:02:43.290> moved<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.620> serve<00:02:43.920> a

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
say if TV tree was moved to serve a

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.100 
say if TV tree was moved to serve a
different<00:02:44.310> looks<00:02:44.640> with<00:02:45.180> an<00:02:45.300> ordinary<00:02:45.690> box<00:02:45.870> if

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
different looks with an ordinary box if

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.420 
different looks with an ordinary box if
you<00:02:46.200> record<00:02:46.560> an<00:02:46.680> hour<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.040> warned<00:02:47.280> you

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
you record an hour to you warned you

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.220 
you record an hour to you warned you
wouldn't<00:02:47.640> be<00:02:47.700> able<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:47.850> look<00:02:48.030> at<00:02:48.209> TV<00:02:48.390> tree<00:02:48.750> well

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
wouldn't be able to look at TV tree well

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.630 
wouldn't be able to look at TV tree well
this<00:02:49.470> box<00:02:49.650> here<00:02:49.890> it's<00:02:50.130> much<00:02:50.280> more<00:02:50.459> flexible

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
this box here it's much more flexible

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.240 
this box here it's much more flexible
and<00:02:51.300> that's<00:02:51.480> obviously<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.170> could<00:02:53.040> be<00:02:53.160> an

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
and that's obviously and could be an

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.800 
and that's obviously and could be an
important<00:02:53.670> feature<00:02:53.820> you<00:02:54.270> really<00:02:54.540> what<00:02:54.690> you're

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
important feature you really what you're

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.330 
important feature you really what you're
investing<00:02:55.230> in<00:02:55.320> here<00:02:55.560> is<00:02:55.680> future<00:02:56.010> proofing

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
investing in here is future proofing

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.970 
investing in here is future proofing
your<00:02:56.490> box<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:57.320> so<00:02:58.320> what<00:02:58.440> we're<00:02:58.530> gonna<00:02:58.620> do<00:02:58.800> here

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
your box and so what we're gonna do here

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.170 
your box and so what we're gonna do here
is<00:02:59.040> I'm<00:02:59.190> just<00:02:59.220> going<00:02:59.520> to<00:02:59.580> go<00:02:59.910> through<00:02:59.940> the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
is I'm just going to go through the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.150 
is I'm just going to go through the
steps<00:03:00.390> of<00:03:00.510> actually<00:03:00.830> connecting<00:03:01.830> this<00:03:01.950> over

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
steps of actually connecting this over

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.730 
steps of actually connecting this over
so<00:03:02.670> what<00:03:02.850> we<00:03:02.940> have<00:03:03.120> here<00:03:03.360> is<00:03:03.900> I'm<00:03:04.110> gonna<00:03:04.230> use<00:03:04.500> an

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
so what we have here is I'm gonna use an
