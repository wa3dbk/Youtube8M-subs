we're<00:00:00.630> going<00:00:00.780> to<00:00:00.840> talk<00:00:00.989> about<00:00:01.140> the<00:00:01.410> very<00:00:01.620> early

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
we're going to talk about the very early

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.710 
we're going to talk about the very early
origins<00:00:02.310> of<00:00:02.550> timekeeping<00:00:02.790> because<00:00:03.419> some<00:00:03.600> of

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
origins of timekeeping because some of

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.690 
origins of timekeeping because some of
those<00:00:03.810> are<00:00:03.870> collectible<00:00:04.859> items<00:00:05.160> as<00:00:05.339> well<00:00:05.370> and

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
those are collectible items as well and

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.490 
those are collectible items as well and
things<00:00:05.879> that<00:00:06.000> you'll<00:00:06.180> find<00:00:06.480> obviously<00:00:07.410> in

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
things that you'll find obviously in

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.140 
things that you'll find obviously in
these<00:00:07.649> cases<00:00:07.919> you<00:00:08.519> don't<00:00:08.550> have<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:08.940> wind

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
these cases you don't have to wind

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.910 
these cases you don't have to wind
anything<00:00:09.570> or<00:00:09.719> worried<00:00:09.900> about<00:00:10.230> how<00:00:10.740> you're

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
anything or worried about how you're

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.379 
anything or worried about how you're
going<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.099> take<00:00:11.309> care<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.610> these<00:00:11.700> cup<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.210> these

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
going to take care of these cup of these

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.180 
going to take care of these cup of these
time<00:00:12.690> keepers<00:00:13.080> but<00:00:13.469> they're<00:00:13.650> interesting<00:00:14.070> in

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
time keepers but they're interesting in

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.330 
time keepers but they're interesting in
themselves<00:00:14.870> we<00:00:15.870> probably<00:00:16.470> figured<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.070> the

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
themselves we probably figured that the

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.460 
themselves we probably figured that the
first<00:00:17.970> guy<00:00:18.150> that<00:00:18.420> figured<00:00:18.840> out<00:00:18.960> about<00:00:19.109> time

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
first guy that figured out about time

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.500 
first guy that figured out about time
keeping<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:20.010> poked<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.460> stick<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.029> sand<00:00:21.300> in

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
keeping it poked a stick in the sand in

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.970 
keeping it poked a stick in the sand in
Egypt<00:00:21.630> somewhere<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.320> saw<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.740> shadow

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
Egypt somewhere and saw that the shadow

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.370 
Egypt somewhere and saw that the shadow
moved<00:00:23.340> around<00:00:23.609> during<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.090> day<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.539> that

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
moved around during the day and that

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.769 
moved around during the day and that
probably<00:00:25.949> gave<00:00:26.250> him<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.490> idea<00:00:26.519> for<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.240> sundial

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
probably gave him the idea for a sundial

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.589 
probably gave him the idea for a sundial
I<00:00:28.349> have<00:00:28.740> some<00:00:28.920> examples<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.609> sundials<00:00:30.269> here

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
I have some examples of sundials here

has a equation of time chart in there
and<00:01:04.920> everything<00:01:05.280> too<00:01:05.489> they<00:01:05.970> always<00:01:06.150> have<00:01:06.390> a

because<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.640> need<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.820> orientate<00:01:09.420> yourself

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
because you need to orientate yourself

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.830 
because you need to orientate yourself
correctly<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.650> order<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.310> use<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.600> sundial<00:01:12.600> and

correctly in order to use a sundial and

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.570 
correctly in order to use a sundial and
really<00:01:13.049> know<00:01:13.200> what<00:01:13.350> time<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.400> is

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
really know what time it is this is

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.999 
really know what time it is this is
actually<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> 20th<00:01:15.450> century<00:01:15.930> piece<00:01:16.200> made<00:01:16.860> by

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
actually a 20th century piece made by

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.340 
actually a 20th century piece made by
the<00:01:17.070> waterbury<00:01:17.610> clock<00:01:17.909> company<00:01:18.140> but<00:01:19.140> it's

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
the waterbury clock company but it's

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.770 
the waterbury clock company but it's
they<00:01:19.770> call<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.130> their<00:01:20.310> son<00:01:20.640> watch<00:01:20.939> they<00:01:21.600> were

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
they call it their son watch they were

of course a big big clock manufacturer

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.810 
of course a big big clock manufacturer
but<00:01:25.259> they<00:01:25.380> thought<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.770> would<00:01:26.430> reach<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
water clocks which would work by a

these<00:01:54.149> all<00:01:54.390> had<00:01:54.630> problems<00:01:55.460> which<00:01:56.460> which<00:01:57.210> meant

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
these all had problems which which meant

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.940 
these all had problems which which meant

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
probably the better way to go and
