first one and didn't have any other
bites<00:00:19.619> but<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.070> I'm<00:00:20.850> sure<00:00:21.119> there's<00:00:21.360> more<00:00:21.509> fish

bites but it I'm sure there's more fish
there<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.140> whole<00:00:22.290> time<00:00:22.470> when<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.710> was

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
there and the whole time when I was

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.440 
there and the whole time when I was
fishing<00:00:23.040> or<00:00:23.490> when<00:00:23.759> I<00:00:23.820> was<00:00:23.910> throwing<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:24.210> drop

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.450

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
river channel right here it's got a big

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.430 
river channel right here it's got a big
flat<00:01:18.120> I<00:01:18.480> mean<00:01:18.630> it's<00:01:18.720> just<00:01:18.810> everything<00:01:19.170> is

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
wind and some overcast the fish might be

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.160 
wind and some overcast the fish might be
more<00:01:23.640> active<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.600> might<00:01:24.750> not<00:01:24.870> have<00:01:25.050> to

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
more active and you might not have to

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.300 
more active and you might not have to
catch<00:01:25.350> them<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.590> drop<00:01:25.890> shot<00:01:26.070> or<00:01:26.220> something

but I pulled over here and what we got
here<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.710> underwater<00:01:29.040> point<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:30.330> shows<00:01:30.600> up

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
here is the underwater point it shows up

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.430 
here is the underwater point it shows up
on<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.080> on<00:01:31.560> an<00:01:32.010> avionics<00:01:32.430> chip<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.440> it

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
on the on an avionics chip and it

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.110 
on the on an avionics chip and it
basically<00:01:34.710> comes<00:01:34.980> out<00:01:35.130> here<00:01:35.430> same<00:01:35.880> type<00:01:36.090> of

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
basically comes out here same type of

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.460 
basically comes out here same type of
situation<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:37.020> little<00:01:37.230> smaller

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
situation it's just a little smaller

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.200 
situation it's just a little smaller
point<00:01:37.800> I'm<00:01:38.400> just<00:01:38.460> going<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.730> see<00:01:38.790> if<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.970> can't

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
point I'm just going to see if I can't

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:50.699 
throughout the day I mean this is a this

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:53.149 
throughout the day I mean this is a this
is<00:03:51.359> a<00:03:51.419> spot<00:03:51.659> so<00:03:52.260> far<00:03:52.470> today<00:03:52.620> with<00:03:52.859> the<00:03:52.949> most

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
is a spot so far today with the most

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.969 
is a spot so far today with the most
bites<00:03:53.569> but<00:03:54.569> we've<00:03:54.989> only<00:03:55.079> fished<00:03:55.409> a<00:03:55.500> small<00:03:55.739> area

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:55.979 
bites but we've only fished a small area

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:57.860 
bites but we've only fished a small area
that's<00:03:56.159> lake<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:56.639> this<00:03:57.299> might<00:03:57.479> not<00:03:57.629> even<00:03:57.750> make

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
that's lake so this might not even make

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.689 
that's lake so this might not even make
it<00:03:58.019> in<00:03:58.199> the<00:03:58.260> rotation<00:03:58.829> if<00:03:59.040> we<00:03:59.400> go<00:03:59.519> somewhere

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
it in the rotation if we go somewhere

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.099 
it in the rotation if we go somewhere
else<00:03:59.940> and<00:04:00.060> catch<00:04:00.269> a<00:04:00.359> bunch<00:04:00.540> of<00:04:00.599> big<00:04:00.780> ones<00:04:00.900> or

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
else and catch a bunch of big ones or

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.719 
else and catch a bunch of big ones or
have<00:04:01.229> some<00:04:01.349> really<00:04:01.530> good<00:04:01.650> bites<00:04:01.889> so<00:04:02.129> you<00:04:02.609> never

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:02.729 
have some really good bites so you never

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:04.490 
have some really good bites so you never
know<00:04:02.970> just<00:04:03.030> keep<00:04:03.359> an<00:04:03.479> open<00:04:03.540> mind<00:04:03.750> but<00:04:04.349> there's

00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:32.219 
I didn't mean to set the hook is kind of

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:36.659 
I didn't mean to set the hook is kind of
instinct<00:04:32.669> that's<00:04:33.510> a<00:04:33.690> good<00:04:33.870> fish

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.189
