while<00:01:01.320> about<00:01:01.739> staying<00:01:02.160> with<00:01:02.430> Epson<00:01:02.850> and

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
while about staying with Epson and

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.509 
while about staying with Epson and
purchasing<00:01:03.660> either<00:01:03.840> 60<00:01:04.379> 10<00:01:04.650> then<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.309> thought

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
purchasing either 60 10 then I thought

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.359 
purchasing either 60 10 then I thought
about<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.760> 80/20<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:07.200> then<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.530> 90<00:01:07.799> 100

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
about the 80/20 and then the 90 100

about the 80/20 and then the 90 100
however<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.510> kept<00:01:10.260> coming<00:01:10.470> back<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.740> this

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
however I kept coming back to this

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.950 
however I kept coming back to this
Panasonic<00:01:11.580> because<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.150> specs<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
Panasonic because the specs on the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.980 
Panasonic because the specs on the
Panasonic<00:01:13.500> would<00:01:14.220> always<00:01:14.400> trump<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.479> absent

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
Panasonic would always trump the absent

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
you do have the s XRD system that Sony

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.550 
you do have the s XRD system that Sony
users<00:03:06.940> or<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.860> JVC<00:03:08.860> di<00:03:09.700> la<00:03:10.239> method<00:03:10.720> is<00:03:11.230> even

now coming out LED slushed laser methods
as<00:03:14.290> well<00:03:15.030> but<00:03:16.030> they're<00:03:16.540> super<00:03:16.959> expensive<00:03:17.140> and

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
as well but they're super expensive and

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.979 
as well but they're super expensive and
well<00:03:18.220> you<00:03:18.700> know<00:03:18.820> millions<00:03:19.120> 1<00:03:19.330> contrast<00:03:19.780> ratio

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
well you know millions 1 contrast ratio

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.920 
well you know millions 1 contrast ratio
great<00:03:20.650> but<00:03:21.160> that's<00:03:22.030> beyond<00:03:22.330> my<00:03:22.480> budget

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
great but that's beyond my budget

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.800 
great but that's beyond my budget
so<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.620> Panasonic's<00:03:24.250> got<00:03:24.549> 3<00:03:26.040> LCD<00:03:27.040> panels<00:03:27.810> all

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
so the Panasonic's got 3 LCD panels all

light<00:04:30.570> mind<00:04:31.570> you<00:04:31.780> when<00:04:31.990> you're<00:04:32.140> actually

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
light mind you when you're actually

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.230 
light mind you when you're actually
operating<00:04:32.830> in<00:04:32.890> say<00:04:33.220> this<00:04:33.400> mode<00:04:33.610> cinema<00:04:34.030> one

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
operating in say this mode cinema one

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.690 
operating in say this mode cinema one
it's<00:04:34.810> dropped<00:04:35.110> it<00:04:35.230> right<00:04:35.410> back<00:04:35.620> to<00:04:35.860> this<00:04:35.980> I<00:04:36.430> do

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
it's dropped it right back to this I do

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.370 
it's dropped it right back to this I do
believe<00:04:37.060> it's<00:04:37.240> five<00:04:37.420> or<00:04:37.570> six<00:04:37.750> hundred<00:04:37.810> lumens

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
believe it's five or six hundred lumens

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.310 
believe it's five or six hundred lumens
so<00:04:38.760> just<00:04:39.760> because<00:04:39.880> you<00:04:40.150> have<00:04:40.180> a<00:04:40.330> very<00:04:41.080> bright

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
so just because you have a very bright

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.780 
so just because you have a very bright
projector<00:04:41.860> doesn't<00:04:42.310> mean<00:04:42.400> you<00:04:42.490> actually<00:04:42.520> have

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
projector doesn't mean you actually have

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.420 
projector doesn't mean you actually have
to<00:04:42.880> use<00:04:43.120> it<00:04:43.270> at<00:04:43.390> that<00:04:43.570> level<00:04:43.830> this<00:04:44.830> project<00:04:45.280> is

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
300 inches obviously the bigger you

that's going to burn your lamp out a lot

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.410 
that's going to burn your lamp out a lot
