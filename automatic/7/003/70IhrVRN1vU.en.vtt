00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.330
 hi everyone knows anyway JCCT 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.110
 67 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.680
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:23.980
 special promo video because it's about 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.009
 so full of this black and white promo 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.890
 so I miss it just one but I you 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:33.239
 explain why so here's so 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.890
 all you see is new 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.540
 normal and if you see maps 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.020
 English is normal because it's not 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:44.800
 have not come out in French so they 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:51.210
 are numbered from 1 to the last so 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.210
 b doubled 101 makes you quickly go around 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:02.330
 I still had trouble looking 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:10.280
 all the promos what do you see this one there 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:13.160
 she is English that one I thought 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.660
 that it exists in French but never 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.660
 seen so in my opinion it does not exist 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.110
 now for everything I found this is 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.610

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.610
