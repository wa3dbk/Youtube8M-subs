00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:11.030
 good kids a first and a new 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.010
 episode of the hacker series in gta 5 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.650
 online that good and a week ago or 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.180
 so this series did not go up and now 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.010
 I looked forward to some so good 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.570
 Here you have a new episode , you know that 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.000
 good with the avalanche of cliches of 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.770
 these days because of the update 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.600
 1.10 and all that because it has been a bit 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.310
 slipped the hackers and that and I've 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.020
 preferred to upload the clichés like this is not 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.670
 that have come out but well we return a 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.110
 little bit to normal little by little and 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.760
 well I wanted to bring this episode of 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.499
 hackers pretty good the truth has 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.989
 given time to collect enough things 

00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:41.030
 and as good as you will see background are going to 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.530
 have a lot of things I'm going to look at it 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.289
 here I have it pointed but good 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.109
 you are basically going to be able to find weapons 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.190
 that shoot water or they shoot and where 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:51.440
 shoot out a jet of water 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.940
 amazing that it's like a super hose 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.889
 of water totally incredible the truth 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.909
 is that I loved that because 

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:58.489
 shoots a stream of water 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.679
 huge so to speak and well then 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.059
 also what are you going to shoot fire is 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.709
 here where it shoots a jet of 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.170
 fire also totally amazing and 

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:08.120
 huge and good also around here can 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.000
 going to find is also 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.820
 expansive waves with suitcases even or 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.650
 it is a very strange thing because 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.660
 you throw the briefcase and suddenly there is a wave 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.760
 expansive in which everything goes off 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.100
 towards the sides that you have the same 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.830
 briefcase and it's like like a black hole 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.650
 not because it's like you throw it and sometimes 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.910
 everything is attracted towards that 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.470
 towards the briefcase so it's like a 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.570
 black hole then pretty 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.950
 incredible you can touch one of the two 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.170
 things so to speak that is a wave 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.400
 super expansive or a wave that what 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.960
 does the opposite that attracts the 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.910
 things towards them not so good what 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.620
 you will see in the background we can also 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.210
 find around here I told him to go 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.470
 naming several things surely I do not 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.510
 give time to name everything because there 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.760
 many different things but good 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.770
 here baseball bats that have them if 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.200
 they are like cocktails mólotov a thing 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.440
 quite rare too and good is also 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.330
 here you can find how 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.910
 that you can shoot green or it's as if 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.110
 it was as if to make snot or whatever 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.820
 you can do both with a gun and with 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.550
 hitting with a bat or whatever and 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.170
 it comes out and comes out like green blood or shots 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.450
 or by car and it also comes out as a 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.010
 green dent or 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.780
 a green bullet shot and when 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.700
 we shoot people equal their 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.010
 blood and green salts as if it were hulk 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.290
 so to speak the blood of hull or 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.060
 snot or I do not know how to call it because the 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.830
 truth which is quite rare but one 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.269
 here you have enough things the truth is 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.680
 that has surprised me enough to those of 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.690
 this episode because what for example 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.550
 water and fire also when 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.170
 shoot if a jet of fire comes out 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.480
 things go off and more or that is 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.099
 an authentic madness and he shoots it are 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.780
 cuchi the truth is that it shoots and 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.040
 everything that is around also 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.650
 over here I've seen that you can shoot 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.390
 flares with a gun that good a 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.440
 pistol I think it goes out that shoots with 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.930
 a shotgun and they start to leave 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.360
 cartridges also with a car that makes 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.299
 Like some rap is strange I do not know if it's 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.500
 water what comes out of the ground or I do not know but 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.940
 the wheels are left marked on the 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.099
 soil as if it were water I do not know the 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.810
 it's really quite weird also if 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.239
 it's as if it were water but the dry 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.709
 not then not something quite weird and 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.690
 well you can also 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.329
 find him the new weapon this new that 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.209
 has left for online gta or the 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.340
 thompson this is called another form it 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.650
 call 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.060
 or something so weird but good is 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.489
 basically the one that has come out not the new 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.900
 dlc of valentine and all that is the 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.910
 that everyone knows as the 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.920
 lifelong thomson how nice to be 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.930
 here and as you will see in the background then shoot 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.269
 some incredible bombs shoots like a 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.640
 submachine gun but every bullet is like a 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.620
 incredible explosion so good then 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.599
 Here you can load everything and see it 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.250
 that makes it play put a second and 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.420
 some kids, nothing else 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.220
 You will have all background for it 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.780
 can you see you will have the hacker channel 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.670
 in the description that as I always say 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.650
 He is very attentive and always passes me everything 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.880
 instant when it comes out I also wanted 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.890
 tell you that this video I left 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.390
 scheduled because it was going to be all the 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.910
 day at the university from 8 in the 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.530
 morning until 9 at night so 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.910
 If I do not answer comments until 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.110
 night and all that do not worry 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.760
 that there are some who always start 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.379
 say no molas no answer 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.540
 comments okay I do not have the time that 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.950
 had before and before too as if 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.720
 I have 20 or 30 comments I can 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.480
 answer them but if I have 500 in each 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.549
 video is impossible and to put it at 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.549
 better I do not know in an easy day I can 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.930
 receive 3000 4000 comments because no 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.729
 they are only the comments of the last 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.500
 video but of all the videos 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.990
 above that they are coming 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.060
 I do not know five thousand comments a day easy 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.890
 or at least a thousand two thousand very sure 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.030
 so understand that it's impossible 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.980
 totally answer all 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.510
 comments and less with the university and 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.640
 all that many times I have to 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.350
 stay all day so just 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.300
 have a little patience and if you have 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.460
 Some doubt networks ask me the most about 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.870
 twitter which is where I usually look 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.940
 and all that if you mention me and I'm sure that 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.800
