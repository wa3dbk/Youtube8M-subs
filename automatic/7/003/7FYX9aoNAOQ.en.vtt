00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
weapons in mind they designed the mass

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.730 
weapons in mind they designed the mass
before<00:01:53.430> they<00:01:53.729> designed<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.240> weapons<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:55.110> is

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
before they designed the weapons it is

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.530 
before they designed the weapons it is
kind<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.399> right<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.790> aspect<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.390> can

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
kind of right in that aspect you can

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.359 
kind of right in that aspect you can
almost<00:01:57.659> tell<00:01:58.049> because<00:01:58.259> most<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.920> maps<00:01:59.130> have

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
almost tell because most the maps have

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.730 
almost tell because most the maps have
no<00:01:59.610> flow<00:01:59.909> whatsoever<00:02:00.600> well<00:02:01.229> let's<00:02:01.439> go<00:02:01.560> ahead

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
no flow whatsoever well let's go ahead

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.340 
no flow whatsoever well let's go ahead
and<00:02:01.890> find<00:02:02.130> what<00:02:02.369> flow<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.880> flow<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.869> basically

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
and find what flow is flow is basically

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.069 
and find what flow is flow is basically
when<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.799> basically<00:02:04.979> kill<00:02:05.430> an<00:02:05.549> enemy<00:02:05.670> and

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
when you can basically kill an enemy and

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.630 
when you can basically kill an enemy and
move<00:02:07.079> right<00:02:07.350> into<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.740> next<00:02:08.039> set<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.220> enemies

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
move right into the next set of enemies

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.880 
move right into the next set of enemies
rather<00:02:09.000> easily<00:02:09.390> like<00:02:10.259> when<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.560> kill<00:02:10.770> the

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
rather easily like when you kill the

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.380 
rather easily like when you kill the
group<00:02:11.039> enemies<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.580> know<00:02:11.700> exactly<00:02:12.150> where<00:02:12.300> the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
group enemies you know exactly where the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.920 
group enemies you know exactly where the
next<00:02:12.690> group

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
next group

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.300 
next group
enemies<00:02:13.200> are<00:02:13.230> going<00:02:13.439> to<00:02:13.530> do<00:02:13.650> which<00:02:13.890> keeps<00:02:14.159> the

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
enemies are going to do which keeps the

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.209 
enemies are going to do which keeps the
flow<00:02:14.609> of<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.879> map<00:02:15.209> up<00:02:15.480> there<00:02:16.019> is<00:02:16.170> no<00:02:16.349> you<00:02:17.099> no

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219 
flow of the map up there is no you no

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.149 
flow of the map up there is no you no
barriers<00:02:17.819> there's<00:02:18.239> no<00:02:18.450> like<00:02:19.170> roundabout<00:02:19.950> ways

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
barriers there's no like roundabout ways

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.030 
barriers there's no like roundabout ways
to<00:02:20.430> get<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:20.670> air<00:02:20.879> there's<00:02:21.120> no<00:02:21.150> zigzags<00:02:22.040> that

to get to air there's no zigzags that

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.970 
to get to air there's no zigzags that
kind<00:02:23.549> of<00:02:23.609> keep<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.969> in<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.180> enemy's<00:02:24.480> apart

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
kind of keep you in the enemy's apart

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.660 
kind of keep you in the enemy's apart
there's<00:02:25.980> no<00:02:26.159> real<00:02:26.609> huge<00:02:27.000> choke<00:02:27.359> holes<00:02:28.670> that's

there's no real huge choke holes that's

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.250 
where slums and a lot like Maps like ray
do<00:02:32.400> really<00:02:32.730> well<00:02:32.909> because<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.510> traffic<00:02:33.780> flows

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
do really well because the traffic flows

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.530 
do really well because the traffic flows
in<00:02:34.439> the<00:02:34.530> big<00:02:34.739> open<00:02:35.159> areas<00:02:35.489> that<00:02:36.030> are<00:02:36.150> easy<00:02:36.420> to

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900

of<00:03:25.379> the<00:03:25.440> game<00:03:25.650> itself<00:03:25.979> because<00:03:26.699> you<00:03:26.819> ask

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
of the game itself because you ask

is<00:04:47.400> a<00:04:47.580> damn<00:04:47.850> shame<00:04:47.880> that<00:04:48.150> the<00:04:48.389> map<00:04:48.510> slow<00:04:48.840> so

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
map pack did so well because the map

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.650 
map pack did so well because the map
pack<00:04:52.650> itself<00:04:53.040> from<00:04:53.580> really<00:04:53.940> good<00:04:54.120> maps<00:04:54.360> that

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660
