00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.610
 explain to you that we will do without 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.730
 season and after we will discuss the camp 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.730
 preparation 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.070
 you know guillaume is the 6th 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.419
 He will take care of them 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.189
 nobody after I will let 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.000
 to guillaume regret a little how that 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.980
 is going to happen 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.980
 it's a first roll that 's been sent 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.329
 it can change quickly 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.930
 so here I saw a little travel 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.420
 we have to do 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.739
 nothing except in october during the cut 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.539
 of the world then we have 4 November and a 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.149
 drawing did half of the championship 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.609
 there is calculation of 10 on one-way matches 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.679
 back then there are two championships 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.320
 existing championship goes back into pro 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.219
 d2 and there our championship to win 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.109
 the title of federal 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.399
 the importance that compared to the 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:58.780
 difference per year by the last ones who 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.749
 know that last year for the girl 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.190
 first of all that serves at 46 in no way a 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:04.750
 benefit if not to receive the 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.490
 matches the maches back home his 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.439
 final state of installing finishing 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.640
 national that the big advantage is 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.640
 that we are directly in the semifinals 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.160
 quickly before attacking this law a 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.600
 little bit the way we work 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.640
 and we will see progressively but 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.390
 necessarily the first ones first 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.390
 elements are put in place 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:12.180
 Tourre is the day in this sense when 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.940
 these ads and we were going defender 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.860
 four defenders who stands for 3 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.480
 especially to play the red defend 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.670
 on the reds against the three fronts 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.000
 and an extra player for the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.010
 large 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.010
 it comes with the 17 percent followed 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.120
