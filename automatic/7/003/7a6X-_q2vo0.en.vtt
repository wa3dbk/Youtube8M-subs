00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
hello this do and I am in the process

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.970 
hello this do and I am in the process
coming<00:00:04.380> assembling<00:00:05.190> a<00:00:05.509> shelf<00:00:06.509> here<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.440> I've

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
coming assembling a shelf here and I've

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.970 
coming assembling a shelf here and I've
noticed<00:00:08.639> well<00:00:09.120> this<00:00:09.269> is<00:00:09.420> just<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:09.840> kit<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:10.950> you

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
noticed well this is just a kit that you

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.009 
noticed well this is just a kit that you
buy<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.730> you<00:00:12.269> have<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.509> assemble<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:12.990> yourself

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
buy and you have to assemble it yourself

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.250 
buy and you have to assemble it yourself
and<00:00:13.710> I've<00:00:14.130> noticed<00:00:14.400> that<00:00:14.790> with<00:00:15.630> more<00:00:15.870> more<00:00:16.139> of

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
and I've noticed that with more more of

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.439 
and I've noticed that with more more of
these<00:00:16.379> like<00:00:16.830> either<00:00:17.010> shelves<00:00:17.970> bookcases

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
these like either shelves bookcases

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.689 
these like either shelves bookcases
dressers<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.619> have<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.920> basically<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:20.580> get

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
dressers you have to basically you get

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.700 
dressers you have to basically you get
them<00:00:20.850> in<00:00:20.939> kits<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.449> have<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.350> build<00:00:22.590> them

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
them in kits and you have to build them

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.269 
them in kits and you have to build them
yourself<00:00:23.250> so<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:24.269> I've<00:00:24.480> been<00:00:24.840> noticing<00:00:25.279> as

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
yourself so and I've been noticing as

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.310 
yourself so and I've been noticing as
time<00:00:26.580> goes<00:00:26.849> on

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
time goes on

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.900 
time goes on
funny-looking<00:00:28.320> fasteners<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.490> come<00:00:29.730> with

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
funny-looking fasteners that come with

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.990 
funny-looking fasteners that come with
these<00:00:30.090> kits<00:00:30.449> now<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.710> actually<00:00:32.520> what's

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
these kits now this is actually what's

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.040 
these kits now this is actually what's
called<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.450> cam<00:00:33.950> lock<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.280> nut<00:00:35.579> or<00:00:35.899> this<00:00:36.899> would

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
called a cam lock and nut or this would

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.920 
called a cam lock and nut or this would
be<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> cam<00:00:37.469> lock<00:00:37.969> and/or<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.180> cam<00:00:39.450> screw

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
be the cam lock and/or this cam screw

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.209 
be the cam lock and/or this cam screw
and<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.890> would<00:00:41.100> be<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.940> cam<00:00:42.510> nut<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:44.040> will

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and this would be the cam nut and I will

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.420 
and this would be the cam nut and I will
show<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.550> how<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.230> how<00:00:46.230> these<00:00:46.410> work<00:00:46.710> when

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
show you how to how these work when

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.020 
show you how to how these work when
you're<00:00:47.610> assembling<00:00:48.090> these<00:00:48.450> these<00:00:49.020> kits<00:00:50.030> so

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
you're assembling these these kits so

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.360 
you're assembling these these kits so
basically<00:00:51.360> what<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.719> have<00:00:51.870> here<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.440> I've

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
basically what you have here is I've

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.619 
basically what you have here is I've
already<00:00:53.699> put<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.090> couple<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.390> dolls

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
already put in a couple of dolls

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.170 
already put in a couple of dolls
following<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.530> instructions<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.879> you

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
following the instructions and you you

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.020 
following the instructions and you you
get<00:00:57.390> these<00:00:57.750> pre-drilled<00:00:58.530> holes<00:00:58.890> which<00:00:59.430> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
get these pre-drilled holes which the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.410 
get these pre-drilled holes which the
the<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.230> cam<00:01:01.440> screw<00:01:01.800> goes<00:01:02.039> into<00:01:02.399> now<00:01:03.000> these

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
the the cam screw goes into now these

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.390 
the the cam screw goes into now these
are<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.840> most<00:01:04.019> critical<00:01:04.439> aspects<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.100> this

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
are the most critical aspects of this

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.070 
are the most critical aspects of this
locking<00:01:06.060> fast<00:01:06.330> fastener<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.549> this<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:09.360> this

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
locking fast fastener is this this this

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.440 
locking fast fastener is this this this
threaded<00:01:11.010> component<00:01:11.520> here<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
threaded component here this is the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.570 
threaded component here this is the
weakest<00:01:12.810> component<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.500> whole<00:01:13.650> system<00:01:13.860> if

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
weakest component of the whole system if

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.760 
weakest component of the whole system if
you<00:01:14.820> strip<00:01:15.119> out<00:01:15.270> these<00:01:15.509> holes<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:16.170> won't<00:01:16.530> hold

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
you strip out these holes it won't hold

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.370 
you strip out these holes it won't hold
properly<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.850> when<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.180> screw<00:01:18.479> these<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.840> you

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
properly so when you screw these in you

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.070 
properly so when you screw these in you
want<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.710> be<00:01:19.799> very<00:01:20.189> careful<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:21.030> just<00:01:21.299> kind

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
want to be very careful so you just kind

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.200 
want to be very careful so you just kind
of<00:01:22.140> take<00:01:22.740> your<00:01:22.920> Phillips<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.759> just<00:01:24.000> kind

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
of take your Phillips and you just kind

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.749 
of take your Phillips and you just kind
of<00:01:24.299> screw<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.200> just<00:01:25.890> stop<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.490> wear<00:01:26.729> it

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
of screw it in and just stop it wear it

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.910 
of screw it in and just stop it wear it
here<00:01:27.360> let<00:01:27.509> me<00:01:27.540> just<00:01:27.630> hold<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.140> real<00:01:28.380> tight

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
here let me just hold this real tight

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.410 
here let me just hold this real tight
you<00:01:29.490> just<00:01:29.700> stop<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.240> just<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.439> it's<00:01:31.650> tight<00:01:32.009> at

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
you just stop it just so it's tight at

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.390 
you just stop it just so it's tight at
where<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:33.540> where<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:33.990> ends<00:01:34.380> if<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.650> over

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
where it's where it ends if you over

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.090 
where it's where it ends if you over
torque<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.450> could<00:01:36.659> strip<00:01:36.960> out<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.500> your

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
torque it it could strip out and your

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.460 
torque it it could strip out and your
whole<00:01:38.280> system<00:01:38.549> won't<00:01:38.909> lock<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.420> place<00:01:39.630> well

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
whole system won't lock in place well

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.160 
whole system won't lock in place well
and<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.670> want<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.939> put<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.750> this

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
and so I just want to put this is this

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.530 
and so I just want to put this is this
is<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.560> plate<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.579> attaches<00:01:44.850> with<00:01:45.090> and

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
is the plate that it attaches with and

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.109 
is the plate that it attaches with and
it<00:01:45.600> has<00:01:45.750> three<00:01:46.079> pre-drilled<00:01:46.439> holes<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.090> I

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
it has three pre-drilled holes and so I

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.569 
it has three pre-drilled holes and so I
just<00:01:48.479> make<00:01:48.689> sure<00:01:48.930> I'm<00:01:49.770> going<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:49.979> hammer<00:01:50.280> this

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
just make sure I'm going to hammer this

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.300 
just make sure I'm going to hammer this
in<00:01:51.320> and<00:01:52.320> I'll<00:01:52.409> be<00:01:52.530> right<00:01:52.680> back<00:01:53.990> so<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.619> kind

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
in and I'll be right back so I just kind

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
of kind of hammered that and pushed in

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.609 
of kind of hammered that and pushed in
real<00:01:59.360> carefully<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.659> on<00:02:00.780> this<00:02:00.960> side<00:02:01.259> you

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
real carefully and on this side you

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.760 
real carefully and on this side you
actually<00:02:02.460> see<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.360> end<00:02:03.570> if<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.500> see<00:02:04.649> the

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
actually see the end if you see the

metal end of the cam cam lock cam
screws<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:11.039> this<00:02:11.940> component<00:02:12.840> this<00:02:13.200> this

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
screws and this component this this

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.740 
screws and this component this this
pre-drilled<00:02:14.280> hole<00:02:14.459> is<00:02:14.730> basically<00:02:15.150> able<00:02:15.599> to

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
pre-drilled hole is basically able to

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.100 
pre-drilled hole is basically able to
fit<00:02:16.019> this<00:02:16.680> little<00:02:17.040> nut<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.580> if<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.269> can<00:02:18.900> see

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
fit this little nut and if you can see

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.020 
fit this little nut and if you can see
the<00:02:19.230> shape<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.680> nut<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.580> goes<00:02:20.790> in<00:02:20.940> a

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
the shape of the nut it goes in a

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.790 
the shape of the nut it goes in a
certain<00:02:21.360> way<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.900> has<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:22.200> little<00:02:22.530> arrow

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
certain way and it has a little arrow

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.229 
certain way and it has a little arrow
here<00:02:23.250> which<00:02:24.120> points<00:02:24.720> in<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.959> direction<00:02:25.319> of

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
here which points in the direction of

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.089 
here which points in the direction of
the<00:02:27.239> screw<00:02:27.599> itself<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.769> want<00:02:28.980> to

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
the screw itself and you want to

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.089 
the screw itself and you want to
initially<00:02:29.459> just<00:02:29.640> put<00:02:29.910> them<00:02:30.000> in<00:02:30.180> just<00:02:30.989> so<00:02:31.260> the

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
initially just put them in just so the

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:39.350 
initially just put them in just so the
arrow<00:02:33.200> fits<00:02:34.200> in<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.620> direction<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:39.000> we<00:02:39.150> just

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
arrow fits in that direction so we just

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.729 
arrow fits in that direction so we just
stick<00:02:39.989> that<00:02:40.019> in<00:02:40.519> and<00:02:41.519> you<00:02:41.760> take<00:02:42.500> then<00:02:43.500> take

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
stick that in and you take then take

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.930 
stick that in and you take then take
your<00:02:45.170> screw<00:02:46.170> let<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:47.069> head<00:02:47.250> screwdriver<00:02:47.760> in

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
your screw let that head screwdriver in

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.009 
your screw let that head screwdriver in
this<00:02:48.090> case<00:02:49.160> stick<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:50.840> then<00:02:51.840> you're

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
this case stick it in and then you're

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.490 
this case stick it in and then you're
just<00:02:52.230> twisting<00:02:52.769> clockwise<00:02:53.720> until<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:55.200> locks

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
just twisting clockwise until it locks

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.370 
just twisting clockwise until it locks
and<00:02:55.860> thus<00:02:56.010> why<00:02:56.280> it's<00:02:56.430> called<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.790> lock<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.480> you

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
and thus why it's called a lock and you

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.979 
and thus why it's called a lock and you
just<00:02:58.590> twisted<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.220> locks<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.870> basically

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
just twisted it locks and it basically

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.850 
just twisted it locks and it basically
holds<00:03:01.860> that<00:03:02.099> screw<00:03:03.060> component<00:03:03.630> in<00:03:03.750> place<00:03:03.860> and

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
holds that screw component in place and

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.550 
holds that screw component in place and
so<00:03:05.459> it's<00:03:05.640> nice<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:05.970> fastened<00:03:06.720> correctly<00:03:06.780> and

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
so it's nice and fastened correctly and

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.979 
so it's nice and fastened correctly and
so<00:03:08.040> that's<00:03:08.250> how<00:03:08.430> these<00:03:08.640> cam<00:03:09.090> lock<00:03:09.420> ins<00:03:09.690> and

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
so that's how these cam lock ins and

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.490 
so that's how these cam lock ins and
nuts<00:03:10.500> work<00:03:10.920> two<00:03:11.910> components<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.690> screw<00:03:13.200> and

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
nuts work two components the screw and

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.000 
nuts work two components the screw and
then<00:03:14.069> a<00:03:14.099> walking<00:03:14.670> nut<00:03:15.680> to<00:03:16.680> make<00:03:16.859> sure

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
then a walking nut to make sure

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.309 
then a walking nut to make sure
everything<00:03:17.370> doesn't<00:03:17.700> fall<00:03:17.880> apart<00:03:18.120> so<00:03:18.389> I<00:03:19.049> hope

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
everything doesn't fall apart so I hope

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.710 
everything doesn't fall apart so I hope
this<00:03:19.530> helps<00:03:19.889> you<00:03:20.010> in<00:03:20.190> your<00:03:20.569> building<00:03:21.569> your

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
this helps you in your building your

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.629 
this helps you in your building your
cabinets<00:03:22.350> or<00:03:22.530> whatever<00:03:22.829> you're<00:03:23.010> building<00:03:23.250> and

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639
