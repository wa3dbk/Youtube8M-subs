00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:09.690
 olaf this is the last automotive clay to 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.290
 last harder hardness of all dogs 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.719
 automotive cea 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:29.609
 As you can see, he's a guy. 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:41.700
 hard as a hard is not you can till 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:45.440
 be small amounts in the hand with 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.440
 automotive dogs is drier too 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.250
 show the street 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.080
 which is the same ball in a block of the same 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:16.320
 way any value in itself that 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:19.820
 He is warm and very variable. 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.820
 despite being a fart 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:34.470
 and it is here with others the temperature 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:37.590
 ideal for you to apply and make the start 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.909
 of the debate is a character one 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:47.549
 skeleton or a block of polyurethane 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:50.700
 styrofoam with wood or metal to make a 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.090
 prototype of a car is scale 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.090
 natural size 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.569
 the workspace 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.690
 [Applause] 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.690
 ready 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:46.780
 if you noticed the difference between 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:49.040
 brown clay and other in gray the chips 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.540
 votes are going down as you go 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:57.069
 taking out automotive nuclei stuff that 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.069
 were more glued to the tool 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.600
 or rather we believe ashes become more 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:18.370
 glued on the automotive nuclear tool 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.370
 it loose easier right 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:31.340
 but even so African slaves and 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:41.930
 can do is join this with 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:44.500
 fairly easily and stick in the 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.500
 easy 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:54.440
 You can use it cheekily. 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.160
 The details that I've done are still here. 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:10.430
 this is so much smoother work 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.110
 neighbor everything else on that day 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.350
 it's all here 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.950
 I think if I continue to deliver it 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.950
 will assume 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:37.430
 more is still going out the user runs 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.430
 drug that has not only cut 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:56.630
 already gave a giggle you can do the 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.630
 you need 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:19.450
 nor speak cruel things hard anymore 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:23.170
 details of what they but this you 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.170
 work harder 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.870
 and do not spoil tonnage with 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.530
 facility 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:38.889
 as soon as we deserve your more moles 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:42.340
 each has its own utility and each person 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:45.279
 has a specific taste 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.050
 there are people who like silva climate 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:50.110
 soft mass 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.439
 There are people who like to score hard and 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.439
 that's right
