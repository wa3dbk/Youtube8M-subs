00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Piano Play 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 Where nearly three million pieces, 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.150
 Before taking off 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.090
 Boeing engineers are well aware 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.990
 That these pieces will work efficiently during the trip without damaging the environment 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.860
 Starting from raw materials and production methods 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.760
 Even fuel efficiency and an end by referring those aircraft to retirement, 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.050
 Boeing is designing aircraft to improve 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.590
 All aspects of use, as well as environmental performance. 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.840
 Aircraft are characterized by very long service periods. 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.510
 [Jenny Yu, Environmental Performance Manager] My job is to look for ways to continue 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.560
 Improve the environmental performance of those products 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.700
 Throughout its entire life cycle. 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.020
 When the aircraft were initially built, 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.190
 There was not much interest in the material 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.250
 Or components or even the aircraft as a whole 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.940
 Once its working hours are over, 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.410
 After almost 30 years or more of manufacturing. 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.070
 But all this has changed completely. 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.740
 Boeing is currently adopting aircraft with recycling mode in mind. 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.010
 For example, the composite wing and fuselage structures. 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.040
 The 787 was manufactured from a composite structure, 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.740
 Which makes it lighter 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.750
 More fuel efficient 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.530
 Compared to other aircraft. 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.910
 With all these composite structures, we have worked 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.350
 Hard in the industry to understand how to maintain carbon fiber, 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.790
 Because once you can recycle carbon fiber, 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.290
 You can use it in many other applications 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.070
 At much lower cost and much less energy 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.040
 Of those consumed when using raw material. 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.600
 However, the design aimed at preserving the environment goes beyond 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.160
 High-tech materials such as carbon fiber. 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.800
 They also include the best ways to recycle most traditional materials, 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.190
 Such as aircraft floors 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.350
 We were surprised when we learned 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.580
 The number of times the floors are changed in any aircraft. 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.310
 For 20 to 30 years is the life span of the aircraft, 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.040
 Tons of aircraft floors go to the garbage. 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.620
 This makes Boeing help airlines replace limited parts of worn carpets 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.760
 Other recyclable parts. 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.150
 If there is a splash or scatter of a material, 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.280
 You can remove one piece of carpet and replace it with a new one, 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.620
 And be perfectly suitable without any difference. 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.460
 We love it. 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.060
 Our clients, 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.280
 They are better for the environment, 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.950
 So, they are a win-win. 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.180
 What makes the design for the preservation of the environment really important 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.140
 Is the extent to which this design is represented. 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.810
 Boeing produces more than 48 large commercial aircraft per month, 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.350
 So, any improvement in aircraft design 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.560
 Reflected on thousands of aircraft 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.180
 In a few years. 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.650
 There is nothing simpler than that about a plane. 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.050
 The real challenge is 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.930
 Make aircraft more viable or more sustainable, 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.670
 We need every person who has anything to do with the plane 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.930
 To start thinking about a more sustainable way. 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:31.700
