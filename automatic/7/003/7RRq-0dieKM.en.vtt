00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.560
 [Music] 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:18.990
 I used to have that printer here 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:28.669
 she is a cat po model deskjet e r 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:32.300
 380 to winco only this one this ounce here 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.300
 swallow the paper 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.570
 I pulled it forward instead of 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.579
 pull back there 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.579
 So you can call here. 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.000
 so what happened 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.740
 she stopped pulling the paper she 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.220
 I worked the car would go everywhere in 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:01.270
 attack but she did not pull the paper 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:08.820
 so after analyzing this little thing 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:08.820
 here to apply with a little bit of light 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.170
 this little piece there that stays with the 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.170
 car 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:38.250
 this piece in here she took that one 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.560
 plastic head that she has today 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:48.480
 has a debut on the tip 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:50.550
 so I grated that she has a not 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.610
 you can see that the camera does not 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:58.460
 so much so that she cracked the 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:02.190
 law in this plastic party alone 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:06.750
 so every time the engine ran 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.340
 that spin would transmit the tone to this 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.840
 gear but the gear is not 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:19.470
 transmitted the doc to the axis because it was 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:24.720
 then the good old cola glue 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:27.680
 Super Glue famous go placed pulled out 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.680
 good to have to punish 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:35.450
 I spent a bit of glue there pro dried in 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.450
 minutes 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:44.000
 printer is ready for use again. 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.000
 use a paper here 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.820
 I'm going to call her, nobody here. 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:03.880
 we relate to cancel and 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.880
 colorful and she goes 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.640
 make me feel ashamed 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.950
 will make me ashamed 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.030
 When the boring car is a long time 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.569
 stopped 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.569
 there is meanwhile 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:00.269
 so that it may be tejuco but like me 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.959
 I lived there khan a sun come 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.959
 O 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.750
 long time stopped cartridges 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.699
 good but most important was that he came back 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:40.020
 printing a cartridge only takes a bath 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:41.849
 sun on the cartridge head that Papa 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.080
 this ink and this time you this 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.080
