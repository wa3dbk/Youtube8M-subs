00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.560
 how rich the mass of today in a base 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.880
 crispy with very dark cinnamon they are going to 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.039
 know why it comes out I'm going to say the 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.080
 little secret inside he's going to have apples 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:32.230
 caramelized with many nuts and a 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:36.200
 caramel great if you go for an apple 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.090
 I also stay together 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.490
 today we are going to make the mass of this letter 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.500
 and I'm going to do with me a lot easier and 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.950
 fast with the processors in the mold 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.280
 the processor we are going to put flour 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:53.270
 black sugar two tablespoons alright 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.570
 abundant a pinch of cinnamon and 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.040
 let's add butter after good 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.960
 dry ingredients and butter 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.950
 let's press the processor to 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.950
 form a sandblasting 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.590
 and now we are going to create an egg so that 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.590
 the dough is finished 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.220
 we continue processing 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.930
 so the dough will be good to Band-Aid 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.700
 it's about the secret the black sugar the 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.490
 they will let rest and it is good to agree 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.930
 a mold of 24 centimeters look at me 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.020
 I had here finishing forming this 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.570
 mold with this roll much easier 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.310
 they reach the edges very fast and here 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.380
 arrived at the refrigerator 20 minutes so that 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.360
 rest and in the meantime we prepare the 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.759
 press this cake to make the 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.890
 filling of the cake we are going to use 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.770
 apples the secret to this cake is that 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.660
 do not lose our apples much more 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.869
 easy and we take out the center of the 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.149
 apples with this popular utensil that 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.780
 I have that it is very easy 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.530
 look how it looks 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.760
 and then we cut them in quarters and there 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.760
 in sheets ready 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.020
 let's have our apples 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.270
 says the heart of our cake and 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.700
 let's flavor it with cinnamon and with 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.849
 black sugar as I told you we are going to 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.160
 put on bad spray and then 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:21.630
 we place our apples 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.230
 we add black sugar and a touch of 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.540
 cinnamon 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.819
 and now we are cooking until they are 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.920
 well bland after cooking 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.049
 apples we are cooling them in a bowl 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.330
 in the refrigerator and then we put them 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.400
 in our cake and now we're going to do 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.680
 the crispy part of this cake the 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.840
 carmen to make this candy we are going to 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.239
 use three ingredients the same amount 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.140
 of each one is very fun and we're going 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.959
 to do with your hands 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.069
 the first is flour if they use leavening 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:53.980
 sugar is much more crispy too 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:57.310
 sugar plus one more butter the last 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.769
 to perfume cinnamon and now hands on 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.310
 mass' hand well cleaned but with nails 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:07.629
 well, nice little pintadita we are forming 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.519
 the marinade with the fingers is important 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:12.489
 that does not form a mazacote that 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:15.549
 that's how much sandstone we're going to put together 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.609
 cake we have the base of the cake that 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:21.519
 come from the refrigerator remember, let's go 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:24.579
 put some of these cold apples 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.049
 remember because if not the filling them 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.240
 the bottom part will be very soft 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:31.110
 in the afternoon 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:33.480
 and we're going to add nuts broken tables 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:38.100
 with your hand or worry about pica 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:41.970
 waters but rather very easy 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:44.520
 we add apples to our stuffing 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:48.560
 this cake to the last touch with our 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:51.620
 nuts we use with our hands 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.240
 we add the candy to finish 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:58.450
 this spectacular cake 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.120
 we have our cake with the dough with the 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.250
 stuffed with nuts with cinnamon with 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.920
 the cram of all ready we are going to 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.170
 Preheat the oven 5 minutes to 180 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.830
 degrees and we're going to put the cake in the 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:15.370
 middle part of the oven and let's put 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:19.390
 the 40 minutes or a minute or so 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.380
 because it burns when we know that the 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.120
 letter is ready 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.310
 when the caramel is well golden 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.400

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.690
