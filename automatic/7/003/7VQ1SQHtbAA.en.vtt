 quite easy for the people here 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.100
 Let's just say we can read a bit 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.979
 you are with your bus arbitrarily in 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.509
 gelsenkirchen gladbeck presses on the way 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.190
 In any case, once the old-key that 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.950
 her downstairs 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.120
 is her praise window on and 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.330
 transported where there was once a 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.010
 gelsenkirchen depot 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.490
 hey presto because we simply go 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.200
 curious; excited 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.930
 and now we should not have any 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.700
 mistake the same good running so we build 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.909
 So here in this little kabuff say 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.450
 let's take a taboo 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.450
 and 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.130
 so now you think where should I go 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.460
 now here but maybe 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.930
 already driven out of here if years that 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.930
 is for bus and train 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.890
 we demand grad 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.020
 I'll show that quickly 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.590
 whether ballack accident that's what I wanted now 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.979
 not just any tree 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:06.229
 you drove in here so by 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.909

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.369

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.580
 around 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.250
 it was 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.690
 I'll show you this for the people now 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:36.160
 maybe they have lost their way 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.660
 turn the steering wheel completely left again 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.050
 we have to go back to that 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:46.590
 depot out or not go up from 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.590
 sorry so 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:55.879
 and then 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.879
 quite simply she lives here again 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.290
 and now we are there to see you safe 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.019
 put what did right here 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.970
 may we drill the wall so where 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.439
 the stop sign is with me 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.849
 It does not work on the front 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:14.140
 how we do it 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:16.420
 Now we are going to take the bus here 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.420
 the track sport we stand here 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.769
 press and sports out so now 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:27.939
 we are here with our men 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:32.049
 go on train tram and yes we 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:35.170
 may the money of gladbeck company so 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:39.299
 missing and sport depot 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.900
 We have gelsenkirchen quite simply 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.849
 our ground 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.810
 we can now also increase yes ok 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.230
 strangely enough, in others 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.239
 direction 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.239
 but I think here is somewhere 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.230
 i'm not sure i have myself 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.230
 have removed 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.530
 here is a third now you see too 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.239
 how to turn here now you think 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.200
 Mr. the boy drives now also before 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.360
 wrong line 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.739
 and that is quite easy I show 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.010
 Of course you also still when you are up 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.970
 the wrong train on the way you are 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.820
 Gives a little more gas 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:27.490
 how fast your bike you see with the 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:29.140
 Now I've turned it off so look 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.640
 her by then stop up here 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.420
 Show red and now you go 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.890
 the f4 attention normal f4 people press 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.530
 and then you go to your soft ones 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.660
 you want to put so soft ours 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.030
 only there at the very back is the ass of 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.140
 world we have to set the places we put 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.910
 do not sell the vehicle 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.290
 we really have to go there and here 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.510
 click on the wing 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.310
 that the soft is put siblings 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.410
 we put the soft ones to us 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.710
 can the gelsenkirchen 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.710
 leave 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.480
 I'll show you again 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.750
 and you 're on the right track 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.640
 roadway again that is actually quite 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.010
 simple and easy as I said 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.830
 a little respawn you have to go back 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.410
 to this climax you have to get off your bus 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.580
 make the ground-sport should on the 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.650
 wrong side is bonn 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.540
 just drive through the wall 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.100
 it turns and how I did it 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:27.540
 you turn back to the soft one here 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.290
 and otherwise you can be quite normal 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.790
 depart 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.020
 I wish you much fun, I hope so 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.970
 helped you a bit if it was 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.430
 you liked or helped you 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.270
 or he has questions write it 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.200
 in the comments 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:42.780
 where where then only one 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.880
 Let's say little constructive 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.560
 criticism so until then, it was the 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.010
 gaming plays with me and relax 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.010
 play
