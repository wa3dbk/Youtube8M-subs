00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.730
 the first generation of handsets 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.769
 Blackberry was represented by 10 and 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.210
 that they practically carried the 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.920
 same settings 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.289
 but while the 10's do not have a keyboard 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.880
 that is designed to 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.470
 to the audience that has become accustomed to 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.930
 the good old west 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.630
 in the second generation we have the c30 a super 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.590
 e10 so to speak and the q5 version 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.590
 than 10 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.450
 even though it is the most basic device 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.969
 released so far q5 does not disappoint the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.329
 screen has the same 3.1 inches than 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.760
 10 but comes with lcd ips technology when 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.590
 instead of love led in practice changes a lot 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.100
 little since both are screens of 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.100
 high quality 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.949
 The difference is also small in 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.530
 Q5 settings has the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.070
 snapdragon s4 dual core processor 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.969
 1.2 ghz only 300 megawatts less than 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.189
 that 10 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.229
 but it has the same 2 gb of memory 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.360
 ram so we can not repair 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.040
 any performance difference 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.810
 we noticed some breaks only 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.340
 with six or more applications open to the 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.229
 same time but this is a situation 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.270
 quite likely to find in the 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.159
 day-to-day we believe that it has 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.049
 been a mistake since the quest keyboards 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.880
 are becoming less popular 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.490
 the few users who still prefer 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.990
 are well users of blackberrys and this 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.049
 may disrupt future sales of the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.049
 company 

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:40.109
 in any way the 4g and gps support 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.630
 with gps nfc bluetooth 4.0 and so on 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:44.700
 remain on the camera. 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.770
 rear now has 5 megapixels 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.209
 against 8 megapixels than 10 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.340
 but the quality is basically the same 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:51.270
 something similar to what happens with 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.490
 front camera 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.259
 then the conclusion is as follows if you 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.969
 likes the platform and does not see the 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.189
 clearly simpler construction of the 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.539
 that five as a negative point is worth 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.539
 Worth considering as an option 

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:08.700
 it still does not have an official price 

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:10.049
 here in brazil but it sure will be more 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.480
 cheap than 10 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:15.299
 which in itself is already good news to 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.950
 black berry hit the price the q5 can 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.599
 help in popularizing the platform 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.190
 In the next months 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.480
