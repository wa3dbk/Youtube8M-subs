00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:28.649
 what prevented the developers responded almonds 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.079
 the scorer was removed by ideological 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:33.290
 reasons as a matter of fact and criteria 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.210
 Achievements performed on art sa 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.360

 tank roam 2 developers answered no 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.410
 plan to do transparency like 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.790
 for the bushes the developers responded 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.220
 regarding transparency soon 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.260
 time do not plan to do however in 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.060
 the future will be big enough 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.640
 the number of changes associated with 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.450
 why does graphics cost so much 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.020
 pumping 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.479
 because t110 e4 is like a tank level 10 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.840
 developers answered look at both 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.689
 branches e3 and e4 note on 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.380
 cost of research and transition from t28 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.810
 prototype in t28 both branches by themselves 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.170
 quite flexible in terms of their study 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.060
 based on this and was formed 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.520
 final research cost when 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.159
 all the perks of all classes will be downloaded 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.649
 the crewâ€™s experience will accumulate as 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.600
 before introducing these very perks into the game and 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.999
 when adding new ones will allow 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.459
 accumulated distribute on them or they 

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:42.359
 will burn the developers he answered 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:45.299
 will burn 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:47.399
 if all the perks are deflated and yet we 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.920
 pondering the accumulation option but 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.529
 no final decision has yet been taken 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.899
 sight clings to other tanks when 

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:57.329
 you aim it you eat someone they pass 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.299
 sometimes even past the other end of the map 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.639
 once in this tank was removed now he 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.099
 again there when you remove it 

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:07.170
 the developers responded we don't consider it 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:09.660
 gods so how this logic works 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.060
 aiming and focusing the sight 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.610
 tank seems or new sight 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.480
 brings closer and when leaving it 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.519
 effect to 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.129
 would be alienated with a return to mind from 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.950
 third person appeared what he 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.290
 not comfortable at all was better before 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.250
 the developers answered the sight did not change 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.190
 at all 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.909
 increase the battle time by at least one 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.069
 a minute 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.690
 developers responded soon 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.750
 change the maximum amount of time 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.180
 for one fight we do not plan nevertheless 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.940
 we closely monitor the statistics not 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.599
 it is possible that in the future we can 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.150
 to change 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.500
 is it worth waiting for the introduction of the so-called 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.319
 dynamic camera 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.870
 developers answered no enter this is not 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.959
 we are planning cards 4 times less 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.760
 fighting dynamics is higher therefore free 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.579
 camera can give significant 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.980
 advantage whether there are plans to raise 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:04.140
 t110 e5 by cross in sands 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.060
 developers responded with mobility at 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.190
 tank's more than okay 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.299
 change the coefficients of patency is not 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.019
 plan not in 18 not in 19 new cards we 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.390
 didn't see 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.769
 hence the demand to wait for at least one new 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.379
 110 card 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.139
 the developers answered wait for sure 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.180
 It is worth but on 110 specifics give while 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.819
 we will not follow and please 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.040
