00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.580
 Hello, I am writing down a review 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.380
 laboratory power supply 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.230
 independently which I did 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:18.960
 made in the case of the power supply 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.310
 the computer being there were many cases then 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.269
 there are these power supplies 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.769
 Only one of the buttons I used 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:28.189
 to the transformer which is inside 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.099
 It is under load but was not 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:36.059
 disconnect from this terminal to here 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:43.170
 and remote meter we here the regulator test 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:49.670
 state trimmer resistor 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:52.710
 but outputs the 1 and 2 to 12 volts stream 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.550
 vampire is not regulated because there 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.550
 maximum boldly transformer one amp 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:05.809
 I decided well , so I made two wiring 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.809
 bought crocodile blades too 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.770
 I will demonstrate first how it works 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:20.720
 then inside I'll show you a little bit according to the scheme and 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.720
 the scheme also show stabilization on lm317 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:57.490
 so fascist you put a back button 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:02:01.060
 I click and you need a cooler also works here 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:07.679
 there is so here is the very beginning that is 12 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:10.840
 supplies adjustable voltage with 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:13.440
 I checked it with a multimeter, that's all 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.440
 exactly 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:25.000
 up to a tenth voltage serve 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:29.920
 for example, you can now, laser him 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.430
 it takes 5 volts bundles of wire coolio 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.430
 hurt 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.810
 azure 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.510
 her eyes are shining 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:14.700
 so here is the food well you come we 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.700
 then the contact goes to the button 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.840
 lighting fuck 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.609
 Well, that is, there is a two-position 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.889
 button all that is, we closed 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:29.470
 yes so that from the walls that code but mine 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:33.250
 220 volt step-down transformer 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:41.370
 output for us here is one amp that's this 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:41.370
 contact comes to the control bridge 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:53.800
 here it is indicated on the group 806 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:59.860
 my case, well, and then on the scheme 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:06.180
 goes to lan 317 link stabilization 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:11.039
 leave on the scheme and the first is the initiator 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.039
 2200 microfarad twenty five volts 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:26.520
 farther on 01 goes the camera wo n't take the corner 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:26.520
 that is, here it is under 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:43.120
 yellow is seen at the end and then work 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:47.270
 well here it is he 317 on the diagram before set 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.280
 the radiator did not make thermal grease 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.760
 glued, that is, in principle, whether the disk rub 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:55.180
 . it is once again interesting there it will be 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:06:02.479
 to distinguish 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:05.720
 to resistor but resistor and capacitor 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:06.710
 one more here on the way out like this 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.290
 it looks 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.600
 but here they are now 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:19.910
 it is adjustable we tom current with 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:22.630
 stabilize the arm even feed the terminals well 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:25.160
 voltmeter connected here 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.229
 powered from started after first 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:32.000
 big condenser there is cases on ios 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:36.229
 Already and not half-period gave more or less 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.960
 normal current here here and testimony 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:42.580
 removed here these animals pressed 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:48.729
 wiring 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:48.729
 Well, the cooler, also at first, that is 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:56.270
 here it left the cooler tab Blagin 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:59.240
 I think this is some kind of project and what is it ? 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.479
 adjusts fan speeds well, let's say 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:05.150
 Depending on the stress well, so as not to 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:09.229
 Media rights proved as not being 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.840
 tension on rotational speed there 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:18.050
 trimmer resistor 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:29.169
 Well, here is fixed here on the preview than 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:32.750
 Could as so links leave on schemes 

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:39.590
 who can be interested in can 

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:41.479
 nothing is difficult here that need it than we are 

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:44.389
 a gun so we all have this 

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:50.780
 place solder on soldering iron 

00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:51.800
 such things well, so buy it too 

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.550
 have to shoot 

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:57.500
 and everything else power supply now 

00:07:54.550 --> 00:08:07.330
 titus toll lying no laptop under 

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:07.330
 thanks to all of you
