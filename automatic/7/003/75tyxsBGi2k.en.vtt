I've<00:00:00.510> got<00:00:00.659> another<00:00:00.810> video<00:00:01.020> here<00:00:01.350> on<00:00:01.469> the<00:00:01.589> o3

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
I've got another video here on the o3

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.690 
I've got another video here on the o3
yz250<00:00:02.820> f<00:00:03.080> real<00:00:04.080> simple<00:00:04.440> in<00:00:04.529> here<00:00:04.740> now<00:00:05.069> we're

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
yz250 f real simple in here now we're

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.400 
yz250 f real simple in here now we're
going<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:05.879> be<00:00:06.210> doing<00:00:06.390> taking<00:00:07.020> off<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.200> front

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
going to be doing taking off the front

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.740 
going to be doing taking off the front
wheel<00:00:07.700> sounds<00:00:08.700> little<00:00:08.849> simpler<00:00:09.300> than<00:00:09.360> it<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.719> I

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
wheel sounds little simpler than it is I

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.720 
wheel sounds little simpler than it is I
mean<00:00:09.960> it<00:00:10.050> is<00:00:10.139> really<00:00:10.380> simple<00:00:10.710> but<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.190> couple

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
mean it is really simple but a couple

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.990 
mean it is really simple but a couple
steps<00:00:12.030> you<00:00:12.540> get<00:00:12.980> to<00:00:13.980> nut<00:00:14.190> or<00:00:14.309> two<00:00:14.519> bolts<00:00:14.849> up

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
steps you get to nut or two bolts up

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.240 
steps you get to nut or two bolts up
here<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.389> either<00:00:15.570> side<00:00:15.929> on<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.440> top<00:00:16.500> then<00:00:17.220> you

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
here on either side on the top then you

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.580 
here on either side on the top then you
get<00:00:17.460> your<00:00:17.609> one<00:00:17.940> main<00:00:18.210> nut<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:19.289> we're<00:00:19.410> going<00:00:19.500> to

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
get your one main nut so we're going to

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.710 
get your one main nut so we're going to
loosen<00:00:20.160> up<00:00:20.400> this<00:00:20.550> main<00:00:20.850> nut<00:00:21.090> first<00:00:21.359> because

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
loosen up this main nut first because

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.519 
loosen up this main nut first because
this<00:00:21.869> these<00:00:22.260> clamp<00:00:22.619> down<00:00:22.830> on<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.930> it<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.170> a

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
this these clamp down on that so it is a

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:35.770 
this these clamp down on that so it is a
I<00:00:25.560> believe<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:25.980> 22<00:00:26.420> yeah<00:00:27.420> 22<00:00:27.480> millimeter

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.119 

there's<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.020> nut<00:00:38.480> and<00:00:39.480> then<00:00:39.920> you<00:00:40.920> want<00:00:41.070> to

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
there's the nut and then you want to

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.190 
there's the nut and then you want to
loosen<00:00:41.340> these<00:00:41.489> up<00:00:41.600> which<00:00:42.600> they<00:00:42.840> are<00:00:42.960> ten

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
loosen these up which they are ten

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.100 
loosen these up which they are ten
millimeter<00:00:43.620> there's<00:00:44.610> like<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.879> said<00:00:45.090> two<00:00:46.079> and

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
millimeter there's like I said two and

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.700 
millimeter there's like I said two and
either<00:00:46.379> side<00:00:46.789> lift<00:00:47.789> them<00:00:47.940> both<00:00:48.120> up<00:00:48.360> but<00:00:49.350> loosen

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
either side lift them both up but loosen

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.420 
either side lift them both up but loosen
the<00:00:49.829> take<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> nut<00:00:50.550> off<00:00:50.579> first<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:52.430> way

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
the take the nut off first so that way

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:12.710 
the take the nut off first so that way
doesn't<00:00:53.640> spin<00:00:53.940> around<00:00:56.059> there's<00:00:57.059> one<00:01:00.050> two<00:01:11.720> and

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
doesn't spin around there's one two and

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.910 
doesn't spin around there's one two and
get<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> two<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.770> other<00:01:13.920> side<00:01:14.250> just<00:01:15.920> see

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
get the two on the other side just see

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.929 
get the two on the other side just see
if<00:01:16.979> we<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.220> get<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.729> here<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:22.939> here

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
if we can get this in here for you here

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.359 
if we can get this in here for you here
they<00:01:24.060> are<00:01:24.150> right<00:01:24.360> here

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
they are right here

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.550 
they are right here
open<00:01:26.369> they're<00:01:26.490> actually<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.850> different<00:01:27.119> size

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
open they're actually a different size

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:44.690 
open they're actually a different size
got<00:01:28.560> about<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:30.950> they<00:01:31.950> are<00:01:31.979> twelve<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.150> believe

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.090 

actually<00:01:45.700> one<00:01:45.820> of<00:01:45.850> the<00:01:46.090> twelve<00:01:46.860> not<00:01:47.860> sure<00:01:48.009> if

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
actually one of the twelve not sure if

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.429 
actually one of the twelve not sure if
that's<00:01:48.250> correct<00:01:48.430> or<00:01:48.759> not<00:01:48.820> I<00:01:49.149> have<00:01:49.990> to<00:01:50.079> look<00:01:50.259> at

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
that's correct or not I have to look at

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.830 
that's correct or not I have to look at
it

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.380 

there<00:01:55.840> you<00:01:55.960> go<00:01:58.110> okay<00:01:59.110> the<00:01:59.409> next<00:01:59.590> step<00:02:00.360> which<00:02:01.360> is

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
there you go okay the next step which is

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.190 
there you go okay the next step which is
the<00:02:01.780> final<00:02:02.110> step<00:02:05.069> back<00:02:06.069> over<00:02:06.340> here<00:02:06.490> is<00:02:06.640> to

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
the final step back over here is to

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.270 
the final step back over here is to
lightly<00:02:08.200> tap<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:10.260> launch<00:02:11.260> nut<00:02:11.890> back<00:02:12.099> through

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
lightly tap the launch nut back through

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:25.020 
lightly tap the launch nut back through
the<00:02:12.430> level<00:02:22.470> which<00:02:23.670> can<00:02:24.670> be<00:02:24.849> a<00:02:24.880> little

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
the level which can be a little

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.069 
the level which can be a little
difficult<00:02:25.209> for<00:02:25.510> me<00:02:25.810> I<00:02:27.810> don't<00:02:28.810> have<00:02:28.870> anything

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
difficult for me I don't have anything

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:34.580 
difficult for me I don't have anything
else<00:02:29.290> holding<00:02:29.560> this<00:02:29.650> bike<00:02:29.860> up<00:02:32.459> there<00:02:33.459> it<00:02:33.610> goes

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
else holding this bike up there it goes

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.630 
else holding this bike up there it goes
so<00:02:35.590> I'm<00:02:35.709> not<00:02:35.829> going<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:36.040> take<00:02:36.190> it<00:02:36.310> off<00:02:36.400> right

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
so I'm not going to take it off right

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.979 
so I'm not going to take it off right
now<00:02:36.790> because<00:02:36.970> I<00:02:37.120> need<00:02:37.269> somebody<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.690> hold<00:02:37.870> it

now because I need somebody to hold it

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.160 
now because I need somebody to hold it
up<00:02:38.079> for<00:02:38.110> me<00:02:38.400> but<00:02:39.420> tap<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:40.630> through<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.110> it
