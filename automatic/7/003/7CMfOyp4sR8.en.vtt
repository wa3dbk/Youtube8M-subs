and<00:00:46.260> strategic<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.219> could<00:00:47.840> this<00:00:48.840> one<00:00:49.110> has<00:00:49.350> a

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
and strategic we could this one has a

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.170 
and strategic we could this one has a
high<00:00:49.620> attack<00:00:49.950> but<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.340> dies<00:00:50.550> at<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.850> end<00:00:50.969> of

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
high attack but it dies at the end of

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.479 
high attack but it dies at the end of
turn<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:52.199> strategically<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.070> could<00:00:53.280> place

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
turn so strategically you could place

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.330 
turn so strategically you could place
them<00:00:53.640> where<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.969> want

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.780 

and<00:00:56.460> when<00:00:56.970> your<00:00:57.120> opponent<00:00:57.630> goes<00:00:57.750> down<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.230> em

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
and when your opponent goes down to em

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.520 
and when your opponent goes down to em
mark<00:00:59.790> creature<00:01:00.420> dies

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
mark creature dies

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.380 
mark creature dies
and<00:01:02.649> when<00:01:03.129> you<00:01:03.219> goes<00:01:03.430> down<00:01:03.670> to<00:01:03.820> zero<00:01:04.059> you<00:01:04.210> win

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
and when you goes down to zero you win

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.990 
and when you goes down to zero you win
so<00:01:05.080> this<00:01:05.290> is<00:01:05.440> a<00:01:05.470> fat<00:01:05.799> more<00:01:06.010> fast-paced<00:01:06.520> way<00:01:06.940> to

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
so this is a fat more fast-paced way to

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.490 
so this is a fat more fast-paced way to
play<00:01:07.299> yugioh<00:01:07.510> and<00:01:09.570> as<00:01:10.570> completely<00:01:11.080> different

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
play yugioh and as completely different

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.460 
play yugioh and as completely different
rules<00:01:12.340> so<00:01:12.610> it's<00:01:12.759> a<00:01:12.820> brand-new<00:01:13.150> game<00:01:13.380> using<00:01:14.380> the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
rules so it's a brand-new game using the

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.670 
rules so it's a brand-new game using the
ukyo<00:01:14.830> universe<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.570> it's<00:01:17.080> more<00:01:17.259> complicated

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
ukyo universe and it's more complicated

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.649 
ukyo universe and it's more complicated
as<00:01:18.070> it<00:01:18.190> goes<00:01:18.369> along<00:01:18.490> that's<00:01:18.790> a<00:01:18.970> that's<00:01:19.300> a<00:01:19.450> nice

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
as it goes along that's a that's a nice

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.130 
as it goes along that's a that's a nice
easy<00:01:19.960> beginner<00:01:20.320> level<00:01:21.130> right<00:01:21.460> there<00:01:21.930> right<00:01:22.930> so
