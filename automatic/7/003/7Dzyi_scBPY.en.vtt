00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.009 
and I don't know if he uses the headset
for<00:01:02.100> his<00:01:02.280> commentaries<00:01:02.820> because<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.840> stuff

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
for his commentaries because this stuff

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.740 
for his commentaries because this stuff

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.390 
always sounds pretty nice I know he he
says<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.140> he<00:01:07.229> goes<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:08.100> know<00:01:08.189> kind

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
says that he goes in and you know kind

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.580 
says that he goes in and you know kind
of<00:01:08.490> tweaks<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> volume<00:01:09.750> or<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.020> audio<00:01:10.530> a

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
of tweaks the volume or the audio a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.590 
of tweaks the volume or the audio a
little<00:01:10.920> bit<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.700> make<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.909> sound<00:01:12.240> much<00:01:12.390> better

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
little bit to make it sound much better

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.719 
little bit to make it sound much better
so<00:01:12.930> maybe<00:01:13.650> that's<00:01:13.920> what<00:01:14.070> I'm<00:01:14.159> doing<00:01:14.369> wrong<00:01:14.520> is

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
so maybe that's what I'm doing wrong is

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.820 
so maybe that's what I'm doing wrong is
I'm<00:01:14.880> not<00:01:15.030> going<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:15.900> tweaking<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.740> to

I'm not going in and just tweaking it to

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.219 
I'm not going in and just tweaking it to
where<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.310> sounds<00:01:17.909> correct<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:19.080> just

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
where it sounds correct it's just

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.510 
where it sounds correct it's just
blowing<00:01:19.380> my<00:01:19.590> ears<00:01:19.770> away<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.130> speaking<00:01:20.430> of

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
you gave the setup I have on it now is

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.530 
you gave the setup I have on it now is
rapid<00:03:55.709> firing<00:03:55.920> silencer<00:03:56.459> so<00:03:56.640> it<00:03:56.970> is<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.180> no<00:03:57.240> p

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
rapid firing silencer so it is a no p

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.020 
rapid firing silencer so it is a no p
weapon<00:03:57.870> in<00:03:57.990> a<00:03:58.080> you<00:03:58.440> know<00:03:58.500> it's<00:03:59.220> actually<00:03:59.580> how<00:04:00.000> I

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
weapon in a you know it's actually how I

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.699 
weapon in a you know it's actually how I
believe<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.690> weapon<00:04:00.959> is<00:04:01.050> supposed<00:04:01.350> to<00:04:01.530> use

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
believe the weapon is supposed to use

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.230 
believe the weapon is supposed to use
because<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.520> firing<00:04:02.820> rate<00:04:02.970> is<00:04:03.090> so

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
because the firing rate is so

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.880 
because the firing rate is so
inconsistent<00:04:03.660> on<00:04:04.170> it<00:04:04.290> when<00:04:04.410> you<00:04:04.500> you<00:04:04.740> don't

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
inconsistent on it when you you don't

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.360 
inconsistent on it when you you don't

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
forth from a high rate of fire to a slow

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.750 
forth from a high rate of fire to a slow

last<00:04:34.590> time<00:04:34.770> i've<00:04:34.920> used<00:04:35.070> it<00:04:35.250> other<00:04:35.430> than

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
last time i've used it other than

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.730 
last time i've used it other than
picking<00:04:35.880> it<00:04:36.090> up<00:04:36.210> when<00:04:36.870> i<00:04:36.900> ran<00:04:37.110> out<00:04:37.260> of<00:04:37.290> ammo<00:04:37.590> or

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
picking it up when i ran out of ammo or

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.770 
picking it up when i ran out of ammo or
something<00:04:38.100> like<00:04:38.190> this<00:04:38.340> I<00:04:38.580> throw<00:04:39.030> scavenger<00:04:39.690> on

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
something like this I throw scavenger on

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.720 
something like this I throw scavenger on
this<00:04:39.930> weapon<00:04:40.110> which<00:04:40.530> is<00:04:40.680> not<00:04:41.160> my<00:04:41.370> style

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
this weapon which is not my style

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.060 
this weapon which is not my style
because<00:04:42.210> I'm<00:04:42.360> a<00:04:42.390> run-and-gun<00:04:42.870> type<00:04:43.290> player<00:04:43.560> so

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
because I'm a run-and-gun type player so

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.290 
because I'm a run-and-gun type player so
I<00:04:44.100> have<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.370> play<00:04:44.520> a<00:04:44.550> little<00:04:44.910> bit<00:04:45.150> more

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
I have to play a little bit more

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.820 
I have to play a little bit more
strategic<00:04:45.810> when<00:04:45.960> you<00:04:46.050> have<00:04:46.200> scavenger<00:04:46.650> on<00:04:46.740> it

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
strategic when you have scavenger on it

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.350 
strategic when you have scavenger on it
because<00:04:46.950> I<00:04:47.070> got<00:04:47.190> to<00:04:47.280> give<00:04:47.400> myself<00:04:47.550> time<00:04:48.300> to

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
because I got to give myself time to

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.140 
because I got to give myself time to
reload<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:49.740> reload<00:04:50.070> on<00:04:50.100> this<00:04:50.370> on<00:04:50.790> the<00:04:51.000> gun

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
reload the reload on this on the gun

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.270 
reload the reload on this on the gun
without<00:04:51.300> a<00:04:51.780> slight<00:04:52.050> of<00:04:52.140> hand<00:04:52.170> isn't<00:04:52.500> bad<00:04:52.920> I

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
without a slight of hand isn't bad I

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.970 
without a slight of hand isn't bad I
mean<00:04:53.430> I've<00:04:53.580> seen<00:04:53.790> worse<00:04:54.060> that's<00:04:54.900> for<00:04:55.050> sure<00:04:55.080> but

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
mean I've seen worse that's for sure but

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.530 
mean I've seen worse that's for sure but
it's<00:04:56.370> not<00:04:56.490> bad<00:04:56.670> but<00:04:56.850> you<00:04:57.000> have<00:04:57.210> to<00:04:57.360> put

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
it's not bad but you have to put

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.240 
it's not bad but you have to put
yourself<00:04:57.660> in<00:04:57.990> a<00:04:58.050> position<00:04:58.080> where<00:04:58.440> you<00:04:59.010> can<00:04:59.160> get

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
yourself in a position where you can get

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.650 
yourself in a position where you can get
out<00:04:59.430> of<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.669> second<00:05:00.030> out<00:05:00.210> of<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:00.419> situation

out of the second out of the situation
in<00:05:01.020> this<00:05:01.110> scenario<00:05:01.320> where<00:05:02.040> you<00:05:02.070> can<00:05:02.310> actually

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
in this scenario where you can actually

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.130 
in this scenario where you can actually
get<00:05:02.700> a<00:05:02.760> reload<00:05:03.150> and<00:05:03.330> potentially<00:05:03.780> come<00:05:03.960> back

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
get a reload and potentially come back

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.550

my moves have been on specialist and

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.950 
my moves have been on specialist and
I've<00:06:20.580> actually<00:06:20.790> came<00:06:21.150> closer<00:06:21.419> to<00:06:21.660> an<00:06:21.750> assault

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:25.140 
man moab a couple games back where i was

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.270 
man moab a couple games back where i was
playing<00:06:25.350> a<00:06:25.410> free-for-all<00:06:25.830> and<00:06:25.890> i<00:06:26.010> was<00:06:26.130> running

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
playing a free-for-all and i was running

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.760 
playing a free-for-all and i was running
around<00:06:26.430> with<00:06:26.729> the<00:06:27.020> custom<00:06:28.020> class<00:06:28.200> that<00:06:28.440> set<00:06:28.650> up

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
around with the custom class that set up

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.040 
around with the custom class that set up
for<00:06:28.919> you<00:06:29.010> when<00:06:29.160> you<00:06:29.250> prestige<00:06:29.430> with<00:06:30.150> the<00:06:30.240> g36<00:06:30.930> i

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
for you when you prestige with the g36 i

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.480 
for you when you prestige with the g36 i
think<00:06:31.169> it<00:06:31.229> has<00:06:31.320> a<00:06:31.350> new<00:06:31.560> tube<00:06:31.800> on<00:06:31.979> and<00:06:32.220> all<00:06:32.340> that

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
think it has a new tube on and all that

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.640 
think it has a new tube on and all that
us<00:06:32.610> up<00:06:32.820> but<00:06:33.330> it's<00:06:33.479> it<00:06:33.570> free<00:06:33.810> for<00:06:33.960> all<00:06:34.080> so<00:06:34.349> i

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
us up but it's it free for all so i

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.980 
us up but it's it free for all so i
think<00:06:35.039> the<00:06:35.340> mo<00:06:35.460> apps<00:06:35.669> are<00:06:35.940> fairly<00:06:36.390> easy<00:06:36.660> to<00:06:36.780> get

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
think the mo apps are fairly easy to get

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.910 
think the mo apps are fairly easy to get
in<00:06:37.169> free<00:06:37.500> throw

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:37.920 
in free throw

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.210 
in free throw

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:50.640 
286 over watching the two choppers

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.210 
286 over watching the two choppers
called<00:06:51.000> in<00:06:51.180> which<00:06:51.750> only<00:06:52.020> equivalent<00:06:52.620> to<00:06:52.770> 10

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.220 
called in which only equivalent to 10

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.100 
called in which only equivalent to 10
kills<00:06:53.490> so<00:06:53.790> but<00:06:54.330> this<00:06:54.450> map<00:06:54.660> here<00:06:54.870> is<00:06:54.960> just

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110 
kills so but this map here is just

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.490 
kills so but this map here is just
pretty<00:06:55.230> much<00:06:55.470> it's<00:06:55.830> not<00:06:55.920> really<00:06:56.310> great<00:06:56.520> for

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:57.500 
pretty much it's not really great for

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.890 
pretty much it's not really great for
running<00:06:58.500> assault<00:06:59.040> when<00:06:59.700> it<00:06:59.790> comes<00:06:59.970> to<00:07:00.180> your<00:07:00.330> I

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:00.900 
running assault when it comes to your I

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.660 
running assault when it comes to your I
guess<00:07:01.710> kill<00:07:01.950> streaks<00:07:02.250> and<00:07:02.340> stuff<00:07:02.490> like<00:07:02.610> that

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:02.670 
guess kill streaks and stuff like that

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:03.710 
guess kill streaks and stuff like that
just<00:07:02.820> because<00:07:03.120> of<00:07:03.240> the<00:07:03.270> fact<00:07:03.330> that<00:07:03.540> you<00:07:03.690> know

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:06.900
