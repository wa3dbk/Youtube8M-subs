00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.500 
just said well it could be very very
important<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:16.460> America's<00:00:17.460> future<00:00:17.730> especially

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.620 
important in America's future especially
the<00:00:19.109> direction<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.590> it's<00:00:19.859> moving<00:00:20.220> now<00:00:20.630> that

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
this this could be a probability so I

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.490 
this this could be a probability so I
studied<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.519> because<00:00:26.849> they<00:00:27.029> know<00:00:30.260> that<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.320> have

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
an amazing turning point the more I

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.660 
an amazing turning point the more I

learned from the a's two more and

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.020 
learned from the a's two more and
realize<00:01:11.869> how<00:01:12.869> important<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.409> actually<00:01:13.770> was

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
realize how important that actually was

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.719 
realize how important that actually was
for<00:01:15.030> Humanity<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.869> actually<00:01:16.770> have<00:01:17.040> the

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
opportunity of self-government

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.140 
opportunity of self-government
unfortunately<00:01:22.400> there's<00:01:23.400> been<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.909> tremendous

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
unfortunately there's been a tremendous

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.600 
unfortunately there's been a tremendous
amount<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.720> negative<00:01:24.900> intervention<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.009> they

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
amount of negative intervention and they

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.950 
amount of negative intervention and they
know<00:01:26.790> us<00:01:27.000> probably<00:01:27.390> better<00:01:27.659> than<00:01:27.810> we<00:01:27.930> know

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
know us probably better than we know

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.990 
know us probably better than we know
ourselves<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.829> they've<00:01:29.340> been<00:01:29.460> able<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.729> low

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
ourselves and they've been able to low

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.359 
ourselves and they've been able to low

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
school systems you know now they don't

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.230 
school systems you know now they don't
even<00:01:41.220> really<00:01:41.640> teach<00:01:41.939> any<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.829> so<00:01:44.030> it<00:01:45.030> was

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
even really teach any of that so it was

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.170 
even really teach any of that so it was
they<00:01:45.630> felt<00:01:46.020> very<00:01:46.250> importantly<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.610> let<00:01:48.000> me

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
they felt very importantly to let me

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.600 
they felt very importantly to let me
know<00:01:48.360> about<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.229> if<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.220> look<00:01:50.399> at<00:01:50.520> the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
know about that and if you look at the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.940 
know about that and if you look at the
third<00:01:50.820> trial<00:01:51.149> it's<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.869> remarkable<00:01:52.170> event<00:01:52.740> I

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
third trial it's a remarkable event I

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.060 
third trial it's a remarkable event I
certainly<00:01:53.790> hope<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.240> doesn't<00:01:54.570> happen<00:01:54.979> and<00:01:55.979> I

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
certainly hope it doesn't happen and I

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.260 
certainly hope it doesn't happen and I
wanted<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.490> happen<00:01:56.939> um<00:01:58.670> but<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.729> just<00:02:00.000> shared

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270
