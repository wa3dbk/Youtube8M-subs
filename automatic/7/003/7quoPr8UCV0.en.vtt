video on this particular style of trap
and<00:00:29.490> what<00:00:29.699> was<00:00:29.820> attractive<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.449> me<00:00:30.660> about<00:00:30.929> it

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
and what was attractive to me about it

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.000 
and what was attractive to me about it
was<00:00:31.260> all<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.430> inner<00:00:32.640> workings<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.510> the

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
was all of the inner workings of the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.720 
was all of the inner workings of the
trap<00:00:35.010> are<00:00:35.719> inside<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:38.010> smooth<00:00:38.340> sides

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
trap are inside so you have smooth sides

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.979 
trap are inside so you have smooth sides
you<00:00:38.910> don't<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.300> any<00:00:39.480> kind<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.870> a

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
you don't have any kind of a

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.979 
you don't have any kind of a
teeter-totter<00:00:40.860> type<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.790> trigger<00:00:42.290> and<00:00:44.930> so<00:00:45.930> I

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
teeter-totter type of a trigger and so I

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.020 
teeter-totter type of a trigger and so I
am<00:00:46.320> getting<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.039> cobble<00:00:47.460> together<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.940> he's

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
am getting a cobble together and he's

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.240 
am getting a cobble together and he's
gonna<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> treadle<00:00:48.870> here<00:00:49.260> it'll<00:00:50.039> be

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
gonna have a treadle here it'll be

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.270 
gonna have a treadle here it'll be
kicked<00:00:50.520> up<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.969> then<00:00:51.059> when<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.300> goes<00:00:51.480> down

voila finish the trap and the more that
I<00:01:21.990> look<00:01:23.330> at<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.570> more<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.780> appreciate<00:01:24.990> just

I look at it the more I appreciate just
how<00:01:26.270> versatile<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.420> design<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:28.020> because

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
how versatile the design is because

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.240 
how versatile the design is because
really<00:01:28.700> if<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.820> look<00:01:30.030> here<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:31.590> trigger<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.220> a

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
really if you look here the trigger is a

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.499 
really if you look here the trigger is a
single<00:01:33.030> piece<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.840> wire<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:36.439> reach<00:01:37.439> in

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
single piece of wire and you reach in

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.789 
single piece of wire and you reach in
you<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.600> see<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.079> reach<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.710> you

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
you can see that you reach in and you

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.440 
you can see that you reach in and you
pull<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.280> wire<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.850> just<00:01:41.880> set<00:01:42.420> it

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
pull this wire and you just set it

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.690 
pull this wire and you just set it
rested<00:01:43.079> gently<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.770> top<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.189> trapdoor

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
rested gently on the top of the trapdoor

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.700 
rested gently on the top of the trapdoor
and<00:01:44.960> then<00:01:45.960> when<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.070> need<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.310> stick

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.750 

the<00:01:50.710> animal<00:01:51.130> goes<00:01:51.280> in<00:01:51.610> here<00:01:52.060> you<00:01:52.210> can<00:01:53.050> see<00:01:53.290> the

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
the animal goes in here you can see the

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.040 
the animal goes in here you can see the
little<00:01:54.760> trapdoor<00:01:55.090> right<00:01:55.600> there

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
little trapdoor right there

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.490 
little trapdoor right there
this<00:01:56.620> is<00:01:56.800> the<00:01:56.920> treadle<00:01:57.250> so<00:01:58.240> that<00:01:58.420> it's<00:01:59.350> a

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
this is the treadle so that it's a

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.560 
this is the treadle so that it's a
single<00:02:00.150> a<00:02:02.070> single<00:02:03.070> wire<00:02:03.370> is<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:03.940> trigger<00:02:04.240> so

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
single a single wire is the trigger so

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.960 
single a single wire is the trigger so
it's<00:02:05.080> infinitely<00:02:05.830> adjustable<00:02:05.950> I<00:02:06.490> can<00:02:06.640> adjust

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
it's infinitely adjustable I can adjust

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.450 
it's infinitely adjustable I can adjust
the<00:02:07.350> see<00:02:08.350> how<00:02:08.500> it<00:02:08.590> goes<00:02:08.770> right<00:02:08.800> up<00:02:09.040> to<00:02:09.160> there<00:02:09.310> so

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
the see how it goes right up to there so

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.490 
the see how it goes right up to there so
the<00:02:10.149> squirrel<00:02:10.450> or<00:02:10.690> whatever<00:02:10.899> comes<00:02:11.140> in<00:02:11.290> here

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
the squirrel or whatever comes in here

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.170 
the squirrel or whatever comes in here
and<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.650> steps<00:02:12.040> on<00:02:12.250> this<00:02:13.380> this<00:02:14.380> comes<00:02:14.800> down<00:02:15.180> and

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
and it steps on this this comes down and

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.080 
and it steps on this this comes down and
locks<00:02:16.540> it<00:02:16.750> in<00:02:16.870> nice<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.080> secure<00:02:17.790> I've<00:02:18.790> made

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
locks it in nice and secure I've made

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.600 
locks it in nice and secure I've made
the<00:02:19.330> lid<00:02:19.960> let's<00:02:20.590> see<00:02:20.710> how<00:02:20.800> this<00:02:20.950> holds<00:02:21.340> up<00:02:21.490> but

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
the lid let's see how this holds up but

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.230 
the lid let's see how this holds up but
it's<00:02:21.730> plumbers<00:02:22.540> mesh<00:02:23.070> so<00:02:24.070> hopefully<00:02:24.490> it'll<00:02:24.670> be

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
it's plumbers mesh so hopefully it'll be

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.230 
it's plumbers mesh so hopefully it'll be
strong<00:02:25.540> enough<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.870> keep<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.910> keep<00:02:27.910> squirrels

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
strong enough to keep the keep squirrels

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.610 
strong enough to keep the keep squirrels
and<00:02:28.510> stuff<00:02:28.540> in<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:28.990> if<00:02:29.050> it<00:02:29.170> is<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.440> I'll<00:02:29.500> just

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
and stuff in and if it is and I'll just

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.400 
and stuff in and if it is and I'll just
replace<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:31.000> then<00:02:31.270> right<00:02:31.510> here<00:02:31.540> I<00:02:32.050> put<00:02:32.380> a

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
replace it and then right here I put a

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.960 
replace it and then right here I put a
Plexiglas<00:02:33.750> gonna<00:02:34.750> think<00:02:35.020> this<00:02:35.140> is<00:02:35.200> an<00:02:35.500> open

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
Plexiglas gonna think this is an open

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.120 
Plexiglas gonna think this is an open
area<00:02:36.970> here<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:38.260> they'll<00:02:38.410> feel<00:02:38.650> safe<00:02:38.950> about

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
area here so they'll feel safe about

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.979 
area here so they'll feel safe about
going<00:02:39.490> it<00:02:41.220> yeah<00:02:42.250> you're<00:02:42.520> in<00:02:42.610> my<00:02:42.730> room<00:02:42.989> wasting

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
going it yeah you're in my room wasting

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.890 
going it yeah you're in my room wasting
time<00:02:44.410> on<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.709> computer<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:46.270> right<00:02:46.540> out<00:02:46.690> that

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
time on the computer and right out that

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.660 
time on the computer and right out that
window<00:02:48.060> is<00:02:49.060> where<00:02:49.300> I<00:02:49.360> set<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.840> traps<00:02:50.170> and<00:02:50.670> I

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
window is where I set the traps and I

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.000 
window is where I set the traps and I
just<00:02:51.910> had<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.090> squirrel<00:02:52.480> come<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.470> original

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
just had a squirrel come to the original

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.000 
just had a squirrel come to the original
box<00:02:54.250> trap<00:02:54.610> that<00:02:54.820> I<00:02:54.880> made<00:02:55.209> and<00:02:55.750> of<00:02:56.590> course<00:02:56.830> they

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
box trap that I made and of course they

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.400 
box trap that I made and of course they
had<00:02:57.160> already<00:02:57.310> taken<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:58.060> bait<00:02:58.840> off<00:02:59.080> of<00:02:59.290> the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
had already taken the bait off of the

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.130 
had already taken the bait off of the
trigger<00:02:59.910> so<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.330> squirrel<00:03:01.660> went<00:03:01.810> in<00:03:01.989> there

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
trigger so the squirrel went in there

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.110 
trigger so the squirrel went in there
and<00:03:02.200> looked<00:03:02.290> at<00:03:02.530> saw<00:03:02.680> there<00:03:02.830> was<00:03:02.950> I<00:03:03.040> so<00:03:03.760> I<00:03:03.790> ran

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
and looked at saw there was I so I ran

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.880 
and looked at saw there was I so I ran
and<00:03:04.300> grabbed<00:03:04.570> this<00:03:04.840> new<00:03:05.110> trap<00:03:05.440> that<00:03:05.590> I<00:03:05.650> just

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
and grabbed this new trap that I just

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.810 
and grabbed this new trap that I just
made<00:03:06.130> and<00:03:06.850> I<00:03:06.970> set<00:03:07.390> it<00:03:07.420> right<00:03:07.750> out<00:03:08.019> there<00:03:08.820> next

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
made and I set it right out there next

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.870 
made and I set it right out there next
to<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.030> old<00:03:10.150> trap<00:03:11.100> hoping<00:03:12.100> that<00:03:12.310> because<00:03:12.700> the

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
to the old trap hoping that because the

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.310 
to the old trap hoping that because the
squirrels<00:03:13.269> have<00:03:13.390> identified<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:14.080> as<00:03:14.230> an

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
squirrels have identified that as an

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.690 
squirrels have identified that as an
area<00:03:14.440> where<00:03:14.650> there's<00:03:14.799> food<00:03:15.100> that<00:03:15.370> it'll<00:03:15.549> come

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
area where there's food that it'll come

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.500 
area where there's food that it'll come
right<00:03:15.760> back

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
right back

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.680 
right back
so<00:03:17.380> we're<00:03:17.980> wait<00:03:18.160> here<00:03:18.430> for<00:03:18.670> a<00:03:18.700> few<00:03:18.940> minutes<00:03:19.299> and

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
so we're wait here for a few minutes and

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.850 
so we're wait here for a few minutes and
I<00:03:19.840> will<00:03:20.250> watch<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.549> traps<00:03:21.880> as<00:03:22.180> I'm<00:03:22.860> browsing

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
I will watch the traps as I'm browsing

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.970 
I will watch the traps as I'm browsing
the<00:03:24.100> internet<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.959> if<00:03:26.320> the<00:03:26.440> squirrel<00:03:26.680> comes

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
the internet and if the squirrel comes

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.420 
the internet and if the squirrel comes
up<00:03:27.220> I<00:03:27.430> will<00:03:27.489> show<00:03:28.150> you<00:03:28.209> what<00:03:28.390> it<00:03:29.250> whether<00:03:30.250> it

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
up I will show you what it whether it

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.910 
up I will show you what it whether it
works<00:03:30.640> or<00:03:30.850> not

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
works or not

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.830 
works or not
have<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.610> camera<00:03:32.910> all<00:03:33.030> set<00:03:33.360> up<00:03:33.450> and<00:03:33.570> ready<00:03:33.630> to

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
have the camera all set up and ready to

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.210 
have the camera all set up and ready to
go<00:03:34.050> now<00:03:34.620> we're<00:03:34.800> just<00:03:34.920> waiting<00:03:35.220> for<00:03:35.280> a<00:03:35.430> squirrel

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
go now we're just waiting for a squirrel

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.190 
go now we're just waiting for a squirrel
you<00:03:38.220> can<00:03:38.370> see<00:03:38.610> my<00:03:38.790> original<00:03:39.120> box<00:03:39.600> trap<00:03:39.960> that<00:03:40.140> I

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
you can see my original box trap that I

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.980 
you can see my original box trap that I
made<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.500> couple<00:03:40.620> of<00:03:40.980> years<00:03:41.220> ago<00:03:41.400> on<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:42.540> top<00:03:42.780> of

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
made a couple of years ago on the top of

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.080 
made a couple of years ago on the top of
the<00:03:43.110> table<00:03:43.500> and<00:03:43.710> just<00:03:43.890> beneath<00:03:44.430> it<00:03:44.640> is<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.790> new

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
the table and just beneath it is the new

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.230 
the table and just beneath it is the new
trap<00:03:45.470> with<00:03:46.470> all<00:03:46.680> of<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.070> workings<00:03:47.580> for<00:03:48.150> the

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
trap with all of the workings for the

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.740 
trap with all of the workings for the
trigger<00:03:48.570> on<00:03:48.890> the<00:03:49.890> inside<00:03:50.550> so<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.330> doesn't<00:03:51.600> have

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
trigger on the inside so it doesn't have

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.590 
trigger on the inside so it doesn't have
that<00:03:51.780> big<00:03:51.960> teeter-totter<00:03:52.830> on<00:03:53.070> the<00:03:53.220> top<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.760> it

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
that big teeter-totter on the top and it

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.650 
that big teeter-totter on the top and it
uses<00:03:54.780> a<00:03:54.960> treadle<00:03:55.380> which<00:03:56.340> is<00:03:56.520> a<00:03:56.550> plate<00:03:57.300> on<00:03:57.510> the

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
uses a treadle which is a plate on the

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.430 
uses a treadle which is a plate on the
floor<00:03:58.110> in<00:03:58.710> order<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.520> trigger<00:04:00.080> the<00:04:01.080> trap

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
floor in order to trigger the trap

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.830 
floor in order to trigger the trap
whereas<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.010> one<00:04:02.160> on<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.370> top<00:04:02.610> the<00:04:03.420> bait<00:04:03.660> is

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
whereas the one on the top the bait is

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.230 
whereas the one on the top the bait is
actually<00:04:04.290> affixed<00:04:04.770> to<00:04:04.860> a<00:04:04.980> trigger<00:04:05.430> stick<00:04:05.910> and

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
actually affixed to a trigger stick and

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.750 
actually affixed to a trigger stick and
as<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:06.690> squirrel<00:04:07.680> manipulates<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.490> stick

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
as the squirrel manipulates the stick

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.370 
as the squirrel manipulates the stick
trying<00:04:09.030> to<00:04:09.090> get<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.270> bait<00:04:09.510> off<00:04:09.690> it<00:04:09.930> trips<00:04:10.230> the

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
trying to get the bait off it trips the

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.830 
trying to get the bait off it trips the
trap<00:04:10.880> so<00:04:11.880> I'm<00:04:11.940> hoping<00:04:12.240> that<00:04:12.300> this<00:04:12.510> pressure

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
trap so I'm hoping that this pressure

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.380 
trap so I'm hoping that this pressure
plate<00:04:13.080> on<00:04:13.320> the<00:04:13.440> floor<00:04:13.709> will<00:04:14.010> be<00:04:14.280> just<00:04:15.240> as

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
plate on the floor will be just as

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.479 
plate on the floor will be just as
effective<00:04:15.540> or<00:04:16.320> maybe<00:04:16.500> even<00:04:16.590> more<00:04:16.980> effective

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
effective or maybe even more effective

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.789 
effective or maybe even more effective
it's<00:04:18.269> raining<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.810> little<00:04:18.930> bit<00:04:19.170> and<00:04:19.380> the

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
it's raining a little bit and the

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.940 
it's raining a little bit and the
squirrel<00:04:20.130> that<00:04:20.459> was<00:04:20.640> there<00:04:20.970> went<00:04:21.269> up<00:04:21.390> in<00:04:21.570> that

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
squirrel that was there went up in that

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.680 
squirrel that was there went up in that
camper<00:04:22.950> tree<00:04:23.280> that's<00:04:23.580> just<00:04:23.970> to<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.270> right<00:04:24.480> of

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
these that we'll wait and see if he

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.750
