yeah<00:02:53.600> when<00:02:53.780> I<00:02:53.810> immediately<00:02:54.140> saw<00:02:54.590> this<00:02:54.799> I

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
yeah when I immediately saw this I

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.280 
yeah when I immediately saw this I
thought<00:02:55.190> of<00:02:55.459> my<00:02:55.760> potatoes<00:02:56.450> last<00:02:56.690> year<00:02:56.989> because

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
thought of my potatoes last year because

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.199 
thought of my potatoes last year because
it<00:02:57.440> was<00:02:57.530> very<00:02:57.830> difficult<00:02:58.220> back-breaking<00:02:58.940> work

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
it was very difficult back-breaking work

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.750 
it was very difficult back-breaking work
in<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.630> hot<00:02:59.780> Sun<00:03:00.080> and<00:03:00.290> just<00:03:00.950> every<00:03:01.250> potato<00:03:01.610> I'd

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
in the hot Sun and just every potato I'd

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.699 
in the hot Sun and just every potato I'd
have<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:02.030> lean<00:03:02.269> up<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.750> then<00:03:02.900> put<00:03:03.560> it

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
have to lean up and then put it

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:04.840 
have to lean up and then put it
somewhere<00:03:03.980> behind<00:03:04.370> me<00:03:04.489> it<00:03:04.549> was<00:03:04.640> a<00:03:04.670> lot<00:03:04.820> of

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
somewhere behind me it was a lot of

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.850 
somewhere behind me it was a lot of
twisting<00:03:05.360> motion<00:03:05.720> so<00:03:06.260> I<00:03:06.290> just<00:03:06.530> liked<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.709> idea

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
twisting motion so I just liked the idea

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.680 
twisting motion so I just liked the idea
of<00:03:07.280> not<00:03:07.459> having<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.730> do<00:03:07.910> that<00:03:08.030> twisting<00:03:08.540> when

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
of not having to do that twisting when

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.690 
of not having to do that twisting when
I'm<00:03:08.840> harvesting<00:03:09.260> down<00:03:09.680> and<00:03:10.160> it's<00:03:10.310> all<00:03:10.459> right

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
I'm harvesting down and it's all right

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.280 
I'm harvesting down and it's all right
there<00:03:10.910> in<00:03:11.000> front<00:03:11.060> of<00:03:11.269> mates<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:11.840> it's<00:03:12.080> still

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
there in front of mates and it's still

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.670 
there in front of mates and it's still
very<00:03:12.320> easy<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.769> use<00:03:12.860> when<00:03:13.010> your<00:03:13.130> honor

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
very easy to use when your honor

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.720 
very easy to use when your honor
so<00:03:14.680> people<00:03:14.860> are<00:03:15.040> concerned<00:03:15.340> about<00:03:15.459> what's

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
so people are concerned about what's

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.910 
so people are concerned about what's
gonna<00:03:15.909> happen<00:03:15.970> in<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.330> pouch<00:03:16.709> it's<00:03:17.709> just

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
gonna happen in the pouch it's just

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.649 
gonna happen in the pouch it's just
gonna<00:03:18.040> fall<00:03:18.280> forward<00:03:18.760> so<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.030> lot<00:03:19.239> of<00:03:19.329> times<00:03:19.510> I'm

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:19.659 
gonna fall forward so a lot of times I'm
