00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:52.320 
instead of the episode of Liberty City

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.470 
instead of the episode of Liberty City
it's<00:07:52.530> like<00:07:52.710> I<00:07:52.950> got<00:07:53.550> it<00:07:53.640> up<00:07:53.790> there<00:07:53.820> but<00:07:54.150> I<00:07:54.180> tried

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:54.480 
it's like I got it up there but I tried

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.820 
it's like I got it up there but I tried
doing<00:07:54.630> it<00:07:54.750> up<00:07:54.900> to<00:07:55.020> the<00:07:55.140> maintenance<00:07:55.350> but<00:07:55.740> it

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:55.830 
doing it up to the maintenance but it

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.730 
doing it up to the maintenance but it
wouldn't<00:07:56.040> let<00:07:56.070> me<00:07:56.160> do<00:07:56.370> it<00:07:56.570> so<00:07:57.570> it<00:07:58.350> has<00:07:58.380> the

00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:58.740 
wouldn't let me do it so it has the

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.680 
wouldn't let me do it so it has the
little<00:07:58.890> yellow<00:07:59.430> bar<00:07:59.760> next<00:08:00.000> to<00:08:00.150> it<00:08:00.270> so<00:08:00.300> I<00:08:00.420> didn't

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:00.690 
little yellow bar next to it so I didn't

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:03.080 
little yellow bar next to it so I didn't
so<00:08:01.530> that's<00:08:01.680> when<00:08:01.830> I<00:08:01.860> figured<00:08:02.400> out<00:08:02.640> about<00:08:02.790> this

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:03.090 
so that's when I figured out about this

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:04.820 
so that's when I figured out about this
vehicle<00:08:03.630> and<00:08:03.720> I<00:08:03.990> figured<00:08:04.290> out<00:08:04.410> making<00:08:04.710> this

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:04.830 
vehicle and I figured out making this

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:06.290 
vehicle and I figured out making this
one<00:08:05.040> because<00:08:05.160> it<00:08:05.340> works<00:08:05.520> without<00:08:05.700> cancelling

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:06.300 
one because it works without cancelling

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.110 
one because it works without cancelling
