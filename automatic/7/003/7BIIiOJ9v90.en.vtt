00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:08.069
 Hello guys 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:14.910
 line 2 engine editing 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:17.180
 already in the branch starting to leave some 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.470
 tips here 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:30.870
 here is a very good engine engine 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:45.420
 fado 1.0 it takes 9 8 valves with 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:48.590
 injection module ew and w 11 107 ok I go 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:55.170
 speak a little of actuating sensors there 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:59.630
 for those who do not have the location 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:06.450
 components you should know there worth 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:11.479
 come only Adriano again then the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:15.420
 Mechanic, love, your face, to continue. 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:20.180
 good motor 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.370
 he gasoline has 36 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.920
 1.10 involves very good engine 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:33.300
 and working with two coils 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:39.300
 window 1 of September 4 going of the book the 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:45.180
 third member we have there samsung 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:48.420
 acer idle actuator 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.060
 Okay, tps, right below. 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.619
 it stays on the axis of the butterfly logo 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:02:08.550
 below here butterfly position sensor 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:14.489
 we have here the same air temperature act 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:19.530
 Nice and be who I am Mapi ok 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:23.209
 From here I'll try to get you here it's 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:33.440
 voting only 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:33.440
 someone here each 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:44.840
 already unconventional to use 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.840
 motor promise 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:03:15.480
 we have the water temperature sensor 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:21.910
 the t1 the natura and the water cps invoice of the water 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:25.870
 Well, what 's the tactic, do not you have a problem? 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.860
 and when you see in the physical part 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.620
 under 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:34.740
 should also parallel the border 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.770
 Shock temperature below its part 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:44.110
 consuming more or consuming more siblings 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:46.810
 event and prove that you can 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:52.050
 turn well in and out of town 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:58.240
 some people usually trust is wrong and there 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:04:02.890
 shows the sun in this mon mode getores 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:07.170
 there we have the ones to vote for this 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:11.200
 The right to pardon requires attention and 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:16.380
 detonation take samsung duration 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:23.950
 good made me get cardinal sanctioned 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:26.139
 a great and already conditioned sac de fn eu 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:34.949
 neither the way 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:40.419
 and what is the ok lambda probe wins under the 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:48.370
 stay there then this is the bike some 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:49.210
 thing to show you here, huebl ae 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:05:03.340
 dengue 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:05:10.210
 here you connect your position tone to the 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:28.810
 and then the temperature of the 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:42.069
 Very good water and water air a problem 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:43.930
 22 people also want to order ends 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:46.719
 sending fuel that I harbor in this 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:52.379
 link here the car stay and with your 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:54.490
 Damn well and only you are that fucking baboon 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:58.060
 noble was very good 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:01.439
 I always work here with a 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.439
 pistol temperature 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:25.040
 work with a reason quite well 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:33.110
 high potential very good importance and 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:37.580
 Are you checking in there? 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:51.710
 current or not, the pain is very 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:56.930
 important also 1998 valves to the very 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:07:07.070
 good taste of the components and sensors and 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:10.610
 Actuators there okay it 's tps that has a 

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:12.740
 butterfly he gets excited all ok 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:15.020
 competitor to perform in a manner that 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:18.070
 that the opening of the 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:21.070
 butterfly and false miss on fake 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.070
 false 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:28.550
 The message there put top module is with 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:32.630
 problem and ended up almost yearning 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:34.099
 a problem, leaving you both okay 

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.770
 more gall 

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:39.530
 a hug in your dog is that 

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:43.340
 I liked it because it was new video and 

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:46.449
 other engines are for you to enjoy.
