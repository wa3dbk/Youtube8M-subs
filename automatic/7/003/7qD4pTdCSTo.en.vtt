00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
put something big on there the fish is

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.290

going<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.099> come<00:00:26.279> up<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.670> he's<00:00:26.789> going<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.119> pick

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
going to come up and he's going to pick

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.109 
going to come up and he's going to pick
away<00:00:27.630> at<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:28.019> big<00:00:28.260> worm<00:00:28.490> until<00:00:29.490> he<00:00:29.609> gets<00:00:29.849> down

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
away at that big worm until he gets down

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.310 
away at that big worm until he gets down
to<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.810> hook<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.289> he's<00:00:31.710> going<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.949> swim<00:00:32.250> off

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
to the hook and he's going to swim off

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.720 
to the hook and he's going to swim off
if<00:00:34.550> you<00:00:35.550> tip<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:35.910> off<00:00:36.860> tip<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.040> off<00:00:38.190> with<00:00:38.489> no

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
if you tip it off tip it off with no

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.970 
if you tip it off tip it off with no
more<00:00:38.969> than<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.270> piece<00:00:39.510> like<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:39.780> maybe<00:00:40.620> this

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
more than a piece like this maybe this

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.630 
more than a piece like this maybe this
and<00:00:41.629> the<00:00:42.629> idea<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.710> some<00:00:43.980> fish<00:00:44.219> will<00:00:44.430> come

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
and the idea is that some fish will come

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.110 
and the idea is that some fish will come
up<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.059> they'll<00:00:45.270> still<00:00:45.809> smell<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:47.120> they'll

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
up and they'll still smell that they'll

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.170 
up and they'll still smell that they'll
smell<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.840> tube<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.500> get<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> feel<00:00:50.789> for<00:00:50.820> it

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
smell that tube and get a feel for it

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.910 
smell that tube and get a feel for it
and<00:00:51.270> if<00:00:51.449> they<00:00:51.660> smell<00:00:52.079> if<00:00:52.350> there's<00:00:52.559> something

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
and if they smell if there's something

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.470 
and if they smell if there's something
good<00:00:53.129> there<00:00:53.399> they'll<00:00:53.820> take<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.270> whole<00:00:54.449> thing

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
good there they'll take the whole thing

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.810 
good there they'll take the whole thing
in<00:00:55.219> provided<00:00:56.219> it's<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.550> small<00:00:56.879> piece<00:00:58.190> now<00:00:59.190> I'll

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
in provided it's a small piece now I'll

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.400 
in provided it's a small piece now I'll
tell<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.270> couple<00:01:00.449> other<00:01:00.750> ways<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.350> people

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
bottom right where the fish are for a

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.929 
bottom right where the fish are for a

long presentation you can get the bottom

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.760 
long presentation you can get the bottom
is<00:01:18.090> rough<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.780> get<00:01:18.960> down<00:01:19.200> there<00:01:19.530> and

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
is rough you can get down there and

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.510 
is rough you can get down there and

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
still have it float above the bottom a

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.990 
still have it float above the bottom a
little<00:01:23.610> bit<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.380> this<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.670> popular<00:01:26.670> way<00:01:26.850> of

all been in tackle stores and seen beads
I<00:01:34.530> mean<00:01:34.799> what<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.490> heck<00:01:35.729> are<00:01:35.970> those<00:01:36.119> beads<00:01:36.450> for

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
I mean what the heck are those beads for

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.060 
I mean what the heck are those beads for
well<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.340> bead<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.060> prevent<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:40.070> this

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
well this bead is to prevent this this

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.350 
well this bead is to prevent this this
hook<00:01:41.369> from<00:01:41.729> coming<00:01:42.240> through<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.720> tube<00:01:45.229> all

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
greased that up a little bit so it

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:58.580 
greased that up a little bit so it
slides<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.549> good

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.300 

I'll<00:01:59.340> pull<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.790> pull<00:02:00.680> that<00:02:01.680> bead<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.250> that

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
I'll pull it pull that bead and that

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.770 
I'll pull it pull that bead and that
hook<00:02:03.590> hop<00:02:04.590> inside<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.490> tube<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.540> little

hook hop inside of that tube a little
bit<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:11.840> from<00:02:12.840> here<00:02:16.849> the<00:02:17.849> tube<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:19.739> tube

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
bit and from here the tube the tube

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.820
