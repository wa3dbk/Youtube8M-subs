00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.160
 I have always said that sleeping in a house 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.769
 alien, even if it belongs to someone 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.509
 of the family is sometimes a 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.509
 not so pleasant experience 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.290
 and with this I am not referring to the 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.540
 comfort of our mattress that although 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.820
 have a spring hopped we know how 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.250
 avoid it and fixed matter my 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.880
 comment goes further I talk about entities 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.500
 wanderers who live in these places 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.250
 making company to people who 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.250
 there they reside 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.200
 when I came to visit with my aunt 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.510
 cousins ​​never referred to these 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.910
 companies so after playing 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.760
 almost shuffles and until 2:30 of the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.650
 tomorrow I went to my room assigned the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.060
 which was my youngest cousin's 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.060
 the house of ten years old 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.680
 To sleep, I was sleeping 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.680
 beating quickly and confirm that your 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.690
 of the sleepless was not my thing in that 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.790
 moment I realized that a silhouette happened 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.790
 quickly towards the exit of the room 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.520
 at first I thought it was my cousin who 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.070
 I had entered the room for something that 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.760
 I had forgotten and for this reason I decided 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.760
 To fall asleep 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.390
 the next day at breakfast I commented 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.869
 the event but only saw ones to 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.180
 others ducked their heads and I knew that 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.460
 something was wrong 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.780
 I tried to reassure myself I only had to stay 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.520
 one more day of visiting so 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.520
 I would only be there one more night 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.910
 He fell the night beforeesaoples asked 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.070
 again for that silhouette but 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.420
 nobody told me anything so I went to 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.420
 sleep with more questions than answers 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.590
 when I was lying down I looked again at that 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:06.530
 silhouette and I assumed that there would be everything 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.010
 like the night before but that 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.160
 shadow returned and was put next to the bed 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.160
 staring at me 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.340
 I could not move or even close 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.430
 the eyes his little arm stretched 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.120
 until my hand touched his face he could not 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.819
 see was very dark as if 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.890
 had a hole in the face just his 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.890
 little eyes shone like two 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.939
 embers lit at that moment I 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.939
 squeezed and I'm like that 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.610
 that voice I can never forget the no 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.760
 it was from a child is more it was not even 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.790
 a normal voice seemed like a bell 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.650
 tone fixed with effects and just spoke 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:02.400
 to tell me 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:02.400
 here is our course you must be here 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.299
 he really did not tell me twice and I left 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.640
 running from the room and with my screams 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.290
 I woke up to others my cousin the greatest 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.780
 He told me to sleep with them but now 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.400
 I could not close my eyes that image 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.400
 I was really stuck in my brain 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.700
 the next day very early 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.760
 I talked about last night but nobody and his 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.040
 surprise gesture 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.010
 I did not have to make an effort to understand that 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.900
 in that house there was an intruder and that 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.900
 intruder was me 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.019
