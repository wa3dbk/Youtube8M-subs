00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
about bikes I only drive them oh it's so

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.200 
about bikes I only drive them oh it's so
easy<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:47.010> literally<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:47.640> turn<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.059> thing

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.149 
on a road trip I'd love to take one of
these<00:01:26.909> I'd<00:01:27.389> be<00:01:27.689> fun<00:01:27.929> so<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.409> picked<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.889> bike

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
these I'd be fun so I picked this bike

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.159 
these I'd be fun so I picked this bike
for<00:01:29.369> two<00:01:29.729> reasons<00:01:30.149> was<00:01:30.359> the<00:01:30.539> way<00:01:30.779> it<00:01:30.840> looked

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:31.169 
for two reasons was the way it looked

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:33.499 
for two reasons was the way it looked
and<00:01:31.499> the<00:01:32.009> apparent<00:01:32.399> size<00:01:32.549> but<00:01:32.909> along<00:01:33.209> with<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
and the apparent size but along with the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.279 
and the apparent size but along with the
way<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.810> looked

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
way it looked

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:35.959 
way it looked
I<00:01:34.409> liked<00:01:35.039> the<00:01:35.219> handle<00:01:35.549> bars<00:01:35.729> weren't

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
I liked the handle bars weren't

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:37.999 
I liked the handle bars weren't
ridiculously<00:01:36.659> high<00:01:36.959> I<00:01:37.200> think<00:01:37.560> that's<00:01:37.709> silly

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
ridiculously high I think that's silly

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.409 
ridiculously high I think that's silly
and<00:01:38.249> it<00:01:38.369> doesn't<00:01:38.639> interest<00:01:38.909> me

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:39.419 
and it doesn't interest me

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:41.989 
and it doesn't interest me
I<00:01:39.450> don't<00:01:40.200> want<00:01:40.349> handlebars<00:01:40.950> or<00:01:41.159> as<00:01:41.429> high<00:01:41.669> as<00:01:41.729> my

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:41.999 
I don't want handlebars or as high as my

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:44.389 
I don't want handlebars or as high as my
face<00:01:42.409> so<00:01:43.409> while<00:01:43.649> these<00:01:43.799> are<00:01:43.979> higher<00:01:44.130> than<00:01:44.310> a

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
face so while these are higher than a

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.219 
face so while these are higher than a
sport<00:01:44.700> bike<00:01:44.849> relative<00:01:45.359> to<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.599> seat<00:01:45.840> it's

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
sport bike relative to the seat it's

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.169 
sport bike relative to the seat it's
very<00:01:46.560> comfortable<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.310> be<00:01:47.369> perfectly<00:01:47.759> honest

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
very comfortable to be perfectly honest

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:49.789 
very comfortable to be perfectly honest
so<00:01:48.329> looking<00:01:48.719> at<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.929> handlebars<00:01:49.409> they<00:01:49.590> look

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
so looking at the handlebars they look

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.319 
so looking at the handlebars they look
crooked<00:01:50.039> out<00:01:50.310> if<00:01:50.489> you<00:01:50.579> can<00:01:50.729> see<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.060> but<00:01:51.209> it

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
crooked out if you can see this but it

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.289 
crooked out if you can see this but it

handle it but I don't know what it is
maybe<00:03:25.739> it's<00:03:25.979> because<00:03:26.159> it's<00:03:26.430> two-stroke<00:03:26.909> it's

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
maybe it's because it's two-stroke it's

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.710 
maybe it's because it's two-stroke it's
my<00:03:27.269> guess<00:03:27.829> but<00:03:28.829> it<00:03:28.979> is<00:03:29.129> not<00:03:29.340> intimating<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:30.150> is

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
my guess but it is not intimating it is

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.189 
my guess but it is not intimating it is

practical<00:04:03.220> if<00:04:03.340> you<00:04:04.060> live<00:04:04.239> on<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.569> road<00:04:04.690> and

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
practical if you live on the road and

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.960 
practical if you live on the road and
you<00:04:04.959> got<00:04:05.080> to<00:04:05.170> travel<00:04:05.440> a<00:04:05.470> lot<00:04:05.590> that's<00:04:05.769> fine<00:04:06.129> but

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
you got to travel a lot that's fine but

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.460 
you got to travel a lot that's fine but
I'm<00:04:07.120> all<00:04:07.299> about<00:04:07.540> the<00:04:07.659> way<00:04:07.780> it<00:04:07.900> looks<00:04:08.080> I<00:04:08.290> chose

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
I'm all about the way it looks I chose

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.839 
I'm all about the way it looks I chose
this<00:04:08.620> one<00:04:08.799> because<00:04:08.830> the<00:04:09.190> way<00:04:09.310> it<00:04:09.459> looks<00:04:09.640> I

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
this one because the way it looks I

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.490 
this one because the way it looks I
still<00:04:10.299> think<00:04:10.480> it<00:04:10.569> looks<00:04:10.599> great<00:04:10.900> is<00:04:11.200> blacked

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.619 
still think it looks great is blacked
out<00:04:11.709> it's<00:04:12.099> not<00:04:12.220> obnoxiously<00:04:12.700> large<00:04:13.030> or<00:04:13.420> a

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
out it's not obnoxiously large or a

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.110 
out it's not obnoxiously large or a
whole<00:04:14.230> lot<00:04:14.379> like<00:04:14.530> a<00:04:14.560> cruiser<00:04:14.920> doesn't<00:04:15.910> have<00:04:16.060> a
