00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.219
 or the friend of all my name is Jorge 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.020
 bucay a chile I'm the general manager of 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.980
 rhyme factory and I want to talk to you 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.980
 about automotive painting 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.360
 do not 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.760
 to call him 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:47.890
 basically the baked paint 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.449
 automotive has nothing to do with a 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.129
 Electrostatic painting theme the 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.250
 Electrostatic painting is for another type 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.420
 of the paint system and coatings 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.750
 They are usually made for systems 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.460
 industrial to paint everything paint 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.180
 shelves the automotive paint is 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.180
 completely different 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.090
 it's basically a common painting and 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.440
 current as the previous ones everything is 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.940
 can say in the application is similar 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.150
 but the only difference is told to 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.210
 oven because it is applied within 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.880
 a negative pressure booth so that 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.130
 is the particles that in the environment 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.370
 do not adhere to the painting that is a 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.590
 catalyzed paint gets the engine of 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.630
 the street of the paint eye and it 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.670
 warm the air to approximately 60 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.100
 degrees for an hour so that the 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.440
 drying process is much faster 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.450
 we're talking basically three to 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.370
 four important phases one is the 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.190
 first that would come to be the base where 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.930
 is going to go painting the painting itself and in 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.030
 some cases that are chopped paintings 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.730
 plus three layers has to go lacquer 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.030
 transparent or a background not depending 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.960
 of the quality or the type of paint and 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.960
 finished that one wants 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.900
 the paint has to be applied in a 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.670
 negative pressure cabin so that this 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.379
 cabin that has filters and you have a few 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.590
 engines that recirculate air under pressure 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:30.540
 negative absorb all the particles 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.760
 that float in the system within the 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.860
 cabin after the paint is applied on 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.980
 technician leaves the cockpit and simply 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.510
 it turns on the engine is an engine that 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.750
 what you are going to do is heat the air that 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.480
 will have circulated in the cabin and 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.010
 for 60 minutes approximately one 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.250
 Average temperature between 50 to 60 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.280
 degrees will dry the paint very fast 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.470
 the base has to be very good a very 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.000
 good foundation implies that everything else 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.000
 that in good condition 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.890
 but basically here in Peru is 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.470
 acrylic paint and polyurethane paint 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.030
 urethane polyester polyurethanes that are 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.280
 the two branches of paintings that 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.250
 basically it brings here the difference is 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.860
 important the acrylic paints are 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.460
 paintings that are practically only 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.460
 of resin are diluted in an activator and 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.960
 that are applied without any problem to 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.540
 outdoors paintings instead 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.050
 polyurethanes if they need a 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.160
 much more specific procedure a lot 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.560
 more technical 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.850
 if we want to differentiate them acrylics 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.070
 and polyurethane pigtails are 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.380
 paintings of much better quality and by and 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.360
 therefore much more expensive 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.490
 It can last well applied with all the 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.650
 complete system can last from five to 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.300
 ten years without any problem hello 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.400
 friends of all others my name is Jorge 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.830
 vih the general manager of the factory 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.710
 rimac zach we are located in the 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.020
 avenue the colony 170 rÃ­mac and we are 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.330
 to serve you and to give you the best of 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.630
 our experience that are almost 20 years 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:12.790
 in an automotive store and good it 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.790
 will finish anything can serve them
