yaw that doesn't change with the rates

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.010 
yaw that doesn't change with the rates
but<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.650> pretty<00:01:55.890> good<00:01:56.220> yaw<00:01:56.780> it<00:01:57.780> also

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
but it is a pretty good yaw it also

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.490

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
know a real joy to fly maybe the only

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.369 
know a real joy to fly maybe the only
complaint<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.790> would<00:02:35.909> have<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.900> the

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
complaint I would have is that the the

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.860

body here is kind of all one piece the

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.740 
body here is kind of all one piece the
the<00:02:40.560> prop<00:02:40.860> guards<00:02:41.250> are<00:02:41.400> part<00:02:41.670> of<00:02:41.879> the<00:02:42.030> frame<00:02:42.390> so

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
the prop guards are part of the frame so

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.830 
the prop guards are part of the frame so
if<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:42.989> were<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.319> break<00:02:43.560> one<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:43.890> these

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
get some lights back on I think I got

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.499

some<00:06:00.129> hair<00:06:00.430> in<00:06:00.610> one<00:06:00.729> of<00:06:00.849> the<00:06:00.909> props<00:06:01.240> or

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:01.509 
some hair in one of the props or

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:03.480 
some hair in one of the props or
something<00:06:01.840> kind<00:06:02.229> of<00:06:02.349> flying<00:06:02.710> off<00:06:02.919> to<00:06:02.949> the<00:06:03.250> side

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
something kind of flying off to the side

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:17.430 
something kind of flying off to the side
on<00:06:03.849> me<00:06:14.490> there<00:06:15.490> we<00:06:15.669> go<00:06:15.849> just<00:06:16.120> needed<00:06:16.690> to<00:06:16.900> kind<00:06:17.289> of

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
on me there we go just needed to kind of

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.860 
on me there we go just needed to kind of
think<00:06:17.889> for<00:06:18.129> a<00:06:18.159> second<00:06:18.639> level<00:06:19.270> itself<00:06:19.599> out<00:06:19.840> I

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
think for a second level itself out I

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.019 
think for a second level itself out I
guess<00:06:21.960> so<00:06:22.960> yeah<00:06:23.139> this<00:06:23.409> is<00:06:23.469> a<00:06:23.650> pretty<00:06:24.009> cool<00:06:24.279> cool

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:25.029 
guess so yeah this is a pretty cool cool

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:28.050 
guess so yeah this is a pretty cool cool
little<00:06:25.270> uh<00:06:26.039> ultra-micro<00:06:27.039> I<00:06:27.069> guess<00:06:27.430> not<00:06:27.699> really

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
little uh ultra-micro I guess not really

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.459 
little uh ultra-micro I guess not really
quite<00:06:28.330> a<00:06:28.360> nano<00:06:30.360> well<00:06:31.360> that's<00:06:31.659> that's

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:32.469 
quite a nano well that's that's

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:36.749 
quite a nano well that's that's
interesting<00:06:33.189> look<00:06:33.400> at<00:06:33.430> that<00:06:35.490> that<00:06:36.490> was

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:36.759 
interesting look at that that was

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:39.450 
interesting look at that that was
interesting<00:06:37.419> was<00:06:37.690> kind<00:06:38.289> of<00:06:38.440> suction<00:06:38.770> into<00:06:39.310> the

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460 
interesting was kind of suction into the

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.930 
interesting was kind of suction into the
wall<00:06:40.210> there<00:06:40.569> on<00:06:40.779> its<00:06:40.930> own

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940

so<00:06:54.400> it<00:06:54.520> could<00:06:54.730> benefit<00:06:55.240> from<00:06:55.420> a<00:06:55.540> little<00:06:55.780> bit

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.050 
so it could benefit from a little bit

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.380 
so it could benefit from a little bit
faster<00:06:56.650> all<00:06:56.950> right<00:06:57.310> but<00:06:57.670> it's<00:06:58.060> definitely

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:58.390 
faster all right but it's definitely

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:04.150 
faster all right but it's definitely
