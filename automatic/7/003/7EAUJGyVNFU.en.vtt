here in the UK I got mine from Tesco for
just<00:00:22.920> about<00:00:23.130> four<00:00:23.430> pounds<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:25.730> here's<00:00:26.730> what

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
just about four pounds so here's what

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.630 
just about four pounds so here's what
happened<00:00:27.150> when<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.420> press<00:00:27.630> button<00:00:27.960> one<00:00:28.640> the

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.540 
and when you've had enough of that press
1<00:00:50.240> again<00:00:50.540> and<00:00:50.810> it<00:00:51.710> stops<00:00:51.980> at<00:00:52.160> the<00:00:52.250> end<00:00:52.370> of<00:00:52.490> the

which<00:00:57.140> is<00:00:57.290> the<00:00:57.410> trigger

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
which is the trigger

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.299 
which is the trigger
it<00:00:59.690> makes<00:00:59.900> the<00:01:00.170> large<00:01:01.030> fan<00:01:02.030> spin<00:01:03.100> this<00:01:04.100> is

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
it makes the large fan spin this is

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.700 
it makes the large fan spin this is
controlled<00:01:04.760> using<00:01:04.970> a<00:01:05.180> relay<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:06.440> open

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.850 

that's<00:01:11.300> the<00:01:11.450> Darlington<00:01:11.840> array<00:01:12.170> chip<00:01:12.440> and

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
that's the Darlington array chip and

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.210 
that's the Darlington array chip and
these<00:01:13.460> this<00:01:13.850> is<00:01:14.000> two<00:01:14.210> relays<00:01:14.800> on<00:01:15.800> a<00:01:15.860> relay

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
these this is two relays on a relay

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.249 
these this is two relays on a relay
border<00:01:19.509> so<00:01:20.509> we'll<00:01:20.660> pull<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:20.960> trigger<00:01:21.170> again

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259

just which pedals over here we've got a

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.150 
just which pedals over here we've got a
solenoid<00:01:32.320> which<00:01:33.320> I<00:01:34.180> was<00:01:35.180> inspired<00:01:35.630> by<00:01:36.020> the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
solenoid which I was inspired by the

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.130 
solenoid which I was inspired by the
solenoid<00:01:37.160> sequencer<00:01:37.820> I<00:01:37.880> videoed<00:01:38.420> of<00:01:38.810> Pete

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
solenoid sequencer I videoed of Pete

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.840

Andrews<00:01:39.530> at<00:01:39.680> one<00:01:39.890> of<00:01:40.009> the<00:01:40.100> Oxford<00:01:40.310> raspberry

Andrews at one of the Oxford raspberry

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.719 
Andrews at one of the Oxford raspberry
jams<00:01:41.090> and<00:01:42.080> I<00:01:42.680> thought<00:01:42.979> I'd<00:01:43.160> have<00:01:43.340> a<00:01:43.399> go<00:01:43.610> at

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
jams and I thought I'd have a go at

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.030 
jams and I thought I'd have a go at
making<00:01:43.880> some<00:01:44.240> sound<00:01:44.509> but<00:01:44.690> solenoids<00:01:45.050> to<00:01:45.380> so

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
making some sound but solenoids to so

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.260 
making some sound but solenoids to so
what<00:01:46.190> I<00:01:46.220> have<00:01:46.430> here<00:01:46.460> is<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.759> stainless<00:01:47.060> steel

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
what I have here is a stainless steel

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.540 
what I have here is a stainless steel
egg<00:01:47.690> Cup<00:01:47.930> which<00:01:48.170> is<00:01:48.290> acting<00:01:48.619> like<00:01:48.649> a<00:01:48.800> bell<00:01:49.070> when

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
egg Cup which is acting like a bell when

00:01:49.550 --> 00:02:06.460 
egg Cup which is acting like a bell when
I<00:01:49.670> press<00:01:50.860> plus<00:02:02.679> it<00:02:03.679> times<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.220> egg<00:02:04.340> cup<00:02:05.470> and

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
I press plus it times the egg cup and

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.499 
I press plus it times the egg cup and
makes<00:02:06.709> the<00:02:06.830> bell<00:02:07.039> sound<00:02:07.340> it<00:02:07.670> does<00:02:07.850> also<00:02:08.209> repeat

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
makes the bell sound it does also repeat

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.199 
makes the bell sound it does also repeat
if<00:02:08.660> you<00:02:08.690> hold<00:02:08.959> the<00:02:09.080> button<00:02:09.200> down<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:13.760> solenoid

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
if you hold the button down the solenoid

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.070 
if you hold the button down the solenoid

the<00:03:00.860> motor<00:03:01.070> will<00:03:01.310> cycle<00:03:01.610> up<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.480> then<00:03:02.930> down

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
the motor will cycle up and then down

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.380 
the motor will cycle up and then down
takes<00:03:03.620> about<00:03:03.740> 30<00:03:04.130> seconds<00:03:04.640> to<00:03:04.820> go<00:03:04.970> through<00:03:05.270> the

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
takes about 30 seconds to go through the

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:33.250 
takes about 30 seconds to go through the
whole<00:03:05.570> cycle<00:03:06.490> so<00:03:07.490> here's<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.970> button<00:03:08.270> press

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.979 

so<00:03:34.260> those<00:03:34.439> are<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.620> four<00:03:34.860> most<00:03:35.010> interesting

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
so those are the four most interesting

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.970 
so those are the four most interesting

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
controller over here we have the 80 mega

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.280 
controller over here we have the 80 mega
microprocessor<00:06:15.180> chip<00:06:15.419> on<00:06:15.630> the<00:06:15.810> Girt<00:06:16.020> board

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290 
microprocessor chip on the Girt board

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.770 
microprocessor chip on the Girt board
which<00:06:16.560> is<00:06:16.830> controlling<00:06:17.700> the<00:06:18.060> pulse<00:06:18.510> width

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
which is controlling the pulse width

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.230 
which is controlling the pulse width
modulation<00:06:19.700> for<00:06:20.700> the<00:06:21.950> servo<00:06:22.950> so<00:06:23.640> what<00:06:23.970> we<00:06:24.060> have

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
modulation for the servo so what we have

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.960 
modulation for the servo so what we have
to<00:06:24.330> do<00:06:24.479> is<00:06:24.660> type<00:06:24.900> sudo<00:06:25.200> python

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:25.970 
to do is type sudo python

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.340 
to do is type sudo python
we<00:06:26.270> remote<00:06:26.630> py<00:06:28.210> and<00:06:29.210> press<00:06:29.510> enter<00:06:29.960> now<00:06:30.200> it's

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:30.350 
we remote py and press enter now it's

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.940 
we remote py and press enter now it's
asking<00:06:30.500> me<00:06:30.800> to<00:06:30.890> press<00:06:31.190> 1<00:06:31.430> and<00:06:31.460> 2<00:06:31.760> on<00:06:32.060> the<00:06:32.120> Wii

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:32.950 
asking me to press 1 and 2 on the Wii

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:39.460 
asking me to press 1 and 2 on the Wii
controller<00:06:36.700> and<00:06:37.700> it's<00:06:38.180> successfully<00:06:38.990> shakin

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.470 
controller and it's successfully shakin

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.680 
controller and it's successfully shakin
hands<00:06:39.710> so<00:06:40.610> now<00:06:40.760> we<00:06:40.820> can<00:06:41.090> start<00:06:41.360> pressing

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:41.690 
hands so now we can start pressing

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:48.070 
hands so now we can start pressing
buttons<00:06:42.340> so<00:06:43.340> if<00:06:43.790> I<00:06:44.060> press<00:06:46.600> so<00:06:47.600> if<00:06:47.810> I<00:06:47.900> press

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 
buttons so if I press so if I press

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.610 
buttons so if I press so if I press
button<00:06:48.380> 1<00:06:49.030> that<00:06:50.030> sets<00:06:50.360> off<00:06:50.540> the<00:06:50.780> servo<00:06:51.380> and<00:06:51.410> the

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620 
button 1 that sets off the servo and the

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.260
