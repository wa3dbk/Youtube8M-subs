00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
in my last few videos on Nuketown and I

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.799 
in my last few videos on Nuketown and I
use<00:00:35.340> flak<00:00:35.670> jacket<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:36.210> time<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.540> reason<00:00:36.690> why

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
use flak jacket this time the reason why

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.299 
use flak jacket this time the reason why
you<00:00:36.870> gotta<00:00:37.050> use<00:00:37.170> flak<00:00:37.380> jacket<00:00:37.770> this<00:00:38.100> because

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
you gotta use flak jacket this because

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.950 
you gotta use flak jacket this because
you're<00:00:38.430> gonna<00:00:38.550> get<00:00:38.670> nade<00:00:38.879> spammed<00:00:39.210> little<00:00:39.840> bit

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
you're gonna get nade spammed little bit

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.090 
you're gonna get nade spammed little bit
too<00:00:40.079> much<00:00:40.200> because<00:00:40.379> people<00:00:40.710> kind<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.920> caught

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
too much because people kind of caught

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.920 
too much because people kind of caught
on<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.460> they<00:00:41.969> kind<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.210> know<00:00:42.329> how<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.719> throw

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
on and they kind of know how to throw

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.540 
on and they kind of know how to throw
grenades<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.559> click<00:00:43.739> them<00:00:43.890> pretty<00:00:44.129> well<00:00:44.190> now

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
grenades and click them pretty well now

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.160 
grenades and click them pretty well now
so<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.850> don't<00:00:45.000> really<00:00:45.059> have<00:00:45.210> enough<00:00:45.629> time<00:00:46.110> to

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
so you don't really have enough time to

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.860 
so you don't really have enough time to
dodge<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.890> dip<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.280> duck<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.760> plus<00:00:48.480> people

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
dodge and dip and duck and plus people

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.170 
dodge and dip and duck and plus people
and<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.170> top<00:00:49.620> windows<00:00:49.980> like<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.280> use<00:00:50.399> RPGs<00:00:51.149> a

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
and the top windows like to use RPGs a

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.049 
and the top windows like to use RPGs a
lot<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.690> thrown<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:53.070> perfect<00:00:53.579> direction

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
lot and thrown a that perfect direction

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.779 
lot and thrown a that perfect direction
from<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.390> windows<00:00:55.399> so<00:00:56.399> when<00:00:56.520> you're<00:00:56.640> right

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
from the windows so when you're right

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.670 
from the windows so when you're right
here<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.629> need<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.899> have<00:00:57.960> flak<00:00:58.230> jacket<00:00:58.590> on

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
here you need to have flak jacket on

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.770 
here you need to have flak jacket on
that's<00:00:58.890> basically<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.910> biggest<00:01:00.120> part<00:01:00.570> is

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
that's basically the the biggest part is

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.750 
that's basically the the biggest part is
also<00:01:01.410> make<00:01:01.949> sure<00:01:01.980> where<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.309> know<00:01:02.489> where<00:01:02.640> your

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
also make sure where you know where your

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.520 
also make sure where you know where your
teammates<00:01:02.940> are<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.690> that's<00:01:04.290> how<00:01:04.379> you're

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
teammates are and that's how you're

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.630 
teammates are and that's how you're
gonna<00:01:04.589> be<00:01:04.710> able<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.949> watch<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> spawns<00:01:05.489> I

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
gonna be able to watch the spawns I

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.399 
gonna be able to watch the spawns I
think<00:01:05.820> I'm<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.060> game<00:01:06.240> with<00:01:06.390> thorax<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.200> I

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
think I'm in this game with thorax and I

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.950 
think I'm in this game with thorax and I
ended<00:01:08.369> up<00:01:08.460> pulling<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.790> pretty<00:01:09.090> good<00:01:09.180> score<00:01:09.330> 35

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
ended up pulling a pretty good score 35

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.429 
ended up pulling a pretty good score 35
and<00:01:10.229> one<00:01:10.380> um<00:01:11.119> it's<00:01:12.119> probably<00:01:12.450> my<00:01:12.780> second<00:01:13.320> best

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
and one um it's probably my second best

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.410 
and one um it's probably my second best
to<00:01:13.680> date<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.890> do<00:01:14.040> have<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> 37<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.030> one<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.330> I'll

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
to date I do have a 37 and one that I'll

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.820 
to date I do have a 37 and one that I'll
probably<00:01:15.540> be<00:01:15.840> uploading<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.350> little<00:01:16.530> bit<00:01:16.619> later

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
probably be uploading a little bit later

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.520 
probably be uploading a little bit later
and<00:01:17.299> I<00:01:18.299> fast<00:01:18.570> forward<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.900> little<00:01:19.049> bit<00:01:19.200> i<00:01:19.290> don't

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
and I fast forward a little bit i don't

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.200 
and I fast forward a little bit i don't
think<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.740> games<00:01:19.920> too<00:01:20.189> long<00:01:20.430> i<00:01:20.670> think<00:01:20.880> i<00:01:20.939> think

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
think the games too long i think i think

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.880 
think the games too long i think i think
it<00:01:21.390> was<00:01:21.450> only<00:01:21.570> like<00:01:21.720> five<00:01:21.990> minutes<00:01:22.229> regularly

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
it was only like five minutes regularly

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.469 
it was only like five minutes regularly
if<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.430> did<00:01:23.610> fast<00:01:23.850> forward<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:24.420> only

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
if I did fast forward it so it's only

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.450 
if I did fast forward it so it's only
about<00:01:24.630> going<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.140> be<00:01:25.229> about<00:01:25.320> 4<00:01:25.740> minutes<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.159> 20

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
about going to be about 4 minutes and 20

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.390 
about going to be about 4 minutes and 20
seconds<00:01:27.259> which<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.290> it's<00:01:28.950> funny<00:01:29.280> though

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
seconds which is it's funny though

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.219 
seconds which is it's funny though
because<00:01:29.430> I'm<00:01:29.729> getting<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.090> used<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.600> short

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
because I'm getting so used to short

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.719 
because I'm getting so used to short
commentaries<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:31.950> way<00:01:32.189> if<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.369> try<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.549> do

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
commentaries that way if I try to do

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.819 
commentaries that way if I try to do
like<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.880> nine<00:01:33.150> minute<00:01:33.360> video<00:01:33.570> right<00:01:33.960> now<00:01:33.990> it'd

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
like a nine minute video right now it'd

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.859 
like a nine minute video right now it'd
be<00:01:35.009> really<00:01:35.520> hard<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:36.000> kinda<00:01:36.509> want<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.689> talk

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
be really hard but kinda want to talk

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.109
