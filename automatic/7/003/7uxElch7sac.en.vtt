00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:11.290
 and here 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:26.840
 the forward and the first for this 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:33.199
 part not the third part is actually 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:37.250
 of 5 608 there's no middle so I do not think 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:40.960
 that is my life because they threw me back 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.960
 with that part that is not 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.620
 let's work with the rich who like 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.620
 karma 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.760
 note 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:01:02.600
 go down the river with more than 365 thousand 341 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.729
 we play string 5 and 6 with finger 1 of 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:20.970
 the string 6 of 13 3 and the finger 3 on the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:25.770
 rope 45 of this art 5 we do not touch the 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:31.250
 cord without air of 624 marking with 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.250
 finger 1 on string 4 of fret 2 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.340
 then we do as he does 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.560
 with 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.560
 our 2 and 4 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:54.580
 playing the string 5 and 4 obviously then 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.800
 let's play small leif touching the 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.090
 rope 5 air and hand 4 covering it 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:04.690
 among all we do it again 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:09.270
 first king is on the 3rd fret with the 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.270
 fret of 5 playing the string 6 and 5 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.970
 then we can serve a space up 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:22.750
 that in fret 2 with 4 of it 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:25.720
 possible king then we go down that riff some 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.530
 strings we do the same riff with the 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.250
 fret 2 and 4 but with string 5 and 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.250
 the rope 4 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.730
 after showing small that was plugging 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.970
 only one rope four others 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.970
 state 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:54.470
 then we do the terry that was the 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:59.420
 plugging according to 5 and account 4 of 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:05.150
 fret 2 and 4 we move it until we took 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:07.100
 a space of between 3 to 5 then what 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:14.780
 we return back to the back 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:22.190
 fret 2 and 4 and less time ago and then 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:24.020
 we just play the string 5 434 in 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.040
 the process as many times as necessary 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.040
 I know if its 4 3 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.799
 the process of listening to grace 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.680
