onto the building a mine and the helper

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.150 
onto the building a mine and the helper
is<00:00:48.510> enough<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.050> propel<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.500> on<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.920> pretty

this<00:00:53.489> map<00:00:53.989> you<00:00:54.989> could<00:00:55.140> even<00:00:55.260> multiply<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
this map you could even multiply the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.000 
this map you could even multiply the
helpers<00:00:56.489> by<00:00:56.640> four<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.539> works<00:00:57.719> too<00:00:58.010> evident

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
helpers by four that works too evident

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.130 
helpers by four that works too evident
by<00:00:59.579> this<00:00:59.789> following<00:01:00.149> trick<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.570> which<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.899> show

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
by this following trick in which I show

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.229 
by this following trick in which I show
you<00:01:01.199> how<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:01.620> manage<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.039> put<00:01:02.309> enough<00:01:02.670> recoil

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
you how we manage to put enough recoil

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.850 
you how we manage to put enough recoil
into<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> team<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.110> throw<00:01:04.290> up<00:01:04.409> our<00:01:04.589> course

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
into a team to throw up our course

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.700 
into a team to throw up our course
backwards<00:01:05.610> onto<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.420> building<00:01:06.750> notice<00:01:07.530> how<00:01:07.650> we

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
backwards onto a building notice how we

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.649 
backwards onto a building notice how we
use<00:01:07.920> his<00:01:08.100> Thunder<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.580> damage<00:01:08.909> himself<00:01:09.060> but

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
use his Thunder to damage himself but

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.450 
use his Thunder to damage himself but
then<00:01:09.869> as<00:01:10.080> he<00:01:10.320> ran<00:01:10.470> up<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.770> mine<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
then as he ran up to the mine and the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.370 
then as he ran up to the mine and the
team<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.760> four<00:01:12.000> he<00:01:12.510> equipped<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> repair

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
team of four he equipped the repair

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.350 
team of four he equipped the repair
beforehand<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.820> would<00:01:14.970> keep<00:01:15.150> healing

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
beforehand so that it would keep healing

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.660 
beforehand so that it would keep healing
himself<00:01:15.600> many<00:01:16.500> times<00:01:16.590> over<00:01:17.070> as<00:01:17.369> he<00:01:17.549> went

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
himself many times over as he went

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.640 
himself many times over as he went
through<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.939> mind<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.450> helper<00:01:19.200> team<00:01:19.439> of

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
through the mind and the helper team of

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.609 
through the mind and the helper team of
four<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.580> principle<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.659> works<00:01:21.869> both<00:01:22.110> ways<00:01:22.409> you

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
four in principle it works both ways you

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.410 
four in principle it works both ways you
might<00:01:22.740> end<00:01:22.920> up<00:01:23.130> tipping<00:01:23.549> over<00:01:23.729> as<00:01:24.060> well<00:01:24.270> and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
might end up tipping over as well and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.730 
might end up tipping over as well and
flying<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> direction<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.650> were

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
flying in the direction that you were

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.950 
flying in the direction that you were
driving<00:01:25.920> or<00:01:26.369> end<00:01:26.850> up<00:01:27.000> going<00:01:27.330> backwards<00:01:27.810> like

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
driving or end up going backwards like

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.319 
driving or end up going backwards like
in<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.229> previous<00:01:28.350> trick<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.340> all<00:01:29.579> depends<00:01:30.210> on

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
in the previous trick it all depends on

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.569 
in the previous trick it all depends on
the<00:01:30.390> timing<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.259> shots<00:01:31.530> made<00:01:32.070> by<00:01:32.369> your

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
the timing of the shots made by your

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.749 
the timing of the shots made by your
helpers<00:01:32.970> all<00:01:33.119> right<00:01:33.299> all<00:01:33.869> right<00:01:34.170> all<00:01:34.229> right

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
helpers all right all right all right

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.740 
helpers all right all right all right
right<00:01:35.759> around<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.119> middle<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.420> Berlin

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
right around the middle of Berlin

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.719 
right around the middle of Berlin
there's<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.200> building<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.710> from<00:01:38.189> hindsight

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
there's a building that from hindsight

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.910 
there's a building that from hindsight
looks<00:01:38.970> too<00:01:39.210> far<00:01:39.509> from<00:01:39.659> Rams<00:01:39.960> but<00:01:40.350> what<00:01:40.530> we<00:01:40.650> did

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
looks too far from Rams but what we did

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.010 
looks too far from Rams but what we did
here<00:01:41.250> i<00:01:41.430> thought<00:01:41.970> was<00:01:42.240> absolutely<00:01:42.840> genius

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
here i thought was absolutely genius

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.620 
here i thought was absolutely genius
notice<00:01:43.500> how<00:01:43.710> we've<00:01:44.220> constructed<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:45.030> pyramid

to the middle of the mansion is a bit

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.610 
to the middle of the mansion is a bit
harder<00:03:18.390> you'll<00:03:18.660> notice<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.110> angle<00:03:19.380> of
