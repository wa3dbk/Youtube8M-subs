 lizard it's very easy starts with 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.710
 draw a long curve 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.090
 then another below that connects the to 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:34.820
 this one by a half circle for the

 stroke finishes the front left leg by 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:54.110
 a curve draws another hand 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:57.850
 behind the first draws a line 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.850
 starting from the dough to make the belly 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.630
 from the draw a c-shaped curve 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:20.149
 then finish the left hind leg by 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:21.830
 4 must then connect the back and the leg 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.540
 back by two big curves 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.740
 they meet in peak for 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.740
 form the lizard's tail 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.360

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.840
 and left rear 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:58.110
 finally a last line between the dough and 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:02:01.280
 the beyond that makes an eye shaped 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.280
 wheel with a point in it 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.190
 to make our point at the snout 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:17.170
 signs and now the language 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:19.060
 ends with two spikes done 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.590
 now some scales on everything 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.590
 his body shaped like a semicircle 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:56.230
 now you can color it and that's it 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.230
