00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 as yesterday we discussed with you what 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.299
 is happening in some municipalities 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.420
 of the state of mexico where the 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.790
 insecurity has been disrupted and we put 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.969
 the case of the planet we talked about yesterday 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.650
 in the middle of the surrounding metropolitan area 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.770
 with the federal district in the valley of 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.300
 Mexican neighbors have created a group of 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.600
 self-defense to combat the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.220
 delinquents this is happening to about 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.019
 how many kilometers from the center of 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.740
 Mexico City with 1 Juan Rivas 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.740
 report 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.690
 in the middle of this urban spot the 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.850
 inhabitants have organized themselves to 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.800
 face crime forward 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.980
 for I bring a forward 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.980
 no no 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:56.710
 and if these men call themselves group 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.839
 of self-defense the prey emerged in the 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.629
 Colonia LÃ¡zaro Cardenas in Tlalnepantla 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:04.829
 state of mexico right on the border 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.829
 with the federal district 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.070
 watch the revolvers squads carry 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.230
 a rifle and even a pair of weapons 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.020
 semi-automatic 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:22.040
 We do not have this, we think we monitor 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.980
 our colonies before the negligence of 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.250
 the authorities another of the things that 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.700
 we have done is to arm ourselves 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.700
 I repeat we are not criminals 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.610
 we are aspects that want to live in peace 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.190
 been second everything quieter and is 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.530
 that at the end of 2013 in this area the 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.740
 criminals went from simple theft to 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.590
 extortion and then kidnapping with 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.680
 letters like this demanded merchants 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.990
 and professionals delivering money 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.210
 change supposedly would provide them 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.620
 security however it was about 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.390
 floor and extortion charge 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.810
 clarifying we are not against the 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.360
 government for nothing 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.070
 but if against crime they are 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.970
 the merchants are the merchants 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.590
 we are behind the transport what you 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.540
 you want everything that is the trade that 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.970
 we are the main affected of all 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.130
 this geography of this colony is 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.310
 complex is embedded in the 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.280
 skirts of the chiquihuite hill here 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.050
 everyone has a very clear request 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.489
 that continue to be safer streets 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.519
 now he can not go out and find the 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.550
 street because he already feels that what 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.049
 assault or take things away 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.330
 we toured the streets for more than one 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.840
 hour and at no time do we document the 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.730
 presence of police corporations 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.340
 this patrol being cut with the 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.780
 tires struck and without turret was the 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.260
 only indication of the police that 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.930
 we found in this mexican corner 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.180
 there are abandoned houses their owners fled 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.150
 after being kidnapped victims 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.760
 police modules are empty they are 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.950
 three of which one does not become 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.500
 this is the security module that looks 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.720
 more deteriorated is graffiti is without 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.430
 furniture with broken glass even 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.620
 with some shots that still 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.480
 You can see on this site people 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.980
 he does not know who did it and what the 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.140
 people do know is that since 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.510
 approximately 20 years this module 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.590
 it was never used by the elements of 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:28.400
 the municipal police serves as 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.370
 for house of lovers for not telling you 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.030
 another stronger word serves to make 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:38.180
 the criminals are not few because 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.340
 they hide there the self-defense group the 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.549
 dam took shape in November of the year 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.910
 past since they have captured the 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:49.129
 least 13 suspects 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:52.310
 these are pictures taken at the moment 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:55.099
 to deliver them to the police as part 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.140
 of the strategy placed 26 cameras of 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:00.290
 safety on the streets at a cost 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.380
 total of 300 thousand pesos are also 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.630
 backed by more than 400 taxi drivers and 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.579
 public transport operators that in 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.860
 alert case in a matter of minutes 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.860
 they can close all streets of the 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.489
 Lazaro Cardenas where they live 115 thousand 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.489
 people 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.430
 here in just six months it 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:37.050
 they registered 82 merchant kidnappings 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.510
 mechanics and some professionals 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:43.800
 it was the victims who after overcoming 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:47.880
 fear now take care of themselves with 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.500
 one juan rivas the station in this area 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.320
 near the chiquihuite hill in 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.230
 full hill of the chiquihuite before the 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.930
 state absence is the civil presence 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:01.620
 of people who are fed up with the 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:04.380
 insecure flame cries out for help for the 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.690
 that the government the police go and the 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.700

 surrounded us showed Juan Rivas a 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.970
 police module 20 years abandoned serves 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:18.500
 as a room to make appointments quotes from 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.500
 love but not good for anything else
