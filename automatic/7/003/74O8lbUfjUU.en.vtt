 joel friends youtube how good is my 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.880
 name is brian as you already know and I come 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.860
 with this new tutorial I know it did not go up 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.990
 many videos for a matter of time 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.049
 but I will try to upload more videos to 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.020
 often this time I come with a 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.560
 tutorial which many people have 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.740
 asked and many people who have 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.740
 asked 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.029
 and this time I come to tell you about two 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.029
 very important issues 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:37.390
 Problems have arisen after 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.309
 and to make a format on your computer 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.960
 since you do not know where to find the 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:46.130
 fault drivers or out there you do not get 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.960
 sound on your computer 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.300
 and it's because you do not have even seven is a 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.810
 previous support from other tweets 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.270
 jobs 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:58.130
 well here I have a program and the way 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:01.820
 to install their drivers in this case I'll 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.340
 to focus more on sound drivers 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.280
 Of video 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.480
 drivers that are very important for the 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.230
 correct operation of your 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.000
 good computer for this we are going to 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.110
 need a program that is going to 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.110
 allow to identify 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.250
 identify the name of our plate 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.040
 mother of our members 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.170
 this program is called duties as 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.649
 you can realize I already 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.649
 I have here 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.810
 and I'm going to leave the softonic page 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.270
 here you can download it is not very 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.300
 heavy and is free of viruses 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.979
 so do not worry about that, I 'm going to 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.840
 leave the download link in the 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.600
 description of this video 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.920
 and well once downloaded we will 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.920
 appear something like this 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:01.180
 what they have to do is open it 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:05.290
 the installer and start installing 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.060
 we put the language 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.040
 and what we do is with the following 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.860
 next until it is determined is a 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.130
 installation very easy to do once 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.150
 installed the program we will appear a 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.060
 icon like this 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.810
 what 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.810
 we open it 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.090
 where we open it and wait 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.020
 we wait a moment until until 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.380
 I finished 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.830
 and to open the program let's hope for a 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.830
 moment 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.750
 good and here we have the program has already 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.380
 open this the program interface 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.150
 duties which has spoken well to you a 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.690
 time here we go to where it says 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.690
 decline 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.580
 where we see the icon again 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.110
 mail that will leave us all 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.480
 specifications of our card 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.590
 mother and the name of our card 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.020
 mother which mine is that what 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.850
 we do is click right click and 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.200
 we copy 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:13.800
 this after we go 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.600
 we open our google page 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.400
 since this is the name of our 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:24.439
 mother card we put that name 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.439
 it's not because of bad times 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.180
 and what we should put later drivers 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.849
 [Applause] 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.480
 we have something load and it's going to 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:40.240
 redirect directly to the page 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.880
 from the manufacturer in this case hp 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.670
 Y 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.790
 and good here what we have to be able 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.140
 search drivers 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.390
 [Applause] 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.340
 we simply look for the driver that 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.530
 we need to download it and ready 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.050
 I'm going to make another 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.110
 another example 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.900
 in this case I'm not going to put the name of 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.069
 the mother card 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.080
 I'm going to 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.490
 to address others to others 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.530
 [Applause] 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.530
 another company as is 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.260
 like rice 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:27.620
 I'm going to the homepage of afro 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:31.730
 de jugro is a company that as 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:34.040
 can give factory factory account 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.740
 mother cards and in which we can 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.150
 find the drivers and graphics 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.510
 what we need in our 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.510
 computer 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.740
 and we wait for him to load 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.960
 we continue to stop what clear 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.060
 and once here 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.300

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:02.370
 to downloads 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:06.470
 we put the model 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.660
 and the and the controller that we are looking for 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.460
 and the only thing that we lack if we were missing 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.880
 is to download it 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.150

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.580
