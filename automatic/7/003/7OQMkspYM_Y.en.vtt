classes table so let's what I'm going to

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.330 
classes table so let's what I'm going to
do<00:00:05.549> is<00:00:05.850> make<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.629> column<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.410> here<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.099> change

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
do is make a column and here and change

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.400 
do is make a column and here and change
this<00:00:08.519> to<00:00:08.700> professor's<00:00:09.269> students<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.200> their

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
classes would you say that's a good idea

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.600 
classes would you say that's a good idea
well<00:00:13.170> you<00:00:13.259> know<00:00:13.320> what<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:13.500> have<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.710> say<00:00:13.830> that<00:00:14.040> no

well you know what I have to say that no

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.129 
well you know what I have to say that no
absolutely<00:00:15.509> not

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
absolutely not

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.859 
absolutely not
you<00:00:16.379> know<00:00:16.500> why<00:00:16.680> because<00:00:17.460> let's<00:00:18.449> say<00:00:18.600> there<00:00:18.779> was

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
you know why because let's say there was

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.010 
you know why because let's say there was
four<00:00:19.529> students<00:00:20.250> in<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.640> class<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:21.660> means<00:00:21.900> the

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
four students in a class that means the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.900 
four students in a class that means the
class<00:00:22.260> would<00:00:22.470> be<00:00:22.529> listed<00:00:22.980> four<00:00:23.189> times<00:00:23.490> as<00:00:23.850> a

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
class would be listed four times as a

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.509 
class would be listed four times as a
foreign<00:00:24.660> key<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.800> professor<00:00:26.279> would<00:00:26.430> be

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
foreign key and the professor would be

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.790 
foreign key and the professor would be
listed<00:00:26.699> four<00:00:27.029> times<00:00:27.240> as<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.689> foreign<00:00:28.080> key<00:00:28.230> which

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
listed four times as a foreign key which

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.440 
listed four times as a foreign key which
ain't<00:00:29.039> bad<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.519> then<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.630> student<00:00:31.380> ID<00:00:31.560> would

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
ain't bad and then the student ID would

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.520 
ain't bad and then the student ID would
be<00:00:33.450> listed<00:00:33.899> four<00:00:34.230> times<00:00:35.120> but<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:37.110> see<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
be listed four times but you see the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.459 
be listed four times but you see the
professor<00:00:37.860> ID<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:39.540> only<00:00:39.809> need<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.050> be<00:00:40.170> put<00:00:40.350> in

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
professor ID is only need to be put in

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.310 
professor ID is only need to be put in
there<00:00:40.649> once<00:00:40.890> having<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.090> there<00:00:42.480> 400<00:00:43.079> times

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
there once having it in there 400 times

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.350 
there once having it in there 400 times
for<00:00:43.739> four<00:00:43.920> hundred<00:00:44.010> students<00:00:44.640> that's<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.149> waste

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
for four hundred students that's a waste

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.940 
for four hundred students that's a waste
of<00:00:45.539> space<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.230> don't<00:00:46.289> really<00:00:46.500> like<00:00:46.590> that

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
of space and I don't really like that

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.130 
of space and I don't really like that
idea<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.969> I'm<00:00:48.180> changing<00:00:48.360> my<00:00:48.660> mind<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.079> I'm

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
idea so I'm changing my mind and I'm

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.619 
idea so I'm changing my mind and I'm
actually<00:00:49.289> gonna<00:00:49.530> make<00:00:49.710> another<00:00:50.100> table<00:00:50.670> man<00:00:51.420> is

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
actually gonna make another table man is

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.090 
actually gonna make another table man is
getting<00:00:51.840> crazy<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:53.239> this<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.390> going<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.690> be

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
getting crazy and this is going to be

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.389 
getting crazy and this is going to be
students<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.399> their<00:00:56.670> classes<00:00:58.129> and<00:00:59.129> we<00:00:59.309> are

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
students and their classes and we are

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.740 
students and their classes and we are
going<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.910> class<00:01:00.329> ID<00:01:02.000> and<00:01:03.000> then<00:01:03.239> student

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
going to have class ID and then student

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.280 
going to have class ID and then student
ID<00:01:04.339> like<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.549> int<00:01:05.900> instead<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:06.990> us

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
ID like that int instead of us

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.080 
ID like that int instead of us
oh<00:01:07.320> yeah<00:01:07.560> also<00:01:07.979> set<00:01:08.310> them<00:01:08.400> both<00:01:08.520> as<00:01:08.729> primary

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
oh yeah also set them both as primary

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.060 
oh yeah also set them both as primary
key<00:01:09.240> because<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:10.290> connection<00:01:10.740> won't<00:01:10.860> ever

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
key because the connection won't ever

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.929 
key because the connection won't ever
change<00:01:11.750> now<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.810> foreign<00:01:13.140> key<00:01:13.260> defer<00:01:13.939> class

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
change now the foreign key defer class

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.920 
change now the foreign key defer class
ID<00:01:15.210> references<00:01:15.900> classes<00:01:16.700> and<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:18.360> column<00:01:18.689> class

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
ID references classes and a column class

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.649 
ID references classes and a column class
ID<00:01:19.229> connects<00:01:20.070> with<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.340> other<00:01:20.430> :<00:01:20.850> class<00:01:21.090> ID<00:01:21.360> as

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
ID connects with the other : class ID as

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.050 
ID connects with the other : class ID as
you<00:01:22.259> can<00:01:22.409> see<00:01:22.590> here<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.460> hover<00:01:23.670> over<00:01:23.759> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
you can see here you hover over the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.870 
you can see here you hover over the
green<00:01:24.299> that's<00:01:25.020> how<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.530> connected<00:01:25.880> and

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
green that's how it is connected and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.370 
green that's how it is connected and
then<00:01:27.060> we<00:01:27.150> make<00:01:27.299> another<00:01:27.330> one<00:01:28.220> which<00:01:29.220> will<00:01:29.430> be<00:01:29.460> a

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
then we make another one which will be a

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.550 
then we make another one which will be a
student<00:01:31.380> ID

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.960 

dan<00:01:35.340> goes<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.030> students<00:01:36.540> where's<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:37.970> there

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
dan goes to students where's that there

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.399 
dan goes to students where's that there
we<00:01:39.060> go<00:01:39.240> student<00:01:40.110> ID<00:01:40.729> student<00:01:41.729> ID<00:01:42.170> now<00:01:43.170> they're

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
we go student ID student ID now they're

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.070 
we go student ID student ID now they're
connected<00:01:44.270> all<00:01:45.270> right<00:01:45.450> now<00:01:45.840> let<00:01:45.960> me<00:01:45.990> explain

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
connected all right now let me explain

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.930 
connected all right now let me explain
this<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.500> little<00:01:46.619> bit<00:01:46.830> because<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.610> don't<00:01:47.729> want

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
this a little bit because I don't want

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.180 
this a little bit because I don't want
to<00:01:48.000> confuse<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.390> guys<00:01:48.590> what<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.619> may<00:01:49.920> think

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
to confuse you guys what you may think

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.719 
to confuse you guys what you may think
to<00:01:50.310> do<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.940> go<00:01:51.390> up<00:01:51.420> here<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.100> put<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.340> students

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
to do is go up here and put the students

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.790 
to do is go up here and put the students
classes<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.420> they're<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.750> with<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.530> table

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
classes that they're in with this table

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.370 
classes that they're in with this table
now<00:01:56.580> that<00:01:56.610> could<00:01:56.880> work<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:58.049> don't<00:01:58.140> really

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
now that could work but I don't really

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.990 
now that could work but I don't really
like<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.560> idea<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.190> you<00:01:59.610> shouldn't<00:01:59.880> either

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
like that idea and you shouldn't either

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.590 
like that idea and you shouldn't either
because<00:02:00.570> then<00:02:01.580> that's<00:02:02.580> that's<00:02:03.240> not<00:02:03.360> really

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
because then that's that's not really

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.350 
because then that's that's not really
connected<00:02:04.110> with<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:05.250> students<00:02:05.670> information

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
connected with the students information

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.719 
connected with the students information
yes<00:02:06.899> asked<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.320> do<00:02:07.440> with<00:02:07.590> them<00:02:07.770> but<00:02:08.369> as<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.610> can

needed to change a class I don't have to

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.210 
needed to change a class I don't have to
mess<00:02:22.110> with<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.380> students<00:02:22.950> information

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.500 
that'll all stay put and I don't have to
worry<00:02:26.220> about<00:02:26.280> screwing<00:02:26.790> something<00:02:27.030> up<00:02:27.269> and

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
worry about screwing something up and

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.570 
worry about screwing something up and
then<00:02:28.019> having<00:02:28.319> big<00:02:28.500> problems<00:02:28.680> in<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.220> end<00:02:31.580> now

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
then having big problems in the end now

then having big problems in the end now
the<00:02:32.610> way<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.030> class<00:02:33.269> is<00:02:33.800> over<00:02:34.800> here<00:02:35.069> and<00:02:35.310> the

ID let's say class ID 67 has a subject
math<00:02:46.650> 101<00:02:47.400> oh<00:02:48.650> sorry<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.829> subject<00:02:50.190> would<00:02:50.250> be

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
math 101 oh sorry the subject would be

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.949 
math 101 oh sorry the subject would be
math<00:02:50.549> and<00:02:50.880> then<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.090> class<00:02:51.299> name<00:02:51.570> would<00:02:51.810> be

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
math and then the class name would be

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.009 
math and then the class name would be
like<00:02:52.200> advanced<00:02:53.190> algebra<00:02:53.510> class<00:02:54.510> number<00:02:54.959> would

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
like advanced algebra class number would

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.370 
like advanced algebra class number would
be<00:02:55.079> like<00:02:55.320> alg<00:02:56.250> 101<00:02:57.030> for<00:02:57.329> example<00:02:57.780> which

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
be like alg 101 for example which

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.750 
be like alg 101 for example which
wouldn't<00:02:58.709> be<00:02:58.769> advanced<00:02:59.220> algebra<00:02:59.370> would<00:02:59.670> be

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
wouldn't be advanced algebra would be

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.000 
wouldn't be advanced algebra would be
beginner<00:03:00.030> algebra<00:03:00.450> or<00:03:00.630> intro<00:03:01.019> but<00:03:01.650> anyways

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
beginner algebra or intro but anyways

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.949 
beginner algebra or intro but anyways
then<00:03:03.470> 67<00:03:04.470> will<00:03:04.739> be<00:03:04.950> over<00:03:05.220> here<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:06.840> will

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
then 67 will be over here and it will

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.289 
then 67 will be over here and it will
also<00:03:07.079> be<00:03:07.260> down<00:03:07.500> here<00:03:07.549> so<00:03:08.549> if<00:03:08.670> you<00:03:08.790> change<00:03:09.090> the

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
also be down here so if you change the

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.240 
also be down here so if you change the
class<00:03:09.540> title<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:11.510> algebra<00:03:12.510> for<00:03:13.260> beginners<00:03:13.950> and

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
class title to algebra for beginners and

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.830 
class title to algebra for beginners and
then<00:03:14.910> then<00:03:15.180> it<00:03:15.269> will<00:03:15.390> change<00:03:15.630> over<00:03:16.410> here<00:03:16.620> and

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.080 

okay<00:03:20.840> guys<00:03:21.019> I'm<00:03:21.349> fairly<00:03:22.010> confident<00:03:22.670> that<00:03:22.790> I've

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
this a little bit

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.970 
this a little bit
I<00:03:28.040> will<00:03:28.250> real<00:03:28.430> quickly<00:03:28.670> we<00:03:29.599> had<00:03:29.840> students<00:03:30.769> and

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
I will real quickly we had students and

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.039 
I will real quickly we had students and
they<00:03:31.730> all<00:03:31.849> and<00:03:32.030> then<00:03:32.329> all<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.720> student

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
they all and then all the student

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.289 
they all and then all the student
information<00:03:33.230> is<00:03:33.739> connected<00:03:34.250> right<00:03:34.280> here<00:03:34.670> it's

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
information is connected right here it's

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.380 
information is connected right here it's
pasted<00:03:35.989> right<00:03:36.140> here<00:03:36.319> now<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.099> books<00:03:37.430> that's<00:03:38.269> a

pasted right here now the books that's a
very<00:03:38.569> broad<00:03:38.840> thing<00:03:38.900> so<00:03:39.349> they<00:03:39.470> put<00:03:39.650> it<00:03:39.739> into<00:03:39.860> a

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
very broad thing so they put it into a

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.190 
very broad thing so they put it into a
new<00:03:40.159> table<00:03:40.430> and<00:03:40.819> a<00:03:41.269> book<00:03:41.450> has<00:03:41.629> a<00:03:41.659> publisher

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
new table and a book has a publisher

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.050 
new table and a book has a publisher
genre<00:03:43.069> an<00:03:43.730> author<00:03:44.000> and<00:03:44.480> a<00:03:45.290> topic<00:03:45.769> and<00:03:46.060> the

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
genre an author and a topic and the

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.000 
genre an author and a topic and the
reason<00:03:47.510> this<00:03:47.780> extra<00:03:48.200> table<00:03:48.560> is<00:03:48.620> here<00:03:48.859> is

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
reason this extra table is here is

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.069 
reason this extra table is here is
because<00:03:49.310> it<00:03:49.730> has<00:03:49.879> many<00:03:50.060> to<00:03:50.269> many<00:03:50.420> relationship

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
because it has many to many relationship

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.960 
because it has many to many relationship
and<00:03:51.319> to<00:03:51.829> remind<00:03:52.069> you<00:03:52.220> what<00:03:52.340> that<00:03:52.519> is<00:03:52.700> that

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
and to remind you what that is that

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.520 
and to remind you what that is that
means<00:03:53.090> a<00:03:53.420> book<00:03:53.840> can<00:03:54.019> have<00:03:54.079> more<00:03:54.290> than<00:03:54.379> one

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
means a book can have more than one

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.319 
means a book can have more than one
author<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:55.069> an<00:03:55.519> altar<00:03:55.790> can<00:03:55.970> write<00:03:56.120> more<00:03:56.269> than

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
author and an altar can write more than

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.000 
author and an altar can write more than
one<00:03:56.569> book<00:03:56.750> that's<00:03:57.620> why<00:03:57.739> we<00:03:57.829> have<00:03:57.920> this

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
one book that's why we have this

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.789 
one book that's why we have this
intermediary<00:03:58.579> table<00:03:59.090> to<00:03:59.659> list<00:04:00.109> which<00:04:00.500> author

connected over here

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.650 
connected over here
and<00:05:55.160> then<00:05:55.370> over<00:05:55.550> here<00:05:55.640> it'll<00:05:56.120> list<00:05:56.300> which

this<00:06:07.970> will<00:06:08.150> connect<00:06:08.780> over<00:06:08.990> here<00:06:09.380> so<00:06:10.070> let's<00:06:10.310> say

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
this will connect over here so let's say

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.040 
this will connect over here so let's say
there's<00:06:10.670> a<00:06:10.730> professor<00:06:11.210> that<00:06:11.240> doesn't<00:06:11.720> teach<00:06:11.900> a

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.930 
there's a professor that doesn't teach a
class<00:06:12.200> he's<00:06:13.010> still<00:06:13.220> in<00:06:13.340> the<00:06:13.430> professor's

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
class he's still in the professor's

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.940 
class he's still in the professor's
column<00:06:14.360> he's<00:06:14.870> just<00:06:15.080> not<00:06:15.230> in<00:06:15.380> the<00:06:15.470> professors

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
column he's just not in the professors

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.890 
column he's just not in the professors
in<00:06:16.100> their<00:06:16.220> classes<00:06:16.700> because<00:06:17.450> he<00:06:17.540> doesn't<00:06:17.750> have

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
in their classes because he doesn't have

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.220 
in their classes because he doesn't have
a<00:06:18.380> class<00:06:18.710> or<00:06:19.450> you<00:06:20.450> could<00:06:20.600> put<00:06:20.750> him<00:06:20.870> in<00:06:20.990> here

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.230 
a class or you could put him in here

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.580 
a class or you could put him in here
with<00:06:21.260> a<00:06:21.440> normal<00:06:22.010> class<00:06:22.280> so<00:06:23.180> that<00:06:23.960> way<00:06:24.140> you<00:06:24.200> know

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
with a normal class so that way you know

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.460 
with a normal class so that way you know
he's<00:06:24.830> still<00:06:25.640> available<00:06:26.180> for<00:06:26.210> teaching<00:06:26.870> but<00:06:27.410> he

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:27.470 
he's still available for teaching but he

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.110 
he's still available for teaching but he
doesn't<00:06:27.830> necessarily<00:06:27.920> have<00:06:28.490> a<00:06:28.520> class<00:06:28.820> yet

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
doesn't necessarily have a class yet

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.930 
doesn't necessarily have a class yet
same<00:06:29.960> for<00:06:30.380> classes<00:06:30.920> if<00:06:31.160> a<00:06:31.280> class<00:06:31.490> does<00:06:31.760> not

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
same for classes if a class does not

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:32.660 
same for classes if a class does not
have<00:06:32.180> a<00:06:32.210> professor

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:32.670 
have a professor

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.540 
have a professor
and<00:06:33.180> then<00:06:33.990> the<00:06:34.050> students<00:06:34.500> and<00:06:34.680> their<00:06:35.130> classes

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
and then the students and their classes

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.490 
and then the students and their classes
is<00:06:35.760> connected<00:06:36.180> up<00:06:36.330> here<00:06:36.570> to<00:06:36.810> the<00:06:36.900> student<00:06:37.260> ID

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
is connected up here to the student ID

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.820 
is connected up here to the student ID
we<00:06:38.250> do<00:06:38.370> not<00:06:38.460> store<00:06:38.760> this<00:06:38.940> information<00:06:39.120> up<00:06:39.630> here

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.830 
we do not store this information up here

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.100 
we do not store this information up here
because<00:06:40.830> it<00:06:41.610> is<00:06:41.790> not<00:06:42.120> related<00:06:42.330> to<00:06:42.630> the<00:06:42.810> student

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
because it is not related to the student

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.720 
because it is not related to the student
information<00:06:43.230> it's<00:06:44.010> related<00:06:44.460> to<00:06:44.580> their

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:44.730 
information it's related to their

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:49.310 
information it's related to their
classes<00:06:45.030> and<00:06:45.890> then<00:06:46.890> classes<00:06:47.550> I<00:06:47.900> said<00:06:48.900> classes

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
classes and then classes I said classes

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.070 
classes and then classes I said classes
classes<00:06:49.950> so<00:06:50.310> many<00:06:50.520> times<00:06:50.760> right<00:06:51.000> then<00:06:52.430> classes

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 
classes so many times right then classes

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.590 
classes so many times right then classes
it's<00:06:55.080> connected<00:06:55.650> over<00:06:55.770> here<00:06:56.160> by<00:06:57.060> connecting

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:57.600 
it's connected over here by connecting

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.290 
it's connected over here by connecting
to<00:06:57.930> the<00:06:58.050> student<00:06:58.470> ID<00:06:58.680> so<00:06:59.460> it<00:06:59.490> lists<00:06:59.820> what

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 
to the student ID so it lists what

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.780 
to the student ID so it lists what
classes<00:07:00.840> are<00:07:01.080> connected<00:07:01.980> to<00:07:02.070> what<00:07:02.250> student<00:07:02.640> ID

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:02.790 
classes are connected to what student ID

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:07.220 
classes are connected to what student ID
so<00:07:03.420> a<00:07:03.450> student<00:07:03.780> let's<00:07:04.530> say<00:07:04.680> a<00:07:04.710> class<00:07:04.980> ID<00:07:06.050> 67<00:07:07.050> as

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:07.230 
so a student let's say a class ID 67 as

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.950 
so a student let's say a class ID 67 as
said<00:07:07.470> earlier<00:07:07.790> had<00:07:08.790> 30<00:07:09.180> students<00:07:09.660> in<00:07:09.720> here

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 
said earlier had 30 students in here

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.680 
said earlier had 30 students in here
class<00:07:10.590> ID<00:07:10.890> would<00:07:11.280> be<00:07:11.400> listed<00:07:11.580> 30<00:07:11.970> times<00:07:12.300> and

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:12.690 
class ID would be listed 30 times and

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.530 
class ID would be listed 30 times and
the<00:07:13.080> student<00:07:13.440> ID<00:07:13.560> would<00:07:13.800> be<00:07:13.920> listed<00:07:14.360> for<00:07:15.360> each

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:15.540 
the student ID would be listed for each

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.680 
the student ID would be listed for each
student<00:07:15.810> and<00:07:16.700> this<00:07:17.700> is<00:07:17.880> just<00:07:18.090> a<00:07:18.180> foreign<00:07:18.480> key

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:18.690 
student and this is just a foreign key

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.690 
student and this is just a foreign key
to<00:07:19.140> this<00:07:19.320> so<00:07:19.650> it's<00:07:19.830> technically<00:07:20.220> only<00:07:20.490> one

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:20.700 
to this so it's technically only one

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.480 
to this so it's technically only one
entry<00:07:21.180> of<00:07:21.360> a<00:07:22.080> class<00:07:22.350> that<00:07:23.010> way<00:07:23.160> we<00:07:23.310> don't

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:23.490 
entry of a class that way we don't

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.830 
entry of a class that way we don't
actually<00:07:23.670> have<00:07:23.910> the<00:07:24.150> name<00:07:24.360> of<00:07:24.390> the<00:07:24.570> class

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 
actually have the name of the class

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.410 
actually have the name of the class
we're<00:07:25.710> in<00:07:25.860> 30<00:07:26.280> times<00:07:26.610> if<00:07:26.910> we<00:07:27.150> need<00:07:27.270> to<00:07:27.300> change

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:27.420 
we're in 30 times if we need to change

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.660 
we're in 30 times if we need to change
it<00:07:27.750> we<00:07:27.840> can<00:07:27.870> just<00:07:27.990> change<00:07:28.290> this<00:07:28.680> rather<00:07:29.520> than

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:29.670 
it we can just change this rather than

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.240 
it we can just change this rather than
changing<00:07:30.240> this<00:07:30.450> so<00:07:31.380> that's<00:07:31.560> a<00:07:31.650> quick<00:07:31.830> sum<00:07:32.100> up

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:32.250 
changing this so that's a quick sum up

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.280 
changing this so that's a quick sum up
and<00:07:32.520> in<00:07:33.090> the<00:07:33.360> next<00:07:33.600> video<00:07:33.840> I'll<00:07:34.050> be<00:07:34.080> teaching
