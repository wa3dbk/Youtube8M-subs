don't even know where the record button
is<00:00:17.190> yet<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.760> will<00:00:17.910> figure<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.390> out<00:00:19.670> basically

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
is yet you will figure it out basically

is yet you will figure it out basically
that's<00:00:20.760> my<00:00:20.939> way<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.119> saying<00:00:21.390> get<00:00:22.320> out<00:00:22.560> there

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
that's my way of saying get out there

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.189 
that's my way of saying get out there
and<00:00:23.279> shoot<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.119> by<00:00:24.390> far<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.869> best
