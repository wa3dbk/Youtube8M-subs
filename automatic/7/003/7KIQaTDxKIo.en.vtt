00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
it was nervous in a big fight into the

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.260

base<00:00:26.950> of<00:00:27.130> the<00:00:27.220> climb<00:00:27.490> so<00:00:27.790> I<00:00:27.820> was<00:00:27.970> already

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
base of the climb so I was already

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.940 
base of the climb so I was already
pretty<00:00:28.420> much<00:00:28.630> full<00:00:28.869> gas<00:00:29.080> before<00:00:29.349> we<00:00:29.619> got<00:00:29.770> to

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
me being in that group it was also a

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.479 
me being in that group it was also a
benefit<00:00:49.480> for<00:00:49.690> Cadel<00:00:50.019> because<00:00:50.470> if<00:00:50.620> because<00:00:51.370> the

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
benefit for Cadel because if because the

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.810 
benefit for Cadel because if because the
cars<00:00:51.729> were<00:00:52.030> had<00:00:52.210> a<00:00:52.239> barrage<00:00:52.600> and<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.699> if

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
cars were had a barrage and so if

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.640 
cars were had a barrage and so if
something<00:00:55.089> happened<00:00:55.420> to<00:00:55.479> him<00:00:55.600> up<00:00:55.780> there<00:00:56.050> I<00:00:56.320> was

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
something happened to him up there I was

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.700 
something happened to him up there I was
there<00:00:56.830> only<00:00:57.010> at<00:00:57.360> 30<00:00:58.360> seconds<00:00:58.780> back<00:00:58.989> to<00:00:59.559> where

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
there only at 30 seconds back to where

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.340 
there only at 30 seconds back to where
he<00:00:59.940> could<00:01:00.940> have<00:01:01.030> limited<00:01:01.629> the<00:01:01.780> damage<00:01:01.809> if

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
he could have limited the damage if

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.820 
he could have limited the damage if
something<00:01:03.070> bad<00:01:03.220> happened<00:01:04.019> over<00:01:05.019> the<00:01:05.500> next<00:01:05.710> few

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
learned that it was something I can

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.700 
learned that it was something I can
handle<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:28.539> it's<00:01:28.689> something<00:01:29.020> I<00:01:29.109> can<00:01:29.289> do<00:01:29.469> and

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
it's not something that I should be

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:37.109 
it's not something that I should be
intimidated<00:01:32.729> from<00:01:33.729> and<00:01:34.000> then<00:01:34.420> I<00:01:35.429> mean<00:01:36.429> I<00:01:36.460> can't

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
intimidated from and then I mean I can't

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.029 
intimidated from and then I mean I can't
