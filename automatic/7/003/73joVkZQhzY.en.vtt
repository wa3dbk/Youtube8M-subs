for<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.449> first<00:01:00.629> smoke<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.530> get<00:01:01.710> on<00:01:01.920> a

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
for the first smoke you have to get on a

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.759 
for the first smoke you have to get on a
long<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.000> just<00:01:03.570> get<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.110> don't<00:01:04.559> be<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
long and just get it this don't be the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.580 
long and just get it this don't be the
right<00:01:05.010> here<00:01:05.250> roughly<00:01:05.729> at<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.150> edge<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:07.380> then

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
right here roughly at this edge and then

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.219 
right here roughly at this edge and then
you<00:01:08.070> have<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.430> aim<00:01:08.640> at<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.659> point<00:01:09.990> right<00:01:10.170> here

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
you have to aim at this point right here

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.550 
you have to aim at this point right here
between<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:11.040> pole<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.840> this<00:01:12.840> power<00:01:13.229> right

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
between this pole and this power right

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.390 
between this pole and this power right
here<00:01:13.909> take<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.210> edge<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.020> align<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:17.220> with

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
here take this edge and align it with

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.990 
here take this edge and align it with
the<00:01:17.610> pole<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.240> just<00:01:18.840> drop<00:01:19.290> small<00:01:19.850> after<00:01:20.850> that

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the pole and just drop small after that

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.090 
the pole and just drop small after that
the<00:01:21.119> front<00:01:21.420> smoke<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.020> box<00:01:22.200> office<00:01:22.409> box<00:01:22.799> and

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
the front smoke the box office box and

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.450 
the front smoke the box office box and
it<00:01:23.549> will<00:01:23.729> land<00:01:24.689> right<00:01:25.020> here<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.979> from<00:01:26.220> this

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
it will land right here and from this

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.060 
it will land right here and from this
side<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:27.420> can't<00:01:27.689> look<00:01:27.990> through<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.829> smoke

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
side you can't look through the smoke

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.580 
side you can't look through the smoke
from<00:01:29.250> any<00:01:29.460> sides<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:30.030> just<00:01:30.329> locks<00:01:30.990> off<00:01:31.259> this

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
from any sides it just locks off this

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.440 
from any sides it just locks off this
passage<00:01:32.009> right<00:01:32.250> here<00:01:32.430> perfectly

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
passage right here perfectly

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.980 
passage right here perfectly
so<00:01:33.899> that's<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.229> first<00:01:34.409> small<00:01:35.570> for<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.659> second

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
so that's the first small for the second

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.840 
so that's the first small for the second
smoke<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.500> have<00:01:37.649> to<00:01:37.799> get<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.399> position

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
smoke you have to get in this position

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.899 
smoke you have to get in this position
right<00:01:38.969> here<00:01:39.030> on<00:01:39.539> a<00:01:40.350> short<00:01:40.740> that's<00:01:41.399> what<00:01:41.610> i<00:01:41.640> call

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
right here on a short that's what i call

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.870 
right here on a short that's what i call
it<00:01:42.119> or<00:01:42.270> next<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.259> toilets<00:01:43.770> have<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.729> get

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
it or next to the toilets have to get

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.910 
it or next to the toilets have to get
into<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.329> corner<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:47.030> just<00:01:48.030> aim<00:01:48.329> between

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
into this corner and just aim between

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.410 
into this corner and just aim between
those<00:01:49.920> two<00:01:50.750> grass<00:01:52.610> straws<00:01:53.610> or<00:01:53.850> whatever<00:01:54.210> this

those two grass straws or whatever this

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.950 
those two grass straws or whatever this
is<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:55.350> between<00:01:55.729> this<00:01:56.729> edge<00:01:57.149> right<00:01:57.179> here<00:01:57.509> and

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
is so between this edge right here and

yourself<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.880> pretty<00:02:09.119> much<00:02:09.209> already<00:02:09.750> know

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
yourself you pretty much already know

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.410 
yourself you pretty much already know
how<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.709> throw<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.849> have<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.150> align

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
how to throw it so you have to align

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.360 
how to throw it so you have to align
those<00:02:12.690> like<00:02:13.260> again<00:02:13.590> like<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.890> poles<00:02:14.130> in<00:02:14.340> the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
those like again like the poles in the

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.830 
those like again like the poles in the
last<00:02:14.610> smoke<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.239> just<00:02:15.959> release<00:02:16.709> it<00:02:16.769> Wow<00:02:17.840> after

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
last smoke and just release it Wow after

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.890 
last smoke and just release it Wow after
that<00:02:19.519> small<00:02:20.519> robots<00:02:21.030> off<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.329> ground<00:02:21.599> and

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
that small robots off the ground and

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.339 
that small robots off the ground and
land<00:02:22.739> right<00:02:22.860> here<00:02:23.040> in<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.519> middle<00:02:24.019> and<00:02:25.019> again

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
land right here in the middle and again

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.380 
land right here in the middle and again
both<00:02:26.040> sides<00:02:26.340> are<00:02:26.610> cut<00:02:27.150> off<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:29.640> yeah<00:02:30.120> you

both sides are cut off and yeah you

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.610 
both sides are cut off and yeah you
can't<00:02:30.599> see<00:02:30.750> anything<00:02:30.989> if<00:02:31.410> you're<00:02:31.590> a

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
have to pair it with other smoke so

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.770 
have to pair it with other smoke so

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
to do this i also have a little monitor

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.949 
to do this i also have a little monitor
for<00:03:10.859> you<00:03:10.950> so<00:03:11.880> for<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.209> monitor<00:03:12.389> what<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:12.870> have

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
for you so for the monitor what you have

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.569 
for you so for the monitor what you have
to<00:03:13.079> do<00:03:13.230> is<00:03:13.470> get<00:03:13.769> on<00:03:13.920> this<00:03:14.010> bench<00:03:14.280> right<00:03:14.549> here

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
to do is get on this bench right here

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.819 
to do is get on this bench right here
align<00:03:15.450> yourself<00:03:15.870> with<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.290> edge<00:03:16.440> of<00:03:16.650> the

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
align yourself with the edge of the

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.740 
align yourself with the edge of the
bench<00:03:16.980> which<00:03:17.549> is<00:03:17.700> roughly<00:03:18.060> like<00:03:18.269> that<00:03:18.510> and

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
bench which is roughly like that and

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.259 
bench which is roughly like that and
then<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.650> have<00:03:19.829> to<00:03:19.859> aim<00:03:20.130> it<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:20.970> edge<00:03:21.239> here

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
then you have to aim it this edge here

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.080 
then you have to aim it this edge here
of<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.930> building<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.410> this<00:03:23.370> paul<00:03:23.700> connect

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
of the building and this paul connect

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.690 
of the building and this paul connect
these<00:03:24.269> two<00:03:24.510> like<00:03:25.290> this<00:03:25.530> maybe<00:03:26.310> get<00:03:26.489> a<00:03:26.519> bit

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
these two like this maybe get a bit

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.780 
these two like this maybe get a bit
lower<00:03:26.970> so<00:03:27.389> maybe<00:03:27.599> from<00:03:28.069> there<00:03:29.069> from<00:03:29.220> here<00:03:29.549> you

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
lower so maybe from there from here you

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.270 
lower so maybe from there from here you
see<00:03:30.030> I'm<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.209> bit<00:03:30.419> on<00:03:30.630> on<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.109> pole<00:03:31.319> and<00:03:31.560> then

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
see I'm a bit on on the pole and then

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.270 
see I'm a bit on on the pole and then
put<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.060> building<00:03:33.450> like<00:03:33.660> this<00:03:33.870> are<00:03:34.769> just

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
put a building like this are just

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.630 
put a building like this are just
release<00:03:35.579> it<00:03:35.609> and<00:03:36.419> then

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
release it and then

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.070 
release it and then
and<00:03:38.980> when<00:03:39.980> someone<00:03:40.310> is<00:03:40.430> standing<00:03:40.580> in<00:03:40.790> here<00:03:41.150> it

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
and when someone is standing in here it

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.150 
and when someone is standing in here it
will<00:03:42.260> just<00:03:42.290> burn<00:03:43.220> so<00:03:44.120> that's<00:03:44.300> pretty<00:03:44.690> useful

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
will just burn so that's pretty useful

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.580 
will just burn so that's pretty useful
Molotov<00:03:46.160> for<00:03:46.670> a<00:03:46.700> leaseback<00:03:47.209> right<00:03:47.630> here<00:03:47.840> then

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590
