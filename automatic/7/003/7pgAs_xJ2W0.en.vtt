00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
a month's worth and my first advice is

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.389 
a month's worth and my first advice is
to<00:00:34.649> throw<00:00:34.890> these<00:00:35.070> things<00:00:35.430> out<00:00:35.700> these<00:00:36.059> are<00:00:36.380> hard

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
to throw these things out these are hard

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.060 
to throw these things out these are hard
plastic<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:39.020> not<00:00:40.020> only<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.530> they're<00:00:40.860> very

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
plastic and not only that they're very

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.160 
plastic and not only that they're very
wide<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.879> when<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.239> put<00:00:42.420> on<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.629> Latisse<00:00:42.989> you

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
wide and when you put on the Latisse you

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.750 
wide and when you put on the Latisse you
want<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> get<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.649> as<00:00:43.770> close<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.309> eye<00:00:44.399> line

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
want to get it as close to the eye line

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.360 
want to get it as close to the eye line
as<00:00:44.910> possible<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:46.440> don't<00:00:46.559> think<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.129> these

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
as possible and I don't think that these

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.790 
as possible and I don't think that these
brushes<00:00:48.270> work<00:00:48.629> very<00:00:48.930> well<00:00:48.989> for<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:49.770> I

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
brushes work very well for that so I

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.560 
brushes work very well for that so I
usually<00:00:50.190> just<00:00:50.579> give<00:00:50.730> them<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.940> my<00:00:51.059> kids<00:00:51.300> and

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
usually just give them to my kids and

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.840 
usually just give them to my kids and
they<00:00:51.780> use<00:00:51.960> them<00:00:52.140> for<00:00:52.379> watercolors<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.250> they

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
they use them for watercolors and they

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.720 
they use them for watercolors and they
work<00:00:54.030> great<00:00:54.320> what<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.350> recommend<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.309> taking

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
work great what I recommend is taking

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.360 
work great what I recommend is taking
