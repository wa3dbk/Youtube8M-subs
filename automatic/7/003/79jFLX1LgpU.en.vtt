00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.429
 Hey guys, what am I doing here? 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.330
 start and welcome to a new one 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.220
 youtube video 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.619
 today there is something completely different what 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.010
 to see it with me otherwise 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.779
 there is a review or a1 conclusion 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.720
 video about the new weapons collaviti 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.869
 gores the ripper yes here you can see the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.440
 rapper more and more games that always 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.230
 with underflow and with the muzzle fire 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.840
 damper ever seen there are 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.780
 no aiming device for no 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.300
 the weapon and here as a very cool 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.789
 weapon already makes fun with him 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.100
 play a little bit of variety and 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.300
 Camouflage is like any other 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.260
 we'll see the same ones here now 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.489
 few clips as I play with the weapon 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.680
 Do not be surprised about my naming me 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.170
 have not gambled for a long time like that 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.630
 Most of the people in the list have me too 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.320
 noticed 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:15.360
 so most of you have noticed 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.880
 because you can change direction 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.280
 once here in these machine pistols 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.909
 mode and then on a storm rifle 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.939
 Mode and how the horse looks like 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.650
 is quite useful what more 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.689
 special so I have something in advance 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.439
 never seen here once fully in 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:39.540
 stories directly from the set not on 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:41.640
 ass and he therefore was here once 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.159
 actually quite good for the kids 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.740
 I think the weapon reminds a lot 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.380
 strong to the pdw 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.450
 yes, but I'll come to that first 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.610
 again 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.000
 and here is a really cool weapon 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.820
 only for the season pass owner 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.590
 available as far as I know and the 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.820
 Weapon is yes I would say for 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.179
 So perfect for the middle distance 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.550
 with the machine pistol tower or 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.099
 Sometimes you can also add something to the mode 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.010
 mean distance tear traffic my 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:21.750
 is driving slow motion as the visor from 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:25.680
 very cool and he already makes something 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:29.130
 for the eye and here we get one more 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.650
 away and another one 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.420
 but the weapon is not the one now 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.030
 absolute burner 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.340
 The weapon is not great op 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.660
 of course better weapons but it does 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.900
 pretty much fun so the watch hindered 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.519
 me as I said very strongly to the pgw 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.640
 First draw completely reminds me 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:52.799
 the week very strong and once 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:56.489
 from the team from the handling so I think 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:59.280
 there is something to compare the 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.370
 weapon the pd i would rather say that 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.920
 the way between the submachine guns 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.609
 and the Sturmgewehr mode is like that 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.390
 Although no cap and so the weapon 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:14.459
 This is very good even if you look at yourself 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.109
 now you can adjust how you completely on 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.510
 seen this at the beginning 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:21.510
 machine guns in it and not at the 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.870
 storm guns and yes I would you 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.120
 recommend this weapon without silencer 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.489
 to play because with silencer 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:34.590
 makes you quite angry when you go along with it 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.690
 plays with the submachine gun tower 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.280
 so I will suggest you the 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.980
 now celebrate the damper on it or 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:46.530
 as something else but yes 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.720
 of course, as he said 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:55.680
 what a game type you are us 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:57.780
 I wanted to grab something quickly 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.180
 So that means I will be enough soon 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:04.650
 I mean the quick guy 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:08.820
 but with silencers we just 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.160
 see and here then without 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.930
 I think with muffler is the 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:21.230
 somehow hurt somehow really hurt 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:24.740
 less yes 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:28.370
 here once with the machine guns 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.350
 essay, there are also quite a lot of violent 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.530
 hit market I noticed as me 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:37.280
 rather play with the understanding with the 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.750
 assault rifle that her husband makes you 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.620
 somehow hurt more my opinion 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.530
 After is good for a short distance, too 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:49.240
 just as he intended over medium 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.860
 distance there he is a short one 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:58.490
 Distance of the machine is full set 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:05:03.040
 already cut away here and so here 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:06.410
 we'll see you nice again 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.760
 Here are these comparisons 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:12.350
 shooting trip if you pull and if you are 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.930
 once you use machine guns 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.870
 is a storm rifle mode and here 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.060
 degree yes in the assault rifle mode you notice 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.330
 also the difference between the two 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.640
 target the assault rifle mode layer 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.750
 slower and more precise and make mine 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:31.430
 opinion also more harm and im 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.650
 this is called machine gun mode 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.080
 on the contrary one does not shoot so fast 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.889
 precise in my opinion, too much 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.870
 more hit market 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.789
 We liked the storm rifle 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.669
 Rather, even if I like 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:48.509
 swiftly run away from everything 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:50.539
 Get here now for a long time 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:55.139
 distance, I still meet well 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:58.740
 yes mei naming is not 1a and that 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:03.330
 After so long , so almost me 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:06.990
 I can think of that is much better 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:09.029
 that means for the mode must change 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.150
 you count the right stick 

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:15.659
 ready then push in that is already 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:20.340
 Rifle mode and assault rifle aim the 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:22.229
 very high and yes if I do not aim 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.629
 and are just the right stick 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:27.300
 Rhine Bridge then knife I stop 

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:28.710
 that happens very often and what happens 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.710
 we noticed again is me 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.629
 sorry that I say so many monsters that 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.240
 I speak sooner than when 

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:37.830
 I become a professor too long 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.360
 no comments the power of total 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.939
 normal and here again purely 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.529
 valued by naming i hope i 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:45.419
 had liked the video if he gives 

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:47.849
 a thumb up or shadow 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:52.099
 comment would be really happy and 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:52.099
 Go on in the cold until next time 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.120
 come ready
