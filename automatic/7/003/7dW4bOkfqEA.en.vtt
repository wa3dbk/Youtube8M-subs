stability system and a lot of shoes

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.520 
stability system and a lot of shoes
because<00:01:40.619> they<00:01:41.159> do<00:01:41.220> couple<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.360> support<00:01:43.020> area

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
because they do couple that support area

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.710
