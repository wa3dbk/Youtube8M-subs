00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
 she is still unknown 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.680
 I went to Urca 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:15.409
 the saber in various types of feathers 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:19.050
 each with its specialized structure according to its function 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.890
 There are feathers that help to keep your temperature as 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.739
 feathers of ostriches 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:34.160
 they act as thermal insulation, or they reduce the heat exchange in which the 

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:37.270
 bird's body and the outer sock 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.220
 It's the same thing we want to do when we put a coat on a cold day. 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.130
 we are wanting to stay warm 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.130
 close to our body 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.080
 other feathers such as those of the peacock's tail marcio are well colored enclosing 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.510
 to attract this beginning 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.160
 in reproductive age these beautiful legs grow them but make a 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.640
 kind of ritual 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.940
 opening and shaking the tail feathers to the finep which then usually leaves 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.240
 that the martyr approaches it for reproduction 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.390
 the six-month feathers are often decorex erased 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.549
 probably to aid in camouflage avoiding attracting the attention of 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.549
 predators for their nests and their offspring 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.850
 notice that the various types of feather have some common feature all of them 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.220
 have a part that is inserted in the pj harvey because it is called heat 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.220
 omar hakim which is the central axis well there are 22 hundredths today each side of the 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.560
 radio 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.890
 feather parades of flying dialysis birds are often 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.800
 cause of air friction during flight 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.470
 usually the most external style vec is the one that suffers the most friction in May 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.590
 ransomed 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.750
 The adhesives are formed by a set of tents that 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.450
 barks on flying bird feathers beards building mills from small 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.600
 who keep their beards together this way of keeping the barbados together 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.410
 they create a resistance home quintÃ£o can not pass through the middle of the penalty 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.749
 know how hard it is to separate the beards focused on those same days 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:36.090
 the explanation for a fly is the third action intervention and 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.010
 reaction as maxi went into the air down with frosts 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:44.869
 more willingly up and so she can raise her hand 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:51.169
 images trying to jump the wings of the wings with force but could not 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:54.839
 take flight because the air is passing the referee this month 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.819
 so that scenes like this do not happen the traces of the boat that are 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.759
 imposed 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:04.949
 the feathers are very different 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:07.949
 but they are also remedies 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.329
 the contract for March the actress 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:12.220
 he has to have 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.459
 these life events 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.729
 but the very fierce image would not only accept flying 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.730
 but how they can be extended at the same time 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:27.559
 more than 90% of a sentence he had made for debate and that he had 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:30.059
 which is a very large protein 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:31.459
 keratin 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.299
 I speak very little 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.239
 but due to its cylindrical shape even though the loco remains the 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.509
 resistant 

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:41.429
 I'll show you that. 

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:43.399
 get a sheet of paper 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:46.559
 in victory and stop at its end with crepe tape 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.260
 now 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.260
 apply a force on the ends of the cylinder 

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:02.249
 realized that the paper does not give away easily 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:06.809
 this cylindrical shape helps maintain the city's exemption and resistance 

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:11.609
 we can know a little more about the sentence 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:16.299
 a very rich part of the bird world these living things are doing 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.759
 today 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:21.029
 in this
