00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:08.940
 It is Hi everyone out of the visit youtube 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:12.690
 This time the second collection of flags that may be usable in the search 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:17.340
 So I would like to deliver a cargo edition 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:22.800
 In the last raid side, it was only subtitles, but this time 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.580
 I will put in the voice , so I think that it will be a video that will be helpful than before 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.880
 Since we wish you please Regards 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:31.489
 Hmm 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:34.120
 However, please note that this is a flag specification that may be usable 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:39.129
 I because I mon or use 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:44.640
 First, in the fact that flags that might be available in the shell tree flag of the You're First, mean that 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.640
 I think whether it is a standard but I would like to introduce this 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:57.750
 So it is a plug that passes over the building on b side 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:01.050
 Well, it is a personal tip 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:07.550
 It is a forklift that appears on the screen right 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.550
 Do you feel like jumping and releasing just next to this ? 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.820
 Hmm 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:22.290
 Yes Well, you can also throw a similar flag from the looks once the other side, but personally 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.290
 I feel a little harder here 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:40.070
 Then it is the second, but I think that it is often used with the opening flag here 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:42.610
 It is said that it is not on the container but near the entrance of the stairs 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.610
 Will be 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:55.010
 First of all, it is the tip of this flag 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:02:00.320
 Like this, it throws from the container at the last moment of jumping out 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.980
 I'm throwing a flag, but it's how I'm going to fit it, but I'm on the reference date 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.680
 Is it 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.680
 I use this because just has to this arrow 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.680
 Hmm 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:22.629
 I'm using it as an opening flag for a while, but I'm using this for a while 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.629
 I don't see many people 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:32.620
 You have to wait for the opening in this position. 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.620
 We use in this plastic Buson basis 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:44.680
 Perhaps it's a flag to throw from here that's still on the orange container 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:50.410
 I think that is a standard , but I am not, and this way of way like this 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:53.660
 Eyeing users had thrown Tsu Well this little miss is when hit in Toka something smg 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:03:00.380
 It is a flag that can be used quite well 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:02.300
 It is a knack of this, but it is what I use as a rough guide. Display of this a 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:07.520
 What 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:11.950
 This indication is when you put the left side for a while and throw away 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.950
 I think that one does not fall to 21 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:26.580
 Yes Let me look at the perspective of the next frau But first enemy 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:28.780
 I would like to introduce a plug that defeats it like this on this forklift. 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:35.040
 I will 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.040
 Here is a flag to throw from the second floor of the office on the b side 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:42.819
 It is It is my b side of the office I take to create that advance the fastest but the offensive side cult 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:47.709
 is not it 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:50.519
 That came up with the store that can not be somehow It is applicable waiting at the forklift 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.519
 This flag 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:04:02.350
 Yes, it's a place as a bone, but it looks like this 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:02.350
 You will be in a position where you put your body too much and a little earlier from there 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:13.720
 It is right next how to match the throwing direction, but as you see 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.720
 I think that it will work well if you can align the crosshairs to this position 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:26.980
 Ah ah ah 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:29.340
 It is possible to Kill is the enemy It's just you're under this flag is guess I lift 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.340
 It is not 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:38.930
 If you say in this case what to do in this case and you can just tilt it down a little 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.930
 I think 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.669
 me 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:01.500
 Yes, let's try the fifth next here 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.500
 Please see from the perspective of the enemy first 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:14.440
 Yes, like this, it looks like an enemy in a thin area Trying to defeat it with a flag from an invisible position 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.440
 This flag is what I made 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:22.310
 Easy to understand and I am seen from directly above it is is this but I'm a standing position in the Yes 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:28.630
 I think 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:28.630
 I hope that you can stand in this position with this as a standard. 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:41.030
 I am standing on the Yes Esono place if you could throw just above it is this flag 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.030
 Explode in the right position 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.750
 The sixth in it is this kind of flag 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.810
 2 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:00.360
 However, it is this flag It is throwing from this place when saying where it was thrown from 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:14.819
 Yes, it is well but I become such orbit and measures the Hey Ju r Is I 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:16.469
 I'm using this flag Yes The theme of this flag is very important 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:22.400
 There is that it is 

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:22.400
 Please is that it does not fall momentum extra careful so as not to fall into the sea 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:29.720
 Yes, this video will be the last 7 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:38.590
 Here is where in the search where to say it was thrown from b 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:40.990
 It is from the place 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.990
 I'm throwing 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.990
 Hmm 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:55.340
 And this flag is I was one -on- one in defense time 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:07:00.890
 b is Once focused on the side of it man and target movie I is I like was heading to the installation to 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:03.700
 So at this time as a result of thinking that the enemy from the right side there is no Takazuko Takako this flag 

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.700
 I arrived 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:19.249
 Yes , it's a knack for this flag, but you got on the cardboard 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:24.529
 I think it will work well if you throw it towards the purpose of a 

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:28.610
 And so this flag has one more important thing, isn't it one? 

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:32.150
 It is something to throw after the tempo delay 

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:36.979
 It is this and hold it and throw it to pour 

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:42.129
 You can not send enough damage from the installation position . 

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:47.080
 So say the throw from delaying one tempo is very important 

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:53.319
 Yes Well many it, but this time we introduce a more month Do It is is also in addition to this 

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:58.589
 Because there is a flag, how about everyone also mention map, how is it until today the end 

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:58.589
 Thank you for watching and see you again next time
