00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.710 

the<00:02:34.390> way<00:02:35.370> but<00:02:36.370> she<00:02:36.400> can

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.770 

for<00:02:41.720> me<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.930> best<00:02:42.050> way<00:02:42.230> of<00:02:43.630> advancing<00:02:44.630> the

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
for me the best way of advancing the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.990 
for me the best way of advancing the
cause<00:02:44.960> of<00:02:45.020> veganism<00:02:45.710> is<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.610> treat<00:02:46.790> people

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000
