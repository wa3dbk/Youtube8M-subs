fairly quickly obviously not on par with

fairly quickly obviously not on par with
the<00:02:10.970> craziness<00:02:11.510> of<00:02:11.810> me<00:02:13.210> of<00:02:14.210> how<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.510> craziness

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
the craziness of me of how the craziness

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.310 
the craziness of me of how the craziness
of<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.830> premium<00:02:16.430> churchill<00:02:16.940> but<00:02:17.210> still<00:02:17.690> able

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
of the premium churchill but still able

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.690 
of the premium churchill but still able
to<00:02:18.560> dish<00:02:18.890> out<00:02:19.070> at<00:02:19.310> least<00:02:19.520> amount<00:02:19.790> of<00:02:19.910> damage

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.040 
to dish out at least amount of damage
now<00:02:22.700> unfortunately<00:02:23.030> I<00:02:23.330> thought<00:02:23.540> that<00:02:23.780> was<00:02:24.020> the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
now unfortunately I thought that was the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.040 
now unfortunately I thought that was the
key<00:02:24.440> of<00:02:24.500> e<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.150> wall<00:02:26.150> there<00:02:26.450> but<00:02:26.660> not<00:02:26.870> that

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
key of e to the wall there but not that

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.260 
key of e to the wall there but not that
was<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.320> QB<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.860> digging<00:02:28.460> off<00:02:28.610> stripping<00:02:29.150> off

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
was the QB to digging off stripping off

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.180 
was the QB to digging off stripping off
pretty<00:02:29.540> much<00:02:29.750> 600<00:02:30.350> of<00:02:30.440> my<00:02:30.560> hip<00:02:30.740> points<00:02:31.010> with<00:02:31.130> a

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
pretty much 600 of my hip points with a

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.850 
pretty much 600 of my hip points with a
shot<00:02:31.400> there<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:32.210> bit<00:02:32.570> of<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.810> shame<00:02:33.110> there<00:02:33.410> now

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
shot there so bit of a shame there now

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.230

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
and able to not necessarily ricochet but

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.860

just<00:02:57.830> not<00:02:58.070> get<00:02:58.370> penetrated<00:02:58.910> by<00:02:59.240> a<00:02:59.540> good

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
just not get penetrated by a good

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.510 
just not get penetrated by a good
majority<00:03:00.260> of<00:03:00.620> rams<00:03:03.100> finally<00:03:04.100> able<00:03:04.190> to<00:03:04.370> take

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
out that ability key of e 2 and I think

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.130 
out that ability key of e 2 and I think
the<00:03:07.340> other<00:03:07.490> Churchill<00:03:07.910> is<00:03:08.090> already<00:03:08.600> destroyed

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
the other Churchill is already destroyed

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.630 
the other Churchill is already destroyed
so<00:03:11.020> just<00:03:12.020> going<00:03:12.200> to<00:03:12.290> move<00:03:12.440> forward<00:03:12.830> now<00:03:13.160> this

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
so just going to move forward now this

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.190 
so just going to move forward now this
wasn't<00:03:13.820> a<00:03:13.940> particularly<00:03:14.150> fantastic<00:03:14.420> gear<00:03:14.960> but

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
wasn't a particularly fantastic gear but

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.860 
wasn't a particularly fantastic gear but
some<00:03:15.710> reason<00:03:16.100> I<00:03:16.220> played<00:03:16.820> probably<00:03:17.270> close<00:03:17.840> to

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
some reason I played probably close to

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.310 
some reason I played probably close to
50<00:03:18.170> kids<00:03:18.650> yesterday<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.580> not<00:03:20.360> a<00:03:20.420> single<00:03:20.810> one

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.020 
of them recorded so all of the recording
starts<00:03:24.890> set<00:03:25.070> aside<00:03:25.400> to<00:03:25.640> do<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.880> first

Churchill<00:04:04.580> but<00:04:05.580> then<00:04:05.700> again<00:04:05.820> it<00:04:06.090> is<00:04:06.300> one<00:04:06.660> T<00:04:06.930> or

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
Churchill but then again it is one T or

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.100 
Churchill but then again it is one T or
higher<00:04:07.260> than<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:08.160> premium<00:04:08.520> Churchill<00:04:09.110> so

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
higher than the premium Churchill so

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.390 
higher than the premium Churchill so
stack<00:04:10.470> up<00:04:10.620> next<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:10.980> each<00:04:11.040> other<00:04:11.190> obviously

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
stack up next to each other obviously

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.100 
stack up next to each other obviously
this<00:04:11.730> one<00:04:11.940> is<00:04:12.120> superior<00:04:12.510> but<00:04:12.840> like<00:04:12.930> I<00:04:13.050> said

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
this one is superior but like I said

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.050 
this one is superior but like I said
that's<00:04:13.530> just<00:04:13.740> because<00:04:13.950> this<00:04:14.280> is<00:04:14.400> probably<00:04:14.640> it

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
that's just because this is probably it

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.810 
that's just because this is probably it
all<00:04:15.450> tier<00:04:15.780> above<00:04:16.079> it<00:04:16.350> so<00:04:16.560> what<00:04:17.250> I<00:04:17.280> go<00:04:17.579> for<00:04:17.760> this

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
all tier above it so what I go for this

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.849 
all tier above it so what I go for this
tank<00:04:18.060> yes<00:04:18.329> I<00:04:18.480> definitely<00:04:18.810> would<00:04:19.290> and<00:04:19.470> if<00:04:19.709> you

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
tank yes I definitely would and if you

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.259 
tank yes I definitely would and if you
think<00:04:19.890> about<00:04:20.190> going<00:04:20.310> down<00:04:20.640> the<00:04:20.760> British<00:04:21.030> tank

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
think about going down the British tank

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.390 
think about going down the British tank
Tariq<00:04:21.570> then<00:04:22.350> I<00:04:22.620> would<00:04:22.950> definitely<00:04:23.160> recommend

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
Tariq then I would definitely recommend

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.310 
Tariq then I would definitely recommend
going<00:04:24.360> as<00:04:25.140> far<00:04:25.410> as<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:26.220> Churchill<00:04:27.120> mark<00:04:27.450> 7<00:04:27.780> so

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
going as far as the Churchill mark 7 so

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.930 
going as far as the Churchill mark 7 so
