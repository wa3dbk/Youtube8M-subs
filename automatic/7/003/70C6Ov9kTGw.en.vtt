00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.980
 Hey ! Hello, YouTube, my name is Patrick and I'm a director and an infographer for our YouTube channel of the Montreal SPCA 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.460
 I'm Amelie, I'm responsible for content and scripting for our web capsules. 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.360
 And we are here today to talk about our brand new contest! 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.040
 Yes, but not right now, we are talking about it immediately after this video so stayed ours! 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.820
 Fan of molosses? I introduce you LENNY! 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.380
 Lenny is a Pero of Presa Canario crossed about 11 months. 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.380
 Still a puppy at heart, Lenny is a great player and gets on well with other dogs. 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.780
 Lenny can live in an apartment, 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.160
 but is not recommended for a family with young children, 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.280
 because Lenny still has trouble controlling her big legs at times! 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.000
 Lenny is looking for an experienced family with large dogs 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.900
 who will not be impressed either by his strength or his loud voice 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.420
 and who is aware that he will have an appetite once adult! 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.820
 If you think you are the perfect family for Lenny or know this family? 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.180
 You can click on the link in the description of this video or share it on social networks. 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.380
 And as always, remember that you may not change the world, 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.360
 but maybe you could change Lenny's world, forever! 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.040
 Thank you, see you soon. 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.180
 Hello again, YouTube, and thank you for watching our video on YouTube. 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.160
 We are back to tell you about our brand new contest. 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.480
 Our brand new contest, all fresh, all beautiful and just for you. This month if you have a chance to win, a clicker 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.520
 Like this one. And tell me Amelie, what can a clicker serve? 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.780
 It is a tool used in training to improve or accelerate the learning of our pets. 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.160
 You can use it if you have a cat, a dog, or even a bird. 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.140
 Even a bird? But it's fantastic! But how can I enter the contest? 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.060
 It's very simple you just have to subscribe to our YouTube channel and leave a comment at the bottom of one of our videos this month though. 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.860
 We will shoot the winner and contact him ... 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.040
 Shoot the winner, haha 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.860
 We will choose the winner from all who left a comment 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.960
 and we will contact him thanks to the information of the profile that he will be created. 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.480
 You can then pick up your prize at the Montreal SPCA counter 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.300
 who will be at the reception desk, in your name obviously. 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.640
 And by going to the SPCA do not hesitate to come and say hello, come see our dogs who are in adoption 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.100
 or even if you are interested in getting more involved with the SPCA you can give your name to become a volunteer, 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.660
 it will always make us happy to have more people helping our animals. 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.680
