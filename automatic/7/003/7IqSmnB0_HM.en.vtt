mentioned and we have an article on our
site<00:00:14.880> how<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.240> use<00:00:15.719> XP<00:00:16.560> safely<00:00:17.220> there<00:00:17.430> are<00:00:17.580> ways

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
site how to use XP safely there are ways

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.700 
site how to use XP safely there are ways
to<00:00:17.850> do<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.270> it's<00:00:18.600> never<00:00:18.840> going<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.050> be<00:00:19.199> quite<00:00:19.500> as

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
to do it it's never going to be quite as

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.580 
to do it it's never going to be quite as
safe<00:00:19.920> as<00:00:20.570> using<00:00:21.570> an<00:00:21.660> up-to-date<00:00:21.930> operating

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
safe as using an up-to-date operating

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.640 
safe as using an up-to-date operating
system<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.880> problem<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.480> if<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.990> have<00:00:25.019> XP

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
system so the problem is if you have XP

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.140 
system so the problem is if you have XP
you<00:00:25.769> probably<00:00:26.039> have<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.220> pretty<00:00:26.460> old<00:00:26.699> machine

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
you probably have a pretty old machine

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.000 
you probably have a pretty old machine
it<00:00:27.300> could<00:00:27.689> be<00:00:27.810> as<00:00:27.900> old<00:00:28.080> as<00:00:28.199> 13<00:00:28.560> years<00:00:28.590> old

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
it could be as old as 13 years old

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.250 
it could be as old as 13 years old
that's<00:00:29.189> how<00:00:29.310> long<00:00:29.490> XP<00:00:29.849> has<00:00:29.970> been<00:00:30.090> around<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.510> a

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
that's how long XP has been around and a

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.020 
that's how long XP has been around and a
13-year<00:00:32.009> old<00:00:32.189> machine<00:00:32.579> isn't<00:00:32.759> going<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.940> be

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
13-year old machine isn't going to be

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.020 
13-year old machine isn't going to be
able<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.270> run<00:00:33.510> any<00:00:33.809> modern<00:00:34.649> operating<00:00:35.579> system

able to run any modern operating system

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.299 
able to run any modern operating system
I<00:00:36.960> might<00:00:37.350> have<00:00:37.469> enough<00:00:37.680> horsepower<00:00:38.010> to

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
I might have enough horsepower to

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.450 
I might have enough horsepower to
Windows<00:00:38.879> 8<00:00:39.030> actually<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.510> pretty<00:00:39.750> lightweight

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
Windows 8 actually is pretty lightweight

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.970 
Windows 8 actually is pretty lightweight
but<00:00:41.460> there<00:00:41.640> won't<00:00:41.820> be<00:00:42.170> software<00:00:43.170> drivers<00:00:43.739> for

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
but there won't be software drivers for

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.910 
but there won't be software drivers for
some<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.280> hardware<00:00:44.550> things<00:00:44.940> like<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.920> so

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
some of the hardware things like that so

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.470 
some of the hardware things like that so
what<00:00:47.309> are<00:00:47.460> what<00:00:47.730> are<00:00:47.789> your<00:00:47.940> options<00:00:48.090> well<00:00:48.390> you

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
what are what are your options well you

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.540 
what are what are your options well you
can<00:00:48.600> continue<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.989> run<00:00:49.140> XP<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:50.070> can<00:00:50.100> buy<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> new

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
can continue to run XP you can buy a new

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.369 
can continue to run XP you can buy a new
machine<00:00:51.000> or<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.539> could<00:00:51.719> put<00:00:51.930> another

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
machine or you could put another

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.110 
machine or you could put another
operating<00:00:52.949> system<00:00:53.039> on<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.640> computer<00:00:53.969> and

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
operating system on that computer and

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.319 
operating system on that computer and
that's<00:00:54.440> why<00:00:55.440> he<00:00:55.680> mentioned<00:00:56.039> Ubuntu<00:00:56.520> Ubuntu<00:00:56.550> is

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
that's why he mentioned Ubuntu Ubuntu is

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.840 
that's why he mentioned Ubuntu Ubuntu is
one<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.199> many<00:00:58.410> flavors<00:00:58.829> hundreds<00:00:59.699> of

one of many flavors hundreds of

different flavors of a free operating

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.810 
different flavors of a free operating
system<00:01:02.550> called<00:01:03.149> Linux<00:01:04.549> probably<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.670> makes

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
system called Linux probably that makes

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.340 
system called Linux probably that makes
people<00:01:06.119> nervous<00:01:06.240> when<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.570> say<00:01:06.720> it's<00:01:06.840> free<00:01:07.110> it's

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
people nervous when I say it's free it's

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.620 
people nervous when I say it's free it's
like<00:01:07.470> well<00:01:07.590> how<00:01:08.010> could<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.250> be<00:01:08.280> free<00:01:08.640> well<00:01:09.390> it's

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
like well how could it be free well it's

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.960 
like well how could it be free well it's
it's<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.260> part<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:10.890> movement<00:01:11.580> we<00:01:11.820> call

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
it's it's part of this movement we call

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.850 
it's it's part of this movement we call

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
and used by computer enthusiasts and so

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.480 
and used by computer enthusiasts and so
there's<00:04:33.570> all<00:04:33.720> you'll<00:04:34.650> use<00:04:34.860> Linux<00:04:35.220> for<00:04:35.340> a<00:04:35.400> while

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
there's all you'll use Linux for a while

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.650 
there's all you'll use Linux for a while
and<00:04:35.640> then<00:04:35.760> you'll<00:04:35.880> run<00:04:36.060> up<00:04:36.150> against<00:04:36.450> something

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
and then you'll run up against something

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.900 
and then you'll run up against something
that's<00:04:36.870> just<00:04:36.960> weird

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
that's just weird

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.400 
that's just weird
and<00:04:38.910> unlike<00:04:39.420> Windows<00:04:39.870> there's<00:04:40.020> so<00:04:40.110> few<00:04:40.140> people

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
and unlike Windows there's so few people

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.170 
and unlike Windows there's so few people
that<00:04:40.590> use<00:04:41.040> it<00:04:41.070> as<00:04:41.340> a<00:04:41.400> desktop<00:04:41.820> operating

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
that use it as a desktop operating

that use it as a desktop operating
system<00:04:42.750> there's<00:04:42.900> it's<00:04:43.590> sometimes<00:04:44.040> hard<00:04:44.250> to

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
system there's it's sometimes hard to

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.650 
system there's it's sometimes hard to
figure<00:04:44.640> out<00:04:44.790> how<00:04:44.910> to<00:04:44.940> get<00:04:45.180> around<00:04:45.480> these

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
figure out how to get around these

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.990 
figure out how to get around these
roadblocks<00:04:46.170> things<00:04:46.470> don't<00:04:46.770> work<00:04:46.980> right<00:04:47.310> I'll

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
roadblocks things don't work right I'll

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.360 
roadblocks things don't work right I'll
give<00:04:48.180> you<00:04:48.300> an<00:04:48.390> example<00:04:48.450> III<00:04:49.200> was<00:04:49.800> running<00:04:50.190> a

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
give you an example III was running a

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.120 
give you an example III was running a
version<00:04:50.760> of<00:04:50.850> Ubuntu<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:51.720> I<00:04:52.590> decided<00:04:52.890> to<00:04:53.010> use

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
version of Ubuntu and I decided to use

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.310 
version of Ubuntu and I decided to use
the<00:04:53.730> open-source<00:04:54.240> version<00:04:54.390> of<00:04:54.720> Google's

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
the open-source version of Google's

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.050 
the open-source version of Google's
Chrome<00:04:55.560> browsers<00:04:55.980> called<00:04:56.160> chromium<00:04:56.670> on<00:04:56.820> it

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
Chrome browsers called chromium on it

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.360 
Chrome browsers called chromium on it
and<00:04:57.150> then<00:04:57.780> I<00:04:57.900> updated<00:04:58.410> it<00:04:58.620> one<00:04:58.830> to<00:04:59.010> got<00:04:59.250> the

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
and then I updated it one to got the

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.980 
and then I updated it one to got the
newest<00:04:59.640> version<00:05:00.030> and<00:05:00.150> chromium<00:05:00.660> stopped

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
newest version and chromium stopped

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.330 
newest version and chromium stopped
working<00:05:01.730> just<00:05:02.730> wouldn't<00:05:02.970> wouldn't<00:05:03.300> run<00:05:03.770> now<00:05:04.770> I

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
working just wouldn't wouldn't run now I

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.340 
working just wouldn't wouldn't run now I
was<00:05:05.910> able<00:05:06.060> to<00:05:06.210> figure<00:05:06.660> out<00:05:06.810> what<00:05:06.990> was<00:05:07.140> wrong

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
was able to figure out what was wrong

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.560 
was able to figure out what was wrong
and<00:05:07.560> it<00:05:07.650> was<00:05:07.740> a<00:05:07.770> library<00:05:08.400> this<00:05:08.850> this<00:05:09.270> is<00:05:09.420> the

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
and it was a library this this is the

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.000 
and it was a library this this is the
kind<00:05:09.960> of<00:05:10.110> thing<00:05:10.230> that<00:05:10.260> happens<00:05:10.620> with<00:05:10.740> Linux

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
kind of thing that happens with Linux

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.970 
kind of thing that happens with Linux
there<00:05:11.580> was<00:05:11.730> a<00:05:11.760> library<00:05:12.120> that<00:05:13.020> chromium<00:05:13.320> needed

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
there was a library that chromium needed

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.590 
there was a library that chromium needed
remember<00:05:14.430> has<00:05:14.520> talked<00:05:14.640> about<00:05:14.790> those<00:05:14.940> dll's

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
remember has talked about those dll's

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.390 
remember has talked about those dll's
Linux<00:05:15.960> has<00:05:16.080> him<00:05:16.260> too<00:05:16.410> there<00:05:17.010> was<00:05:17.070> a<00:05:17.130> library

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
Linux has him too there was a library

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.670 
Linux has him too there was a library
that<00:05:17.700> chromium<00:05:18.030> needed<00:05:18.420> that<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:19.170> people<00:05:19.560> who

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
that chromium needed that the people who

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.170 
that chromium needed that the people who
make<00:05:19.860> a<00:05:19.890> bunch<00:05:20.160> of<00:05:20.220> decided<00:05:20.610> didn't<00:05:20.880> really

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
make a bunch of decided didn't really

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.670 
make a bunch of decided didn't really
need<00:05:21.330> to<00:05:21.420> be<00:05:21.510> included<00:05:21.900> in<00:05:21.960> the<00:05:22.080> new<00:05:22.260> version

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
need to be included in the new version

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.050 
need to be included in the new version
so<00:05:22.890> they<00:05:23.010> took<00:05:23.130> it<00:05:23.220> off<00:05:25.160> so<00:05:26.160> I<00:05:26.190> had<00:05:26.460> to<00:05:26.580> find<00:05:26.880> the

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
so they took it off so I had to find the

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.360

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
general recommendation is that Ubuntu is

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
great way for kids to learn how Linux

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.440

and UNIX based operating systems work

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.170 
and UNIX based operating systems work
the<00:05:52.320> these<00:05:52.890> are<00:05:52.980> the<00:05:53.070> fundamental<00:05:53.670> workhorse

it<00:07:09.110> probably<00:07:10.110> not<00:07:10.229> a<00:07:10.289> good<00:07:10.469> choice

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:10.949 
it probably not a good choice

it probably not a good choice
I<00:07:11.239> think<00:07:12.239> the<00:07:12.509> Chromebooks<00:07:12.899> are<00:07:13.019> a<00:07:13.079> good

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 
I think the Chromebooks are a good

I think the Chromebooks are a good
choice<00:07:13.379> I<00:07:13.589> think<00:07:13.649> a<00:07:13.889> new<00:07:14.069> version<00:07:14.339> of<00:07:14.519> Windows

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:14.579 
choice I think a new version of Windows

00:07:14.579 --> 00:07:16.339 
choice I think a new version of Windows
would<00:07:15.029> be<00:07:15.119> fine<00:07:15.389> Windows<00:07:15.869> 8<00:07:16.019> if<00:07:16.139> you<00:07:16.229> can

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:16.349 
would be fine Windows 8 if you can

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:18.949 
would be fine Windows 8 if you can
afford<00:07:16.439> it<00:07:16.769> a<00:07:17.059> Macintosh<00:07:18.059> if<00:07:18.479> you've<00:07:18.659> got<00:07:18.839> even

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:18.959 
afford it a Macintosh if you've got even

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:21.739 
afford it a Macintosh if you've got even
more<00:07:19.199> money<00:07:19.469> that's<00:07:19.769> a<00:07:19.889> good<00:07:20.039> choice<00:07:20.749> it's

00:07:21.739 --> 00:07:21.749 
more money that's a good choice it's

00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:22.969 
more money that's a good choice it's
