00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.640 
already this is a very very fast
baneling<00:02:13.080> build

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
baneling build

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.050 
baneling build
speed<00:02:14.129> incorporated<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:14.849> have<00:02:14.939> super

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
speed incorporated so you have super

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.789 
speed incorporated so you have super
fast<00:02:15.360> speed<00:02:15.569> links<00:02:15.780> for<00:02:16.019> reinforcements<00:02:16.739> and

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
fast speed links for reinforcements and

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:18.170 
fast speed links for reinforcements and
that's<00:02:16.950> kind<00:02:17.159> of<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.310> point<00:02:17.519> of<00:02:17.670> getting

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
that's kind of the point of getting

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.470 
that's kind of the point of getting
speed<00:02:18.689> in<00:02:18.840> this<00:02:18.959> situation<00:02:19.610> that<00:02:20.610> way<00:02:20.879> you<00:02:21.360> can

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
speed in this situation that way you can

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.330 
speed in this situation that way you can
have<00:02:21.659> reinforcements<00:02:22.470> from<00:02:22.680> your<00:02:22.920> main<00:02:23.069> come

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
have reinforcements from your main come

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.649 
have reinforcements from your main come
all<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.549> way<00:02:23.579> across<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.879> map<00:02:24.090> extremely

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
all the way across the map extremely

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.429 
all the way across the map extremely
fast<00:02:25.849> so<00:02:26.849> that's<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.599> that's<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.170> end<00:02:28.290> for

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
fast so that's the it that's the end for

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:29.899 
fast so that's the it that's the end for
this<00:02:28.590> build<00:02:28.769> like<00:02:29.069> guys<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.489> don't<00:02:29.610> know<00:02:29.790> if<00:02:29.849> I

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
this build like guys I don't know if I

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:31.130 
this build like guys I don't know if I
mentioned<00:02:29.970> this<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.420> beginning<00:02:30.720> but<00:02:30.810> anyways

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
mentioned this the beginning but anyways

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.890 
mentioned this the beginning but anyways
I<00:02:31.349> think<00:02:31.799> spoiler<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.700> very<00:02:33.000> versatile<00:02:33.540> you

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
I think spoiler is very versatile you

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.000 
I think spoiler is very versatile you
can<00:02:33.930> use<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.470> in<00:02:34.730> all<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.760> matchups<00:02:36.269> I<00:02:37.049> think

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
can use it in all the matchups I think

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.319 
can use it in all the matchups I think
whenever<00:02:38.220> you're<00:02:38.459> going<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.730> go<00:02:38.790> against<00:02:39.150> T<00:02:39.299> I

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
whenever you're going to go against T I

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.360 
whenever you're going to go against T I
prefer<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:40.019> use<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.349> if<00:02:40.439> your<00:02:40.620> opponent<00:02:40.859> shows

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
prefer to use it if your opponent shows

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.330 
prefer to use it if your opponent shows
a<00:02:41.700> tech<00:02:42.209> lab<00:02:42.420> on<00:02:42.629> a<00:02:42.659> barracks<00:02:43.230> if<00:02:43.920> they<00:02:44.069> go<00:02:44.159> for

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
a tech lab on a barracks if they go for

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.830 
a tech lab on a barracks if they go for
like<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.579> standard<00:02:45.889> Hellion<00:02:47.510> heli<00:02:48.510> in<00:02:48.720> a

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
like the standard Hellion heli in a

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.509 
like the standard Hellion heli in a
reactor<00:02:49.379> Hellion<00:02:49.620> opening<00:02:49.889> it's<00:02:50.250> kind<00:02:50.459> of

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
reactor Hellion opening it's kind of

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.220 
reactor Hellion opening it's kind of
hard<00:02:50.700> sometimes<00:02:51.450> it's<00:02:51.720> made<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:51.900> work<00:02:52.049> but

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
hard sometimes it's made it work but

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.680 
hard sometimes it's made it work but
it's<00:02:52.379> a<00:02:52.440> little<00:02:52.650> bit<00:02:52.739> riskier<00:02:53.480> because<00:02:54.480> if

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
it's a little bit riskier because if

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.270 
it's a little bit riskier because if
they<00:02:54.810> have<00:02:54.930> good<00:02:55.079> control<00:02:55.379> they<00:02:55.650> can<00:02:56.190> keep

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
they have good control they can keep

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.229 
they have good control they can keep
their<00:02:56.400> aliens<00:02:56.700> alive<00:02:56.849> then<00:02:57.000> after<00:02:57.180> that

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
their aliens alive then after that

bailing nest and skip speed so we have

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.430 
bailing nest and skip speed so we have

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
like three or four banelings and then

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.569 
like three or four banelings and then
spine<00:03:31.709> crawl<00:03:31.919> at<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.099> front<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.400> they<00:03:32.489> have

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
Queens on the ramp that's probably the

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.520 
Queens on the ramp that's probably the
hardest<00:03:34.730> build<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:35.940> deal<00:03:36.180> with<00:03:36.389> if<00:03:36.870> you're<00:03:37.230> if

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
hardest build to deal with if you're if

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.050

you're<00:03:37.889> zerg<00:03:38.159> opponent<00:03:38.489> decides<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.940> go<00:03:39.030> with

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
you're zerg opponent decides to go with

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.569 
you're zerg opponent decides to go with
that<00:03:39.239> so<00:03:39.389> keep<00:03:39.569> it<00:03:39.659> out<00:03:39.750> for<00:03:39.930> that<00:03:39.989> one<00:03:40.169> too

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579
