vegetables to the pot and doing this

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.160 
vegetables to the pot and doing this
first<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.590> just<00:01:49.920> going<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.659> caramelize<00:01:51.659> them<00:01:52.049> a

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
first is just going to caramelize them a

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.260 
first is just going to caramelize them a
little<00:01:52.350> bit<00:01:52.469> just<00:01:52.500> Brown<00:01:52.920> them<00:01:52.950> off<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.549> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
little bit just Brown them off on the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.330 
little bit just Brown them off on the
outside<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:55.439> enhances<00:01:56.159> the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
outside and that just enhances the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.880 
outside and that just enhances the
flavor<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.810> vegetables<00:01:57.990> rather<00:01:58.560> than

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
flavor of the vegetables rather than

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.359 
flavor of the vegetables rather than
just<00:01:59.130> throwing<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.700> into<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.000> into<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.899> stock<00:02:01.369> so

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
so this stage I'm going to turn the heat

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.200 
so this stage I'm going to turn the heat
down<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:43.050> a<00:02:43.200> medium<00:02:44.070> heat<00:02:44.100> I'm<00:02:44.850> going<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.090> get

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.720 
down to a medium heat I'm going to get
that<00:02:45.330> intensity<00:02:45.960> that<00:02:46.650> heat<00:02:46.980> intensity<00:02:47.610> out

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.030 
that intensity that heat intensity out
of<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.090> pot<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.840> now<00:02:48.900> into<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.530> pot<00:02:49.800> I'm

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.270 
now you don't have to use chicken stock
if<00:02:54.810> you're<00:02:54.990> vegetarian<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:56.010> can<00:02:56.220> use

is just turn the heat down to a low to
medium<00:03:11.820> heat<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.540> I'm<00:03:13.350> going<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.590> let<00:03:13.770> this

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
medium heat and I'm going to let this

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.150 
medium heat and I'm going to let this
cook<00:03:14.190> for<00:03:14.490> about<00:03:15.090> 30<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:16.020> 35<00:03:16.050> minutes<00:03:17.010> until

beetroot<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:21.330> tender<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:23.040> then<00:03:23.960> we<00:03:24.960> will<00:03:25.230> pop

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
beetroot is tender and then we will pop

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.280 
beetroot is tender and then we will pop
this<00:03:25.830> into<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.190> blender<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:26.850> mix<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.690> all<00:03:27.780> up<00:03:27.840> so

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
this into a blender and mix it all up so

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.810 
this into a blender and mix it all up so
we've<00:03:28.680> finished<00:03:28.980> cooking<00:03:29.490> our<00:03:29.790> vegetables

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
we've finished cooking our vegetables

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.000 
we've finished cooking our vegetables
here<00:03:30.570> they've<00:03:30.780> been<00:03:30.810> going<00:03:31.050> for<00:03:31.260> about<00:03:31.440> 35

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
here they've been going for about 35

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.550 
here they've been going for about 35
minutes<00:03:32.310> I'm<00:03:32.700> now<00:03:33.240> going<00:03:33.420> to<00:03:33.480> pop<00:03:33.750> them<00:03:33.960> in<00:03:34.260> the

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
minutes I'm now going to pop them in the

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.170 
minutes I'm now going to pop them in the
blender<00:03:34.740> if<00:03:34.980> you<00:03:35.070> don't<00:03:35.220> have<00:03:35.520> a<00:03:35.550> blender<00:03:35.850> you

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
blender if you don't have a blender you

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.030 
blender if you don't have a blender you
can<00:03:36.360> use<00:03:36.540> one<00:03:36.750> of<00:03:36.780> those<00:03:36.930> stick<00:03:37.350> blenders<00:03:37.860> as

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
can use one of those stick blenders as

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.220 
can use one of those stick blenders as
well<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.460> just<00:03:38.640> while<00:03:38.820> it's<00:03:38.850> in<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.180> pot<00:03:39.450> you

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
well and just while it's in the pot you

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:49.699 
well and just while it's in the pot you
can<00:03:40.500> whizz<00:03:40.920> it<00:03:41.100> up<00:03:41.220> there<00:03:41.460> it's<00:03:41.700> up<00:03:41.880> to<00:03:42.000> you

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:57.309 

so<00:03:50.489> lid<00:03:50.969> on<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.450> we're<00:03:51.840> going<00:03:51.989> to<00:03:52.019> blend<00:03:52.290> away

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.640 

so<00:03:58.319> that's<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.650> color<00:03:58.980> that's<00:03:59.280> that<00:03:59.579> vibrant

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
so that's the color that's that vibrant

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.580 
so that's the color that's that vibrant
