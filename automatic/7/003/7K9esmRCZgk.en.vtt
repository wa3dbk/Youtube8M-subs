00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:10.679
 even so my operator talked by 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:13.200
 phone well done here and we come back to 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.010
 the operator prompts the cooker that 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.350
 Rosemary need more 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.270
 Well, in principle, can be really and 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:24.230
 I wish I didnâ€™t think it was more black 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:27.529
 branches means we stopped on the fact that 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.320
 rosemary garlic salt and pepper added 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:33.320
 now add garlic 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.620
 everything is standard everything is usually shoved like 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.620
 is said 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.110
 we grind this whole thing 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.990
 continue to grind 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.329
 it certainly can be done later to 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.510
 more smell preserved but it seems to me 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.119
 that the more it will be in this 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:12.200
 Now here 's the more she 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:14.119
 you can taste yourself and can 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.000
 be wrong and maybe 10 on the most 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:24.740
 but it is difficult to do at the end of garlic from 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.420
 what do you mean grind further already in 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.450
 anyway garlic will not be but now 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.660
 everyone is sick 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:40.399
 so we will be treated in this way 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:42.729
 garlic grind on you left that 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.729
 water beats 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.369
 the whole private house he and then will 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:55.810
 enough than you will be cleared 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.810
 Of course you can not put the sauce Kojima 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.369
 here 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.430
 yes people by the way if someone is too lazy to spend 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.470
 an hour of your life to 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.430
 clean the shrimp directly 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.810
 naturally does not know and stores 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.810
 sold they are reserved 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:34.170
 just not clear how long they are in such 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:37.100
 saw were therefore to be honest 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.590
 I fear buyers are peeled of course 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:47.960
 such too but such at least speak about 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:53.160
 the fact that they are no longer defrosting and so 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:57.380
 add lemons you have some bones 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.380
 uttered begin to pour 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:14.430
 sure to go bones will 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.760
 healthy affected if we do not want them 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.760
 then catch 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:28.130
 here it is that we pick them out 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:28.130
 you spoke beforehand 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:50.710
 and all things I press carefully very often 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.710
 try to survive 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:09.900
 has gone 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:12.050
 gait is exactly 1 lemon neither more nor 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.050
 less 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.130
 another bone 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.819
 not yet require 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:43.319
 and the smell is great 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:45.029
 sorry yet we have a video camera 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:49.849
 can transmit such odors 

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:49.849
 but if him and the thing learn a lot 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.999
 Yes, if someone is too lazy, this is of course all 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:01.340
 hands can grind can be wrapped in gauze and 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:04.219
 suddenly twist if anyone knows how 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.460
 to do it but they were able to bother 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:10.879
 i'm lazy i'm on business and tuscani 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:14.169
 but in general with the ingredients everything is ready 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:16.759
 then we have it for about 20 minutes 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:19.129
 consider but still ok add 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:20.930
 a little rosemary and well, in principle, this 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:25.669
 the procedure already shows the desktop 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:27.409
 business is therefore pumping get 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.189
 accidentally got here lemon 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:30.189
 sunflower seed 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:40.460
 by the way another one is not buried I will be okay 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:44.300
 There is neatly here and after 20 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:46.219
 in principle, you can have this whole thing as 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.349
 we will eat this thing I will show you 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:51.110
 video him but a photo of the finished 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:53.889
 option i will definitely show all mine 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.839
 good on this we say goodbye 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:57.810
 cook and in general, all you have 

00:05:56.839 --> 00:06:00.380
 turn out 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.380
 took everything
