so<00:00:01.290> our<00:00:01.500> solution<00:00:01.650> we<00:00:01.949> call<00:00:02.070> it<00:00:02.159> the<00:00:02.190> Bahamas

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
so our solution we call it the Bahamas

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.340 
so our solution we call it the Bahamas
solution<00:00:02.909> because<00:00:03.179> project<00:00:03.959> Mohammed<00:00:04.259> was

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
solution because project Mohammed was

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.660 
solution because project Mohammed was
our<00:00:04.470> internal<00:00:04.830> designation<00:00:05.310> for<00:00:05.460> Final

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670

Fantasy<00:00:05.759> Tactics<00:00:06.180> rebirth<00:00:06.660> is<00:00:06.870> we're<00:00:07.649> going

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
Fantasy Tactics rebirth is we're going

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.960 
Fantasy Tactics rebirth is we're going
to<00:00:07.830> use<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:07.980> combination<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.849> these

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
to use a combination of these

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.910 
to use a combination of these
alternative<00:00:09.480> systems<00:00:09.840> primarily<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.559> item

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
alternative systems primarily the item

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.180 
alternative systems primarily the item
based<00:00:11.070> system<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:12.660> fill<00:00:12.900> fix<00:00:13.200> so<00:00:14.070> we've

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
based system and the fill fix so we've

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.919 
based system and the fill fix so we've
changed<00:00:14.400> all<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.969> speed<00:00:15.240> growth<00:00:15.420> values<00:00:15.750> to

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
changed all the speed growth values to

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.019 
changed all the speed growth values to
255<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.920> results<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:17.340> an<00:00:17.490> average<00:00:17.609> speed

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
255 this results in an average speed

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.970 
255 this results in an average speed
increase<00:00:18.420> from<00:00:18.600> six<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.080> eight<00:00:19.230> from<00:00:19.500> level<00:00:19.800> 1

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
increase from six to eight from level 1

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.980 
increase from six to eight from level 1
to<00:00:20.010> 99<00:00:20.369> rather<00:00:21.359> than<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.660> speed<00:00:21.869> valéry

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
to 99 rather than a speed valéry

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.660 
to 99 rather than a speed valéry
increase<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.560> 6<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.949> 11<00:00:23.010> like<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
increase of 6 to 11 like it is in the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.880 
increase of 6 to 11 like it is in the
normal<00:00:23.939> game<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.930> side<00:00:25.199> effect<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.680> is

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
normal game the side effect of this is

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.620 
normal game the side effect of this is
it<00:00:26.010> should<00:00:26.250> make<00:00:26.430> all<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.849> late<00:00:27.060> game<00:00:27.269> spells

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
it should make all the late game spells

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.029 
it should make all the late game spells
and<00:00:27.810> abilities<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.170> little<00:00:28.410> better<00:00:28.590> because

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
and abilities a little better because

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.009 
and abilities a little better because
there'll<00:00:29.400> be<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.519> little<00:00:29.880> faster<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.539> relation

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
there'll be a little faster in relation

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.560 
there'll be a little faster in relation
to<00:00:31.140> all<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.470> characters<00:00:31.890> we've<00:00:32.880> also<00:00:33.059> altered

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
to all the characters we've also altered

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.319 
to all the characters we've also altered
speed<00:00:33.899> improving<00:00:34.320> items<00:00:34.880> because<00:00:35.880> speed

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
speed improving items because speed

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.900 
speed improving items because speed
because<00:00:36.930> we've<00:00:37.079> basically<00:00:37.399> condensed<00:00:38.399> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
because we've basically condensed the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.119 
because we've basically condensed the
speed<00:00:39.239> variation<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.050> game<00:00:40.200> stuff<00:00:41.010> like

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
speed variation in the game stuff like

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.760 
speed variation in the game stuff like
thief<00:00:41.399> hats<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.940> flash<00:00:42.360> hats<00:00:42.660> would<00:00:43.530> become

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
thief hats and flash hats would become

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.500 
thief hats and flash hats would become
unbelievably<00:00:44.160> good<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.120> know<00:00:45.180> thief<00:00:45.390> had

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
unbelievably good you know thief had

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.930 
unbelievably good you know thief had
said<00:00:45.719> plus<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.079> speed<00:00:46.320> flash<00:00:46.739> at<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.129> speed<00:00:47.640> and

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
said plus to speed flash at a speed and

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.389 
said plus to speed flash at a speed and
I<00:00:47.969> believe<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.210> magic<00:00:48.539> attack<00:00:48.780> if<00:00:49.160> we<00:00:50.160> left

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
I believe a magic attack if we left

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.400 
I believe a magic attack if we left
those<00:00:50.579> unchanged<00:00:51.270> those<00:00:51.690> would<00:00:51.899> be<00:00:51.989> even

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
those unchanged those would be even

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.110 
those unchanged those would be even
better<00:00:52.440> than<00:00:52.800> they<00:00:52.890> currently<00:00:53.100> are<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.610> in

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
better than they currently are and in

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.760 
better than they currently are and in
vanilla<00:00:54.390> tactics<00:00:54.840> those<00:00:55.050> are<00:00:55.170> no-brainers<00:00:55.320> if

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
vanilla tactics those are no-brainers if

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.380 
vanilla tactics those are no-brainers if
you<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.160> take<00:00:56.340> those<00:00:56.489> items<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:57.059> take<00:00:57.239> those

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
you can take those items you take those

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.779 
you can take those items you take those
items<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.590> we<00:00:58.739> had<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.980> do<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.219> we<00:00:59.309> had<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.489> nerf

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
items so we had to do is we had to nerf

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.639 
items so we had to do is we had to nerf
some<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.180> those<00:01:00.239> high-end<00:01:00.510> items<00:01:01.020> thief

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
some of those high-end items thief

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.020 
some of those high-end items thief
that's<00:01:01.829> only<00:01:01.980> give<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.190> one<00:01:02.370> speed<00:01:02.640> flash

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
that's only give you one speed flash

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.750 
that's only give you one speed flash
hats<00:01:03.239> don't<00:01:03.390> give<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.600> any<00:01:03.719> speed<00:01:03.930> anymore

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
hats don't give you any speed anymore

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.120 
hats don't give you any speed anymore
but<00:01:05.760> using<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.780> using<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.740> part<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
but using this using this part of the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.740 
but using this using this part of the
system<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.700> like<00:01:08.909> item<00:01:09.270> based<00:01:09.420> kind<00:01:09.689> of

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
system the like item based kind of

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.020 
system the like item based kind of
alternative<00:01:10.110> system<00:01:10.439> we<00:01:10.950> could<00:01:11.189> make<00:01:11.460> daggers

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
alternative system we could make daggers

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.000 
alternative system we could make daggers
significantly<00:01:12.840> better<00:01:13.080> they<00:01:13.380> were<00:01:13.439> off<00:01:13.710> on

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
significantly better they were off on

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.429 
significantly better they were off on
the<00:01:14.100> main<00:01:14.280> game<00:01:14.659> but<00:01:15.659> now<00:01:15.810> we<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:16.110> make<00:01:16.259> them<00:01:16.380> a

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
the main game but now we can make them a

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.310 
the main game but now we can make them a
little<00:01:16.560> better<00:01:16.740> by<00:01:17.549> having<00:01:17.880> them<00:01:18.780> give<00:01:18.990> speed

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
little better by having them give speed

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.350 
little better by having them give speed
so<00:01:19.979> now<00:01:20.159> if<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.430> carry<00:01:20.640> around<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:21.030> gorilla

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
so now if you carry around a gorilla

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.550 
so now if you carry around a gorilla
faster<00:01:21.810> which<00:01:22.020> makes<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.259> little<00:01:22.350> sense

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
faster which makes a little sense

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.990 
faster which makes a little sense
carrying<00:01:23.220> around<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.430> dagger<00:01:23.580> rather<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
carrying around a dagger rather the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.370 
carrying around a dagger rather the
sword<00:01:24.240> should<00:01:24.479> make<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.840> able<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.200> move

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
sword should make you able to move

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.340 
sword should make you able to move
around<00:01:25.530> faster<00:01:26.100> take<00:01:26.340> actions<00:01:26.700> quicker<00:01:27.350> we've

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
around faster take actions quicker we've

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.469 
around faster take actions quicker we've
also<00:01:28.530> tweet<00:01:28.979> classes<00:01:29.369> feed<00:01:29.549> multipliers<00:01:30.090> into

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
also tweet classes feed multipliers into

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.999 
also tweet classes feed multipliers into
three<00:01:30.720> tiers<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.380> also<00:01:31.530> part<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.950> the

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
three tiers this is also part of the

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.280 
three tiers this is also part of the
fill<00:01:32.250> fix<00:01:32.549> basically<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:33.509> have<00:01:33.540> slow<00:01:33.869> classes

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
fill fix basically we have slow classes

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.499 
fill fix basically we have slow classes
which<00:01:34.439> include<00:01:34.680> summoners<00:01:35.070> we<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.820> average

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
which include summoners we have average

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.060 
which include summoners we have average

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.839 
going to as a purple line here I'll get
my<00:03:34.260> mouse<00:03:34.410> out<00:03:34.620> show<00:03:34.859> you<00:03:34.919> the<00:03:35.430> purple<00:03:35.819> line

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
my mouse out show you the purple line

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.409 
my mouse out show you the purple line
right<00:03:36.180> here<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:38.370> slowest<00:03:38.760> monsters<00:03:39.180> have

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
right here the slowest monsters have

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.490 
right here the slowest monsters have
approximately<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.109> same<00:03:40.290> speed<00:03:40.739> as<00:03:41.010> the

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
approximately the same speed as the

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.619 
approximately the same speed as the
fastest<00:03:43.500> human<00:03:44.370> class<00:03:44.579> which<00:03:44.910> is<00:03:45.060> going<00:03:45.209> to<00:03:45.269> be

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
fastest human class which is going to be

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.129 
fastest human class which is going to be
the<00:03:46.379> green<00:03:47.389> right<00:03:48.389> here<00:03:48.419> in<00:03:48.599> the<00:03:48.690> background

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
the green right here in the background

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.559 
the green right here in the background
so<00:03:49.440> that<00:03:49.590> they're<00:03:49.769> pretty<00:03:50.129> similar<00:03:50.569> they

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
so that they're pretty similar they

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.059 
so that they're pretty similar they
start<00:03:51.780> off<00:03:51.840> a<00:03:51.959> little<00:03:52.199> faster<00:03:52.680> at<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:52.889> lower

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
start off a little faster at the lower

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.159 
start off a little faster at the lower
levels<00:03:53.430> but<00:03:53.609> then<00:03:53.760> even<00:03:53.940> a<00:03:54.150> little<00:03:54.359> more<00:03:54.629> later

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
levels but then even a little more later

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:57.800 
levels but then even a little more later
and<00:03:55.549> then<00:03:56.549> all<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:57.150> rest<00:03:57.329> of<00:03:57.449> the<00:03:57.540> monsters

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
and then all the rest of the monsters

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.140 
and then all the rest of the monsters
are<00:03:57.900> all<00:03:57.930> faster<00:03:58.470> than<00:03:58.620> all<00:03:58.769> the<00:03:59.099> human<00:03:59.970> based

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
are all faster than all the human based

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.210 
are all faster than all the human based
classes<00:04:00.569> and<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:01.290> zodiac<00:04:01.650> monsters<00:04:01.949> kind<00:04:02.129> of

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
classes and the zodiac monsters kind of

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.759 
classes and the zodiac monsters kind of
have<00:04:02.340> an<00:04:02.489> extra<00:04:03.090> up<00:04:03.269> here<00:04:03.540> at<00:04:03.599> the<00:04:03.659> end<00:04:03.840> so

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
have an extra up here at the end so

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.170 
have an extra up here at the end so
let's<00:04:04.889> just<00:04:05.069> graphically<00:04:05.519> shown<00:04:05.909> you<00:04:06.060> how

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
let's just graphically shown you how

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.439 
let's just graphically shown you how
it's<00:04:06.359> done<00:04:07.609> we<00:04:08.609> thought<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.940> solution<00:04:09.299> worked

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:09.449 
it's done we thought the solution worked

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:10.819 
it's done we thought the solution worked
out<00:04:09.569> pretty<00:04:09.720> well<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.290> we've<00:04:10.379> been<00:04:10.530> happy

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
out pretty well and we've been happy

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.140 
out pretty well and we've been happy
with<00:04:10.949> it<00:04:11.069> so<00:04:11.220> far<00:04:11.250> we<00:04:11.639> haven't<00:04:11.760> noticed<00:04:12.060> a

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
with it so far we haven't noticed a

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.430 
with it so far we haven't noticed a
whole<00:04:12.359> lot<00:04:12.540> of<00:04:12.569> balance<00:04:12.930> issues<00:04:13.260> and

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
whole lot of balance issues and

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.500 
whole lot of balance issues and
everything<00:04:13.709> works<00:04:13.889> out<00:04:14.040> pretty<00:04:14.159> well<00:04:14.419> if<00:04:15.419> you
