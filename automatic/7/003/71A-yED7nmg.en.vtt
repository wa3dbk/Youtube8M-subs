myself<00:01:45.200> as<00:01:45.470> well<00:01:45.800> we<00:01:45.980> do<00:01:46.130> know<00:01:46.280> there<00:01:46.460> are<00:01:46.490> some

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
myself as well we do know there are some

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.180 
myself as well we do know there are some
differences<00:01:47.150> namely<00:01:47.660> the<00:01:47.780> infrared<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:48.500> the

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
differences namely the infrared and the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.680 
differences namely the infrared and the
cement<00:01:49.580> suspect<00:01:49.940> call<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:50.210> I<00:01:50.300> think<00:01:50.540> this

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
cement suspect call and I think this

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.170 
cement suspect call and I think this
actually<00:01:50.900> harkens<00:01:51.500> back<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.340> two<00:01:52.790> we<00:01:53.000> saw

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
actually harkens back to the two we saw

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.210 
actually harkens back to the two we saw
recently<00:01:53.420> in<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.320> black<00:01:54.560> cement<00:01:55.040> and
