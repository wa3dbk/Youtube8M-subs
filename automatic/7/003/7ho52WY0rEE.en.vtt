00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:08.679
 [Music] 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:20.270
 mum like dad you talk today i have 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.700
 different healthy and delicious 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.160
 recipe ideas for you and for 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.840
 breakfast lunch and dinner 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.610
 snacks in between are simple 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.830
 Personally, I very much enjoy recipes 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.330
 like to do and love to and the 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.699
 of course , go very fast and where 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.930
 you do not have to be a professional chef for now 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:37.730
 I wish you a lot of fun with the 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.650
 recipes and see you at the end yet 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.329
 Okay, first of all I want you 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.160
 My typical breakfast which I but 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.050
 also like to eat snack in between as 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.630
 show and for that I just use 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.940
 natural yoghurt fresh strawberries some 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.829
 but also like other fruits and 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.260
 Of course, this is a mixture 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.790
 is a kind of bircher muesli blend with 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.110
 Oatmeal dried cherries 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.149
 bananas, etc 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.530
 yes and I give it all together 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.820
 a bowl and that tastes easy 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.289
 totally good is filling and healthy than 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.450
 next i want you two of my 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:10.009
 introduce your favorite lunch recipes 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.570
 but you also great as a dinner 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.880
 can eat because they are very light 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.740
 but are still the first to satisfy 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.350
 I make a quinoa salad and quinoa 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.630
 is very nutrient-rich contains all 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.459
 many minerals vitamins and has one 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.770
 I can really high protein content 

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:26.810
 recommend it namely a half cup 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.789
 Put them in a sieve and wash the cinema 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.289
 First of all because it contains the bitter substances 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.869
 you should wash off first 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.459
 Then I put the cinema in a pot 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.979
 with twice the amount of water so 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:39.229
 a whole cup and give then 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.209
 another teaspoon vegetable broth around the 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.470
 cinema just to give a taste 

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:44.569
 Of course you can also just 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.280
 just take salt that you would like 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:48.500
 in the meantime, if the quinoa 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.450
 simmer should be about 15 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.429
 simmer minutes until it becomes glassy 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.599
 I'll prepare my salad there 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.830
 Can you really take what you guys 

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:56.330
 I would like to have this for myself 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.179
 Iceberg lettuce decided 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.560
 I also have a zucchini 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.569
 chopped yes zucchini you can 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.489
 also eat raw and is just one 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.050
 good alternative to cucumber the one yes 

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:07.670
 otherwise somehow always in the salad makes 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.440
 I liked it very much yes and 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.239
 otherwise I have to paprika 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.770
 I like paprika easily 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.630
 scary like the village at 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.490
 The whole thing is never missing 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.260
 then together in a bowl of course 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.170
 and is done well once with it 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.580
 the ingredients join well no we 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.340
 are not here at a major tutorial 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.020
 Yes , of course , comes the quinoa and 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.100
 Then I have a honey mustard dressing 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.780
 given about it 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.130
 you can of course also a dressing 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.440
 I have to do it myself 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.390
 go quickly a delicious vinaigrette 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.920
 or so will taste good too yes 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.900
 and then we're done with it 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.630
 this quinoa salad just more 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:46.910
 saturates as a normal salad and very much 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.230
 is very healthy for my next recipe 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.210
 At first I have small vegetables again 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.740
 cut and the kini paprika 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.570
 and broccoli this time 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.970
 But you can take the vegetables you like 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.310
 I would like to have and now I have chicken 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.580
 marinated with pepper soy sauce 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.960
 honey and food starch and the whole 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.120
 I then give a bowl together 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.520
 first a show sojasauce then one 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.050
 a little honey with a bit of pepper 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.670
 which means a little bit much 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.890
 I have taken here as well I give 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.600
 add some food starch because that binds 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.580
 this marinade and leaves it easy 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.050
 better stick to the chicken that 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.000
 I've cut small in 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.570
 Small pieces and give the marinade now 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.220
 about that 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.870
 I'll leave that for about 10 minutes 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.700
 pull and then it will be 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.200
 Seared in a pan together with 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.709
 Simply marinate everything in the pan 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.300
 pour 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.920
 in the meantime I have the 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.110
 Broccoli cooked a little bit because I 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.730
 like them a little softer and have them 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.170
 here, of course, the chicken seared 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.209
 and you see that looks really juicy 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.580
 tastes much better than if 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.530
 you would normally season it after that 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.120
 of course, the whole vegetable comes in 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.790
 the pan and then I like to do it 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.080
 a little bit of this marinade just like you 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.510
 It always wants to call it that 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.459
 vegetables just these too 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.720
 taste absorbs yes and then 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.459
 we also already finished when we 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.870
 can have fried everything together 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.940
 we already eat it and it tastes good 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.040
 really delicious we come now 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.870
 to a sweet pancake recipe what 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.480
 while not really healthy but up 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.770
 each case healthier than many others 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.320
 chocolate cake and for that I take as 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.840
 first two tablespoons wholegrain flour then 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.100
 unfortunately had two tablespoons of cocoa powder 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.720
 I did not have a star on here 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.400
 Schokostreusel change what, of course 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.549
 Cocoa powder is not that good 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.930
 a pinch of salt a little baking powder and 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.789
 also a large spoon of yogurt 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.970
 I give this two more tablespoons 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:29.889
 honey and a protein as you can see 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.229
 can be in this recipe for example 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.240
 no oil or butter and also one 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.070
 sugar substitutes and so on that's what it means 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.229
 is a little lower in calories than one 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.180
 normal chocolate cake the whole is supposed to 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.039
 mix very well with a fork and 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.490
 then the cup comes into the microwave 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.630
 for about a minute at 800 watts 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.550
 if you take the cake out of the microwave 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.110
 brings then he should look something like this 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.940
 definitely not liquid anymore 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.169
 Do not leave it for too long 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.240
 in the microwave then he becomes namely 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.710
 hard yes then you can do that for example 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.419
 tumble on the plate or directly out 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.539
 eat the cup and I have to say 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.960
 the texture is a little bit 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.330
 but it takes some getting used to 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.280
 really delicious and is on everyone 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.580
 case a better alternative than one 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.919
 bought chocolate cake totally like doing 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.240
 I also have a fruit muri and for that 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.729
 I just have fresh strawberries 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.530
 Taken a nectarine and frozen 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.479
 Good if you have a frozen fruit 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.699
 then he just goes straight to them 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.259
 also cold which is great for it should 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:25.900
 but you also have a mixer of 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:27.610
 Frozen things can shrink that 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.500
 I went all together in a mixer 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.789
 Of course with a little water you have to 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.770
 Definitely because it has to 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:34.270
 firstly otherwise too viscous and 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.460
 the mixer otherwise is not clear 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.530
 yes the whole thing is of course mixed and 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.199
 then it completely in a glass and 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.669
 A delicious smoothie is ready 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.520
 for in between or even to 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:49.020
 Breakfast is a great vitamin bomb 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.020
 and tastes really delicious 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.300
 the last recipe is great as 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:04.099
 evening bread or as a breakfast and 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.990
 First, I have two fried eggs in 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:08.690
 fried the pan and with something 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.310
 salt pepper and parsley seasoned in 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.740
 In the meantime I have these 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.370
 wholegrain toast the things in the toaster 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.020
 done 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.729
 you can really super fast in the morning 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.650
 or in the evening I like that too 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:21.199
 like every now and then and then I have 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.240
 an avocado sliced ​​avocados 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:25.879
 are very good they are very healthy 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.379
 Unfortunately, fat was absolutely mine 

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:28.819
 not mature and still very hard because of that 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:30.800
 I have to slice them 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:32.240
 usually you can just look it out 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.819
 hollow when the soft and on the 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.590
 but do not care so went 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:38.780
 even then I have cottage cheese 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.180
 So kings and cheese are taken 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.699
 so my tost rolls lubricated the 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.220
 avocado laid over it the mirror egg 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:49.280
 put on it and also a little bit in the 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.719
 year chicken breast sausage gets used to 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.370
 her course not can you omit 

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:54.440
 if you want but yes I like that 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.210
 quite happily so of course the toast 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.400
 added once in the half 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.830
 cut through and done is this 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.080
 delicious small breakfast or citizens 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.090
 I have a couple of evening sandwiches 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.919
 ate a lot of space and yes that has 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:09.789
 really fed and healthy and 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:09.789
 nutritious 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.279
 [Music] 

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.670
 so that was just a little time now 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.010
 Choice of dishes I personally 

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:23.050
 absolutely like to eat the healthy whole 

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:25.090
 go fast and taste delicious
