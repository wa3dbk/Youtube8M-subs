too much for a period of five years from

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.990 
too much for a period of five years from
the<00:01:09.869> launch<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.229> vanilla<00:01:10.560> WoW<00:01:10.799> all<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.640> way<00:01:11.760> up

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
the launch of vanilla WoW all the way up

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.120 
the launch of vanilla WoW all the way up
until<00:01:12.799> wrath<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.040> lich<00:01:14.250> king<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.939> was<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:16.130> was

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
until wrath of the lich king I was I was

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.100 
until wrath of the lich king I was I was
addicted<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.180> world<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.479> warcraft<00:01:18.930> i

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
addicted to the world of warcraft i

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.690 
addicted to the world of warcraft i
think<00:01:19.290> i<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.560> safely<00:01:19.710> say<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.130> now<00:01:20.460> in

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
think i can safely say that now in

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.060 
think i can safely say that now in
hindsight<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.390> i<00:01:21.509> just<00:01:21.750> put<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.380> much<00:01:22.710> time

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
hindsight and i just put so much time

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.399 
hindsight and i just put so much time
into<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.400> another<00:01:24.119> way<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.570> guess<00:01:24.720> phrase<00:01:25.140> it

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
into it another way to I guess phrase it

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.440 
into it another way to I guess phrase it
would<00:01:25.560> be<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.920> thoroughly<00:01:26.250> enjoyed<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.240> world

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
would be I thoroughly enjoyed the world

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.230 
would be I thoroughly enjoyed the world
of<00:01:27.600> warcraft<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.380> now<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.979> I'm<00:01:29.100> back<00:01:29.240> after

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
footage of the game in a while this game

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.770 
footage of the game in a while this game
looks<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.430> lot<00:02:05.579> prettier<00:02:06.060> than<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.390> remember

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
looks a lot prettier than I remember

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.290 
looks a lot prettier than I remember
I<00:02:07.049> mean<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.830> it's<00:02:08.280> safe<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.729> say<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.970> they've

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
I mean it it's safe to say that they've

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.760 
I mean it it's safe to say that they've
made<00:02:09.509> some<00:02:09.539> graphical<00:02:10.170> improvements<00:02:10.679> now

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
made some graphical improvements now

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.860 
made some graphical improvements now
it's<00:02:11.190> obviously<00:02:11.550> still<00:02:11.790> very<00:02:11.850> cartoony<00:02:12.750> and

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
it's obviously still very cartoony and

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.020 
it's obviously still very cartoony and
being<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.590> ten-year-old<00:02:14.130> game<00:02:14.400> it's<00:02:14.640> not<00:02:14.819> going

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
being a ten-year-old game it's not going

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.030 
being a ten-year-old game it's not going
to<00:02:15.150> look<00:02:15.270> as<00:02:15.510> good<00:02:16.050> as<00:02:16.110> some<00:02:16.470> games<00:02:16.740> that<00:02:16.950> are

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
to look as good as some games that are

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.699 
to look as good as some games that are
just<00:02:17.340> coming<00:02:17.580> out<00:02:17.790> in<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.990> in<00:02:19.260> recent<00:02:19.650> years

just coming out in the in recent years
MMOs<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.610> course<00:02:20.850> is<00:02:21.000> what<00:02:21.030> would<00:02:21.270> be

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
MMOs of course is what would be

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.170 
MMOs of course is what would be
comparing<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:21.959> but<00:02:22.340> yes<00:02:23.340> compared<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.910> some

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
comparing it to but yes compared to some

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.330 
comparing it to but yes compared to some
MMOs<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:24.840> have<00:02:25.200> recently<00:02:25.470> come<00:02:25.770> out<00:02:25.950> it

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
MMOs that have recently come out it

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.520 
MMOs that have recently come out it
doesn't<00:02:26.580> look<00:02:26.850> as<00:02:27.120> good<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:28.110> does<00:02:28.319> still

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
doesn't look as good and it does still

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.320 
doesn't look as good and it does still
have<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.830> overall<00:02:29.160> cartoony<00:02:29.790> vibe<00:02:30.030> but<00:02:30.270> I

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
have that overall cartoony vibe but I

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.000 
have that overall cartoony vibe but I
don't<00:02:30.569> mind<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.750> cartoony<00:02:31.200> vibe<00:02:31.380> I<00:02:31.560> never<00:02:31.739> did

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
don't mind the cartoony vibe I never did

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.210 
don't mind the cartoony vibe I never did
and<00:02:32.220> this<00:02:33.060> definitely<00:02:33.470> graphic<00:02:34.470> looks<00:02:35.010> and

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
and this definitely graphic looks and

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.979 
and this definitely graphic looks and
much<00:02:35.459> better<00:02:35.700> than<00:02:36.120> what<00:02:36.360> I<00:02:36.420> remember<00:02:36.900> it

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
much better than what I remember it

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.300 
much better than what I remember it
looks<00:02:37.170> like<00:02:37.290> they've<00:02:37.440> made<00:02:37.620> improvements<00:02:38.160> to

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
looks like they've made improvements to

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.420 
looks like they've made improvements to
the<00:02:38.430> lighting<00:02:38.870> textures<00:02:39.870> overall<00:02:40.380> look<00:02:40.980> just

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
the lighting textures overall look just

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.340 
the lighting textures overall look just
a<00:02:41.550> lot<00:02:41.760> looks<00:02:42.360> like<00:02:42.480> there's<00:02:42.660> more<00:02:42.780> polygons

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
a lot looks like there's more polygons

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.280 
a lot looks like there's more polygons
basically<00:02:44.220> which<00:02:45.060> is<00:02:45.090> it's<00:02:45.750> always<00:02:46.050> good<00:02:46.260> to

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
basically which is it's always good to

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.380 
basically which is it's always good to
have<00:02:46.980> an<00:02:47.250> improvement<00:02:47.790> in<00:02:47.970> graphical

have an improvement in graphical

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.030 
have an improvement in graphical
fidelity<00:02:48.540> but<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.350> new<00:02:49.500> systems<00:02:49.890> are

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
fidelity but the new systems are

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.770 
fidelity but the new systems are
interesting<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.640> changes<00:02:51.030> are<00:02:51.180> interesting

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780
