00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
pretty good motor here we did some

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.460 
pretty good motor here we did some
initial<00:00:26.849> fire<00:00:27.269> up<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.720> other<00:00:27.900> day<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.380> it

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470

fuel<00:01:11.030> mixtures<00:01:11.450> look<00:01:11.689> good<00:01:11.920> oil<00:01:12.920> pressure

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
fuel mixtures look good oil pressure

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.710 
fuel mixtures look good oil pressure
looks<00:01:13.520> good

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:45.560 

Rinda<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.440> motor<00:01:19.620> looks

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:53.060 

300<00:01:46.110> foot<00:01:46.320> pounds

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.530 

we're<00:01:53.490> going<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.700> finish<00:01:53.850> warming<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.450> up

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
we're going to finish warming it up

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:20.790 
we're going to finish warming it up
we'll<00:01:54.780> start<00:01:54.900> making<00:01:55.350> some<00:01:55.530> holes

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.560 

okay<00:02:21.800> we've<00:02:21.980> done<00:02:22.190> some<00:02:22.460> tuning<00:02:22.850> here<00:02:23.060> on<00:02:23.300> this

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
okay we've done some tuning here on this

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.750 
okay we've done some tuning here on this
did<00:02:23.840> some<00:02:24.080> jet<00:02:24.320> changes<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.070> work<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.400> timing

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
did some jet changes and work the timing

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.970 
did some jet changes and work the timing
around<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.270> at<00:02:27.170> this<00:02:27.290> point<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.800> motor

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
around and at this point the motor

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.910 
around and at this point the motor
performed<00:02:28.550> really<00:02:28.820> well<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:30.230> can<00:02:30.410> see<00:02:30.620> here

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
performed really well you can see here

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.220 
performed really well you can see here
we'll<00:02:31.160> have<00:02:31.340> printouts<00:02:31.880> for<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.300> that<00:02:32.960> it

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
we'll have printouts for you that it

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.540 
we'll have printouts for you that it
made<00:02:33.500> so<00:02:34.070> just<00:02:34.820> about<00:02:35.680> 514<00:02:36.680> horsepower<00:02:37.280> at

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
made so just about 514 horsepower at

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.350 
made so just about 514 horsepower at
5800<00:02:38.360> rpm<00:02:38.780> we<00:02:39.500> pulled<00:02:39.800> it<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.040> 6000<00:02:40.880> and<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.120> ran

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
5800 rpm we pulled it to 6000 and it ran

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.360 
5800 rpm we pulled it to 6000 and it ran
real<00:02:41.630> good<00:02:41.870> no<00:02:42.080> problems<00:02:42.620> there<00:02:42.890> but<00:02:43.070> you<00:02:43.220> can

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
real good no problems there but you can

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.550 
real good no problems there but you can
tell<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.670> power's<00:02:44.060> just<00:02:44.900> starting<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:45.320> drop

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
tell the power's just starting to drop

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.140 
tell the power's just starting to drop
off<00:02:45.800> so<00:02:46.160> it's<00:02:46.310> working<00:02:46.640> how<00:02:46.760> it<00:02:46.910> should

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
off so it's working how it should

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.540 
off so it's working how it should
air/fuel<00:02:48.140> mixtures<00:02:48.620> look<00:02:48.830> real<00:02:49.040> good<00:02:49.250> oil

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
air/fuel mixtures look real good oil

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.430 
air/fuel mixtures look real good oil
pressure<00:02:49.640> looks<00:02:50.210> good<00:02:50.480> this<00:02:51.020> should<00:02:51.290> be<00:02:51.410> a

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
pressure looks good this should be a

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.160 
pressure looks good this should be a
great<00:02:51.710> motor<00:02:52.070> to<00:02:52.280> run<00:02:52.430> in<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:52.640> car<00:02:56.170> run

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
great motor to run in the car run

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.400 
great motor to run in the car run
