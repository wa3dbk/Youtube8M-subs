but they were never sort of loud enough
and<00:02:30.400> big<00:02:30.520> enough<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:31.060> they<00:02:31.180> would<00:02:31.390> sort<00:02:31.630> of

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
and big enough and they would sort of

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.380

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
wasn't very complicated as an amplifier

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
sometimes it starts with a lyric idea

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.860 
sometimes it starts with a lyric idea
who<00:04:11.260> most<00:04:11.500> often<00:04:11.829> it's<00:04:12.220> a<00:04:12.519> guitar<00:04:12.909> lick<00:04:13.150> you

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
know and then I start hearing the record

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.729 
know and then I start hearing the record
in<00:04:15.819> my<00:04:15.849> mind<00:04:16.209> and<00:04:16.419> just<00:04:16.539> sort<00:04:16.840> of<00:04:16.930> fill<00:04:17.440> it<00:04:17.590> in

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739

collaborated on a song it's kind of
clear<00:04:24.760> to<00:04:25.030> me<00:04:25.150> what<00:04:25.389> the<00:04:25.510> record<00:04:25.870> should<00:04:26.139> be

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
clear to me what the record should be

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.230 
clear to me what the record should be

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
and then it's just a matter of filling

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:36.610 
and then it's just a matter of filling
it<00:04:28.479> in<00:04:28.860> doing<00:04:29.860> diligence<00:04:30.430> to<00:04:30.550> fill<00:04:31.000> it
