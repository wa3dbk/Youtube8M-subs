thicker<00:06:26.729> profile<00:06:27.360> on<00:06:27.539> the<00:06:27.629> added<00:06:27.989> movement

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 
thicker profile on the added movement

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:29.869 
thicker profile on the added movement
and<00:06:28.529> that<00:06:28.619> little<00:06:28.829> kick<00:06:29.159> that<00:06:29.369> you<00:06:29.399> get<00:06:29.669> from
