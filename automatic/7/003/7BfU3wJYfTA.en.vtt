00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:06.839
 hello and welcome back to 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.099
 I'm here in teams 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:14.580
 and today I have something pretty 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.130
 and we can already see it there 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.580
 a castle and many more others 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.289
 stuff 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.590
 but I would say I show you 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.420
 first the hottest was because I have 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.220
 sat down a little and yes 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.130
 a new base built taimos 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.420
 However, this base has in itself and 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.190
 you still can not get that base from 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.890
 In addition , this is only to buy 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.629
 since that is the kite base and mine is 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.829
 I've succeeded in minecraft 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.809
 really sat very slowly what 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.070
 really mega mega mega epic is yes 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.230
 I probably could have so 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.699
 think with me the saddle of the kite 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.840
 Unfortunately, it is not entirely on the things 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.770
 I'll have to see if I can do that 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.360
 somehow manage 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.789
 It's going to be hard, I have to look 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.320
 as it is possible for later one 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.180
 saddle also be directly on the dragon 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.530
 But it does not matter we sit on the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.489
 saddle and you can already imagine 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.920
 what happens when i switch this 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.689
 flips 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:19.140
 The dragon takes off and flies in the air 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:20.460
 and now a free ride and me 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.229
 I can look around and depending 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.350
 which direction I look just flies 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.479
 now the dragon and you see it 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.650
 works really cool though 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.750
 I just want to get out then 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.420
 I press l shift fall sown 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.799
 the dragon is flying away and I'm taking it too 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.869
 no case then harm as long as I open 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.700
 the dragon I am the secured 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.380
 Idea is that he with this basis oh yes 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.840
 and revenge comes after a time too 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.220
 back as you see the idea is 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.850
 that could be based on that 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.290
 traveling the world and yours quickly 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.910
 opponents from above surprise us 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.860
 simply from above comes yes and this 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:58.500
 Squid says problem I have to too 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.500
 still solve it so let's go again 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.330
 against the air and I'll show you something 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.560
 other times such a terror 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.810
 once there is such a beautiful 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.160
 lock implemented there is still 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.410
 That's why others say so too 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.020
 not yet by whom the locks et 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.310
 Cetera are because I think that should still 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.840
 stay a secret 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.850
 I'll do extra video again where 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.200
 I again Extra people honor for 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.760
 things that you have built but I am 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.920
 really excited about some things 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.090
 I get but I really have 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.200
 really really really great 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.680
 things from you get really great 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.770
 submissions and here where I am now 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.870
 just fly over it thank you dragon looks 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.000
 this is what I still want 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.570
 do not name any names but one thing may be said 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.459
 its pretty mega cool looking 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.340
 village here was built by one person 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.530
 that's good off so good I would 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.459
 not succeed and to the others of 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.130
 you will be a lot more 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.739
 desert areas and I explain the whole 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.150
 time ran amazon dungeon so I built 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.550
 I can be a place already 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.200
 desert temple with a pyramid then 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.900
 that would be really cool 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.640
 Well, come back to the 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.390
 Dragon certainly asks you how 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.620
 does that work with the kites? 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.790
 I do not want to go now 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.350
 explain the technique of the relative 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.330
 crazy and also uses some quite 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.880
 crazy methods I especially 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.880
 even a 1.8 has a very important 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.590
 Method is when you are up now 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.680
 Left 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.140
 just look at exactly facing colon 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.870
 eastwood positive ickx and now sees 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.310
 but this number - that is the 980 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.370
 direction in which I look depending on where 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.340
 i look this number changes and 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.049
 the idea that I have now 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.570
 that's where it comes from 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.769
 I have not shown myself well yet 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.190
 then comes another epic one 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.190
 thing about it 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:54.829
 The idea was that I was here one 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:56.390
 highspeed glock just had to wait 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.959
 fast and running fast 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.459
 and I teleport in principle the 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.450
 all the time the kite and how exactly that 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.799
 Works is a hard one too 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.209
 but explain exactly in the direction of the 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.950
 I watch teleport the right dragon 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.180
 teleport the kite like that 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.769
 quickly that it looks like the 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.010
 Dragon would fly normally 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.569
 namely no wobbling generation that 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.209
 that would look like that 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.229
 no, it runs smoothly the other one 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.639
 I have not shown you yet 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:26.090
 but I just jump to it now 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:27.470
 short in a copy so then I can do that 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.509
 In this copy the copy shows throw 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.699
 I'll take it away right away 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:35.870
 into the picture into the so-called picture 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:36.680
 had to be orderable via the homepage 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.190
 I 'm a bit hoarse 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.139
 yes, this sniper tower if I'm on 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.820
 the homepage in now order no matter where 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.810
 I am on the map I am on the spot 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.289
 where I am right now 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.060
 built this atom and we have to 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:51.470
 a box of falling work 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.780
 Year and boring is nothing 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.760
 special 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.280
 especially the coolest is this the 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.389
 idea is of dirt notz i have one 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.190
 a bit remodeled and a bit 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.599
 you should perfect a bit 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.340
 make my neck free now against mine 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:08.270
 agree promotion that's a little bit different 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.280
 mega cool 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.840
 So you can picture it 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.159
 said about the over for a page 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.330
 How to order a homepage 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:17.090
 I do not want to say that works yet 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.380
 but you can order that and then 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:27.409
 be the spot to while since 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:28.729
 saarmund yes now I know why 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:32.740
 that did not work out but I was 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:34.909
 way too deep so I go up 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.870
 I wanted just a small talk 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:37.870
 grassy area for me 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.360
 because when I sit in this picture 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:46.410
 this picture is put in the ground 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:48.030
 rehabilitated but see this machine was 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.010
 set the ground and as soon as you look 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.660
 Honoring these pictures works like that 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.310
 a tower that's cool 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.490
 what it looks like but if you gamon 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.770
 PrÃ¶ll is starting this super nice tour 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.700
 still theoretically on after a while 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:06.900
 1 to shoot I think I'm there 36 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:08.280
 laser beam and i will hit if 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.270
 Of course, many towers next to each other 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.790
 are fast side 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.760
 Game over a tire is this picture in mega 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:16.470
 cool then we still have this picture in it 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.930
 here where I'm looking right now 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:25.760
 is from a block of being under the 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:25.760
 set floor poses a lava trap there 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.600
 Now nothing happens with it 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.430
 The message case activates 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.660
 in five seconds 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.060
 that means running away for me as fast as possible 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.070
 see as I watch out even in the event and 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.940
 the next jerk running through this 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:43.040
 yes, a lama begs a very much 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:47.460
 dangerous trap 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.790
 and another cool picture in this is this 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.870
 here 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:53.010
 It is the super bomb and idea is that 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.550
 if you look at them in the air 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.950
 blown up 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:07:02.700
 if I stand in front of those now in there 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:04.290
 the air it flashes it does it there 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:08.010
 The note blocks also make noise 

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:11.550
 is not in the video now and after one 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:13.500
 time then turns around and the 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.830
 Destruction bomb is all 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.850
 quite acceptable 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.480
 Now I can set the technology principle 

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.140
 throw the garbage 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:24.180
 I've thought about it for a few more 

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.800
 show thank you very much love bomb it will be 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.790
 a lot more phases 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.740
 you can give them over the 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.180
 buy homepage but that would be so first 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.610
 the other things continue to build people 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.050
 I hope to build a lot of fun again 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.930
 I am very much looking forward to your submissions 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:40.640
 already got a lot and we see 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.640
 us then keep people again
