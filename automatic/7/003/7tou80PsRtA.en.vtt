00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
to do this is you can use all sorts of

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.420 
to do this is you can use all sorts of
willow<00:01:25.210> tree<00:01:25.420> sticks<00:01:26.080> apple<00:01:26.740> twiglets<00:01:27.190> as

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
willow tree sticks apple twiglets as

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.280 
willow tree sticks apple twiglets as
well<00:01:27.640> so<00:01:28.240> what<00:01:28.330> you<00:01:28.360> can<00:01:28.510> do<00:01:28.630> is<00:01:28.750> pop<00:01:28.930> a<00:01:28.960> couple

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
well so what you can do is pop a couple

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.230 
well so what you can do is pop a couple
of<00:01:29.380> these<00:01:29.560> into<00:01:29.980> your<00:01:30.310> toilet<00:01:30.850> rolls<00:01:33.210> hock<00:01:34.210> a

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
of these into your toilet rolls hock a

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.270 
of these into your toilet rolls hock a
bit<00:01:34.450> of<00:01:34.570> hay<00:01:34.780> in<00:01:35.020> there<00:01:35.230> just<00:01:35.440> to<00:01:35.650> hold<00:01:35.890> it<00:01:36.130> out

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
bit of hay in there just to hold it out

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.310 
bit of hay in there just to hold it out
and<00:01:36.730> then<00:01:37.450> you<00:01:37.570> could<00:01:37.720> use<00:01:37.900> something<00:01:38.140> like

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
and then you could use something like

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.310 
and then you could use something like
wild<00:01:38.800> geranium<00:01:39.400> from<00:01:39.640> your<00:01:39.790> garden<00:01:40.320> they've

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
even got a bit of mint here as well so

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.190 
even got a bit of mint here as well so
we<00:01:45.520> can<00:01:45.550> stuff<00:01:45.940> them<00:01:46.180> in<00:01:46.360> and<00:01:46.570> then<00:01:47.050> the

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
we can stuff them in and then the

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.050 
we can stuff them in and then the
rabbits<00:01:47.530> can<00:01:47.770> roll<00:01:47.980> that<00:01:48.160> around<00:01:48.490> and<00:01:48.850> keep

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
rabbits can roll that around and keep

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.280 
rabbits can roll that around and keep
trying<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.360> pull<00:01:49.510> it<00:01:49.630> out<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:52.390> what<00:01:53.080> I'm<00:01:53.170> going

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
trying to pull it out so what I'm going

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.900 
trying to pull it out so what I'm going
to<00:01:53.350> do<00:01:53.530> is<00:01:53.740> pop<00:01:54.010> this<00:01:54.160> in<00:01:54.370> with<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:54.580> rabbits

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
here and then they can investigate that

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:07.540 
here and then they can investigate that
in<00:01:57.340> a<00:01:57.430> little<00:01:57.610> bit

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
with the singing nettles the best idea

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.760 
with the singing nettles the best idea
is<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:48.210> hang<00:02:48.420> them<00:02:48.660> up<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.020> leave<00:02:49.500> them<00:02:49.680> for

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.870 
about a week to dry they go nice and dry
and<00:02:51.840> crispy<00:02:52.230> that<00:02:52.530> way<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.830> sting<00:02:53.100> goes<00:02:53.370> and

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
and crispy that way the sting goes and

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.610 
and crispy that way the sting goes and
rabbits<00:02:54.240> love<00:02:54.600> nibbling<00:02:55.080> off<00:02:55.200> them<00:02:55.380> so<00:02:55.530> you

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
done this what you can do is get a paper

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.930 
done this what you can do is get a paper
bag<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:00.480> any<00:03:01.320> small<00:03:01.500> brown<00:03:02.250> paper<00:03:02.550> bags<00:03:02.820> are

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
bag so any small brown paper bags are

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.940 
bag so any small brown paper bags are
fantastic<00:03:03.600> they<00:03:03.690> love<00:03:03.990> rummaging<00:03:04.560> around<00:03:04.650> in

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
fantastic they love rummaging around in

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.590 
fantastic they love rummaging around in
them<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.430> it's<00:03:05.610> safe<00:03:05.850> for<00:03:06.030> them<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.300> chew<00:03:06.450> on

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
treats in there you could even get some

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.949 
treats in there you could even get some
of<00:03:14.070> their<00:03:14.220> diets<00:03:14.610> so<00:03:14.790> come<00:03:15.360> away<00:03:15.600> from<00:03:15.660> the

of a bowl rustle that all around and

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.330 
of a bowl rustle that all around and
then<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.050> rabbits<00:03:22.350> will<00:03:22.470> love<00:03:22.709> jumping<00:03:23.220> in

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340

finding their food and that really

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.310 
finding their food and that really
mimics<00:03:27.030> what<00:03:27.209> they<00:03:27.360> would<00:03:27.510> be<00:03:27.540> doing<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.989> wild

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
mimics what they would be doing the wild

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.720 
mimics what they would be doing the wild
they'll<00:03:28.470> be<00:03:28.590> rummaging<00:03:29.100> they've<00:03:29.580> been

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
they'll be rummaging they've been

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.250 
they'll be rummaging they've been
rustling<00:03:30.090> through<00:03:30.270> the<00:03:30.330> food<00:03:30.600> and<00:03:30.780> foraging

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
rustling through the food and foraging

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.840 
rustling through the food and foraging
and<00:03:31.440> grazing<00:03:31.890> on<00:03:32.010> all<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.310> different<00:03:32.640> types

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
and grazing on all the different types

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.449 
and grazing on all the different types
of<00:03:32.970> plants<00:03:33.300> that<00:03:33.330> are<00:03:33.450> available<00:03:37.459> another

of plants that are available another

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.820 
of plants that are available another
idea<00:03:38.910> would<00:03:39.239> also<00:03:39.420> be<00:03:39.720> a<00:03:39.900> garden<00:03:40.500> hanging

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
idea would also be a garden hanging

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.060 
idea would also be a garden hanging
basket<00:03:41.360> rabbits<00:03:42.360> love<00:03:42.810> these<00:03:43.170> what<00:03:43.830> you<00:03:43.920> can

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
basket rabbits love these what you can

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.310 
basket rabbits love these what you can
do<00:03:44.280> is<00:03:44.550> absolutely<00:03:44.970> stuff<00:03:45.600> these<00:03:45.810> with<00:03:46.080> hay

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
do is absolutely stuff these with hay

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.970 
do is absolutely stuff these with hay
and<00:03:47.959> then<00:03:48.959> again<00:03:49.260> get<00:03:49.470> all<00:03:49.620> sorts<00:03:49.890> of

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
and then again get all sorts of
