00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
to position the circle of like this and

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.990 
to position the circle of like this and
what<00:01:25.680> you'll<00:01:25.830> do<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.250> press<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.790> back<00:01:26.970> button

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
your character all mode and from the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.830 
your character all mode and from the
character<00:01:31.710> mode<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.979> can<00:01:32.040> set<00:01:32.369> up<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.520> map

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
shaft of hell I can never fucking heads

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.680 
shaft of hell I can never fucking heads
I'm<00:03:32.870> dragging<00:03:33.380> along<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.770> wall<00:03:33.980> huh<00:03:34.600> so<00:03:35.600> you

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
I'm dragging along the wall huh so you

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.420 
I'm dragging along the wall huh so you
fall<00:03:35.900> right<00:03:36.140> through<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:36.740> you<00:03:37.010> don't<00:03:37.190> dine

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
fall right through and you don't dine

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.710 
fall right through and you don't dine
this<00:03:37.760> mode<00:03:38.660> since<00:03:38.930> just<00:03:39.410> create<00:03:39.740> a<00:03:39.770> mode<00:03:40.720> after

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
this mode since just create a mode after

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.140 
this mode since just create a mode after
that<00:03:41.900> you<00:03:42.590> are<00:03:42.710> free<00:03:42.950> to<00:03:43.190> set<00:03:43.340> up<00:03:43.430> spawns<00:03:43.760> like

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
that you are free to set up spawns like

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.800 
that you are free to set up spawns like
I<00:03:44.360> just<00:03:44.540> did<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:46.220> I'm<00:03:46.910> gonna<00:03:47.300> run<00:03:47.480> over<00:03:47.510> here

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
I just did and I'm gonna run over here

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.660 
I just did and I'm gonna run over here
and<00:03:48.050> once<00:03:48.350> it<00:03:48.530> lights<00:03:48.830> up<00:03:48.980> that<00:03:49.250> means<00:03:49.459> you're

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
and once it lights up that means you're

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.640 
and once it lights up that means you're
unable<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.030> set<00:03:50.480> up<00:03:50.600> another<00:03:50.780> spawn<00:03:51.170> location

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
unable to set up another spawn location

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.199 
unable to set up another spawn location
all<00:03:51.770> you<00:03:51.890> need<00:03:52.040> is<00:03:52.190> to<00:03:52.220> set<00:03:52.670> up<00:03:52.760> a<00:03:52.850> death<00:03:53.000> match

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
all you need is to set up a death match

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.360 
all you need is to set up a death match
this<00:03:53.870> next<00:03:54.140> one<00:03:54.350> is<00:03:54.380> in<00:03:54.530> the<00:03:54.680> same<00:03:54.950> building

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
this next one is in the same building

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.100 
this next one is in the same building
but<00:03:55.520> a<00:03:55.700> different<00:03:56.060> location<00:03:56.630> in<00:03:56.720> the<00:03:56.810> building

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
but a different location in the building

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.710 
but a different location in the building
because<00:03:57.459> you<00:03:58.459> know<00:03:58.580> this<00:03:58.820> building<00:03:59.270> is<00:03:59.510> pretty

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
because you know this building is pretty

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.610 
because you know this building is pretty
fucking<00:04:00.050> big<00:04:00.520> so<00:04:01.520> this<00:04:02.480> locations<00:04:03.140> right<00:04:03.350> here

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
fucking big so this locations right here

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.040 
fucking big so this locations right here
what<00:04:04.520> you're<00:04:04.610> gonna<00:04:04.730> do<00:04:04.940> is<00:04:05.090> just<00:04:05.240> put<00:04:05.840> on<00:04:05.959> the

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
what you're gonna do is just put on the

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.380 
what you're gonna do is just put on the
wall<00:04:06.200> it's<00:04:06.650> near<00:04:06.800> the<00:04:06.860> FIB<00:04:07.400> sign<00:04:07.670> I<00:04:07.970> remember

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
wall it's near the FIB sign I remember

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
wall it's near the FIB sign I remember
that's<00:04:08.540> how<00:04:08.600> you<00:04:08.690> know<00:04:08.870> it's<00:04:09.020> the<00:04:09.050> second

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
that's how you know it's the second

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.020 
that's how you know it's the second
location<00:04:09.680> also<00:04:09.980> is<00:04:10.160> it<00:04:10.250> to<00:04:10.400> buy<00:04:10.520> if<00:04:10.790> you<00:04:10.820> want

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
location also is it to buy if you want

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.670 
location also is it to buy if you want
to<00:04:11.090> relate<00:04:11.360> that<00:04:11.480> to<00:04:11.540> the<00:04:11.780> second<00:04:12.140> location<00:04:12.380> my

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
to relate that to the second location my

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.360 
to relate that to the second location my
video<00:04:13.180> this<00:04:14.180> one's<00:04:14.390> a<00:04:14.420> little<00:04:14.480> more<00:04:14.720> tricky<00:04:14.900> uh

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
video this one's a little more tricky uh

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.580 
video this one's a little more tricky uh
it<00:04:16.370> doesn't<00:04:16.580> really<00:04:16.790> load<00:04:17.180> up<00:04:17.209> unless<00:04:18.140> you<00:04:18.350> run

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
it doesn't really load up unless you run

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.530 
it doesn't really load up unless you run
to<00:04:19.070> a<00:04:19.100> certain<00:04:19.400> point<00:04:19.519> so<00:04:19.850> just<00:04:20.120> keep<00:04:20.330> running

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
to a certain point so just keep running

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.330 
to a certain point so just keep running
around<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:21.230> eventually<00:04:21.560> it'll<00:04:21.980> just<00:04:22.160> start

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
around and eventually it'll just start

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.490 
around and eventually it'll just start
loading<00:04:22.700> everything<00:04:22.880> and<00:04:23.630> this<00:04:24.020> is<00:04:24.169> the<00:04:24.290> same

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
loading everything and this is the same

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.680 
loading everything and this is the same
place<00:04:25.310> that<00:04:25.340> I<00:04:25.550> was<00:04:25.730> just<00:04:25.910> in<00:04:26.120> you<00:04:26.419> just<00:04:26.540> gotta

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
place that I was just in you just gotta

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.880 
place that I was just in you just gotta
run<00:04:26.900> around<00:04:27.200> and<00:04:27.350> knock<00:04:27.470> and<00:04:27.650> it<00:04:27.680> eventually

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
run around and knock and it eventually

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.340 
run around and knock and it eventually
it<00:04:28.280> loads<00:04:28.490> I<00:04:28.790> just<00:04:29.480> get<00:04:29.720> forward<00:04:30.080> because<00:04:30.230> it

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
it loads I just get forward because it

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.980 
it loads I just get forward because it
took<00:04:30.470> me<00:04:30.620> like<00:04:30.800> five<00:04:31.790> minutes<00:04:31.820> to<00:04:32.630> find<00:04:32.840> the

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
took me like five minutes to find the

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.670 
took me like five minutes to find the
correct<00:04:33.290> a<00:04:33.470> loading<00:04:33.890> point<00:04:35.260> this<00:04:36.260> next<00:04:36.470> one<00:04:36.650> is

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
correct a loading point this next one is

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.230 
correct a loading point this next one is
in<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:36.950> building<00:04:37.100> right<00:04:37.250> next<00:04:37.610> to<00:04:37.760> the<00:04:37.880> FIB

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
in the building right next to the FIB

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.720 
in the building right next to the FIB
building<00:04:38.630> on<00:04:38.720> me<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:38.870> zoom<00:04:39.050> out<00:04:39.230> and<00:04:39.580> you<00:04:40.580> just

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
building on me the zoom out and you just

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.210 
building on me the zoom out and you just
got<00:04:40.880> to<00:04:40.910> put<00:04:41.150> your<00:04:41.270> spawn<00:04:41.960> beacon<00:04:42.140> inside<00:04:42.650> that

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
got to put your spawn beacon inside that

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.770 
got to put your spawn beacon inside that
window<00:04:43.550> that<00:04:43.790> you<00:04:43.820> can<00:04:43.910> see<00:04:44.240> through<00:04:44.450> you<00:04:44.540> and

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
window that you can see through you and

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.990 
window that you can see through you and
once<00:04:45.590> you<00:04:45.650> do<00:04:45.860> you<00:04:46.280> can<00:04:46.460> just<00:04:46.640> go<00:04:46.760> to<00:04:46.820> your

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
once you do you can just go to your

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.120 
once you do you can just go to your
character<00:04:47.450> press<00:04:47.900> it<00:04:48.050> back<00:04:48.320> remember<00:04:48.980> you

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
character press it back remember you

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.170 
character press it back remember you
have<00:04:49.220> to<00:04:49.280> press<00:04:49.430> back<00:04:49.760> to<00:04:49.790> go<00:04:50.030> to<00:04:50.090> your

have to press back to go to your
character<00:04:50.570> and<00:04:50.600> you'll<00:04:50.840> spawn<00:04:51.200> inside<00:04:51.530> the

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
character and you'll spawn inside the

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.240 
character and you'll spawn inside the
building<00:04:51.950> or<00:04:52.520> you<00:04:52.820> can<00:04:53.030> create<00:04:53.510> a<00:04:53.630> death<00:04:53.810> match

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
building or you can create a death match

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.540 
building or you can create a death match
this<00:04:55.250> one's<00:04:55.460> pretty<00:04:55.610> small<00:04:56.000> so

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
this one's pretty small so

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.580 
this one's pretty small so
yeah<00:04:57.700> not<00:04:58.600> sure<00:04:58.780> what<00:04:58.930> you<00:04:59.080> can<00:04:59.230> do<00:04:59.320> in<00:04:59.440> here

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
yeah not sure what you can do in here

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
but if you can do something let me know

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.500 
but if you can do something let me know
it's<00:05:02.500> pretty<00:05:02.680> intense<00:05:05.640> this<00:05:06.640> next<00:05:06.940> one<00:05:07.270> is

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
it's pretty intense this next one is

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.780 
it's pretty intense this next one is
that<00:05:07.960> Michaels<00:05:08.470> house<00:05:08.970> now<00:05:10.830> I'm<00:05:11.830> not<00:05:12.100> sure<00:05:12.550> if

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
that Michaels house now I'm not sure if

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.700 
that Michaels house now I'm not sure if
it's<00:05:12.970> just<00:05:13.270> because<00:05:13.570> I<00:05:13.810> have<00:05:14.110> the<00:05:14.140> character

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
it's just because I have the character

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.430 
it's just because I have the character
Michael<00:05:15.130> so<00:05:15.810> apparently<00:05:16.810> if<00:05:16.870> you're<00:05:17.260> playing

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
portion of the game rather than the

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.970

like from the single player that are

like from the single player that are
open<00:05:28.710> are<00:05:29.710> naturally<00:05:30.160> open<00:05:30.520> in<00:05:30.640> this<00:05:30.850> so<00:05:31.060> I

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
open are naturally open in this so I

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
open are naturally open in this so I
don't<00:05:31.180> even<00:05:31.330> think<00:05:31.450> you<00:05:31.600> have<00:05:31.720> to<00:05:31.780> glitch<00:05:31.960> do

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
don't even think you have to glitch do

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.660 
don't even think you have to glitch do
but<00:05:32.380> if<00:05:32.500> you<00:05:32.620> did<00:05:32.890> have<00:05:33.070> two<00:05:33.220> clicks<00:05:33.460> to<00:05:33.580> it

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670 
but if you did have two clicks to it

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.490 
but if you did have two clicks to it
then<00:05:34.420> you<00:05:34.600> just<00:05:34.780> have<00:05:34.900> to<00:05:34.990> put<00:05:35.140> the<00:05:35.170> circle

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
then you just have to put the circle

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.760 
then you just have to put the circle
