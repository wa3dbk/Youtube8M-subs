in<00:06:23.560> the<00:06:23.650> second<00:06:23.979> film<00:06:24.130> because<00:06:24.400> in<00:06:24.490> the<00:06:24.550> first

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:24.789 
in the second film because in the first

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:27.180 
in the second film because in the first
film<00:06:25.030> we<00:06:25.900> thought<00:06:26.229> we<00:06:26.380> did<00:06:26.620> you<00:06:26.919> know<00:06:27.010> we

thought that the Chi Jews had the you

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:30.029 
thought that the Chi Jews had the you
know<00:06:28.720> the<00:06:28.870> upper<00:06:29.110> hand<00:06:29.260> what<00:06:29.500> not<00:06:29.650> destroying

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039 
know the upper hand what not destroying

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:33.029 
know the upper hand what not destroying
the<00:06:30.159> city<00:06:30.310> here<00:06:30.550> and<00:06:30.669> there<00:06:30.789> um<00:06:31.680> but<00:06:32.680> they<00:06:32.979> were

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 
the city here and there um but they were

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:35.640 
the city here and there um but they were
made<00:06:33.310> short<00:06:33.789> work<00:06:33.820> by<00:06:34.300> gipsy<00:06:34.810> danger<00:06:34.840> so<00:06:35.440> I

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 
made short work by gipsy danger so I

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.710 
made short work by gipsy danger so I
feel<00:06:36.250> like<00:06:36.400> if<00:06:37.060> they're<00:06:37.330> going<00:06:37.449> to<00:06:37.510> introduce

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
feel like if they're going to introduce

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.390 
feel like if they're going to introduce
more<00:06:38.080> cages<00:06:38.500> I<00:06:38.620> think<00:06:38.770> the<00:06:38.830> kaiser<00:06:39.039> should<00:06:39.310> be

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
more cages I think the kaiser should be

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.210 
more cages I think the kaiser should be
more<00:06:39.639> more<00:06:40.599> aggressive<00:06:41.229> like<00:06:41.380> animal<00:06:41.860> sort<00:06:42.130> of

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.220

on but in terms of Jim gipsy danger of

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.680 
on but in terms of Jim gipsy danger of
