00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:14.510
 Yes It is standing part 2 from the floor continuing 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:17.570
 Stand up from the state on the floor 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.550
 It is the movement of the joint, which also has no technique name 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:25.980
 Let's practice your feet first 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:30.039
 Either foot is good, I kick my foot in front with my favorite story 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.460
 Let's drop the heel from the beginning of the accounting 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.079
 I have not lowered my feet 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.740
 With this movement 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:42.730
 Is also a disgusting whole most of the people 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.140
 I am in a pendulum state and my body is yeah 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.540
 In such Fu 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.540
 I think this will be pulled by the force of the back of the foot 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.179
 It will be this 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.440
 Body 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.130
 Include 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.900
 What is it 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:06.460
 It is not pulled straight as it is 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.460
 Yeah it is yet to come good in exaggerated 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.110
 The body when a drop in out 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.200
 Follow 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:19.020
 There it is this necessarily this as it is in the tongue 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.710
 For example 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.710
 From this form 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.740
 The foot 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.070
 On the sometimes oblique issue 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:35.260
 Diagonally above 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:37.310
 I press down the shoulder or from where it was kicking out of the cut-out Masuko 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.870
 Kick out and drop heels 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.290
 At this time 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.720
 This support 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.100
 Please boil this too 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.100
 It seems like this upper body starts from there 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.950
 I will try this a little 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.880
 is 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.880
 I get up this way 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:01.790
 At first it's a little difficult, but please try to put in force as much as possible 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.790
 It, for example, is good even from footwork 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:10.069
 Kick your leg up diagonally to raise your body 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.049
 Diagonally early 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.049
 It is easy to drop my shoulder from there 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.560
 At first it will be like Goo 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.560
 Oh 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.840
 This way 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.840
 It can be another first floor front of rising above from the floor 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.150
 It is feeling 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:40.489
 It is quite difficult without a little momentum 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:40.489
 It is this movement when you check in and I think way as good to try doing it with a pond 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.409
 It is an image to pop up 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.090
 It's like this 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:03:05.360
 Yes Try doing to fit it in to Tsugion 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:05.360
 bht j 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.109
 Hmm 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.750
 bl 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.750
 th 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:37.349
 Booty
