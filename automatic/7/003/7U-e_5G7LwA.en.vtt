 first touch of the crowned father of 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:14.790
 parents and then we believe their assaults 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:18.390
 whose role in nature is everything 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:26.600
 we just come the last days 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:26.600
 the wall in a house in this sense 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.159
 break you 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.500
 at first in this direction then 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.750
 in a second time he a day without 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.830
 release all in length the better one 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:58.030
 come back to his house with that 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:02:04.780
 crossed in front of him it allows a little 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:07.930
 eyes I had to finish we come back a 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.800
 third time the initial position 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.800
 we started east 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:25.280
 here and we start this barn at 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:25.280
