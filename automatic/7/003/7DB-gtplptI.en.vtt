guys so we have two kinds of idle air

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.109 
guys so we have two kinds of idle air
control<00:00:25.050> valve<00:00:25.439> there's<00:00:26.130> one<00:00:26.400> with<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> black

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
control valve there's one with a black

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.779 
control valve there's one with a black
plactic<00:00:27.990> plastic<00:00:28.560> casing<00:00:29.099> which<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.460> can<00:00:29.609> see

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
plactic plastic casing which you can see

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.089 
plactic plastic casing which you can see
right<00:00:30.029> here<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.480> there's<00:00:31.470> basically<00:00:31.650> two

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
right here and there's basically two

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.979 
right here and there's basically two
bolts<00:00:32.399> on<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.640> one<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.390> looks<00:00:33.600> like<00:00:33.660> 12

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
bolts on this one and this looks like 12

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.600 
bolts on this one and this looks like 12
millimeter<00:00:34.410> bolts<00:00:34.649> correct<00:00:35.250> me<00:00:35.370> if<00:00:35.460> I'm<00:00:35.579> wrong

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
millimeter bolts correct me if I'm wrong

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.760 
millimeter bolts correct me if I'm wrong
enough<00:00:35.969> with<00:00:36.090> an<00:00:36.180> annotation<00:00:36.420> up<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.710> you

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
enough with an annotation up and so you

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.470 
enough with an annotation up and so you
take<00:00:37.950> those<00:00:38.070> two<00:00:38.129> up<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.700> then<00:00:39.149> right<00:00:39.450> down

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
take those two up and then right down

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.479 
take those two up and then right down
here<00:00:39.840> below<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.110> can't<00:00:40.440> get<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> good<00:00:40.800> angle<00:00:41.040> on

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
here below I can't get a good angle on

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.709 
here below I can't get a good angle on
it<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:41.700> if<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:41.940> see<00:00:42.090> my<00:00:42.180> finger<00:00:42.480> moving

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
it but if you can see my finger moving

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.540 
it but if you can see my finger moving
there<00:00:42.870> there's<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.440> two<00:00:43.680> coolant<00:00:44.129> hoses

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
there there's the two coolant hoses

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.790 
there there's the two coolant hoses
you've<00:00:45.030> got<00:00:45.210> army<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.260> take<00:00:46.590> those<00:00:46.739> two

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
you've got army so you take those two

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.650 
you've got army so you take those two
bolts<00:00:47.100> out<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.340> then<00:00:47.579> two<00:00:47.940> hoses<00:00:48.149> off<00:00:48.420> and

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
bolts out and then two hoses off and

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.540 
bolts out and then two hoses off and
then<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.840> can<00:00:48.989> replace<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.860> don't<00:00:50.460> air

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
then you can replace that I don't air

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.430 
then you can replace that I don't air
control<00:00:50.940> valve<00:00:50.969> now<00:00:51.629> there's<00:00:51.809> also<00:00:52.020> another

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
on I believe they're ten millimeters I

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.750 
on I believe they're ten millimeters I
think<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.540> other<00:02:27.660> one<00:02:27.840> or<00:02:27.930> twelve<00:02:28.319> so<00:02:29.069> you<00:02:29.400> can

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
think the other one or twelve so you can

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.160 
think the other one or twelve so you can
go<00:02:29.910> ahead<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.180> take<00:02:30.300> those<00:02:30.540> off<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:31.019> then

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
go ahead and take those off and then

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.960 
go ahead and take those off and then
you'll<00:02:31.860> unplug<00:02:32.310> this<00:02:32.519> piece<00:02:32.730> right<00:02:32.910> here

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
you'll unplug this piece right here

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.520 
you'll unplug this piece right here
which<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:33.780> believe<00:02:34.049> is<00:02:34.140> it's<00:02:34.230> going<00:02:34.349> to<00:02:34.410> be<00:02:34.500> a

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
which I believe is it's going to be a

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.170 
which I believe is it's going to be a
squeeze<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:34.860> pull<00:02:35.190> just<00:02:35.519> like<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.819> other<00:02:35.970> one

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
squeeze and pull just like the other one

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.809

in there pretty good you may have to

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.380 
in there pretty good you may have to
take<00:03:05.190> like<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.400> little<00:03:05.549> screwdrivers<00:03:06.090> on<00:03:06.269> them

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
take like a little screwdrivers on them

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.550 
take like a little screwdrivers on them
but<00:03:07.340> let's<00:03:08.340> say<00:03:08.670> I<00:03:08.880> just<00:03:09.750> kind<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.200> set<00:03:10.410> them<00:03:10.470> on

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
but let's say I just kind of set them on

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.140 
but let's say I just kind of set them on
in<00:03:10.739> here<00:03:10.920> so<00:03:11.160> shouldn't<00:03:11.430> be<00:03:11.549> too<00:03:11.700> hard<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.970> get

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
in here so shouldn't be too hard to get

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.110
