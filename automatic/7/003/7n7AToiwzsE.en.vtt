00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.719
 Y 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.719
 turn around 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:27.490
 [Music] 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.750
 hello how are you today a mini 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.169
 dance on the channel 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.629
 I am already saw and how can you see the title 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.900
 today I'm going to make the video 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:40.239
 on how to organize a children's party 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.220
 and especially if it is for the first year 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.879
 we are talking about that many moms 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.650
 they decide not to do the children's party 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.070
 when the first year is completed because 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.559
 they say to and it is that it is not going to remember it or not 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.330
 will understand anything or is going to harass and 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.330
 will be crying during all the 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.790
 party for so many people then already 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.830
 depends on the judgment of each mom my 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.619
 criterion was I'm going to organize a 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.720
 giselle party but it's simple is 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.780
 economic 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.450
 and it's nice I have here some times for 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.870
 that you can organize all that and then 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.420
 let's start with number one do one 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.400
 guest list is very important 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.800
 before starting anything before 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.210
 start buying things like crazy is very 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.520
 important that you make a list of 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.650
 guests since based on the list you go 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.770
 to be able to buy all things and 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.450
 for how many people are you then 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.370
 I recommend that you invite people who 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.500
 you really want me to be on this day 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.380
 so special for you and your son or your 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.900
 daughter then also took into account that 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.700
 if you invite a person that person 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.240
 You can take a guest to you 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.430
 you say you know her then yes it's very 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.070
 important that you make a list 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.820
 detailed exactly how many people 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.130
 they want me to go to is number two choose 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.500
 a place since you have the list of 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.930
 guests then it's time to choose 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.509
 place because you already know approximately 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.119
 how many people are going to go then 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.760
 you decide to do it in a garden take in 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.780
 that you have to see garcÃ­a 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.030
 and if it is on the day then tents and all that 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.170
 then a provides to do it in a 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:27.099
 garden is that there is more space is free 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.349
 number 3 choose a date but if your 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.569
 son just like I did my birthday 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.099
 in summer for example my girl 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.530
 July 18th fulfillment 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.950
 there I decided to do it in a garden 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.420
 then it has been important that it is that 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.430
 Check the date I wanted you 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.700
 make the party the same if he celebrates years in 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.650
 December you can delay the one of the 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.269
 this party you can do in summer 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.340
 but it's a matter of every mom 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.560
 then it is very important to be the date 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.980
 because based there is going to be the 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.560
 theme of the whole m24 choose an hour 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.670
 or that you already have the date but take 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:06.060
 note that if the party is in summer 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.530
 and it is at three o'clock in the afternoon 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.080
 be the sun and the heat 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.030
 we all have then left then 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.310
 you'll have to invent tents and other 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.010
 things then it is very important to choose 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.780
 the date because for example if you choose 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.360
 doing it in the morning will have to be a 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.040
 breakfast at 9 in the morning and take in 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.010
 realize that there are many many popes 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.440
 they still work at that time then yes 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.230
 think very well about the time you want 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:35.040
 are about to number 5 you must choose 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.140
 the theme of the party if your child already has 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.560
 more than 5 years I think he already has a 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.590
 favorite character then well since 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.060
 It would be the child's choice but yes if your case 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.940
 it's like mine that is just going to meet 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.650
 one year there you can move and the 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.750
 what do you like or what else 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.690
 I would like you to like your daughter or you 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.170
 son then there yes scroll and choose 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.420
 the one you like most point number 6 is 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.489
 now from the invitations to 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.060
 beginning when you made the list view 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:08.180
 you put dian 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.010
 it is assumed that if they are husbands 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.420
 obviously they do not deliver a 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.099
 invitation to each 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.100
 obviously you are going to deliver the invitation 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:18.829
 per family but for example if it is this 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.630
 an aunt and an uncle who have a daughter who 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.200
 she is already married and has her own family 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.190
 yes you must make two invitations 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.770
 so it is very important that 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.120
 checks and armes for per family this 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.310
 [Music] 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.370
 so you send the invitations point 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.470
 number 7 the decoration of the party 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:41.460
 you have to see that a children's party 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.979
 He carries colorful balloons that 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.590
 takes centerpieces according to the 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:48.690
 subject then it is very important that I know 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.960
 which is all the decoration that you want 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.780
 who wants me to go in each 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.570
 table on every corner in all that 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.760
 so then also the most important 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.729
 are the centerpieces because the 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.949
 centerpieces like that they make the hit of 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:07.650
 the decoration then yes it is very 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:09.750
 important to check what type of decoration 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.550
 you want and also that it's not a 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.280
 very dangerous decoration for 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:17.100
 little children so they can help us 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:20.430
 hurt or perhaps an accident but if 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:23.910
 Check the decoration of the party 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.400
 point number 8 choose the catering that 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.490
 have mean the food that is what 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.789
 is going to eat during the party 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.889
 depends on the type of food that is going to be 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.319
 it depends on the party for example in my 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:41.340
 case if I went I was good at the party 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:46.220
 and it's going to be at 3 o'clock in the afternoon 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:49.139
 garden on a Saturday then there are two 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.599
 there are two types of catering that is for 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:53.400
 adults and for children takes in 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:56.340
 account that children do not all 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.229
 like the pig then if you must good 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.199
 I suggest and is a very good day 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:03.120
 I put you is to separate the two meals 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:06.509
 separate food from adults with the 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.460
 of children number nine to children what 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:11.920
 what they like most at a party is the 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.450
 birthday cake then 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.760
 and it is very important that since it is the 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:18.340
 birthday cake and that you decide what 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:23.410
 that you want it to be a big cake 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:26.080
 round brownies cupcakes the side 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:28.150
 then it's up to you on my part 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.880
 I was partying and they say I chose to do 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:34.330
 cupcakes and I myself skype 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.370
