for the eye for I've seen people modify

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.359 
for the eye for I've seen people modify
like<00:00:17.539> events<00:00:18.539> ones<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.590> profiler<00:00:20.100> ones

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
like events ones and and profiler ones

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.800 
like events ones and and profiler ones
and<00:00:20.580> girls<00:00:20.640> ones<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.119> try<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.300> fit<00:00:21.570> them<00:00:21.630> onto

and girls ones to try to fit them onto

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.120 
and girls ones to try to fit them onto
their<00:00:21.960> eye<00:00:22.020> force<00:00:22.380> but<00:00:22.560> they've<00:00:22.680> never<00:00:22.800> quite

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
their eye force but they've never quite

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.279 
their eye force but they've never quite
worked<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:24.000> these<00:00:24.269> are<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.570> first<00:00:24.720> ones<00:00:25.050> that

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
worked so these are the first ones that

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.750 
worked so these are the first ones that
are<00:00:25.380> designed<00:00:25.710> specifically<00:00:26.279> for<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.730> eye

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
are designed specifically for the eye

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.580 
are designed specifically for the eye
for<00:00:27.180> masks<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:28.140> again<00:00:28.320> they're<00:00:28.439> made<00:00:28.560> by

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
for masks and again they're made by

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.290 
for masks and again they're made by
Atlas<00:00:29.010> research<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.580> they're<00:00:29.670> exclusive<00:00:30.150> to

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300

Atlas research and they're exclusive to
us<00:00:30.349> a<00:00:31.820> there<00:00:32.820> are<00:00:32.850> two<00:00:33.000> different<00:00:33.239> versions<00:00:33.500> in

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
us a there are two different versions in

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.780 
us a there are two different versions in
two<00:00:34.800> different<00:00:34.920> colors<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.370> you've<00:00:35.489> got<00:00:35.610> white

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
you've got a soft and a hard version of

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.639 
you've got a soft and a hard version of
it<00:00:39.270> right<00:00:39.450> here<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.719> one<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:39.960> my<00:00:40.020> hand<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.620> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
are all the same in design as far as

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.240 
are all the same in design as far as
what<00:00:48.210> their<00:00:48.360> shape<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.050> how<00:00:50.010> they're<00:00:50.160> gonna

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
what their shape and how they're gonna

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.979 
what their shape and how they're gonna
mount<00:00:50.489> up<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:51.300> can<00:00:51.390> see<00:00:51.480> you've<00:00:51.600> got<00:00:51.719> four

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
mount up you can see you've got four

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.840 
mount up you can see you've got four
posts<00:00:52.379> on<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.590> bottom<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.160> each<00:00:53.340> post<00:00:53.640> has

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
posts on the bottom and each post has

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.319 
posts on the bottom and each post has
two<00:00:54.120> different<00:00:55.010> ridges<00:00:56.010> or<00:00:56.340> grooves<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.879> so

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
two different ridges or grooves in it so

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.299 
two different ridges or grooves in it so
you<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.719> either<00:00:57.960> put<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.440> all<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.649> way<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.980> and

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
you can either put it all the way in and

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.790 
you can either put it all the way in and
make<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.969> mask<00:01:00.149> super<00:01:00.570> low<00:01:00.780> or<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.170> lower

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
make the the mask super low or a lower

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.210 
make the the mask super low or a lower
profile<00:01:02.219> bring<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.609> down<00:01:02.820> or<00:01:03.300> put<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
profile bring it down or put it on the

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.649 
profile bring it down or put it on the
bottom<00:01:05.220> Ridge<00:01:05.610> basically<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.270> have<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.479> sit

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
bottom Ridge basically and have it sit

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:07.910 
bottom Ridge basically and have it sit
up<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.840> little<00:01:06.990> bit<00:01:07.110> higher<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.320> depending<00:01:07.860> on

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
up a little bit higher so depending on

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.670 
up a little bit higher so depending on
how<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.159> want<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.610> sit<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:08.970> your<00:01:09.360> eye<00:01:09.390> for

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
how you want it to sit on your eye for

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.760 
how you want it to sit on your eye for
you<00:01:10.680> can<00:01:10.799> kind<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.040> control<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.810> and<00:01:12.810> conform

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
you can kind of control that and conform

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.870 
you can kind of control that and conform
it<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.890> how<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.070> want<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.400> fit<00:01:14.520> or<00:01:14.670> maybe<00:01:14.790> you

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
it to how you want to fit or maybe you

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.310 
it to how you want to fit or maybe you
want<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.119> sides<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.600> be<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.720> little<00:01:15.900> lower<00:01:16.110> than

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
want the sides to be a little lower than

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.350 
want the sides to be a little lower than
the<00:01:16.439> top<00:01:16.650> or<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.220> middle<00:01:17.460> or<00:01:17.610> vice<00:01:18.000> versa<00:01:18.270> so

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
the top or the middle or vice versa so

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.280 
the top or the middle or vice versa so
you<00:01:18.420> could<00:01:18.540> do<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.689> either<00:01:18.720> way<00:01:20.630> there<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.840> a

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
you could do it either way there is a

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.499 
you could do it either way there is a
little<00:01:22.470> piece<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.700> double<00:01:23.700> stick<00:01:23.850> velcro<00:01:24.090> that

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
little piece of double stick velcro that

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.230 
little piece of double stick velcro that
comes<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:24.840> each<00:01:25.049> visor<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.009> sides<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.970> that

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
comes on each visor on the sides so that

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.539 
comes on each visor on the sides so that
you<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.750> stick<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.100> side<00:01:29.280> right<00:01:29.490> here

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
you can stick it to the side right here

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.999 
you can stick it to the side right here
if<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.360> don't<00:01:30.570> use<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.869> velcro<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.619> edges

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
if you don't use the velcro the edges

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.950 
if you don't use the velcro the edges
will<00:01:32.189> tend<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.610> stick<00:01:32.880> out<00:01:33.150> just<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.600> little<00:01:33.630> bit

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
will tend to stick out just a little bit

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.590 
will tend to stick out just a little bit
so<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.829> velcro<00:01:35.009> can<00:01:35.310> bring<00:01:35.490> them<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.700> or<00:01:36.479> if

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
so the velcro can bring them in or if

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.760 
so the velcro can bring them in or if
you<00:01:36.689> don't<00:01:36.840> really<00:01:36.930> care<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
you don't really care and you like the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.170 
you don't really care and you like the
way<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:37.950> looks<00:01:38.100> sticking<00:01:38.400> out<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.000> leave

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
way it looks sticking out you can leave

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.700 
way it looks sticking out you can leave
the<00:01:39.270> velcro<00:01:39.450> off<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.020> just<00:01:40.229> have<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> stick<00:01:40.560> up

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
the velcro off and just have a stick up

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.060 
the velcro off and just have a stick up
it's<00:01:40.979> up<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:42.409> again<00:01:43.409> two<00:01:43.710> different

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
it's up to you so again two different

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.550 
it's up to you so again two different
hardnesses<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> hard<00:01:46.439> one

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
hardnesses to it this is the hard one

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.749 
hardnesses to it this is the hard one
right<00:01:46.590> here<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:46.979> there's<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.189> hard<00:01:47.399> one<00:01:47.520> on

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
right here and there's a hard one on

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.940 
right here and there's a hard one on
this<00:01:48.000> mask<00:01:48.270> right<00:01:48.479> here<00:01:48.560> so<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.649> can<00:01:49.770> see

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
this mask right here so you can see

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.690 
this mask right here so you can see
there<00:01:50.189> isn't

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
there isn't

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.420 
there isn't
I<00:01:50.729> can<00:01:51.570> flex<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.140> but<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.530> doesn't<00:01:52.860> flex<00:01:53.100> really

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
I can flex it but it doesn't flex really

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.100 
I can flex it but it doesn't flex really
well<00:01:53.729> I'm<00:01:53.909> pushing<00:01:54.299> on<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.509> pretty<00:01:54.659> good<00:01:54.780> right

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
well I'm pushing on it pretty good right

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.280 
well I'm pushing on it pretty good right
there<00:01:55.350> but<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.369> soft<00:01:56.610> one

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
there but the soft one

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.230 
there but the soft one
super<00:01:58.290> easy<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.649> flex<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.490> with<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.790> soft<00:02:00.030> one

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
super easy to flex so with the soft one

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.120 
super easy to flex so with the soft one
here<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.570> might<00:02:00.780> be<00:02:01.409> prone<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.710> get<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.950> little

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
here you might be prone to get a little

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.639 
here you might be prone to get a little
bit<00:02:02.219> more<00:02:02.310> bounce<00:02:02.549> out<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.450> if<00:02:04.439> you're

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
bit more bounce out of it so if you're

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.630 
bit more bounce out of it so if you're
new<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.890> tournament<00:02:05.280> play<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.549> you're

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
new to tournament play and you're

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.609 
new to tournament play and you're
looking<00:02:05.880> for<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.320> maximum<00:02:07.320> amount<00:02:07.530> of

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
looking for the maximum amount of

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.169 
looking for the maximum amount of
bounces<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.310> can<00:02:08.489> get<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.849> would

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
bounces that you can get I would

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.820 
bounces that you can get I would
probably<00:02:09.420> go<00:02:09.690> with<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.899> softer<00:02:10.349> one<00:02:10.500> if

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
probably go with the softer one if

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.589 
probably go with the softer one if
you're<00:02:11.160> looking<00:02:11.340> for<00:02:11.489> more<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.879> a

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
you're looking for more of a

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.649 
you're looking for more of a
more<00:02:13.590> on<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.280> protection<00:02:14.879> side<00:02:15.299> where<00:02:15.569> you

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
more on the protection side where you

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.289 
more on the protection side where you
want<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.900> just<00:02:15.930> not<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.980> potentially<00:02:17.549> get<00:02:17.670> any

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
want to just not to potentially get any

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.630 
want to just not to potentially get any
kind<00:02:18.629> of<00:02:18.750> pain<00:02:19.379> out<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.650> getting<00:02:19.890> shot<00:02:20.159> where

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
kind of pain out of getting shot where

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.240 
kind of pain out of getting shot where
the<00:02:20.790> visor<00:02:21.000> would<00:02:21.269> cover<00:02:21.799> go<00:02:22.799> with<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.040> hard

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
the visor would cover go with the hard

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.039 
the visor would cover go with the hard
one<00:02:23.400> it's<00:02:23.790> definitely<00:02:24.209> a<00:02:24.239> lot<00:02:24.510> harder<00:02:24.540> and

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
one it's definitely a lot harder and

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.780 
one it's definitely a lot harder and
then<00:02:25.530> again<00:02:25.739> same<00:02:26.010> for<00:02:26.159> the<00:02:26.219> white<00:02:26.370> we've<00:02:26.579> got
