rubbing alcohol a sponge and some salt

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.360 
rubbing alcohol a sponge and some salt
regular<00:00:31.179> table<00:00:31.570> salt<00:00:31.829> so<00:00:33.059> let's<00:00:34.059> start<00:00:34.390> with

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
regular table salt so let's start with

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.799 
regular table salt so let's start with
the<00:00:36.370> spattering<00:00:36.820> technique<00:00:37.300> you<00:00:37.510> can<00:00:37.660> also

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
the spattering technique you can also

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.470 
the spattering technique you can also
use<00:00:37.930> a<00:00:38.140> brush<00:00:38.530> regular<00:00:38.980> brush<00:00:39.219> for<00:00:39.460> this<00:00:39.670> but

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
use a brush regular brush for this but

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.639 
use a brush regular brush for this but
all<00:00:40.629> you<00:00:40.750> have<00:00:40.840> to<00:00:40.930> do<00:00:41.050> is<00:00:41.260> just<00:00:41.860> save<00:00:42.039> some<00:00:42.070> old

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
all you have to do is just save some old

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.889 
all you have to do is just save some old
toothbrushes<00:00:44.649> and<00:00:44.890> add<00:00:45.879> some<00:00:46.149> water<00:00:46.329> to<00:00:46.449> it<00:00:46.629> to

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
toothbrushes and add some water to it to

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.610 
toothbrushes and add some water to it to
moisten<00:00:47.140> it<00:00:47.440> and<00:00:48.449> just<00:00:49.449> dip<00:00:49.660> it<00:00:49.780> into<00:00:49.930> the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
moisten it and just dip it into the

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.450 
moisten it and just dip it into the
color<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.840> I<00:00:53.320> usually<00:00:53.680> just<00:00:53.710> use<00:00:53.920> my<00:00:54.160> thumb

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
color and I usually just use my thumb

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.810 
color and I usually just use my thumb
and<00:00:54.730> usually<00:00:55.120> spray<00:00:55.510> very<00:00:56.410> close<00:00:56.680> to<00:00:56.859> paper

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
and usually spray very close to paper

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.590 
and usually spray very close to paper
and<00:00:58.440> spatter<00:00:59.440> you'll<00:00:59.739> get<00:00:59.949> a<00:01:00.570> technique<00:01:01.570> that

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
and spatter you'll get a technique that

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.310 
and spatter you'll get a technique that
simulates<00:01:02.579> airbrushing<00:01:03.869> this<00:01:04.869> could<00:01:05.049> be<00:01:05.080> used

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
simulates airbrushing this could be used

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.429 
simulates airbrushing this could be used
for<00:01:05.409> texture<00:01:05.979> on<00:01:06.340> things<00:01:07.119> like<00:01:07.270> fruits<00:01:08.259> and

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
for texture on things like fruits and

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.859 
for texture on things like fruits and
vegetables<00:01:08.920> or<00:01:09.220> like<00:01:09.820> rock<00:01:10.090> surfaces<00:01:10.689> and

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
vegetables or like rock surfaces and

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.380 
vegetables or like rock surfaces and
landscapes<00:01:11.409> and<00:01:11.820> all<00:01:12.820> you<00:01:12.909> have<00:01:12.970> to<00:01:13.119> do<00:01:13.240> is

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
landscapes and all you have to do is

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.950 
landscapes and all you have to do is
just<00:01:14.369> get<00:01:15.369> some<00:01:16.210> water<00:01:16.390> on<00:01:16.509> you<00:01:16.780> can<00:01:16.930> make

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
just get some water on you can make

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.830 
just get some water on you can make
larger<00:01:17.829> spattering<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.960> will<00:01:20.140> change<00:01:20.560> value

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
larger spattering that will change value

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.230 
larger spattering that will change value
the<00:01:22.840> other<00:01:22.960> technique<00:01:23.409> you<00:01:23.560> can<00:01:23.590> use<00:01:23.770> is<00:01:24.280> you

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
the other technique you can use is you

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.840 
the other technique you can use is you
just<00:01:25.479> take<00:01:25.659> some<00:01:26.700> color<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:30.310> can<00:01:30.430> add<00:01:30.579> some

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
just take some color and we can add some

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.480 
just take some color and we can add some
salt<00:01:31.119> to<00:01:31.240> this<00:01:31.570> now<00:01:32.200> salt<00:01:33.780> soaks<00:01:34.780> up<00:01:35.020> water<00:01:35.490> so

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
salt to this now salt soaks up water so

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.389 
salt to this now salt soaks up water so
if<00:01:36.909> you<00:01:37.210> have<00:01:37.450> too<00:01:37.750> much<00:01:37.899> pigment<00:01:38.229> on<00:01:38.649> the

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
if you have too much pigment on the

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.249 
if you have too much pigment on the
paper<00:01:39.640> it<00:01:40.030> will<00:01:40.180> not<00:01:40.770> soak<00:01:41.770> up<00:01:41.799> any<00:01:42.189> of<00:01:42.369> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
paper it will not soak up any of the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.440 
paper it will not soak up any of the
water<00:01:44.259> so<00:01:44.710> it<00:01:45.009> should<00:01:45.219> be<00:01:45.250> watery<00:01:45.729> and<00:01:46.060> I<00:01:46.240> up

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
water so it should be watery and I up

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.039 
water so it should be watery and I up
view<00:01:46.750> is<00:01:47.020> just<00:01:47.290> add<00:01:48.159> some<00:01:48.640> salt<00:01:49.600> to<00:01:49.960> the

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
view is just add some salt to the

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.050 
view is just add some salt to the
surface<00:01:50.290> and<00:01:50.740> what<00:01:50.860> it<00:01:50.979> does<00:01:51.159> is<00:01:51.399> it<00:01:51.430> picks<00:01:51.880> up

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
surface and what it does is it picks up

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.550 
surface and what it does is it picks up
the<00:01:52.780> pigment<00:01:53.880> picks<00:01:54.880> up<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.149> water<00:01:55.560> around

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
the pigment picks up the water around

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.249 
the pigment picks up the water around
the<00:01:56.770> pigment<00:01:57.189> so<00:01:57.520> that<00:01:57.700> when<00:01:57.880> this<00:01:58.060> dries<00:01:58.299> you

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
the pigment so that when this dries you

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.230 
the pigment so that when this dries you
just<00:01:59.469> rub<00:02:00.009> it<00:02:00.159> off<00:02:00.310> and<00:02:00.610> you'll<00:02:00.729> get<00:02:00.939> this

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
just rub it off and you'll get this

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.959 
just rub it off and you'll get this
little<00:02:01.570> speckling<00:02:02.229> on<00:02:02.439> the<00:02:03.250> surface<00:02:03.670> of<00:02:03.850> your

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
little speckling on the surface of your

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:09.560 
little speckling on the surface of your
paper<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:06.070> other<00:02:06.909> technique<00:02:07.509> you<00:02:07.719> can<00:02:07.780> use<00:02:07.960> is

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
paper the other technique you can use is

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.120 
paper the other technique you can use is
the<00:02:10.570> rubbing<00:02:10.900> alcohol<00:02:10.960> just<00:02:11.470> regular<00:02:11.830> rubbing

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
the rubbing alcohol just regular rubbing

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.020 
the rubbing alcohol just regular rubbing
alcohol<00:02:12.310> you<00:02:12.580> can<00:02:12.700> buy

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
alcohol you can buy

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.670 
alcohol you can buy
at<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.150> drugstore<00:02:13.480> or<00:02:13.810> any<00:02:14.350> store<00:02:14.709> that<00:02:15.040> has

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
at a drugstore or any store that has

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.500 
at a drugstore or any store that has
different<00:02:17.680> grades<00:02:17.890> of<00:02:18.040> rubbing<00:02:18.910> alcohol<00:02:19.030> you

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
different grades of rubbing alcohol you

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.400 
different grades of rubbing alcohol you
just<00:02:19.690> add<00:02:19.870> some<00:02:20.170> pigment<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:20.860> your<00:02:21.010> paper<00:02:21.370> and

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.870 

you<00:02:26.410> must<00:02:26.620> do<00:02:26.770> this<00:02:26.950> while<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.370> pigment<00:02:27.730> is

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
you must do this while the pigment is

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.460 
you must do this while the pigment is
wet<00:02:28.770> because<00:02:29.770> alcohol<00:02:30.130> will<00:02:31.230> push<00:02:32.230> the

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
wet because alcohol will push the

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.800 
wet because alcohol will push the
pigment<00:02:32.890> over<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:34.540> that<00:02:36.300> it<00:02:37.300> will<00:02:37.480> create

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
pigment over so that it will create

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.430 
pigment over so that it will create
these<00:02:38.970> circular<00:02:39.970> shapes<00:02:40.300> if<00:02:40.600> you<00:02:40.780> just<00:02:41.200> dip

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
these circular shapes if you just dip

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.140 
these circular shapes if you just dip
your<00:02:41.470> brush<00:02:41.800> into<00:02:42.069> the<00:02:42.310> alcohol<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:42.940> you<00:02:43.030> can

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
your brush into the alcohol and you can

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.390 
your brush into the alcohol and you can
just<00:02:43.330> touch<00:02:43.510> your<00:02:43.690> paper<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.380> it<00:02:44.530> will<00:02:44.709> push

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
just touch your paper and it will push

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.240 
just touch your paper and it will push
the<00:02:45.670> pigment<00:02:46.239> over<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:47.290> can<00:02:47.470> even<00:02:47.620> paint<00:02:48.010> with

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
the pigment over you can even paint with

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.890 
the pigment over you can even paint with
it<00:02:48.489> which<00:02:48.940> is<00:02:49.170> just<00:02:50.170> using<00:02:50.350> your<00:02:50.530> brush<00:02:51.120> in<00:02:52.120> any

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
it which is just using your brush in any

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.110 
it which is just using your brush in any
direction<00:02:53.110> you<00:02:53.410> like<00:02:53.709> and<00:02:53.950> you<00:02:53.980> will<00:02:54.459> start<00:02:55.060> to

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
direction you like and you will start to

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.470 
direction you like and you will start to
see<00:02:55.239> how<00:02:55.600> with<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:56.050> paint<00:02:56.350> I<00:02:56.650> will<00:02:57.400> move<00:02:58.209> over

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
see how with the paint I will move over

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.160 
see how with the paint I will move over
now<00:02:59.140> this<00:02:59.410> becomes<00:02:59.769> permanent<00:03:00.519> on<00:03:00.700> your<00:03:00.850> paper

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
now this becomes permanent on your paper

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.040 
now this becomes permanent on your paper
because<00:03:02.170> alcohol<00:03:04.170> alcohol<00:03:05.170> will<00:03:05.709> evaporate

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
because alcohol alcohol will evaporate

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.690 
because alcohol alcohol will evaporate
so<00:03:08.050> if<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:08.650> want<00:03:08.830> to<00:03:08.890> make<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.040> change<00:03:09.130> you

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
so if you want to make a change you

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.759 
so if you want to make a change you
should<00:03:09.940> not<00:03:10.090> use<00:03:10.360> alcohol<00:03:10.600> for<00:03:11.290> this<00:03:11.500> purpose

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
should not use alcohol for this purpose

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.590 
should not use alcohol for this purpose
but<00:03:12.040> it<00:03:12.160> has<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.340> very<00:03:12.670> interesting<00:03:12.790> effect

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
but it has a very interesting effect

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.250 
but it has a very interesting effect
where<00:03:13.810> for<00:03:14.500> landscape<00:03:15.069> or<00:03:15.340> for<00:03:16.260> creating

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
where for landscape or for creating

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.680 
where for landscape or for creating
different<00:03:17.620> values<00:03:18.220> in<00:03:18.610> something<00:03:19.239> like<00:03:19.329> stone

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
different values in something like stone

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.830 
different values in something like stone
or<00:03:21.030> sand<00:03:22.030> this<00:03:22.750> will<00:03:22.930> be<00:03:23.220> really<00:03:24.420> effective<00:03:25.420> in

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
or sand this will be really effective in

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.830 
or sand this will be really effective in
that<00:03:26.079> situation<00:03:26.489> if<00:03:27.489> you<00:03:27.930> want<00:03:28.930> to<00:03:29.140> create

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
that situation if you want to create

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.990 
that situation if you want to create
different<00:03:31.840> textures<00:03:32.350> with<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:33.370> sponge<00:03:33.730> I

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
different textures with the sponge I

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000 
different textures with the sponge I
usually<00:03:34.299> use<00:03:34.630> a<00:03:34.660> sea<00:03:35.110> sponge<00:03:35.290> because<00:03:35.709> has

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
usually use a sea sponge because has

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.000 
usually use a sea sponge because has
different<00:03:36.430> parts<00:03:37.180> that<00:03:37.780> are<00:03:37.959> at<00:03:38.620> different

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
different parts that are at different

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.410 
different parts that are at different
angles<00:03:39.190> so<00:03:39.670> when<00:03:39.820> you<00:03:39.910> dip<00:03:40.150> it<00:03:40.329> into<00:03:41.160> pigment

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
angles so when you dip it into pigment

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.729 
angles so when you dip it into pigment
you<00:03:43.420> can<00:03:43.600> create<00:03:43.840> different<00:03:44.320> kinds<00:03:44.650> of

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
you can create different kinds of

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.699 
you can create different kinds of
textures<00:03:45.130> with<00:03:46.090> this<00:03:46.390> you<00:03:47.140> can<00:03:47.290> use<00:03:47.320> this<00:03:47.500> as<00:03:47.680> a

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
textures with this you can use this as a

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.699 
textures with this you can use this as a
base<00:03:47.799> shape<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:49.090> then<00:03:49.600> paint<00:03:49.930> over<00:03:50.290> after

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
base shape and then paint over after

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.830 
base shape and then paint over after
it's<00:03:50.829> completely<00:03:51.280> dry<00:03:51.489> for<00:03:52.329> textural

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
it's completely dry for textural

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.750 
it's completely dry for textural
qualities<00:03:53.350> like<00:03:53.650> your<00:03:53.829> fruit<00:03:54.100> and<00:03:54.250> vegetables

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
qualities like your fruit and vegetables

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.370 
qualities like your fruit and vegetables
or<00:03:54.970> fours<00:03:55.750> landscape<00:03:57.180> stones<00:03:58.180> or<00:03:58.600> mountains

Rangers<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:02.190> last<00:04:03.190> technique<00:04:03.640> which<00:04:03.880> I'll

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
Rangers the last technique which I'll

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.830 
Rangers the last technique which I'll
show<00:04:04.359> which<00:04:04.750> is<00:04:04.930> using<00:04:05.260> a<00:04:05.320> regular<00:04:05.530> flat<00:04:06.070> brush

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
show which is using a regular flat brush

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.190 
show which is using a regular flat brush
you<00:04:07.840> can<00:04:07.870> do<00:04:08.170> a<00:04:08.200> dry<00:04:08.680> brush<00:04:08.739> technique<00:04:09.070> and

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
you can do a dry brush technique and

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.420 
you can do a dry brush technique and
usually<00:04:11.200> I<00:04:11.230> would<00:04:11.410> wet<00:04:11.850> the<00:04:12.850> brush<00:04:13.030> and<00:04:14.430> take

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
usually I would wet the brush and take

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.840 
usually I would wet the brush and take
all<00:04:15.730> the<00:04:16.060> water<00:04:16.510> out<00:04:16.810> with<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.919> rag<00:04:18.250> or<00:04:18.609> paper

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
all the water out with the rag or paper

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.650 
all the water out with the rag or paper
towel

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
towel

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:28.210 
towel
and<00:04:22.450> dip<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:23.900> tip<00:04:24.110> into<00:04:24.820> pigment<00:04:25.820> and<00:04:27.010> so<00:04:28.010> when

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
and dip the tip into pigment and so when

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.310 
and dip the tip into pigment and so when
you<00:04:28.310> paint<00:04:28.640> with<00:04:28.850> it<00:04:30.010> you<00:04:31.010> will<00:04:31.190> get<00:04:31.430> a<00:04:32.320> dry

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
you paint with it you will get a dry

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.880 
you paint with it you will get a dry
brush<00:04:33.380> technique<00:04:35.260> that<00:04:36.260> will<00:04:36.410> allow<00:04:36.680> you<00:04:36.740> to

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
brush technique that will allow you to

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.470 
brush technique that will allow you to
give<00:04:37.220> you<00:04:37.340> a<00:04:37.400> texture<00:04:37.820> that<00:04:37.940> looks<00:04:38.300> like

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
give you a texture that looks like

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.010 
give you a texture that looks like
weathered<00:04:38.960> wood<00:04:39.260> or<00:04:39.980> it<00:04:40.280> can<00:04:40.400> be<00:04:40.430> used<00:04:40.700> for

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
weathered wood or it can be used for

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.280 
weathered wood or it can be used for
strokes<00:04:42.020> that<00:04:42.170> go<00:04:42.590> into<00:04:43.960> something<00:04:44.960> like<00:04:45.080> an

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
strokes that go into something like an

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.440 
strokes that go into something like an
apple<00:04:45.680> they<00:04:45.770> have<00:04:45.890> streaks<00:04:46.250> in<00:04:46.520> it<00:04:46.550> and<00:04:46.850> is

long leaves and sharp or pointed leaves

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.540 
long leaves and sharp or pointed leaves
that<00:05:03.560> will<00:05:04.240> be<00:05:05.240> good<00:05:05.420> for<00:05:05.650> background<00:05:06.650> grass

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
that will be good for background grass

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.830 
that will be good for background grass
and<00:05:08.920> those<00:05:09.920> are<00:05:10.070> your<00:05:10.220> basic<00:05:10.510> special<00:05:11.510> effects

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
and those are your basic special effects

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.500 
and those are your basic special effects
