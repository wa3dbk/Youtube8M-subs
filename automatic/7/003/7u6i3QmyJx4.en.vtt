00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.529 

there<00:01:38.229> we<00:01:38.350> go<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.590> I<00:01:41.830> chose<00:01:42.670> blue<00:01:43.000> since<00:01:43.240> I<00:01:43.390> mean

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
there we go so I chose blue since I mean

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.210 
there we go so I chose blue since I mean
the<00:01:43.659> green<00:01:43.840> isn't<00:01:44.049> that<00:01:44.349> great<00:01:44.619> looking<00:01:45.009> and

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
the green isn't that great looking and

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.580 
the green isn't that great looking and

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
I'm red is a little too flashy I think

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.740 
I'm red is a little too flashy I think
so<00:01:48.369> I<00:01:48.399> decided<00:01:48.700> just<00:01:48.759> to<00:01:48.909> go<00:01:48.970> with<00:01:49.060> simple<00:01:49.569> blue

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.480 
so I decided just to go with simple blue

apparently lokay in the back just tells
you<00:02:11.400> which<00:02:12.400> would<00:02:12.579> be<00:02:12.760> right<00:02:13.329> there<00:02:14.100> let's<00:02:15.100> see

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
you which would be right there let's see

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.699 
you which would be right there let's see
right<00:02:17.970> there<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.959> see<00:02:20.139> that<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.560> black

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
right there you see that that black

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:21.509 
right there you see that that black
button<00:02:21.100> right<00:02:21.280> there

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
button right there

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.910 
button right there
that's<00:02:22.329> to<00:02:22.420> have<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.630> glow<00:02:22.780> button<00:02:23.139> and<00:02:23.410> that

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
that's to have to glow button and that

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.129 
that's to have to glow button and that
seems<00:02:24.130> like<00:02:24.250> that's<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.519> only<00:02:24.670> difference

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:25.139 
seems like that's the only difference

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.470 
seems like that's the only difference
the<00:02:26.139> analog<00:02:26.590> stick<00:02:26.859> the<00:02:27.340> grips<00:02:27.639> that's<00:02:28.420> the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
the analog stick the grips that's the

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.309 
the analog stick the grips that's the
only<00:02:28.600> thing<00:02:28.720> I'm<00:02:28.810> missing<00:02:28.989> from<00:02:29.230> the

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
only thing I'm missing from the

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.449 
only thing I'm missing from the
rock-candy<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:31.180> grips<00:02:31.450> were<00:02:31.709> hard<00:02:32.709> plastic

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
rock-candy the grips were hard plastic

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.550 
rock-candy the grips were hard plastic
well<00:02:34.090> this<00:02:34.239> is<00:02:34.389> rubber<00:02:34.750> so<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.109> grips<00:02:35.319> will

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
well this is rubber so the grips will

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.080 
well this is rubber so the grips will
waste<00:02:35.799> so<00:02:36.190> that's<00:02:36.579> not<00:02:36.730> something<00:02:37.000> I'm

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
waste so that's not something I'm

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.059 
waste so that's not something I'm
looking<00:02:37.180> forward<00:02:37.600> to<00:02:37.750> but<00:02:38.530> other<00:02:38.829> than<00:02:38.980> that

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
looking forward to but other than that

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.069 
looking forward to but other than that

too<00:04:30.810> sensitive<00:04:31.230> it<00:04:31.530> seems<00:04:31.710> like<00:04:31.830> they<00:04:31.950> flip

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190

the same actually the triggers feel a
little<00:04:36.090> bit<00:04:36.240> thicker<00:04:36.870> or<00:04:37.320> I<00:04:37.350> mean<00:04:37.560> a<00:04:37.590> little

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
little bit thicker or I mean a little

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.010 
little bit thicker or I mean a little
bit<00:04:37.950> more<00:04:38.280> stiff<00:04:38.580> and<00:04:39.300> then<00:04:39.419> the<00:04:39.540> rock<00:04:39.720> candy

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
bit more stiff and then the rock candy

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.120 
bit more stiff and then the rock candy
but<00:04:40.140> then<00:04:40.260> again<00:04:40.350> I<00:04:40.500> had<00:04:40.710> that<00:04:40.890> for<00:04:41.040> a<00:04:41.070> while

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
but then again I had that for a while

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.710 
but then again I had that for a while
that<00:04:41.430> was<00:04:41.580> my<00:04:41.700> primary<00:04:41.940> control<00:04:42.360> my<00:04:42.510> only

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.320 
that was my primary control my only
control<00:04:43.020> after<00:04:43.169> a<00:04:43.290> while<00:04:43.440> is<00:04:44.310> so<00:04:44.640> that's<00:04:45.120> it

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
control after a while is so that's it
