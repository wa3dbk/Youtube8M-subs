00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
here it could be the battery could be

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.020 
here it could be the battery could be
the<00:01:50.509> battery<00:01:50.930> charging<00:01:51.530> circuitry<00:01:52.190> or<00:01:52.370> it

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
the battery charging circuitry or it

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.100 
the battery charging circuitry or it
could<00:01:53.210> just<00:01:53.240> be<00:01:53.450> Windows<00:01:53.840> I'm<00:01:53.960> gonna

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
could just be Windows I'm gonna

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.630 
could just be Windows I'm gonna
eliminate<00:01:54.350> a<00:01:54.590> software<00:01:55.040> problem<00:01:55.250> with<00:01:55.520> what

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
eliminate a software problem with what

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.940 
eliminate a software problem with what
I'm<00:01:55.730> about<00:01:55.910> to<00:01:56.060> do<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:57.380> can<00:01:57.500> see<00:01:57.650> it<00:01:57.770> says

I'm about to do you can see it says

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.030 
I'm about to do you can see it says
plug-in<00:01:58.430> not<00:01:58.610> charging<00:01:59.060> 31%<00:01:59.840> available<00:02:03.040> so

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
plug-in not charging 31% available so

software<00:03:43.829> issue

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.849 

it<00:04:03.790> may<00:04:03.969> be<00:04:04.030> an<00:04:04.209> issue<00:04:04.360> with<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:04.810> BIOS<00:04:05.409> I'm<00:04:05.709> not

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
it may be an issue with the BIOS I'm not

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.720 
it may be an issue with the BIOS I'm not
sure<00:04:06.099> I<00:04:06.129> recently<00:04:06.730> updated<00:04:06.939> the<00:04:07.269> BIOS<00:04:07.659> but<00:04:08.730> it

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
sure I recently updated the BIOS but it

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.160 
sure I recently updated the BIOS but it
was<00:04:09.849> having<00:04:10.030> the<00:04:10.180> problem<00:04:10.480> before<00:04:10.629> I<00:04:10.870> have<00:04:11.019> to

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
was having the problem before I have to

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.250 
was having the problem before I have to
get<00:04:11.319> the<00:04:11.379> BIOS<00:04:11.680> as<00:04:11.920> far<00:04:12.099> as<00:04:12.219> I<00:04:12.310> can<00:04:12.370> tell<00:04:12.730> so

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
get the BIOS as far as I can tell so

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.909 
get the BIOS as far as I can tell so
that's<00:04:14.260> not<00:04:14.439> the<00:04:14.650> issue<00:04:16.079> it<00:04:17.079> may<00:04:17.350> very<00:04:17.650> well<00:04:17.739> be

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
that's not the issue it may very well be

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.800 
that's not the issue it may very well be
that<00:04:18.430> the<00:04:18.579> batteries<00:04:18.970> that<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.449> battery

may invest in a new battery that might
be<00:04:28.870> what's<00:04:29.110> next<00:04:29.560> for<00:04:29.710> this<00:04:31.350> but<00:04:32.350> anyway<00:04:32.680> there

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
be what's next for this but anyway there

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.680 
be what's next for this but anyway there
you<00:04:32.919> go<00:04:33.190> if<00:04:33.340> you're<00:04:33.460> having<00:04:33.699> this<00:04:33.910> problem<00:04:34.270> and

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
you go if you're having this problem and

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.950 
you go if you're having this problem and
I'm<00:04:34.780> having<00:04:35.050> which<00:04:35.410> apparently<00:04:35.800> is<00:04:36.960> common

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
I'm having which apparently is common

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.960 
I'm having which apparently is common
enough<00:04:38.020> for<00:04:38.500> HP<00:04:38.919> to<00:04:39.070> actually<00:04:39.460> have<00:04:39.610> a<00:04:39.639> page

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970

small<00:05:09.880> let's<00:05:10.090> scan<00:05:10.360> the<00:05:10.510> system<00:05:10.870> and<00:05:11.020> see<00:05:11.139> what

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
small let's scan the system and see what

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:19.500 
small let's scan the system and see what
it<00:05:11.349> does<00:05:16.020> so<00:05:17.020> there's<00:05:17.770> that<00:05:18.010> anyway<00:05:19.000> like<00:05:19.389> I

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
it does so there's that anyway like I

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:20.930 
it does so there's that anyway like I
was<00:05:19.539> saying<00:05:19.659> if<00:05:20.020> you're<00:05:20.169> having<00:05:20.349> this<00:05:20.560> problem

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
was saying if you're having this problem

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.930 
was saying if you're having this problem
try<00:05:21.940> what<00:05:22.180> I<00:05:22.210> just<00:05:22.599> did<00:05:22.840> before<00:05:23.050> you<00:05:23.610> like<00:05:24.610> send

try what I just did before you like send

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.969 
try what I just did before you like send
it<00:05:25.030> in<00:05:25.150> or<00:05:25.330> get<00:05:25.630> a<00:05:25.659> new<00:05:25.810> battery<00:05:26.020> or<00:05:26.349> get<00:05:26.800> a<00:05:26.830> new

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
it in or get a new battery or get a new

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.830 
it in or get a new battery or get a new
motherboard<00:05:27.220> or<00:05:27.520> whatever<00:05:27.820> because<00:05:28.630> it<00:05:28.750> may

this<00:05:32.199> may<00:05:32.409> very<00:05:32.710> well<00:05:32.770> be<00:05:32.919> a<00:05:33.039> BIOS<00:05:33.430> problem<00:05:33.880> I

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
this may very well be a BIOS problem I

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.189 
this may very well be a BIOS problem I
may<00:05:34.150> very<00:05:34.360> well<00:05:34.479> have<00:05:34.659> to<00:05:34.750> replace<00:05:35.020> the

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 
may very well have to replace the

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:40.020 
may very well have to replace the
motherboard<00:05:36.240> but<00:05:37.240> I<00:05:37.300> don't<00:05:37.539> know<00:05:37.690> that<00:05:39.030> so

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
motherboard but I don't know that so

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.969 
motherboard but I don't know that so
we'll<00:05:40.210> see<00:05:40.389> it's<00:05:41.080> not<00:05:41.169> like<00:05:41.229> I<00:05:41.470> port<00:05:41.830> this

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
we'll see it's not like I port this

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:44.779 
we'll see it's not like I port this
around<00:05:42.310> anyways<00:05:42.729> well<00:05:43.330> I<00:05:43.360> do<00:05:43.510> it<00:05:44.169> used<00:05:44.349> to<00:05:44.500> and

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
around anyways well I do it used to and

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:47.070 
around anyways well I do it used to and
it<00:05:45.789> turns<00:05:45.970> out<00:05:46.120> I<00:05:46.150> have<00:05:46.330> to<00:05:46.449> use<00:05:46.630> this<00:05:46.810> for<00:05:47.020> the

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
it turns out I have to use this for the

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.990 
it turns out I have to use this for the
next<00:05:47.169> couple<00:05:47.320> of<00:05:47.620> days<00:05:47.740> anyway<00:05:47.979> because<00:05:48.760> we're

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
next couple of days anyway because we're

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.960 
next couple of days anyway because we're
doing<00:05:49.150> a<00:05:49.210> project<00:05:49.449> that<00:05:49.780> requires<00:05:50.169> me<00:05:50.409> to<00:05:50.440> use

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
doing a project that requires me to use
