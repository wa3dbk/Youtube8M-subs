00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:08.090
 that's knee-length an eight-year-old is on 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.900
 mare from Holland 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:18.600
 her father her father comes from belgium 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:25.080
 Worry woman proudly kill and the mother 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:28.939
 from iceland of this fleet gilli one 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.529
 daughter of judy woman flights more 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:45.539
 who again in son of crossgate flights 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:49.200
 Mary, this is also a big strong one 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:57.960
 even goes on heat leaves in the construction 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:01:07.100
 is not fixed and is very good 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:07.100
 you pay looks dropped 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.930
 the customer saves the micro on it again 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.930
 do 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:37.520
 now hope city ​​could all yes 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:41.179
 just about to see that they are about one 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.060
 Grotten braves drives is she came 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:46.789
 several three common to us we have 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.890
 she's turned on last month 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.099
 in the front still beaten with plastic 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.009
 still beaten and kills though 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:58.939
 in the meantime easy if 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.409
 currently only at a slow pace 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.329
 but you really do not have to do much 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.030
 and does not drive a bit 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:08.989
 gossamer the contact to the mouth and it 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.269
 is extremely comfortable is something with her 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:17.709
 small movement so what mother was 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:17.709
 I simply camp without any problems 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.220
 logically no sport goes with the 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.940
 Movements but a great free time 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:33.230
 Drives can go anywhere from anyone 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:38.840
 to be ridden is completely normal 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.519
 You have to learn a beautiful head 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.560
 nothing particularly to the clock is 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.180
 maybe ever she falls in there 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.290
 tab in the meat if you like the meat 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.750
 lets go for too long 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.709
 I'll just stop it 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.250
 Trapp 1 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:56.109
 then that is again bite on paper 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.849
 perhaps through the step again and 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:01.700
 came again easily posed 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.919
 and it is also not making them the 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.780
 stairs and directly as soon as my reins 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:08.329
 loose is the indian and a beautiful one 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.790
 piece further killed and she must 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.380
 actually just rode on 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.200
 because you have to make especially since 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.540
 just let them apply that way 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.220
 so more and more routine in tölt 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.169
 and then she is guaranteed 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.669
 also like all ferries that way in the art 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.669
 they are also faster 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.930
 to walk a bit already 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.910
 just by she actually has to 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.000
 First and foremost , it simply has to be 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:39.020
 to be comfortably ridden in the tent 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.120
 great horse also for a little bit anxious 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.790
 Beginners are just a sweetie 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.260
 good easy to ride 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.260
 would like to have traveled 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.830
 as easy as the door is too 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:02.100
 the day on very pleasant relief 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.650
 riding now is easy to imagine 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.650
 that you could ride so distant 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.890
 also very comfortable do not move as you do 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.810
 so you can always just keep on doing it 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:17.549
 let write and they have just 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.100
 no show moves quite clear though 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:23.640
 that's how they strike economic 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.980
 movement which for a wander hans 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.800
 importantly i can with one 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.270
 huge action theater action only 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.760
 hard to go on the distanzeritt 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:37.890
 because you need it so uncomplicated and 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:41.780
 very easy and therefore jogging 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.780
 can and she can do it well 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:10.690
 the same is true too much in the 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:11.400
 galloping but that's easy too 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:18.850
 horse riding 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:21.700
 You see her having to give in on surrender 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:24.000
 I tend to help out a little bit on 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.000
 the train 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:48.090
 that is very nice of the mutation now 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.090
 been like just need yourself 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:55.270
 a bit afraid if a bit drifting 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:58.300
 supported again and always 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.900
 clock is right on it can too 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:11.470
 with two fingers wonderfully easy 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:18.040
 be ridden if you take note 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:20.280
 holland very sympathetic 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.280
 moves
