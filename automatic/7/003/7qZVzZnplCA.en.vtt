00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.929 
you're actually controlling an aircraft
you're<00:01:37.290> controlling<00:01:37.710> behind<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.340> top<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.850> it

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
you're controlling behind on top of it

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.190 
you're controlling behind on top of it
because<00:01:39.240> we're<00:01:39.420> covering<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.720> black<00:01:39.960> ops

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
because we're covering the black ops

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.990 
because we're covering the black ops
angle<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:41.130> know<00:01:41.220> these<00:01:41.340> are<00:01:41.400> guys<00:01:41.670> who<00:01:41.700> are

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
angle you know these are guys who are

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.690 
angle you know these are guys who are
CIA<00:01:42.329> sanctioned<00:01:42.689> right<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.259> they<00:01:43.409> have<00:01:43.700> access

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
CIA sanctioned right so they have access

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.480 
CIA sanctioned right so they have access
to<00:01:45.390> unprecedented<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:46.380> prototype<00:01:46.979> weapons

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
to unprecedented in prototype weapons

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.130 
to unprecedented in prototype weapons
right<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.090> we<00:01:48.450> talked<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.869> lot<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
right so we talked to a lot of the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.569 
right so we talked to a lot of the
veterans<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.890> are<00:01:49.950> part<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.280> these<00:01:50.399> groups

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
veterans that are part of these groups

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.770 
veterans that are part of these groups
too<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.060> they<00:01:51.119> said<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.390> it's<00:01:51.600> not

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
too and they said that it's not

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.679 
too and they said that it's not
unrealistic<00:01:52.200> for<00:01:53.130> them<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.430> get<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:54.570> have

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
unrealistic for them to get to have

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.170 
unrealistic for them to get to have
gotten<00:01:54.869> prototypes<00:01:55.590> upwards<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.700> five<00:01:56.939> years

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
gotten prototypes upwards of five years

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.160 
gotten prototypes upwards of five years
out<00:01:57.329> in<00:01:57.390> advance<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.840> when<00:01:57.960> they<00:01:58.110> were

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
out in advance of when they were

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.840 
out in advance of when they were
mainline<00:01:58.560> production<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.250> some<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
mainline production so some of the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.670 
mainline production so some of the
weapons<00:01:59.969> in<00:02:00.240> our<00:02:00.329> game<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:01.259> may<00:02:01.380> not<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.649> may

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
weapons in our game you may not you may

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.139 
weapons in our game you may not you may
think<00:02:01.829> well<00:02:02.070> weren't<00:02:02.369> those<00:02:02.490> developed<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.969> few

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
think well weren't those developed a few

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.240 
think well weren't those developed a few
years<00:02:03.360> later<00:02:03.570> well<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.439> point<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.799> if<00:02:05.100> they

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
years later well the point is if they

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.160 
years later well the point is if they
wanted<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.579> field<00:02:05.820> test<00:02:06.000> those<00:02:06.210> weapons<00:02:06.390> these

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
wanted to field test those weapons these

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.020 
wanted to field test those weapons these
black<00:02:07.439> ops<00:02:07.649> teams<00:02:07.920> like<00:02:08.160> SOG<00:02:08.429> they<00:02:08.789> would<00:02:08.940> be

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
black ops teams like SOG they would be

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.999 
black ops teams like SOG they would be
the<00:02:09.119> guys<00:02:09.300> they've<00:02:09.720> won

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
the guys they've won

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.559 
the guys they've won
field<00:02:10.159> testing<00:02:10.549> yeah<00:02:10.879> i<00:02:10.909> was<00:02:11.060> i<00:02:11.209> was<00:02:11.299> thinking

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
field testing yeah i was i was thinking

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:12.789 
field testing yeah i was i was thinking
i<00:02:11.629> watch<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.900> demo<00:02:12.170> because<00:02:12.319> they<00:02:12.560> were<00:02:12.650> using

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
i watch the demo because they were using

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.860 
i watch the demo because they were using
the<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.280> dragon's<00:02:13.640> breath<00:02:13.790> shotgun<00:02:14.510> ammo<00:02:14.720> and

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
the the dragon's breath shotgun ammo and

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.390 
the the dragon's breath shotgun ammo and
i<00:02:14.900> was<00:02:14.989> thinking<00:02:15.260> was<00:02:15.409> really<00:02:15.799> in<00:02:15.890> this<00:02:16.159> era

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
i was thinking was really in this era

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.789 
i was thinking was really in this era
yeah<00:02:16.730> exactly<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.420> that<00:02:17.930> more<00:02:18.230> specifically

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
yeah exactly and that more specifically

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.910 
yeah exactly and that more specifically
is<00:02:19.549> an<00:02:19.819> example<00:02:20.090> of<00:02:20.269> some<00:02:20.480> of<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.769> way<00:02:21.769> they

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
is an example of some of the way they

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.309 
is an example of some of the way they
would<00:02:22.040> pack<00:02:22.489> their<00:02:22.760> own<00:02:22.849> custom<00:02:23.269> ammo<00:02:23.540> we

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
would pack their own custom ammo we

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.720 
would pack their own custom ammo we
talked<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.680> Major<00:02:24.829> John<00:02:25.040> classroom<00:02:25.549> who's<00:02:25.700> a

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
so we've completely blown that system

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.560 
so we've completely blown that system
out<00:04:38.320> and<00:04:38.590> then<00:04:39.250> socialization<00:04:40.180> you<00:04:40.300> know<00:04:40.390> it's

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570
