 is looking to include the minecraft 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.240
 ok since it has been in devices

 ios android and xbox360 and finally pc 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.949
 good that it was the first but good 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.610
 have seen that in recent years it is worth 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.930
 has been the best-selling game has seen 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.489
 that has been quite successful at main 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.210
 craft so they are looking at 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.980
 enter it inside you do not know but 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.780
 they are going to introduce it into the company 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.150
 sony that is to say he can be in play 3 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.809
 with the movie 4 you do not know how to fish looking 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.850
 to make minecraft playable 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.190
 in play 3 or in play 4 you do not know maybe 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.040
 in the consoles you do not know but good 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.260
 there you already have an information and I suppose 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.989
 the ama 24 to trade and 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.410
 make it much better but good too 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.090
 have said evil that good are there better 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.690
 they are there you do not know but I think so 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.820
 they are going to do it for me I think that as they go 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.100
 they took out in their 360 added that also the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.220
 they will take out here in play everywhere 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.530
 to get money that they will also 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.940
 take out for the ps vita is worth going to 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.729
 be for ps vita not so that you see 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.460
 only to precipitate and finally 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.780
 who have said that it does not make very likely 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.290
 that is to say that established 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.350
 I suppose it's going to be the last thing 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:39.490
 we thought hank in introducing minecraft 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.590
 in the wiki it would be the last console and 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.310
 what the field is they have put a 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.110
 small and 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.630
 a little sentence of what he has said to 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.939
 the company they're going to try to get 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.500
 to all the consoles that come out is to say 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.220
 all things come out matters 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.049
 minecraft so you already know possibly 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.159
 I think that if 95 percent then 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:03.080
 since he is already in the procedure of 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.590
 create or what you have to do that 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.679
 this one and minecraft for playstation3 that 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.560
 it is avoided and well you will see if they are going to 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.840
 enter or not in the nintendo wii I 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.519
 so I hope you liked this 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.290
 great video for and you already know what 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.720
 pass pearl to people who have 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.519
 play you're going to have inside nothing if you 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.910
 they take out soon they do not know I do not know if what 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:31.310
 they are already creating but they have said that is 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.630
 they want they want me to be there 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.430
 in play on all the consoles that 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.470
 only issued for now are going to 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.230
 enter within the company sound 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.950
 so nothing I hope that our next 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.950
 goodbye
