00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
where you start seeing the reading as

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.820 
where you start seeing the reading as
bulb<00:02:44.910> then<00:02:45.910> after<00:02:46.840> that<00:02:46.960> assuming<00:02:47.410> you've<00:02:47.590> set

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
kind of environment in which you want to

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:04.020 
kind of environment in which you want to
take<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.350> photograph<00:02:56.800> just<00:02:57.130> place<00:03:02.520> so<00:03:03.520> let<00:03:03.940> me

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
take the photograph just place so let me

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.170 
take the photograph just place so let me
just<00:03:04.210> demonstrate<00:03:04.390> it<00:03:04.840> right<00:03:05.080> here<00:03:05.470> I<00:03:06.180> have

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
just demonstrate it right here I have

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:14.930 
just demonstrate it right here I have
set<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.510> focus<00:03:07.720> now<00:03:09.240> point<00:03:10.240> the<00:03:11.460> side<00:03:12.460> of<00:03:12.840> your

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
set the focus now point the side of your

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.700 
set the focus now point the side of your
remote<00:03:15.940> shutter<00:03:16.180> release<00:03:16.270> device<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:17.560> the

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
remote shutter release device to the

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.360 
remote shutter release device to the
infrared<00:03:18.190> receiver<00:03:19.830> region<00:03:20.830> of<00:03:20.920> your<00:03:21.070> camera

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
infrared receiver region of your camera

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.820 
infrared receiver region of your camera
you<00:03:21.460> see<00:03:21.610> this<00:03:21.700> little<00:03:22.260> area<00:03:23.260> where<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:23.650> see<00:03:23.800> a

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
you see this little area where you see a

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.760 
you see this little area where you see a
little<00:03:24.010> light<00:03:24.960> this<00:03:25.960> is<00:03:26.140> where<00:03:26.320> the<00:03:26.470> infrared

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
little light this is where the infrared

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.740 
little light this is where the infrared
receiver<00:03:27.130> is<00:03:27.310> so<00:03:27.490> you<00:03:27.580> always<00:03:28.030> point<00:03:28.510> it

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
receiver is so you always point it

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.500 
receiver is so you always point it
somehow<00:03:29.650> like<00:03:30.160> this<00:03:30.400> if<00:03:30.850> you're<00:03:31.030> gonna<00:03:31.150> click

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
somehow like this if you're gonna click

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.030 
somehow like this if you're gonna click
like<00:03:32.320> this<00:03:32.590> pointing<00:03:33.460> this<00:03:33.580> off<00:03:34.800> the<00:03:35.800> target

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
like this pointing this off the target

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.640 
like this pointing this off the target
here<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:37.150> this<00:03:37.390> is<00:03:37.480> not<00:03:37.630> gonna<00:03:37.780> work<00:03:37.870> this<00:03:38.530> is

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
here and this is not gonna work this is

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.340 
here and this is not gonna work this is
one<00:03:38.800> of<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.010> disadvantages<00:03:39.990> however<00:03:40.990> if

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
one of the disadvantages however if

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.350 
one of the disadvantages however if
you're<00:03:41.500> pretty<00:03:41.680> much<00:03:41.890> pointing<00:03:42.580> it<00:03:42.820> around

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
you're pretty much pointing it around

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.630 
you're pretty much pointing it around
this<00:03:43.540> region<00:03:43.930> on<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.260> camera<00:03:44.620> then<00:03:44.920> I<00:03:45.370> have

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
this region on the camera then I have

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.630 
this region on the camera then I have
tested<00:03:45.850> it<00:03:46.030> out<00:03:46.270> it<00:03:46.780> works<00:03:47.740> fine<00:03:48.040> until<00:03:48.400> a

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
tested it out it works fine until a

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.940 
tested it out it works fine until a
range<00:03:48.940> of<00:03:49.209> five<00:03:49.780> to<00:03:50.050> eight<00:03:50.230> meters<00:03:50.440> the

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
range of five to eight meters the

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.070 
range of five to eight meters the
farther<00:03:51.220> you<00:03:51.340> go<00:03:51.580> it<00:03:51.730> starts<00:03:52.120> getting<00:03:53.020> a

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
farther you go it starts getting a

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.230 
farther you go it starts getting a
little<00:03:53.110> less<00:03:53.410> responsive<00:03:54.209> so<00:03:57.030> I'm<00:03:58.030> gonna

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
little less responsive so I'm gonna

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:06.350 
little less responsive so I'm gonna
start<00:03:58.600> now<00:04:01.290> once<00:04:02.290> I've<00:04:02.470> said<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.830> focus

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:16.550 

okay<00:04:09.890> let<00:04:10.890> me<00:04:10.980> check<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:11.340> mode<00:04:11.520> oh<00:04:15.200> sorry<00:04:16.200> the

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
should have set it to the self timer

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.440 
should have set it to the self timer
