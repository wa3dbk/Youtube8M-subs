00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160
What is System23?

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.840
„Brilliant!“

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.100
„I am highly enthusiastic!“

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.320
„Fascinating trip!“

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.800
System23 is THE hypnosis seminar!

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.280
„I am engineer and natural scientist and I know that hypnosis could not work.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.160
But it is fascinating and I thought that I would give it a try.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.320
And actually it works out.“

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.580
If someone comes from therapeutical or psychological background or coaches people

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.460
and will learn more about hypnosis then System23 is THE seminar for him or her.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.100
„It was the best seminar I have ever visited and I visited many.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.240
But this was the most evocative and moving seminar for me.“

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:47.860
It is badly necessary that this exciting art is finally detached from the esoteric, moldy and mystic branch

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.820
and that it is scientifically accredited.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.700
Effectively the seminar exists out of 2 parts.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.140
At the first day you will learn to DO.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.940
Two together hypnotise each other.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.580
Until the end of the day everyone is able to hypnotise.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.160
„It is fascinating to notice that a person holds a arm in the air and cannot move it to any direction anymore

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.740
And what is more to forget one’s name

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.740
and that this person do not know how to pronounce it

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.740
because I have given the suggestion.“

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.360
That are gimmicks but they are on a constant level and it is not about making someone ridiculous

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.120
and there is a strong moment which can be experienced.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.260
On the second day we are concerning with a hypnotherapeutical first-aid kit!

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.460
It is not a complete hypnotherapy apprenticeship because it would last longer

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:46.160
but it is a first-aid kit which you always carry with you to help someone as required. 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.440
The characteristic of System23 is that it starts 23 days before the seminar

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.500
and is continued 23 weeks after the seminar is terminated. 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.060
Too many times people at seminar are cluttered with information

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.580
and feel that after the seminar they could not do it on their own or do not dare to apply it. 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.900
I can truly say that based on the preparation and the exercise during the seminar

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.060
the participants leave it and are able to hypnotise - guaranteed!

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.820
The whole process that I have elaborated and which I give my participants to take with them

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.540
is lined to their heads step by step - so that the whole knowledge and the theory get stuck in their heads. 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.120
„It is great that I am not abrupt confronted with the content but bit by bit lead to the details. 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.520
This builds a base of processes and I can internalise it.“

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.760
What makes me glad and even proud is that every time 10 people participate 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.340
and at the end 10 participants are able to hypnotise and I get 10 happy references.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.240
I am glad to see that my thoughts can come to action and are in working order

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.980
that they are attained and adopted by the people and actually make a difference! 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.680
If you only do it as an demonstration to show someone how strong the subconscious mind is,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.240
or if you apply it in therapeutic field - the experience that there comes about something is most important!

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.160
„It is impressive! At his age - how old his he: 26 - it is amazing!

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.560
When I think about how I was at the age of 26…“

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.580
„It was fascinating how fast the hypnosis can operate.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.900
I have participated at a hypnosis seminar before

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.000
but at System23 you receive much more content and practical experience.“

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.060
I have gone through a detailed hypnosis and hypnotherapeutical apprenticeship

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.380
and at the end I had a huge knowledge at did not know where to start.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.340
While confronting myself with my knowledge I found a structure 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.740
a distinct number of techniques and a distinct order

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.100
which was plain grinded in 4 years of hypnotising thousands of people

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.360
to soon find out that it really works out this way! 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.320
Namely everytime and everywhere and in fact certainly.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.800
„As he started with his hand - he did not even touch me - it became eerily warm

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.740
and the headache was sought out of my head.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.220
And as I woke up it was gone. I tried to feel if any headache was left 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.040
but there was nothing and even now there is nothing!“

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:22.060
The secret of success is that we implement the information at many levels in their heads

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.160
we train, we DO

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.560
the participants get a system - a folder - where everything is inside

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.560
such as handouts, lecture notes, so that they have a collection of knowledge with them when they leave the seminar

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.280
to know that they can work with exactly THIS system.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.440
I can notice that a movement arises out of this community

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.420
that finally makes a difference, and that put the hypnosis in its true light

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.940
because it is and it will be the most effective technique of change for me!

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.320
„If there was a seminar next week, I would visit it without hesitation!

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.940
Who did not experience it has definitely a disadvantage.“
