him<00:01:36.760> a<00:01:36.850> little<00:01:37.060> pressure<00:01:37.240> off<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.660> tree<00:01:37.900> I

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
him a little pressure off the tree I

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.780 
him a little pressure off the tree I
think<00:01:38.470> he's<00:01:38.920> got<00:01:39.010> a<00:01:39.070> pretty<00:01:39.190> good<00:01:39.370> chance<00:01:39.580> to

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
think he's got a pretty good chance to

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.120 
think he's got a pretty good chance to
cut<00:01:40.030> it<00:01:40.060> fast<00:01:40.390> enough<00:01:40.510> to<00:01:40.750> win<00:01:40.930> but<00:01:41.170> he's<00:01:41.980> got

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
cut it fast enough to win but he's got

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.670 
cut it fast enough to win but he's got
