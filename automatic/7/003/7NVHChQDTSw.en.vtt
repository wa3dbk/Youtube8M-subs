00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.410 
finely and I'm using a serrated knife
because<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.250> makes<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.610> really<00:00:44.760> easy<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.149> cut

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
minutes and that just lets the excess

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.779 
minutes and that just lets the excess
water<00:00:52.260> draw<00:00:52.649> out<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.430> will<00:00:53.550> stop

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
water draw out and that will stop

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.090
