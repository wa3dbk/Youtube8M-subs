the<00:02:15.790> ball<00:02:15.970> is<00:02:16.060> beating<00:02:16.390> it<00:02:16.540> but<00:02:16.720> I<00:02:17.140> think<00:02:17.739> deep

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
the ball is beating it but I think deep

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.370 
the ball is beating it but I think deep
down<00:02:18.130> it<00:02:19.030> was<00:02:19.209> a<00:02:19.239> bit<00:02:19.390> upset<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:19.959> he<00:02:20.110> wants<00:02:20.320> to

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
down it was a bit upset and he wants to

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.530 
down it was a bit upset and he wants to
where<00:02:20.769> he<00:02:21.010> wants<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.280> go<00:02:21.430> out<00:02:21.550> to<00:02:21.700> sea<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:22.300> want

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
where he wants to go out to sea you want

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.330 
where he wants to go out to sea you want
to<00:02:22.600> go<00:02:22.690> out<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.900> this<00:02:22.989> career<00:02:23.290> with<00:02:23.830> in<00:02:24.100> a<00:02:24.190> big

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
to go out to this career with in a big

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.770 
to go out to this career with in a big
way<00:02:24.519> so<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:24.790> think<00:02:24.880> he'd<00:02:25.120> be<00:02:25.180> looking<00:02:25.269> for<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.600> big

so<00:03:09.099> Edo<00:03:09.580> is<00:03:09.910> hope<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.510> dry<00:03:10.810> with<00:03:11.110> a<00:03:11.140> time<00:03:11.470> of

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
so Edo is hope and dry with a time of

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.089 
so Edo is hope and dry with a time of
one<00:03:11.950> hour<00:03:11.980> 15<00:03:12.910> minutes<00:03:12.940> and<00:03:13.450> 34<00:03:13.989> seconds<00:03:14.500> he

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
one hour 15 minutes and 34 seconds he

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.100 
one hour 15 minutes and 34 seconds he
lost<00:03:15.370> her<00:03:15.580> off<00:03:15.730> me<00:03:15.940> back<00:03:16.209> to<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.569> third<00:03:16.810> place

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
lost her off me back to the third place

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.199 
lost her off me back to the third place
and<00:03:17.530> that<00:03:17.920> I<00:03:18.190> think<00:03:18.250> is<00:03:18.610> where<00:03:18.819> you'll<00:03:19.000> finish

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
and that I think is where you'll finish

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.570 
and that I think is where you'll finish
now<00:03:19.630> but<00:03:19.900> who<00:03:19.989> wants<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.319> see<00:03:20.530> exactly<00:03:21.310> what

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
now but who wants to see exactly what

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.120 
now but who wants to see exactly what

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
regular bomb can do composite is still

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.309 
regular bomb can do composite is still
some<00:03:24.430> three<00:03:24.700> minutes<00:03:24.849> behind<00:03:25.209> Ino<00:03:25.930> on<00:03:26.140> the

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
some three minutes behind Ino on the

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.370 
some three minutes behind Ino on the
road<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:26.830> so<00:03:27.430> I<00:03:27.670> was<00:03:27.880> so<00:03:28.060> now<00:03:28.239> if<00:03:28.660> Greg<00:03:29.080> is

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
road and so I was so now if Greg is

road and so I was so now if Greg is
going<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.739> come<00:03:29.920> in<00:03:30.040> with<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:30.280> time<00:03:30.580> almost

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
going to come in with a time almost

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.570 
going to come in with a time almost
equal<00:03:31.510> to<00:03:31.630> Ito<00:03:31.989> and<00:03:32.350> into<00:03:32.980> this<00:03:33.100> right<00:03:33.280> hand

equal to Ito and into this right hand

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.809 
equal to Ito and into this right hand
then<00:03:33.790> watch<00:03:34.090> carefully<00:03:34.830> LeMond<00:03:35.830> goes<00:03:36.220> down

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
then watch carefully LeMond goes down

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.509 
then watch carefully LeMond goes down
he<00:03:37.060> either<00:03:37.239> misjudges<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.050> corner<00:03:38.530> or<00:03:38.980> as

sabotaged nobody really believed that

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.290 
sabotaged nobody really believed that
but<00:03:44.560> LeMond<00:03:44.860> did<00:03:45.130> say<00:03:45.370> his<00:03:45.580> brakes<00:03:45.880> were<00:03:46.120> loose

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
but LeMond did say his brakes were loose
