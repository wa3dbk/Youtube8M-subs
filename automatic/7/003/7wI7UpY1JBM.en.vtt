same<00:01:38.189> number<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.520> keke<00:01:38.880> rosberg<00:01:39.000> his<00:01:39.479> father

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
same number that keke rosberg his father

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.630 
same number that keke rosberg his father
took<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.320> his<00:01:40.470> father's<00:01:40.799> lucky<00:01:41.159> number<00:01:41.400> and

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
took is his father's lucky number and

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.090 
took is his father's lucky number and
interestingly<00:01:42.509> it's<00:01:43.259> his<00:01:43.409> future<00:01:43.680> wife's

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
interestingly it's his future wife's

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.010 
interestingly it's his future wife's
lucky<00:01:44.520> number<00:01:44.759> too<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:44.970> hopefully<00:01:45.570> it'll

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
lucky number too so hopefully it'll

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.420 
lucky number too so hopefully it'll
bring<00:01:46.140> Nico<00:01:46.500> some<00:01:46.680> more<00:01:46.799> race<00:01:46.979> winners<00:01:47.340> this

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
bring Nico some more race winners this

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.399 
bring Nico some more race winners this
year<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.820> who<00:01:47.970> knows<00:01:48.149> even<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:49.079> championship

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
year and who knows even the championship

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.039 
year and who knows even the championship
perhaps<00:01:50.159> his<00:01:50.610> teammate<00:01:51.060> Lewis<00:01:51.390> Hamilton<00:01:51.869> has

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
perhaps his teammate Lewis Hamilton has

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.530 
perhaps his teammate Lewis Hamilton has
chosen<00:01:52.290> 44<00:01:53.130> now<00:01:53.399> there<00:01:53.790> are<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> couple<00:01:54.000> of

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
chosen 44 now there are a couple of

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.690 
chosen 44 now there are a couple of
scenarios<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.680> people<00:01:55.829> are<00:01:56.070> suggesting<00:01:56.189> as

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
scenarios that people are suggesting as

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.600 
scenarios that people are suggesting as
to<00:01:56.880> why<00:01:57.180> Lewis<00:01:57.630> chose<00:01:57.869> 44<00:01:58.439> if<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:59.070> add<00:01:59.219> up<00:01:59.250> all

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
to why Lewis chose 44 if you add up all

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.490 
to why Lewis chose 44 if you add up all
his<00:01:59.909> race<00:02:00.119> numbers<00:02:00.509> from<00:02:00.750> his<00:02:00.930> career<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.469> far

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
his race numbers from his career so far

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.010 
his race numbers from his career so far
it<00:02:01.950> totals<00:02:02.579> 44<00:02:03.149> but<00:02:03.630> then<00:02:03.780> there's<00:02:03.930> another

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
it totals 44 but then there's another

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.419 
it totals 44 but then there's another
one<00:02:04.500> perhaps<00:02:05.250> it's<00:02:05.729> because<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:07.039> mp44<00:02:08.039> car

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
one perhaps it's because the mp44 car

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.130 
one perhaps it's because the mp44 car
was<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.060> one<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.330> Senna<00:02:09.660> drove<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.080> of

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
was the one that Senna drove and of

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.869 
was the one that Senna drove and of
course<00:02:10.379> Lewis<00:02:10.950> Hamilton's<00:02:11.370> idol<00:02:11.940> and

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
course Lewis Hamilton's idol and

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.959 
course Lewis Hamilton's idol and
is<00:02:13.239> of<00:02:13.780> course<00:02:14.049> Ayrton<00:02:14.560> Senna<00:02:14.920> Lewis's<00:02:15.700> old

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:15.969 
is of course Ayrton Senna Lewis's old

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.819 
is of course Ayrton Senna Lewis's old
teammate<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:16.599> McLaren<00:02:16.930> Jenson<00:02:17.349> Button<00:02:17.469> has

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
teammate that McLaren Jenson Button has

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.129 
teammate that McLaren Jenson Button has
chosen<00:02:18.129> number<00:02:18.519> 22<00:02:19.060> an<00:02:19.209> interesting<00:02:19.900> choice

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:20.139 
chosen number 22 an interesting choice

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.800 
chosen number 22 an interesting choice
because<00:02:20.560> actually<00:02:20.980> statistically<00:02:21.599> 22<00:02:22.599> has

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
because actually statistically 22 has

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.869 
because actually statistically 22 has
had<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.109> most<00:02:23.349> mechanical<00:02:23.709> failures<00:02:24.639> over

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
had the most mechanical failures over

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.119 
had the most mechanical failures over
the<00:02:25.090> years<00:02:25.299> but<00:02:25.719> it's<00:02:26.290> also<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.799> number<00:02:27.040> that

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
the years but it's also the number that

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.440 
the years but it's also the number that
Jenson<00:02:27.519> had<00:02:27.700> when<00:02:27.879> he<00:02:28.030> won<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.299> world

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
Jenson had when he won the world

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.110 
Jenson had when he won the world
championship<00:02:28.510> in<00:02:29.109> 2009<00:02:29.769> for<00:02:30.099> Braun<00:02:30.310> so<00:02:30.579> maybe

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
championship in 2009 for Braun so maybe

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.789 
championship in 2009 for Braun so maybe
he's<00:02:31.329> hoping<00:02:31.480> McLaren<00:02:31.989> can<00:02:32.139> get<00:02:32.409> it<00:02:32.530> together

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
he's hoping McLaren can get it together

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.619 
he's hoping McLaren can get it together
and<00:02:33.010> get<00:02:33.430> him<00:02:33.579> another<00:02:33.819> world<00:02:34.060> championship

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
and get him another world championship

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.800 
and get him another world championship
for<00:02:34.659> 2014<00:02:35.680> number<00:02:36.400> 13<00:02:36.790> an<00:02:37.060> interesting<00:02:37.659> choice

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
for 2014 number 13 an interesting choice

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.659 
for 2014 number 13 an interesting choice
seeing<00:02:38.109> is<00:02:38.230> its<00:02:38.379> unlucky<00:02:38.799> for<00:02:38.950> so<00:02:39.219> many<00:02:39.430> people

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:39.669 
seeing is its unlucky for so many people

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:41.759 
seeing is its unlucky for so many people
it's<00:02:39.939> actually<00:02:40.030> my<00:02:40.540> lucky<00:02:41.019> number<00:02:41.290> but<00:02:41.409> Pastor

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
it's actually my lucky number but Pastor

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.129 
it's actually my lucky number but Pastor

that Rob Austin takes on for British
Touring<00:02:48.219> cars<00:02:48.430> so<00:02:48.879> maybe<00:02:49.030> pasta<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.629> Rob<00:02:49.780> can

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
Touring cars so maybe pasta and Rob can

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.780 
Touring cars so maybe pasta and Rob can
have<00:02:50.379> some<00:02:50.530> not<00:02:50.709> with<00:02:50.889> that<00:02:51.010> one<00:02:51.189> lucky<00:02:51.400> number

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
have some not with that one lucky number

13<00:02:51.819> and<00:02:52.480> number<00:02:52.900> two<00:02:53.049> no<00:02:53.409> one<00:02:53.439> could<00:02:53.739> actually

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
13 and number two no one could actually

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.939 
13 and number two no one could actually
choose<00:02:54.219> number<00:02:54.609> two<00:02:54.790> for<00:02:55.329> the<00:02:55.389> f1<00:02:55.629> because<00:02:56.620> the

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:56.949 
choose number two for the f1 because the

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:59.729 
choose number two for the f1 because the
FIA<00:02:57.340> have<00:02:57.790> retired<00:02:58.419> it<00:02:58.719> after<00:02:59.379> Mark<00:02:59.560> Webber

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
left f1 at the end of last season well I

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.659 
left f1 at the end of last season well I
think<00:03:02.709> that's<00:03:02.859> enough<00:03:03.069> number<00:03:03.340> crunching

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:03.669 
think that's enough number crunching

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:04.229 
think that's enough number crunching
don't<00:03:03.909> you

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
don't you

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.599 
don't you
