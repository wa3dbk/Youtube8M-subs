00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.059
 hello to all biker friends welcome 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.560
 in the corner near the back directions 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.220
 today we are going to give some suggestions 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.900
 on how to push in the way 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.290
 corrected the screws of the various components 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.420
 of the bicycle is racing on the bike 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.369
 the same thing is important is to go to 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.410
 close the 20 in the correct way 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.640
 how to do it is done using a 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.890
 torque wrench without use 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.620
 of the terminating metric we pose risk 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.260
 to tighten too much and then go to 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.539
 break the component outside the threads 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.140
 or tighten too little e 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:53.199
 obviously have component that yes 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.629
 it bites during the march 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.160
 therefore also very very dangerous as well 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.629
 dynamometric light allows you to 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.199
 go and make life in the way 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.480
 correct and and avoid this type of 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.100
 problems in our case precisely 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.720
 we use a bb key is a lot 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.850
 complete because a sewer is already 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.540
 prepared with all the various serious ones 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:20.770
 hexagonal hexagonal inserts from the 3rd da 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.540
 10 and of course the talks 25 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.329
 the motto used above all in 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.939
 new components as they will be 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:32.159
 will be adopted for a long time in all 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:35.890
 and also various fixing screws are in 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:39.729
 titanium rather than that already has the 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.409
 or ergal we go therefore to 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.770
 use our key 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:48.369
 dynamometer going to sing with 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.490
 tightening that can be in the case of 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:54.039
 brake caliper with titanium screws 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.240
 absent newton meter then in the case 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:00.640
 of the pbb and we have to push the knob 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.620
 adjustment and a woodworm until it is 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:08.229
 the indicator does not go to position 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:10.930
 precisely in the seven newton meter seven in 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.810
 m everything we go then to close 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:16.270
 our lives 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:20.340
 it is called that the square does its job 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.960
 when it starts life and take hold 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.770
 let's go cautious 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.720
 here we will hear a truck this e 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.120
 so the key then starts with a 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.490
 light and light very short time a 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.770
 empty this indicates to me that the 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:40.390
 key reached newton meter e 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:42.130
 previously we had set up once 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.490
 closed our lives 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.100
 a recommendation is to go to 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.500
 discharge of the torque wrench for 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.380
 avoid that leaving precisely for per 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.660
 a lot of time goes state then 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:59.250
 resume the processing pomelo e 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:03.460
 rotate it in the opposite direction 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:06.610
 until we report two kilometers then 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.680
 they discharge it completely and in this 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.489
 so we can repositioned without 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.050
 problems thanks to all the biker friends 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.940
 at their next appointment 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.090
 kitchen always compact directions 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.090
 Hello
