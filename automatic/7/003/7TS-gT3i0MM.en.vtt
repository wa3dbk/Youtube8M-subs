00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.310
 I would like to talk about the forms on the line 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.970
 The fact is that there is in Korea 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.330
 several basic cuts of such 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.250
 permanent not changing in general 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.649
 who have their own clear name 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.610
 Now I will show you some forms 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:36.079
 exist 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.410
 Well, let's start with the easiest circle 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.960
 accordingly, this is a circle 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.719
 as a rule, all forms are demonstrated and 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.760
 when trained is demonstrated on 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.550
 potato as it has a homogeneous 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.440
 structure and for that as well as possible 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:59.520
 suitable circle 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:03.030
 next we have a slice that is this 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:11.189
 half circle as you see and 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:11.759
 only here it is only in some 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.829
 recipes 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.570
 There is a clear description of how to 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:19.530
 punish the product for cooking 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.080
 or another further form of cutting we still 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:29.850
 happen to be this 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:35.100
 The bars to the ebola straw like this 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.380
 the way straw can be shallow here 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.840
 this average straw can be large 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.530
 it will remain accordingly 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:48.440
 also the straw is only a large one charging 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:51.810
 it is on a similar scheme here we brusochek 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.560
 fried potatoes and all of us like 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.890
 things are going to be with us 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.820
 so cut the cubes next 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.570
 cutting shape 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:07.049
 after the cub we will have a cube dice 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.560
 It is cut into principle as it is now 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:14.310
 Inga cut. 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:17.130
 or if we need small ubeg cut into 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.500
 as straw cubes in a different city 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.840
 size it depends on the specific 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.959
 recipe on preferences 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:30.000
 the person who will be ready to buy 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:32.690
 maybe their very small here 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.690
 squirrel cube 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.490
 This is how it turns out 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.060
 you see the cutting form is all pretty 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:51.600
 simple but nevertheless it is considered 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:55.060
 classic cutting forms which when 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.530
 begin to train chefs and train on 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:07.890
 example of potatoes just like that 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:07.890
 the form of slicing carrots all those 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.870
 circle 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:37.610
 luntik slice kept 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.850
 So 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.950
 salon 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.620
 cube
