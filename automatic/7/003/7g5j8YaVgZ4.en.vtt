00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:16.309
 Hello 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.099
 It becomes Agata 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:19.710
 Impact also 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.460
 Let's talk about an electric car 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.169
 I do not know how many years from now 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:26.989
 Even the power of the car 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.099
 The age when household electric energy becomes a leading role 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.119
 Again 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.300
 I think it's Purun 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.520
 In this April 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.649
 Mitsubishi's last sale 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.789
 Delivery will be started for the time being with the corporation 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:44.670
 For each local government 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.670
 It can be done for 3 days, but personal sales will continue 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.890
 We want to be guilty of porn even earlier we personally before 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:52.400
 but 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.799
 This is for laugh 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:57.160
 It is a mini car Mitsubishi i that you all know 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.200
 Just look at everyone in a different style 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.590
 It will be popular 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.590
 Eh, but please take a look here 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.630
 pv 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.810
 We are adding 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.210
 From Mitsubishi i 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.729
 Put down the engine and put in the motor instead 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.070
 Run on batteries 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.620
 Unlike hybrids, electric cars run entirely on electricity 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.250
 What 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.180
 Whether the electric car will be a leading role in the future 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.080
 With the sun 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.330
 Well there is such a case First of all in the maintenance site 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.300
 Zero emissions 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.740
 It is bought with the reduction of co2 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.760
 Don't give anything 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.630
 In fact, use energy when making electricity at a power plant 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.570
 Those 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.850
 This is a little harder to say with a group wheel 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.670
 It is fun and enjoyable to actually use the car from the oil field 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.390
 To say 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.619
 Race is better than ordinary gasoline 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.360
 30% to 40% 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.200
 There is little energy 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.369
 Well we generations of adults are very good 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.170
 It came in familiar with village kabul 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.999
 Tokyo area inspection with se valve 4 

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:12.059
 I was relieved to run eco-friendly 

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:14.160
 Because such sense is ingrained 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.160
 Like cars that are totally different in mind, like electric cars 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.940
 A person who can not accept me 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.839
 I think there are also many 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:26.879
 Change rapidly 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.869
 All of primary schoolchild junior high school students now 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:32.339
 Radio controlled 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:33.919
 It is full marathon 

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:37.619
 When it's grown up 211 / It's full size 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:38.509
 If you think 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:41.969
 Because it is said that the electric car will be accepted 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:44.199
 is 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:46.209
 Eh this is I Meave 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.019
 engine 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.469
 Well, there is a motor. 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:50.680
 As you can see 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.910
 The structure of the electric car is really easy, so here it is 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.679
 I can not see it at all 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:59.830
 Without a direct partner relationship 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.910
 This controls the battery with the Euro motor 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.879
 To do 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.150
 A clump of electronic circuits 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.709
 There is something under it 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.709
 How about it is about this because the size is different 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.059
 About rice cooker for one person 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:21.509
 But the song below this 

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:23.289
 It is in 

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:25.559
 To say it clearly 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:27.039
 Actually the transmission 

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.980
 Not before 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.310
 Only one bill slows down to wait for the power of the motor 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.090
 It is natural because it is a car naturally 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.090
 Shifts in our car 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.849
 Switch the switch when back to reverse the motor 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.589
 There is not each company because it only 

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:46.969
 Very simple 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:49.819
 The weekday was this simple thing 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:50.730
 Nakahi 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.149
 It is the core of the secret of running electric cars 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:55.350
 This 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.929
 There is no maximum output 

00:03:57.929 --> 00:04:00.720
 About 64 horsepower in terms of horsepower 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.710
 Because 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.810
 It is almost the same as the busy system used by everyone today 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.000
 Actually there is not much meaning 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.409
 I thought this 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:14.299
 According to the maximum torque 580 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.969
 This is a normal gasoline engine 

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:20.279
 Non-turbo gasoline engine to 1800 cc 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:25.539
 It is an engine on a mini car 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.580
 That alone is terrific 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.529
 US fomc result ball 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:32.479
 A few years ago my friend 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.720
 The motor of the previous term is zero rotation, that is, of the car 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:36.620
 Zero speed 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.279
 When calling from 

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:40.919
 The movement is also up when it comes up 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.659
 I'm getting torque 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:44.639
 The car is also the best 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:45.750
 The power is 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.240
 It is the most powerful free when it starts to move from the captured state 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.370
 I have a lot of characteristics 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.590
 So it's also a difficult technique when you want to make a quick call from the signal in the city 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.590
 Without King resounding 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.360
 Among these, there is this strength 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.360
 At least the town was watery 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.770
 I just can't skip it now, just before it works 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.990
 become 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.070
 The times change
