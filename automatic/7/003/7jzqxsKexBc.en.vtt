those kind of things
I<00:05:17.240> really<00:05:18.240> recommend<00:05:18.750> using<00:05:19.650> torrents<00:05:20.550> unless

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
I really recommend using torrents unless

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.510 
I really recommend using torrents unless
you<00:05:21.030> know<00:05:21.180> that<00:05:21.210> the<00:05:21.600> user<00:05:21.840> is<00:05:22.230> the<00:05:22.710> uploader

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
you know that the user is the uploader

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.330 
you know that the user is the uploader
is<00:05:23.850> reliable<00:05:24.660> because<00:05:25.320> sometimes<00:05:25.950> people

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
is reliable because sometimes people

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.780 
is reliable because sometimes people
want<00:05:27.210> to<00:05:27.330> make<00:05:27.420> fun<00:05:27.750> and<00:05:27.960> upload<00:05:28.380> viruses<00:05:29.280> so
