00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.200
 device and from there you will have to go to 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.170

 bling software or the present one 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.009
 on the galaxy s ii 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.490
 if you want to return to the situation 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:45.280

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.830
 in shelters return to install zip 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.050
 from sd card select the 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.780

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.840
 galaxy s ii 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.090
 here too you will have to wait for the deadline 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.520
 installation restart the 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.119
 device and you will find the functions 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.680
 original vowels this hit to action 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.150
 can also be done on 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.159
 devices that do not own i 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.349
 root permissions through a recovery 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:17.920
 temporary for example that of feel 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.650
 That 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.830
 for those who have obtained the permits of 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.239
 root installed a modified rom 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.459
 situation is different 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.530
 if the modified rom you have 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.930
 installed is based on a firmware 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.380
 samsung then for example the disaster 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.120
 rom 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.140
 just install this apk file 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.060
 the installation will be the same as that of 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.340
 any other application then 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.250
 you simply have to give install 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.030
 wait for the end and then you can use 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.150
 has boys 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.180
 in the case instead of rom aosp then 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.190
 based on pure android you will have to flash 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.989
 through admissions the file I am going to 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:02.110
 show you the file and this samsung to don 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.440
 geli bam and specific for rom gelli 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.720
 bam 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.870
 however, I also tried it on others 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.620
 aosp therefore for example the super nexus o 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.720
 the route box and it works perfectly 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.950
 install and boys and I dismiss the calculator 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.380
 by samsung 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.180
 a file manager is also a video player 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.599
 perfect pop up 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.489
 so these are the various cases for 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:29.790
 install and run on phones without 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:32.640
 root on phones with ruth and a rom 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.209
 modified based on samsung firmware e 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.920
 with ruth is a rom now modified aosp 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.750
 unfortunately I can't show you the 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.579
 of operation and want it 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.129

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.109
 record or screencast not me 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.959
 allows to use voice assistants 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.939
 during registration 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.970
 however for those interested in 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:56.489
 see in action s boys and see it 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.099

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.290

 comparison I made a few weeks 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.569
 ago in which precisely I compare them and yes 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.010

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.409
 voice assistants and theirs 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.599
