in<00:03:04.930> this<00:03:05.079> series<00:03:05.910> this<00:03:06.910> takes<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:07.359> cake<00:03:07.480> I

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
in this series this takes the cake I

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.660 
in this series this takes the cake I
think<00:03:08.170> yeah<00:03:08.650> this<00:03:08.920> could<00:03:09.130> have<00:03:09.250> been<00:03:09.340> built<00:03:09.519> in

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
think yeah this could have been built in

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.960 
think yeah this could have been built in
1964<00:03:10.510> or<00:03:11.019> three<00:03:11.799> years<00:03:12.010> ago<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:12.519> in<00:03:12.609> this<00:03:12.730> case

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
1964 or three years ago and in this case

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.819 
1964 or three years ago and in this case
it<00:03:13.150> was<00:03:13.239> probably<00:03:13.480> about<00:03:13.569> 14<00:03:13.840> years<00:03:14.200> ago<00:03:14.260> so

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
it was probably about 14 years ago so

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.340 
it was probably about 14 years ago so
it's<00:03:15.579> call<00:03:15.819> it<00:03:15.940> timeless<00:03:16.329> contemporary<00:03:17.019> if
