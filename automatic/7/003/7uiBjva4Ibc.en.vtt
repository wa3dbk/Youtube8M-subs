00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
laptop back here yeah side angle might

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.139 
laptop back here yeah side angle might
be<00:00:48.059> better<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:53.100> metal<00:00:53.399> hook<00:00:53.520> here<00:00:53.969> and

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
be better the metal hook here and

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.389 
be better the metal hook here and
there's<00:00:54.780> two<00:00:54.840> metal<00:00:55.230> hooks<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.739> front<00:00:55.980> on

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
there's two metal hooks in the front on

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.389 
there's two metal hooks in the front on
either<00:00:56.610> side<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.829> we're<00:00:58.829> going<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.980> try<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.190> put

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
either side so we're going to try to put

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.889 
either side so we're going to try to put
the<00:00:59.460> metal<00:00:59.699> hook<00:00:59.820> on<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.030> back<00:01:00.210> we're<00:01:00.750> going

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
the metal hook on the back we're going

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.720 
the metal hook on the back we're going
to<00:01:00.960> connect<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.350> first<00:01:01.620> I'm<00:01:02.399> see<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
to connect that first I'm see in the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.490 
to connect that first I'm see in the
middle<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.300> piece<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.660> rubber<00:01:03.870> and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
middle that is a piece of rubber and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.080 
middle that is a piece of rubber and
that's<00:01:04.680> what<00:01:04.830> gives<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.159> spring<00:01:05.489> back

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.310 

alright<00:01:12.090> big<00:01:12.270> hands<00:01:12.540> might<00:01:12.840> get<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.170> way

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
alright big hands might get in the way

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.929 
alright big hands might get in the way
so<00:01:13.380> we<00:01:13.710> might<00:01:13.890> not<00:01:13.979> actually<00:01:14.040> see<00:01:14.610> how<00:01:14.790> this

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
so we might not actually see how this

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.450 
so we might not actually see how this
goes<00:01:15.380> but<00:01:16.380> hopefully<00:01:16.799> we'll<00:01:16.950> get<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> general

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
goes but hopefully we'll get the general

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.109 
goes but hopefully we'll get the general
idea<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:19.729> there<00:01:20.729> we<00:01:20.790> go

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
idea so there we go

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.230 
idea so there we go
we<00:01:21.750> connect<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.140> back<00:01:22.350> piece<00:01:22.650> first<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.340> then

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
we connect the back piece first and then

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.910 
we connect the back piece first and then
you<00:01:24.390> kind<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.689> slide<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.080> forward<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.740> you

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
you kind of slide it forward and you

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.420 
you kind of slide it forward and you
push<00:01:26.130> down<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.750> it<00:01:27.750> will<00:01:27.869> just<00:01:28.140> click<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.590> like

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
push down and it will just click in like

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
that there you are working key so now

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.380
