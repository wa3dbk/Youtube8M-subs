and<00:02:58.540> then<00:02:58.630> I<00:02:58.750> took<00:02:58.810> that<00:02:59.470> one<00:02:59.739> used<00:03:00.459> to<00:03:00.549> be

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
and then I took that one used to be

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:03.830 
and then I took that one used to be
there<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:02.200> put<00:03:02.440> that<00:03:02.470> one<00:03:02.709> up<00:03:02.769> there<00:03:03.069> so

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
there and put that one up there so

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.170 
there and put that one up there so
turned<00:03:04.840> out<00:03:04.959> nice<00:03:05.170> I<00:03:05.380> went<00:03:05.560> with<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.799> red

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
turned out nice I went with the red

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.110 
turned out nice I went with the red
black<00:03:07.180> red<00:03:07.569> felt<00:03:08.470> you<00:03:09.370> know<00:03:09.459> changing<00:03:10.000> the

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
black red felt you know changing the

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.420 
black red felt you know changing the
colors<00:03:10.510> from<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.560> from<00:03:11.859> the<00:03:11.980> felt<00:03:12.220> but<00:03:12.400> I

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
colors from the from the felt but I

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.650 
colors from the from the felt but I
think<00:03:12.670> it<00:03:12.730> turned<00:03:12.910> out<00:03:13.000> nice<00:03:13.209> I'll<00:03:13.480> probably

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
think it turned out nice I'll probably

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.300 
think it turned out nice I'll probably
do<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.930> same<00:03:13.959> thing<00:03:14.139> on<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:15.100> other<00:03:15.130> side

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
do the same thing on the other side

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.750 
do the same thing on the other side
eventually<00:03:15.790> so<00:03:16.239> anyway<00:03:16.930> I<00:03:17.370> don't<00:03:18.370> know<00:03:18.549> I

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
eventually so anyway I don't know I

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.699 
eventually so anyway I don't know I
don't<00:03:18.850> know<00:03:19.000> should<00:03:19.209> I<00:03:19.329> hang<00:03:19.540> these<00:03:19.750> like

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
don't know should I hang these like

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.759 
don't know should I hang these like
actually<00:03:21.190> hang<00:03:21.400> these<00:03:21.609> up<00:03:21.850> a<00:03:22.180> little<00:03:22.209> bit<00:03:22.769> on
