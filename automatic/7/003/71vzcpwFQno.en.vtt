00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.750
 I just placed the 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:10.110
 the camshaft this here in its 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.780
 position on tacks 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.769
 after squeezing everything well as 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.760
 has done 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:21.520
 the pulley would be a central screw 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.890
 you have to put it in its position 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.980
 and this brand has to be close to 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.980
 this one up here as a reference 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.600
 to the burning part a bit then you 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.399
 about everything I could after I've 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.860
 locked the pulley against the screw 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.820
 that holds the case by putting a 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.790
 screwdriver 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.590
 and so in this position and forcing a 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.440
 little forward to put it to the bottom 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.510
 where can come in enough can and forcing 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.110
 and the palante the screw makes it look like 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.180
 of stop and thus could loosen the nut 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.589
 The crankshaft is not in position 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.570
 I found it was a bit short 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:05.440
 reassembled what tight gave him the 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.030
 little push that was missing and that's it 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.750
 crankshaft of the camshaft in its 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.159
 position 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.679
 and it does not move anymore 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.759
 now there 's this camshaft in the 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:17.759
 position that has to be 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.390
 good 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.120
 we will continue recording with I have to 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.380
 place the timing belt 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.590
 clean first stage of the board of 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.740
 cams this cam stage clean the 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.650
 together here you do not have to put silicone or 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.360
 nothing more than clean it well 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.860
 because it goes to a rubber in the other cap it goes 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.580
 a rubber band that goes inside a 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.300
 rail 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.190
 If it ever lost, it is removed 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.710
 put some silicone and squeeze 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.420
 with the rubber now I will see it or change the 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.009
 rubber for another new 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.580
 but now I will see what I have to 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.299
 do the same if I put it tomorrow or the day after 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:04.009
 when this car is walking I put it 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:07.710
 of what he loses I will put silicone 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:10.610
 together a little and squeeze over and 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.610
 here nothing happens 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.940
 I'll put a rubber band when there's money 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.560
 to buy it 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.410
 good 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.480
 I keep making the strap on 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.940
 distribution that before removing it there 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.600
 than mark it 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.830
 you have to mark to see that is the bomb of 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.500
 water when marking the one that has no position 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.050
 this is the camshaft pulley 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.700
 where the valves go 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.830
 tree pulley valves 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.460
 camshaft east and down there a 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.100
 little girl who does not look good 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.280
 down and now you see that's the one from 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.780
 crankshaft the one that drags the entire engine 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:56.319
 that is very important to mark it 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:03:00.999
 that is necessary to mark it and it is 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.950
 I remember if there was more pulley or something 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:05.920
 because there are times when I get a side 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.359
 you have to mark the two gave me a pulley 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.859
 for the valves it is sometimes two 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:12.219
 pulleys for the valves then there's 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:14.590
 to mark the two pulleys but the one 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:16.750
 I touched the water pump 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.120
 it is necessary because it does not have any 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.780
 specific position 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.840
 any 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.290
 well we continue working if any 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.390
 he was asking and this car where heck 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.940
 takes the thermostat 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.620
 it's a million dollar question where 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.650
 this car the thermostat the explanation 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.270
 found now to change the 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.520
 thermostat of this car you have to take out 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:47.720
 the timing belt the pulley is 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:52.180
 this casing and this tube 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:55.510
 inside is the thermostat 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.459
 behind this tube the thermostat 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.950
 I thought I could extract the pump from 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:03.189
 not water is here behind this 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.840
 tube there inside the block there are two 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:07.780
 screws behind this casing and two 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.370
 more screws are removed and the 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.319
 local thermostat take any of this from 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.170
 up here but you have to take the 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.960
 distribution should change the 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.049
 distribution 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.139
 at the same time you change the thermostat 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.520
 I had never touched him until now 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.710
 Well before removing this pulley for 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.760
 change it, we will do it without removing the 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.180
 Timing belt 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:34.150
 you act on this screw 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.560
 and you can take out the distribution belt 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.030
 after and the pulley 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.900
 to change the thermostat and then 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.900
 reassemble everything 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:46.289
 I will not let you continue working
