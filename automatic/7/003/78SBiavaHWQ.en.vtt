00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
cleaned out the pins and put on a Stock

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.560 
cleaned out the pins and put on a Stock
Show<00:04:05.010> and<00:04:06.010> so<00:04:06.250> then<00:04:06.550> the<00:04:06.670> formalization<00:04:07.150> of

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
Show and so then the formalization of

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.940 
Show and so then the formalization of
the<00:04:07.630> Stock<00:04:07.900> Show<00:04:07.930> as<00:04:08.320> a<00:04:08.350> separate

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
the Stock Show as a separate

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.330 
the Stock Show as a separate
freestanding<00:04:09.250> entity<00:04:10.050> really<00:04:11.340> became

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
freestanding entity really became

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.210 
freestanding entity really became
crucial<00:04:12.850> as<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.620> railroads<00:04:14.620> withdrew<00:04:15.040> their

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
crucial as the railroads withdrew their

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.800 
crucial as the railroads withdrew their
support<00:04:15.250> from<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:15.880> central<00:04:16.239> markets<00:04:16.600> in<00:04:16.750> the

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
support from the central markets in the

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.289 
support from the central markets in the
central<00:04:17.170> markets<00:04:17.530> in<00:04:17.709> essence<00:04:18.040> closed<00:04:19.000> down

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
central markets in essence closed down

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.990 
central markets in essence closed down
and<00:04:19.780> that<00:04:20.410> left<00:04:20.650> the<00:04:20.980> National<00:04:21.520> Western<00:04:21.850> is

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
and that left the National Western is

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.570 
and that left the National Western is
one<00:04:22.150> of<00:04:22.240> the<00:04:22.300> few<00:04:22.510> shows<00:04:22.540> that<00:04:23.200> still<00:04:24.190> was<00:04:24.370> tied

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
one of the few shows that still was tied

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.150 
one of the few shows that still was tied
