00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
and recording there two buttons here the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.530 
and recording there two buttons here the
-<00:01:44.159> 10<00:01:44.490> button<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.479> get<00:01:45.810> set<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.409> gain<00:01:46.680> -<00:01:47.540> -10

- 10 button is to get set the gain - -10

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.800 
- 10 button is to get set the gain - -10
which<00:01:49.280> produces<00:01:50.280> actually<00:01:51.030> much<00:01:51.299> richer

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810

sounds as you will hear when we do the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.109 
sounds as you will hear when we do the
sound<00:01:54.720> test<00:01:55.020> later<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.950> other<00:01:56.189> button<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.850> to

sound test later the other button is to

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.190 
sound test later the other button is to
adjust<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:58.140> base<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.250> mic<00:01:59.490> and<00:02:00.200> that's

adjust the base of the mic and that's

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.679 
adjust the base of the mic and that's
pretty<00:02:01.350> much<00:02:01.500> what<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.979> mic<00:02:02.189> looks<00:02:02.700> like<00:02:03.000> on

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
pretty much what the mic looks like on

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:10.309 
pretty much what the mic looks like on
the<00:02:04.469> outside<00:02:07.789> before<00:02:08.789> we<00:02:09.209> show<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.509> how<00:02:09.929> well

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319

microphone first of all you do not need

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.930 
microphone first of all you do not need
a<00:02:18.090> preamp<00:02:18.780> or<00:02:19.050> phantom<00:02:19.890> power<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.490> power<00:02:20.670> it

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
a preamp or phantom power to power it

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.290 
a preamp or phantom power to power it
it's<00:02:21.150> USB<00:02:21.930> it's<00:02:22.530> plug<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.070> play<00:02:23.460> and<00:02:23.700> does<00:02:24.090> not

now is from my camcorder mic so what I'm

right now is from the u 37 microphone
and<00:03:23.070> this<00:03:23.850> is<00:03:23.970> not<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.450> camcorder<00:03:25.080> microphone

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
and this is not the camcorder microphone

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.100 
and this is not the camcorder microphone
that<00:03:25.950> you<00:03:25.980> were<00:03:26.220> hearing<00:03:26.549> previously<00:03:27.390> and<00:03:27.600> as

that you were hearing previously and as
you<00:03:28.440> can<00:03:28.620> probably<00:03:28.830> tell<00:03:29.070> it's<00:03:29.549> a<00:03:29.730> much<00:03:30.299> warmer

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
you can probably tell it's a much warmer

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.330 
you can probably tell it's a much warmer
sound<00:03:32.100> with<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:33.030> very<00:03:33.510> little<00:03:34.340> background

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
sound with a very little background

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
whatsoever no pops at all so it's a very

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.710 
whatsoever no pops at all so it's a very
smooth<00:03:43.350> warm<00:03:44.070> sound<00:03:44.640> now<00:03:45.180> what<00:03:45.360> I'm<00:03:45.480> going<00:03:45.660> to

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
smooth warm sound now what I'm going to

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.009 
smooth warm sound now what I'm going to
do<00:03:45.959> is<00:03:46.290> switch<00:03:47.100> it<00:03:47.400> over<00:03:47.519> to<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.930> zero<00:03:50.000> gain

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
do is switch it over to the zero gain

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.640 
do is switch it over to the zero gain
setting<00:03:52.019> and<00:03:52.230> that's<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:52.980> lot<00:03:53.430> louder<00:03:54.030> but<00:03:54.989> what

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
setting and that's a lot louder but what

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.580 
setting and that's a lot louder but what
it<00:03:55.769> does<00:03:56.010> is<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.910> sound<00:03:57.299> doesn't<00:03:57.660> seem<00:03:58.110> to<00:03:58.350> be

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
it does is the sound doesn't seem to be

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.460 
it does is the sound doesn't seem to be
as<00:03:58.799> warm<00:03:59.340> so<00:03:59.760> what<00:03:59.970> we<00:04:00.209> would<00:04:00.420> recommend<00:04:01.230> is

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
as warm so what we would recommend is

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.400 
as warm so what we would recommend is
keep<00:04:02.459> it<00:04:02.700> in<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:04.010> -10<00:04:05.030> decibel<00:04:06.030> gain<00:04:06.410> setting

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
keep it in the -10 decibel gain setting

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.620 
keep it in the -10 decibel gain setting
and<00:04:07.620> what<00:04:07.799> this<00:04:08.010> does<00:04:08.220> is<00:04:08.489> produce<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:09.150> very

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
and what this does is produce a very

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.460 
and what this does is produce a very
warm<00:04:10.200> sound<00:04:10.769> for<00:04:11.780> narration<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:12.989> for

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
warm sound for narration and for
