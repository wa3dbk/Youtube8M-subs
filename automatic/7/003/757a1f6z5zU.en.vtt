00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:07.710
 I told your colleagues the truth 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.990
 regret and are the points left to 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.690
 bergamo and the points left with the milan 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.350
 those are points we would have deserved 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.240
 to have a game tonight well 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.199
 contact an extremely difficult team 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.050
 he defended himself in 10 were always good 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.099
 then to restart we also have 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.560
 interpreted 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.250
 if we had been written away we would have you 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.600
 definitely paid the juve on the 10 for the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.160
 Verona risked three counter-attacks 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.780
 crazy that are on the 2 shares 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.870
 it also became difficult for juve 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.420
 so this is to say that a game 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.059
 not easy and regret in this match 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.940
 which is not so much the fact of being 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.410
 went ahead twice but on 2 1 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.780
 we took a goal post with a goalkeeper 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.340
 and if he went inside we would have closed the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.350
 This game even then no one 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.309
 he would have nothing to say then is 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.809
 clear that those pages are 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.670
 determined to be decided by the episodes 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.739
 the episode was not positive because 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.619
 a padano herat a bengasi has received a 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.770
 equalize a penalty perhaps avoidable but 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.380
 so it's part of the game 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.909
 moment when the draw of regret 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.140
 it's not about this game but only those 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.770
 previous you hear the median 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.649
 complete turnover we have seen the three 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.549
 of the line 5 in short, gone good 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:30.610
 answers you expect something more 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.320
 normal and normal that we do the 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.819
 group speech 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.369
 we did we started three years 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:38.770
 ago we bring it forward a speech of 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.270
 group means that going all over 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.600
 in the same way and have all the 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.050
 same rights in the game misses a little 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.690
 maksimovic and more 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.670
 did not understand yet does not speak Italian 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.810
 so it's a bit of a struggle 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.520
 we are waiting for him because a 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.140
 very good player we expect Easter 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.840
 that you also find the condition 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.840
 from the point of view above all physical and 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.280
 masiello who is coming then the others 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.009
 they all played and they are all today 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.939
 we played with rodriguez and returned 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:17.200
 after almost a month of absence 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:18.489
 motionless that had been coming for four days 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.260
 of fever 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.180
 from ambrose asked me to replace it 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.829
 there was a bit of various ailments 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.489
 however, we held up 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:28.930
 at the top in the chest if we had won 3 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.670
 No one would have had anything to say about it 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.500
 just as I have nothing to say about the 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.650
 made that the same people with mister io 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.420
 Sunday they were another star yo yo of 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.040
 defend yourself in this way 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.689
 honestly I did not expect why 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.669
 also in the presence of Turin as with the 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:44.680
 speed adjacent to the same game 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:47.700
 just to know if you too 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.590
 you were expecting a speed as it was 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.969
 own maksimovic shame that you struggle 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.139
 because perhaps seen the physical prowess 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:57.879
 could be a more varied weight e 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:59.650
 colleagues out to contrast luca toni 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.629
 perhaps today then over time it has 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.240
 also asserted the stature in the 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:09.890
 its own showcase is 20 years old 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.290
 must understand the tactical aspect why 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.630
 the qualities are absolutely important 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.790
 but the tactical aspect as well 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.950
 important in Italy and in the world there is a 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.600
 bit of communication problems 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.790
 a few minutes longer than the others e 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.020
 employs that from the time a boy 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.810
 very young who has a great deal 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.780
 the future will surely come 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.959
 while on the fact that I waited for the 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.260
 verona so absolutely yes they moved 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.000
 their way of playing and the ability to 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.510
 these players restart once 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.390
 regained I repeat you don't have someone 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.390
 wanted what the boarding and us today 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.720
 we would be here to talk about a game 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.980
 gone bad instead we are here to talk to you 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.480
 a game that could go very well 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.820
 if they had taken a stake Meggiorini 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.440
 but then again I said this I know nothing else 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.470
 regret 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.830
 when you meet a solid team in 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.620
 health that is ready to restart 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.750
 the episodes determine if not 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.190
 exploit the favorable episode cisco that 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:16.010
 started from the non-episode 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.350
 favorable but I left from the sea 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.330
 on balance I am turnover 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.260
 the yellow yellow that was talked about that 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:27.650
 yesterday commented on the voice to the technicians 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:30.290
 all because you saw that 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.080
 at 80 percent of the balloon came 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:36.169
 searched recently and then by moretti for 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.440
 features maybe even went 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:43.039
 better but being banned will be a 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:47.889
 sin lose captain commander a 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.889
 set of simple things but no but no 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:54.110
 20 year old boy who usually has in 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:58.520
 series to did in my opinion is enough 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:01.010
 then at the beginning he didn't have the measurements 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.720
 so we suffered in between then to 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.539
 weight the measures did much better 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.710
 it's not an easy game for cites 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.710
 also a role because it should have 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:15.770
 to risk something but every time 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.300
 if we had risked it if there had been 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.550
 an error would be a problem 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.530
 they were great at leaving feet 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.520
 it was a good read I would say for 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:27.740
 be the first final game but what 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.500
 he doesn't know why he would be confident but 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.450
 most expected match by your fans and if 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.220
 it is a bonus also for this bull 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.870
 I don't know how to deploy the top scorer 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.490
 if you know that from tonight alessio 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.840
 at least temporarily 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.140
 new year nothing 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:45.040
 the CEO we could not do it alone 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.040
 exactly how it is possible
