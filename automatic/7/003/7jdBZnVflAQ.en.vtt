00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 Hello UTB psycho artur learn in 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.670
 our game besides the fact that everyone 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.410
 tank there is a certain tth in the hangar then 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.599
 there is 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.200
 what class does the average puts out 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.509
 ah 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.789
 what are the characteristics there gun so 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.539
 further man who himself did not play on 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.689
 these machines 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.640
 relying purely on tth in the hangar not immediately 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.070
 can understand what is intended 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.810
 natalya is another car so sometimes people 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.910
 just for what they like for example 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.570
 German technology swings to leopard-1 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.760
 and further keep them 2 4 with 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.480
 average summer damage for 300s 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.280
 survival and there about 25 percent and 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.559
 play but does not get that pleasure 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.160
 which could get for example from us 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.539
 twenty first all why because 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.829
 people mostly want 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.149
 want to crush and bend 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.070
 I think that we are still a minority 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.449
 our game like to stand in the bushes and 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.670
 shoot yes max not far 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.699
 substituted and so on especially 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.280
 realize your throw say so 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.270
 get close when you can 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.799
 it is much more convenient and more pleasant to tank 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.040
 121 this is exactly the tank he created for 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.950
 attacks here are not some compromises in 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.500
 the side of the bad cannon is bad 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.659
 booking insufficient mobility 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.450
 here is all the only thing 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.000
 discourages people from buying this tank 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.549
 These are bad corners and allegedly not the most 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.350
 exact gun but applying this tank 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.650
 in a certain way you are leveling everything 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.750
 these flaws are left alone 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.640
 go to banana on himmelsdorf and even 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.590
 hit the top like me if now you 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.540
 will still have to climb the mountain or 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.060
 go somewhere ours that is 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.250
 wait until your allies and it will help 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.230
 otherwise you just scattered these tigers 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.730
 2 there 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:55.340
 if 3 and so on, that is, here you are just 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.560
 driving a banana like a heavy tank 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.450
 think that if nominally average something 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.010
 in fact must act that way 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.570
 how would act like on someone 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:07.850
 T-44 or the same 59 no taip the tenth 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.400
 the level is all very different and often 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.910
 Rings travel tank T-shki ride on 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.880
 banana 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.930
 tyazh go to the mountain I'm not talking about such 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.050
 tyazh like a hundred 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:22.580
 utyazhki like 50b or T57 heavy truth 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.350
 senha's concept is great 1ru of course it is 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.750
 Only acquired us with stage or with 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.790
 Someone agreed but some unique people 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.160
 believe that once they have the drum tank 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.840
 banana to do nothing, and here's another 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.540
 one indisputable plus of this tank 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.910
 armor piercing shells many now 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.330
 they say that here are hunger arrows such 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.320
 bad people what to do and nose for 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.160
 everyone loves goals arrows good news 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.200
 armor piercing shells of this tank 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.450
 allow more parts of gold not 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.160
 use due to the fact that these 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.320
 armor piercing present normalization 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.000
 they can tangentially enter 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.290
 such difficult booking as for example 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.080
 on the tower of a 8 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.490
 There is there armor where thin but she under 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.550
 wild angle beveled 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:08.000
 with bumps and very often shells 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.530
 e50m leopard 1 getting into this armor then 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.690
 there is a little bit not reaching the flaps 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.600
 just bounce bounce no 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.450
 punch all because of itself 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.280
 subcaliber when touches 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.070
 booking he does not turn over 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.470
 he just ricochet further and all both 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.540
 beha wrap a little and thus 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.700
 did not see the angle that does not allow 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.940
 punk sabber too similar armor penetration 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.860
 go there for the same stb-1 for example you 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.290
 face a big problem be it 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.820
 try to shoot like this without 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.120
 Golda even 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.739
 isu 8 nov 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.090
 she is one hundred and twenty first gold 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.690
 need only to 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.209
 punch forehead turret or 100 or felling 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.819
 This for e100 were in the case when 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.590
 you need to drag it wildly and punch 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.540
 someone from a great distance because 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.940
 armored penetration shells with 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.220
 the distance do not lose showed them to be 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.379
 the simplest against the eighth levels 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.360
 But this is exactly the result of which 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.170
 seeks any person who shakes 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.049
 10th level 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.480
 you suffer on level eight falls 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.579
 against a dozen mentally you understand that 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.620
 someday do you get it or dozens 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.410
 and in the same way will fall against eights 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.450
 be able to punish them to 121 is just 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.329
 the tank that will allow you to calm 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.729
 bend in such notes and will not disappoint 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.460
 thank you for watching whoever 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.350
 interesting video after 21 subscribe 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.610
 on my channel so as not to miss the new 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.610
