00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
for it doesn't really go into depth in

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.390 
for it doesn't really go into depth in
that<00:01:39.299> but<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.079> book<00:01:40.320> does<00:01:40.560> it's<00:01:40.920> got<00:01:41.130> all

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
that but this book does it's got all

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.889 
that but this book does it's got all
kinds<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.759> cool<00:01:41.970> stuff<00:01:42.000> as<00:01:42.420> far<00:01:42.450> as<00:01:42.630> flow

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
kinds of cool stuff as far as flow
