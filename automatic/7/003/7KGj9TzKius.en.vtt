how did you become interested in the

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:04.380 
how did you become interested in the
subject<00:00:03.070> of<00:00:03.459> adaptation<00:00:03.969> I<00:00:04.029> mean<00:00:04.149> what<00:00:04.270> does

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:04.390 
subject of adaptation I mean what does

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.740 
subject of adaptation I mean what does
it<00:00:04.569> open<00:00:04.720> up<00:00:05.100> intellectually<00:00:06.100> I<00:00:06.540> think<00:00:07.540> I've

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:07.750 
it open up intellectually I think I've

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.990 
it open up intellectually I think I've
always<00:00:07.960> had<00:00:08.290> a<00:00:08.350> penchant<00:00:08.650> for<00:00:08.980> I<00:00:09.549> don't<00:00:09.879> want

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.000 
always had a penchant for I don't want

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.640 
always had a penchant for I don't want
to<00:00:10.059> say<00:00:10.150> rescuing<00:00:10.719> or<00:00:10.869> protecting<00:00:11.440> but<00:00:11.530> it

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:11.650 
to say rescuing or protecting but it

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.220 
to say rescuing or protecting but it
always<00:00:11.770> feels<00:00:12.039> that<00:00:12.190> way<00:00:12.990> parts<00:00:13.990> of<00:00:14.110> our

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230 
always feels that way parts of our

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.070 
always feels that way parts of our
culture<00:00:14.440> that<00:00:14.799> people<00:00:15.100> think<00:00:15.340> of<00:00:15.520> as

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
culture that people think of as

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.570 
culture that people think of as
secondary<00:00:17.080> less<00:00:17.740> important<00:00:18.220> than<00:00:18.250> others<00:00:18.430> and

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
secondary less important than others and

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.670 
secondary less important than others and
many<00:00:19.450> years<00:00:19.630> ago<00:00:19.690> I<00:00:19.750> worked<00:00:19.900> on<00:00:20.080> parody

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
many years ago I worked on parody

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.260 
many years ago I worked on parody
because<00:00:20.980> everybody<00:00:21.370> said<00:00:21.580> parody<00:00:21.910> wasn't<00:00:22.180> an

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
because everybody said parody wasn't an

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.130 
because everybody said parody wasn't an
important<00:00:22.630> thing<00:00:22.720> and<00:00:22.810> I<00:00:22.870> thought<00:00:23.020> it<00:00:23.080> was

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
important thing and I thought it was

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.170 
important thing and I thought it was
incredibly<00:00:23.620> important<00:00:24.070> in<00:00:24.250> the<00:00:24.880> middle<00:00:25.060> of<00:00:25.090> a

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
incredibly important in the middle of a

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.510 
incredibly important in the middle of a
postmodern<00:00:25.720> culture<00:00:25.870> that<00:00:26.200> we<00:00:26.320> were<00:00:26.440> in<00:00:26.619> and

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
postmodern culture that we were in and

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.100 
postmodern culture that we were in and
adaptations<00:00:28.360> are<00:00:28.510> another<00:00:28.720> one<00:00:28.900> of<00:00:29.020> these

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110 
adaptations are another one of these

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.380 
adaptations are another one of these
things<00:00:29.380> that<00:00:29.530> people<00:00:29.830> see<00:00:30.220> as<00:00:30.490> secondary

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
things that people see as secondary

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.360 
things that people see as secondary
derivative<00:00:31.720> and<00:00:32.259> I<00:00:32.619> think<00:00:33.130> they're<00:00:33.250> really

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
derivative and I think they're really

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.950 
derivative and I think they're really
interesting<00:00:34.030> and<00:00:34.180> the<00:00:34.540> reason<00:00:34.840> I<00:00:34.900> think

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
interesting and the reason I think

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.450 
interesting and the reason I think
they're<00:00:35.230> interesting<00:00:35.710> adaptations<00:00:36.310> in

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
they're interesting adaptations in

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.450 
they're interesting adaptations in
particular<00:00:37.000> is<00:00:37.210> that<00:00:37.930> this<00:00:38.260> is<00:00:38.410> how<00:00:38.590> we<00:00:39.160> I

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
particular is that this is how we I

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.000 
particular is that this is how we I
think<00:00:39.790> have<00:00:39.940> always<00:00:40.390> told<00:00:41.260> stories<00:00:41.770> we

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
think have always told stories we

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.470 
think have always told stories we
haven't<00:00:42.250> just<00:00:42.370> told<00:00:42.640> stories<00:00:43.149> from<00:00:43.360> the

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
haven't just told stories from the

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.139 
haven't just told stories from the
beginning<00:00:43.899> of<00:00:44.020> human<00:00:44.500> time<00:00:44.770> we've<00:00:45.460> retold

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
beginning of human time we've retold

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.270 
beginning of human time we've retold
stories<00:00:46.630> and<00:00:46.899> that's<00:00:47.530> what<00:00:47.739> interested<00:00:48.250> me

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
stories and that's what interested me

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.490 
stories and that's what interested me
it's<00:00:48.640> not<00:00:48.790> just<00:00:48.850> that<00:00:49.149> we<00:00:49.329> have<00:00:49.540> today<00:00:49.899> but<00:00:50.380> it

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
it's not just that we have today but it

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.389 
it's not just that we have today but it
is<00:00:50.680> true<00:00:50.860> we<00:00:51.070> have<00:00:51.220> more<00:00:51.510> media<00:00:52.510> new<00:00:53.250> means<00:00:54.250> of

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
is true we have more media new means of

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.090 
is true we have more media new means of
diffusion<00:00:54.940> so<00:00:55.059> we<00:00:55.180> need<00:00:55.329> more<00:00:55.510> stories<00:00:56.050> but<00:00:56.980> we

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
diffusion so we need more stories but we

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.319 
diffusion so we need more stories but we
aren't<00:00:57.219> just<00:00:57.309> making<00:00:57.520> up<00:00:57.700> new<00:00:57.850> stories<00:00:58.149> we're

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
aren't just making up new stories we're

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.139 
aren't just making up new stories we're
retailing<00:00:58.899> old<00:00:59.050> toys<00:00:59.260> but<00:00:59.469> we<00:00:59.559> always<00:00:59.739> have

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
retailing old toys but we always have

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.819 
retailing old toys but we always have
we've<00:01:01.149> always<00:01:01.390> retold<00:01:01.989> stories<00:01:02.379> I<00:01:02.410> mean<00:01:02.649> only

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
we've always retold stories I mean only

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.039 
we've always retold stories I mean only
one<00:01:02.920> of<00:01:03.280> Shakespeare's<00:01:03.760> plays<00:01:04.059> is<00:01:04.420> not<00:01:04.869> an

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
one of Shakespeare's plays is not an

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.199 
one of Shakespeare's plays is not an
adaptation<00:01:05.199> and<00:01:05.859> even<00:01:06.159> it<00:01:06.369> adapts

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:07.209 
adaptation and even it adapts

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:10.709 
adaptation and even it adapts
conventions<00:01:07.899> from<00:01:08.289> other<00:01:08.499> things<00:01:08.889> so<00:01:09.729> this<00:01:10.569> is

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:10.719 
conventions from other things so this is

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:12.179 
conventions from other things so this is
the<00:01:10.840> history<00:01:11.109> of<00:01:11.139> how<00:01:11.289> we've<00:01:11.469> always<00:01:11.619> said<00:01:11.859> why

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
the history of how we've always said why

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:13.649 
the history of how we've always said why
do<00:01:12.249> we<00:01:12.459> denigrate<00:01:12.909> it<00:01:13.060> so<00:01:13.270> I<00:01:13.299> was<00:01:13.450> fascinated

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
do we denigrate it so I was fascinated

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.199 
do we denigrate it so I was fascinated
by<00:01:14.049> that<00:01:14.319> you<00:01:14.740> said<00:01:15.130> an<00:01:15.219> adaptation<00:01:15.549> is<00:01:16.179> a

00:01:16.199 --> 00:01:16.209 
by that you said an adaptation is a

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:18.899 
by that you said an adaptation is a
derivation<00:01:16.539> that<00:01:17.049> is<00:01:17.350> not<00:01:17.560> derivative<00:01:18.159> yeah

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
derivation that is not derivative yeah

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.449 
derivation that is not derivative yeah
it<00:01:19.240> obviously<00:01:19.600> comes<00:01:19.840> out<00:01:20.170> of<00:01:20.350> out<00:01:20.560> of<00:01:20.619> I<00:01:20.920> think

00:01:21.449 --> 00:01:21.459 
it obviously comes out of out of I think

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:25.440 
it obviously comes out of out of I think
that<00:01:21.700> because<00:01:22.450> a<00:01:23.409> text<00:01:24.219> comes<00:01:24.459> first<00:01:24.729> or<00:01:24.939> work

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
that because a text comes first or work

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.419 
that because a text comes first or work
comes<00:01:25.719> first<00:01:25.810> doesn't<00:01:26.469> mean<00:01:26.619> that<00:01:26.799> it<00:01:26.979> has<00:01:27.009> any

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429 
comes first doesn't mean that it has any

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:29.580 
comes first doesn't mean that it has any
claim<00:01:27.880> to<00:01:28.119> any<00:01:28.359> kind<00:01:28.659> of<00:01:28.749> authenticity<00:01:28.840> I

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
claim to any kind of authenticity I

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.580 
claim to any kind of authenticity I
think<00:01:30.459> that<00:01:30.609> these<00:01:30.759> stories<00:01:31.439> adaptations<00:01:32.439> and

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
think that these stories adaptations and

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.769 
think that these stories adaptations and
they're<00:01:32.709> adapted<00:01:33.159> stories<00:01:33.999> exist<00:01:34.450> sort<00:01:34.719> of

00:01:34.769 --> 00:01:34.779 
they're adapted stories exist sort of

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:35.999 
they're adapted stories exist sort of
vertically<00:01:35.259> for<00:01:35.469> me<00:01:35.590> rather<00:01:35.859> than

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
vertically for me rather than

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.440 
vertically for me rather than
horizontally<00:01:36.700> that<00:01:36.880> there<00:01:36.999> isn't<00:01:37.179> a<00:01:37.209> priority

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
horizontally that there isn't a priority

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.230 
horizontally that there isn't a priority
and<00:01:37.990> after<00:01:38.529> there's<00:01:39.069> a<00:01:39.159> kind<00:01:39.520> of<00:01:39.670> they<00:01:39.880> exist

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
and after there's a kind of they exist

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.870 
and after there's a kind of they exist
for<00:01:41.049> me<00:01:41.079> when<00:01:41.319> I<00:01:41.349> watch<00:01:41.619> and<00:01:41.829> I<00:01:41.920> suspect<00:01:42.789> this

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
for me when I watch and I suspect this

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.760 
for me when I watch and I suspect this
is<00:01:43.029> true<00:01:43.209> for<00:01:43.240> other<00:01:43.509> people<00:01:43.869> too<00:01:44.049> when<00:01:44.740> i

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
is true for other people too when i

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.309 
is true for other people too when i

adaptation of a book that I know it's

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.050 
adaptation of a book that I know it's
like<00:01:50.439> watching<00:01:50.649> a<00:01:50.889> palimpsest<00:01:51.310> there's<00:01:51.909> sort

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
like watching a palimpsest there's sort

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.029 
like watching a palimpsest there's sort
of<00:01:52.119> two<00:01:52.179> things<00:01:52.869> going<00:01:53.200> on<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:53.619> what's

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
of two things going on and what's

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.129 
of two things going on and what's
happening<00:01:54.429> for<00:01:54.579> me<00:01:54.609> is<00:01:54.909> that<00:01:55.179> I'm<00:01:55.479> oscillating

00:01:56.129 --> 00:01:56.139 
happening for me is that I'm oscillating

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:59.399 
happening for me is that I'm oscillating
between<00:01:56.249> the<00:01:57.249> work<00:01:57.399> I<00:01:57.549> know<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.689> novel<00:01:59.079> or<00:01:59.319> the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
between the work I know the novel or the

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.559 
between the work I know the novel or the
book<00:01:59.590> in<00:01:59.799> this<00:01:59.950> case<00:02:00.189> and<00:02:00.399> the<00:02:01.239> film<00:02:01.450> i'm

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
book in this case and the film i'm

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.089 
book in this case and the film i'm
watching<00:02:01.959> and<00:02:02.139> i'm<00:02:02.259> flipping<00:02:02.649> between<00:02:02.739> the

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:03.099 
watching and i'm flipping between the

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:05.309 
watching and i'm flipping between the
two<00:02:03.279> and<00:02:03.520> i'm<00:02:04.179> not<00:02:04.270> necessarily<00:02:04.779> comparing

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
two and i'm not necessarily comparing

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.440 
two and i'm not necessarily comparing
them<00:02:05.469> i<00:02:05.649> probably<00:02:06.340> am<00:02:06.549> but<00:02:07.329> I'm<00:02:07.419> not

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
them i probably am but I'm not

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.270 
them i probably am but I'm not
evaluating<00:02:08.319> that<00:02:08.470> comparison<00:02:08.979> I'm<00:02:09.070> just

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
evaluating that comparison I'm just

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.710 
evaluating that comparison I'm just
noticing<00:02:09.460> that<00:02:09.850> this<00:02:10.030> is<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.270> same<00:02:10.450> as<00:02:10.600> his

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
noticing that this is the same as his

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.150 
noticing that this is the same as his
difference<00:02:11.050> or<00:02:11.200> whatever<00:02:11.470> but<00:02:11.920> I've<00:02:12.040> always

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
difference or whatever but I've always

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.010 
difference or whatever but I've always
got<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.400> doubled<00:02:13.060> experience<00:02:13.600> so<00:02:13.720> for<00:02:13.900> me

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
got that doubled experience so for me

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.309 
got that doubled experience so for me
going

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
going

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.050 
going

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:18.759 
way and seeing it in new ways I think

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:20.189 
way and seeing it in new ways I think
there's<00:03:19.090> really<00:03:19.209> something<00:03:19.599> to<00:03:19.780> that<00:03:19.959> that

there's really something to that that

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.439 
there's really something to that that
that<00:03:20.500> sameness<00:03:21.400> but<00:03:21.639> difference<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.239> comes

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:22.449 
that sameness but difference that comes

it's a different culture today and I

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.659 
it's a different culture today and I
suspect<00:03:44.319> that<00:03:44.409> you<00:03:44.560> would<00:03:44.949> remake<00:03:45.310> even

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
suspect that you would remake even

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.149 
suspect that you would remake even
historical<00:03:46.060> ones<00:03:46.479> differently<00:03:46.989> I<00:03:47.199> think<00:03:47.979> that

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.159 
historical ones differently I think that

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.530 
historical ones differently I think that
remakes<00:03:48.519> are<00:03:48.669> always<00:03:48.909> interesting<00:03:49.389> because

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
remakes are always interesting because

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.780 
remakes are always interesting because
they<00:03:49.840> filmed<00:03:50.650> films<00:03:50.979> that<00:03:51.099> remake<00:03:51.370> films

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
they filmed films that remake films

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.360 
they filmed films that remake films
because<00:03:52.629> what<00:03:53.290> changes<00:03:53.769> well<00:03:53.919> the<00:03:54.009> audience

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
because what changes well the audience

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.280 
because what changes well the audience
changes<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:55.030> audience<00:03:55.269> is<00:03:55.509> if<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:55.900> if<00:03:56.169> it's

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
changes the audience is if the if it's

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.379

20 years later the audience is 20 years

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:00.059 
20 years later the audience is 20 years
later<00:03:58.689> and<00:03:58.870> they<00:03:59.019> may<00:03:59.169> know<00:03:59.349> that<00:03:59.560> film<00:03:59.889> so
