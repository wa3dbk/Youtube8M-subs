meter plugged into one servo and then

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.310 
meter plugged into one servo and then
plugged<00:01:39.210> into<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.570> receiver<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.110> they<00:01:40.200> can

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
plugged into the receiver so they can

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.020 
plugged into the receiver so they can
read<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.530> current<00:01:40.829> off<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.189> servo<00:01:41.549> so

read the current off of that servo so

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.100

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.020 
now we're at zero if you notice the
circles<00:02:01.240> are<00:02:01.329> very<00:02:01.479> quiet<00:02:01.780> now<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:03.030> now

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
circles are very quiet now and now

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.200 
circles are very quiet now and now
they're<00:02:04.240> balanced<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:06.460> now<00:02:06.579> that<00:02:06.640> we<00:02:06.820> balanced

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
they're balanced so now that we balanced

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.029 
they're balanced so now that we balanced
the<00:02:07.270> first<00:02:07.479> aileron<00:02:07.869> servo<00:02:07.899> it's<00:02:08.679> actually

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
the first aileron servo it's actually

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.370 
the first aileron servo it's actually
now<00:02:09.160> in<00:02:09.369> balanced<00:02:09.819> with<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:09.970> second<00:02:10.390> one<00:02:10.509> so

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
now in balanced with the second one so

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.500 
now in balanced with the second one so
with<00:02:11.500> that<00:02:11.620> being<00:02:11.770> said<00:02:11.890> now<00:02:12.550> they're<00:02:12.849> synced

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
with that being said now they're synced

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.240 
with that being said now they're synced
together<00:02:13.599> so<00:02:14.020> it's<00:02:14.200> Center<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:14.709> at<00:02:15.010> full

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
together so it's Center and at full

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.589 
together so it's Center and at full
stick<00:02:15.550> and<00:02:15.760> mid<00:02:15.910> stick<00:02:16.150> they'll<00:02:16.420> move

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
stick and mid stick they'll move

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.020 
stick and mid stick they'll move
together<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.230> if<00:02:17.769> you<00:02:17.950> if<00:02:18.310> for<00:02:18.580> some<00:02:18.610> reason

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
together and if you if for some reason

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.430 
together and if you if for some reason
they<00:02:19.120> get<00:02:19.269> off<00:02:19.450> what<00:02:19.750> you<00:02:19.870> can<00:02:20.019> do<00:02:20.140> is<00:02:20.260> go<00:02:20.380> to

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
they get off what you can do is go to

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.350 
they get off what you can do is go to
the<00:02:20.650> next<00:02:20.860> point<00:02:21.130> on<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.849> balance<00:02:22.209> function

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
the next point on the balance function

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.270 
the next point on the balance function
screen<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:23.140> if<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.349> move<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.680> servo<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:24.130> that

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
screen and if you move the servo to that

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.009 
screen and if you move the servo to that
point<00:02:24.550> then<00:02:25.150> you<00:02:25.300> can<00:02:25.450> balance<00:02:25.630> them<00:02:25.900> together

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
point then you can balance them together

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.979 
point then you can balance them together
again<00:02:26.319> if<00:02:26.590> they<00:02:26.680> get<00:02:26.800> out<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:27.040> balance<00:02:27.160> to
