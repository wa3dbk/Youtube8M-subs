00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
very odd sounding and the first couple

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.450 
very odd sounding and the first couple
listens<00:04:46.480> through<00:04:46.960> it's<00:04:47.230> interesting<00:04:48.010> but<00:04:48.430> I

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
listens through it's interesting but I

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.750 
listens through it's interesting but I
can<00:04:48.610> see<00:04:48.730> getting<00:04:48.970> very<00:04:49.540> annoying<00:04:49.960> but<00:04:50.830> I<00:04:51.220> like

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760
