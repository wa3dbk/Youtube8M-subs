00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.360

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:29.109
 blender came to me in this packaging and 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.940
 here he brought a seal the truth says best 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:35.800
 of duty 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:37.450
 to one award winner something like that but in 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.090
 English washing in English is very ugly and 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.290
 you know that my English is fatal and 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:46.060
 well, it came in this in this writing 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.960
 here as you can see it says 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:52.890
 sell in this part from here back comes 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:57.989
 as the instructive of what is the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.700
 sponge and this good explains you and others 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.370
 what it is made of and all these 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.440
 little things and well then you open it and in 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:10.180
 this part quote from here came a 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.950
 sponge this as well as stuck in 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.930
 our part of here and well then obvious 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.050
 the sponge without hydrating it is 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.120
 little girl here is already hydrated and 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.760
 Well, girls, this is the little nuns 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.310
 you look in this way that you can give 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:29.190
 account if it is a form of egg but 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:33.030
 it comes as elongated does not come so 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.910
 so round your form is a material you 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.340
 supposed to be latex free your form the 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.800
 It takes immediately very fast again 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.920
 back to me the truth the truth I 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.400
 he really liked the texture he takes when he 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.370
 be applying in certain areas or in 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:54.780
 I like your whole face a lot because it's 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:57.120
 very soft that yes I do not discuss it for 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.850
 nothing compared to all my brushes 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:05.220
 what do I have if it's definitely fine and 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:10.920
 blender is super super soft bone nothing 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:13.880
 rigid nothing lasts very soft is very soft 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.460
 I like a lot very much until that 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.870
 but also to be very very soft because 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.170
 You must have 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.750
 so be careful not for example in this 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.480
 If I have long nails then 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.210
 of not fitting the nails because then everything 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.280
 it is marked and tends to break down 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.600
 the same thing that is a very very very material 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.330
 soft 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.910
 I feel for example if I now have this 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.360
 This spot this makeup 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.820
 I did not take it away very well and if I 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.490
 I'm giving him hard and if he took him to put 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.670
 the nail as study is going to break like 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.620
 any this little sponge that I 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.350
 I have but let me tell you that I 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.930
 I feel that any sponge 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.030
 any of the Korean ones these 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.520
 that I have if I got it to grab like this 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.820
 with the nails holds May crowe like 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.660
 tear that this one because these like that 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:12.780
 more is not very very smooth the material or 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.520
 I do not know very much so I feel that if 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.670
 I do it to him right now at this moment 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.530
 it thunders opens then I'm not 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.060
 saying that the material is bad at 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.130
 otherwise I will repeat them the 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.440
 material to me it becomes very very good and 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.690
 in application and everything else but if 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.250
 I feel that this type of sponge is 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.560
 that treat them with a very careful 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.600
 special because then girls do not 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.290
 are worth three pesos true to me this 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:41.269
 cost 285 pesos I bought it with anahí 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:44.129
 on his page that calls after alter 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:46.349
 maker make up store 'I will leave you 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.239
 here below an information if any 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.819
 is interested in acquiring it 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.069
 with anahí they can do it and well 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.890
 girls in this part of here you go 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.140
 to have some little clips of how I 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.349
 Blur with this beauty sponge and 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.799
 Blender both the corrector of the eyes 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:07.079
 as the corrector of the other parts of 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:09.560
 my face you will also be able to 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:13.349
 see how to apply the foundation 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:16.949
 which is the one that I bring right now that is the 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.989
 of cover girl and I liked it a lot 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.509
 the makeup base also up 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.570
 right now I do not have any fat detail 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:26.669
 and I liked it a lot and also I 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.500
 I really liked how I applied it with this 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.289
 so here you are going to be seeing 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.289
 all that and good girls from the 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:36.240
 plane and blender there are three shades which is the 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.160
 pink is white and black 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.570
 soon I believe when I have a 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.520
 A little more money asked me for the 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.740
 black because personally so this 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.690
 color is already very trite 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.970
 of having asked for another color but 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.639
 So I did not want to try the 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.340
 famous from the first one that came out not that 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:56.400
 it was the rose and so good girls then 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:00.120
 to general features this beauty sponge 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.669
 good blender itself is worth it 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.220
 I go up to repeat the material is very good 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.699
 it's not indestructible girls so for 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.620
 please treat it with a lot of care 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:13.620
 because I repeat them again I feel 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.840
 that if you treat her like that for example 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.080
 this stain no longer came out and if you 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.419
 They are so cute the ideal and hard 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.849
 forget I think they are left without 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:26.310
 sponge then we better not go to 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:28.620
 to do that better we are going to take care of her because 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.630
 it cost us a lot of money and we're going to 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.220
 use it as it should be used and 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.050
 good airplanes, that's all from me 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.819
 part of truth I hope this review 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.819
 I have clarified some of your doubts that 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:40.349
 I had on this sponge and well that's 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:43.699
 all of my part we are seeing ourselves in 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:43.699
 an upcoming video chao
