this<00:00:05.190> is<00:00:05.310> chapter<00:00:05.520> five<00:00:05.819> and<00:00:06.089> we're<00:00:06.480> going<00:00:06.600> to

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
this is chapter five and we're going to

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.780 
this is chapter five and we're going to
go<00:00:06.779> over<00:00:06.810> decimation<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.770> final<00:00:08.340> check<00:00:08.550> and

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
go over decimation and final check and

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.580 
go over decimation and final check and
final<00:00:09.389> check<00:00:09.570> i<00:00:09.690> just<00:00:09.900> mean<00:00:10.050> that<00:00:10.080> you<00:00:10.410> want<00:00:10.559> to

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
final check i just mean that you want to

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.919 
final check i just mean that you want to
give<00:00:10.740> your<00:00:10.830> mesh<00:00:11.269> once-over<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.450> make<00:00:12.780> sure

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
give your mesh once-over and make sure

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.799 
give your mesh once-over and make sure
that<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.580> printable<00:00:14.580> one<00:00:15.420> thing<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.630> keep

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
that it is printable one thing to keep

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.349 
that it is printable one thing to keep
in<00:00:15.929> mind<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.440> all<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.160> pieces<00:00:17.400> are<00:00:17.730> thick

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
in mind is that all the pieces are thick

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.240 
in mind is that all the pieces are thick
enough<00:00:18.390> because<00:00:19.230> if<00:00:19.350> they're<00:00:19.470> too<00:00:19.619> thin<00:00:19.890> like

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
enough because if they're too thin like

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.120 
enough because if they're too thin like
if<00:00:20.340> it's<00:00:20.779> female<00:00:21.779> character<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.859> she<00:00:22.980> has

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
if it's female character and she has

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.550 
if it's female character and she has
really<00:00:23.430> slender<00:00:23.910> fingers<00:00:24.150> your<00:00:25.109> mesh<00:00:25.289> might

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
really slender fingers your mesh might

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.290 
really slender fingers your mesh might
actually<00:00:25.769> be<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.310> close<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.580> itself<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.269> the

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
actually be so close to itself that the

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.480 
actually be so close to itself that the
fingers<00:00:27.990> would<00:00:28.140> fall<00:00:28.380> off<00:00:28.410> it'll<00:00:29.039> print<00:00:29.279> would

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
fingers would fall off it'll print would

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.690 
fingers would fall off it'll print would
just<00:00:30.359> kind<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.599> be<00:00:30.720> broken<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.380> won't<00:00:31.529> be

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
just kind of be broken and it won't be

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.360 
just kind of be broken and it won't be
it<00:00:32.700> won't<00:00:32.759> give<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.210> what<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.750> had<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.079> mind

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
it won't give you what you had in mind

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.470 
it won't give you what you had in mind
so<00:00:35.370> on<00:00:35.460> my<00:00:35.610> character<00:00:35.850> I'm<00:00:36.120> going<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.300> look<00:00:36.390> at

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
so on my character I'm going to look at

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.750 
so on my character I'm going to look at
its<00:00:36.600> head<00:00:36.809> like<00:00:37.500> these<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:38.040> plate<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.700> I

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
its head like these this plate that I

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.610 
its head like these this plate that I
have<00:00:38.910> on<00:00:39.030> its<00:00:39.180> head<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:40.020> back<00:00:40.290> plate

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
have on its head and this back plate

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.220 
have on its head and this back plate
because<00:00:40.800> those<00:00:41.180> areas<00:00:42.180> are<00:00:42.210> pretty<00:00:43.140> thin

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
because those areas are pretty thin

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.810 
because those areas are pretty thin
you're<00:00:43.920> going<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.100> want<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.309> merge<00:00:44.430> all<00:00:44.670> your

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
you're going to want to merge all your

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.209 
you're going to want to merge all your
pieces<00:00:45.030> into<00:00:45.539> one<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.050> then<00:00:46.710> export<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.160> into

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
pieces into one and then export it into

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.160 
pieces into one and then export it into
an<00:00:47.430> STL<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.120> then<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.329> file<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.899> thought<00:00:49.140> of

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
an STL and then this file is thought of

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.170 
an STL and then this file is thought of
as<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.620> series<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.070> cross<00:00:50.370> sections<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.120> are

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
as a series of cross sections that are

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.830 
as a series of cross sections that are
printed<00:00:51.629> paper<00:00:52.170> thin<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:53.399> looking<00:00:54.360> up<00:00:54.480> here<00:00:54.690> in

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
printed paper thin so looking up here in

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.229 
printed paper thin so looking up here in
my<00:00:54.960> mesh<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.440> can<00:00:55.590> see<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.910> good<00:00:57.120> you

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
my mesh I can see that this is good you

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.260 
my mesh I can see that this is good you
know<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.170> cross<00:00:58.379> section<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.890> fine<00:00:59.270> this

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
know but the cross section is fine this

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.569 
know but the cross section is fine this
is<00:01:00.390> my<00:01:00.510> biggest<00:01:01.170> area<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.620> concern<00:01:01.770> here<00:01:02.250> maybe

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
is my biggest area of concern here maybe

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.850 
is my biggest area of concern here maybe
I'll<00:01:02.730> even<00:01:02.760> snip<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.420> top<00:01:03.600> off<00:01:03.809> again<00:01:04.140> just

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
I'll even snip the top off again just

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.920 
I'll even snip the top off again just
for<00:01:04.920> these<00:01:05.100> places<00:01:05.729> where<00:01:06.030> I've<00:01:06.119> really<00:01:06.510> sort

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
for these places where I've really sort

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.520 
for these places where I've really sort
of<00:01:06.990> mashed<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:08.040> mesh<00:01:08.280> onto<00:01:09.119> itself<00:01:09.450> oh<00:01:09.750> and

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
of mashed the mesh onto itself oh and

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.350 
of mashed the mesh onto itself oh and
you<00:01:10.950> know<00:01:10.979> what<00:01:11.100> i<00:01:11.280> should<00:01:11.400> say<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.880> right<00:01:12.119> away

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
you know what i should say is right away

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.580 
you know what i should say is right away
when<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.810> start<00:01:13.049> doing<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.260> you're<00:01:13.470> going

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
when you start doing this you're going

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.830 
when you start doing this you're going
to<00:01:13.650> want<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.830> have<00:01:14.010> double<00:01:14.640> sided<00:01:14.880> press<00:01:15.540> so

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
to want to have double sided press so

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.880 
to want to have double sided press so
here<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.229> up<00:01:16.380> on<00:01:16.530> my<00:01:16.680> interface<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:18.470> on<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
here it is up on my interface and on the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.090 
here it is up on my interface and on the
standard<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:21.869> default<00:01:22.229> interface<00:01:22.470> it's<00:01:22.920> down

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
standard the default interface it's down

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.789 
standard the default interface it's down
here<00:01:23.130> under<00:01:23.549> display<00:01:23.820> properties<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:25.740> you

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
here under display properties so you

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.109 
here under display properties so you
just<00:01:25.830> open<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.250> up<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.670> have<00:01:26.820> double

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
just open this up and you have double

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.240 
just open this up and you have double
sided<00:01:27.330> down<00:01:27.540> here<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.799> can<00:01:28.890> turn<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.189> on

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
sided down here so you can turn that on

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.920 
sided down here so you can turn that on
and<00:01:29.400> off<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.329> up<00:01:30.479> here<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.720> looking

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
and off so this up here is looking

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.469 
and off so this up here is looking
pretty<00:01:31.049> good<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.439> i'm<00:01:31.619> not<00:01:31.770> going<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.299> worry<00:01:33.299> so

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
pretty good so i'm not going to worry so

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.780 
pretty good so i'm not going to worry so
much<00:01:33.540> about<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:35.119> so<00:01:36.119> first<00:01:36.930> one<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.610> are<00:01:38.610> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
much about that so first one is are the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.389 
much about that so first one is are the
pieces<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.329> thin<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.570> they<00:01:39.780> won't<00:01:39.900> print

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.410 

another<00:01:43.399> thing<00:01:43.579> you<00:01:43.610> want<00:01:43.759> to<00:01:43.789> look<00:01:43.880> for<00:01:43.969> is<00:01:44.149> to

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
another thing you want to look for is to

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.959 
another thing you want to look for is to
make<00:01:44.600> sure<00:01:44.630> that<00:01:45.049> all<00:01:45.259> of<00:01:45.289> your<00:01:45.649> sub<00:01:46.460> tools<00:01:46.700> are

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
make sure that all of your sub tools are

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.990 
make sure that all of your sub tools are
properly<00:01:47.299> overlapping<00:01:47.780> one<00:01:48.020> another<00:01:48.820> so<00:01:49.820> the

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
properly overlapping one another so the

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.279 
properly overlapping one another so the
first<00:01:50.270> thing<00:01:50.360> I'm<00:01:50.600> going<00:01:50.689> to<00:01:50.780> look<00:01:50.840> at<00:01:51.049> are

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
first thing I'm going to look at are

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.830 
first thing I'm going to look at are
these<00:01:51.579> feet<00:01:52.579> going<00:01:53.000> into<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.329> base<00:01:55.810> so<00:01:56.810> we

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
these feet going into the base so we

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.730 
these feet going into the base so we
have<00:01:57.079> legs<00:01:57.409> and<00:01:58.069> the<00:01:58.850> space<00:01:59.090> piece<00:02:02.470> can<00:02:03.470> I<00:02:03.560> hide

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
have legs and the space piece can I hide

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.859 
have legs and the space piece can I hide
the<00:02:03.920> bottom<00:02:04.159> of<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.340> space<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.119> base<00:02:05.569> not

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
the bottom of the space and the base not

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.070 
the bottom of the space and the base not
have<00:02:05.960> to<00:02:06.079> click<00:02:06.259> double<00:02:07.450> show<00:02:08.450> that<00:02:08.660> and<00:02:08.929> you

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
have to click double show that and you

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.570 
have to click double show that and you
can<00:02:09.259> see<00:02:09.440> here<00:02:09.709> that<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:10.039> feet<00:02:10.250> are<00:02:10.280> sticking

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
can see here that the feet are sticking

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.160 
can see here that the feet are sticking
through<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:10.879> base<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:13.720> everything's<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.870> okay

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
through the base and everything's a okay

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.229 
through the base and everything's a okay
with<00:02:15.380> that<00:02:15.819> another<00:02:16.819> thing<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.030> wanted<00:02:17.060> to

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
with that another thing I wanted to

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.650 
with that another thing I wanted to
clarify<00:02:17.390> with<00:02:17.900> this<00:02:18.410> base<00:02:18.650> piece<00:02:18.950> is<00:02:19.160> that<00:02:19.370> I

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
clarify with this base piece is that I

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.390 
clarify with this base piece is that I
used<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:21.079> separate<00:02:21.440> polygroup<00:02:21.860> for<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.099> bottom

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
used a separate polygroup for the bottom

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.870 
used a separate polygroup for the bottom
and<00:02:23.360> that<00:02:23.510> was<00:02:23.599> just<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.840> keep<00:02:23.989> it<00:02:24.170> flat<00:02:24.380> so<00:02:24.880> by

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
and that was just to keep it flat so by

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.270 
and that was just to keep it flat so by
that<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:26.090> meant<00:02:26.239> that<00:02:26.540> in<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:27.470> early<00:02:27.799> phases<00:02:28.069> of

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
that I meant that in the early phases of

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.789 
that I meant that in the early phases of
when<00:02:29.269> I<00:02:29.299> was<00:02:29.390> sculpting<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:29.989> base<00:02:30.260> I<00:02:32.140> i<00:02:33.140> took

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
when I was sculpting the base I i took

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.910 
when I was sculpting the base I i took
this<00:02:33.980> bottom<00:02:34.400> plane<00:02:34.700> here<00:02:35.560> made<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:36.680> into<00:02:36.890> a

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
this bottom plane here made it into a

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.589 
this bottom plane here made it into a
separate<00:02:37.250> polygroup<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:37.940> then<00:02:38.030> hit<00:02:38.209> it<00:02:38.239> or<00:02:38.510> I

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
separate polygroup and then hit it or I

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.259 
separate polygroup and then hit it or I
would<00:02:38.810> mask<00:02:39.019> it<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:40.220> that<00:02:40.370> as<00:02:40.489> I<00:02:40.640> was<00:02:40.790> sculpting

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
would mask it so that as I was sculpting

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.000 
would mask it so that as I was sculpting
I<00:02:41.709> wouldn't<00:02:42.709> disturb<00:02:43.010> that<00:02:43.220> flatness<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:45.010> so

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
I wouldn't disturb that flatness and so

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.250 
I wouldn't disturb that flatness and so
obviously<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.700> base<00:02:46.880> has<00:02:47.269> to<00:02:47.510> remain<00:02:47.690> flat<00:02:48.019> so

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
obviously the base has to remain flat so

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.620 
obviously the base has to remain flat so
that<00:02:48.290> when<00:02:48.500> i<00:02:48.530> get<00:02:48.799> it<00:02:48.920> i<00:02:49.040> can<00:02:49.299> put<00:02:50.299> it<00:02:50.389> on<00:02:50.510> my

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
that when i get it i can put it on my

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.789 
that when i get it i can put it on my
shelf<00:02:51.519> okay<00:02:52.519> outside<00:02:53.389> of<00:02:53.420> thin<00:02:53.750> ankles<00:02:53.930> and

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
shelf okay outside of thin ankles and

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.069 
shelf okay outside of thin ankles and
characters<00:02:55.459> that<00:02:55.489> are<00:02:55.700> top-heavy<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.930> want

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
characters that are top-heavy you want

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.210 
characters that are top-heavy you want
to<00:02:57.139> make<00:02:57.200> sure<00:02:57.260> that<00:02:57.410> all<00:02:57.620> your<00:02:57.709> sub<00:02:57.920> souls<00:02:58.130> are

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
to make sure that all your sub souls are

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.470 
to make sure that all your sub souls are
overlapping<00:02:58.549> properly<00:02:59.150> so<00:03:00.940> so<00:03:01.940> zooming<00:03:02.299> in<00:03:02.389> on

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
overlapping properly so so zooming in on

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.720 
overlapping properly so so zooming in on
the<00:03:02.600> mouth<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:03.170> teeth<00:03:03.410> I<00:03:03.799> just<00:03:04.489> want<00:03:04.609> to<00:03:04.670> make

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
the mouth and teeth I just want to make

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.270 
the mouth and teeth I just want to make
sure<00:03:04.790> that<00:03:05.060> this<00:03:05.600> tooth<00:03:06.230> mesh<00:03:06.620> piece<00:03:06.920> is

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
sure that this tooth mesh piece is

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.160 
sure that this tooth mesh piece is
overlapping<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:08.480> inside<00:03:08.930> of<00:03:08.959> his<00:03:09.079> mouth

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
overlapping the inside of his mouth

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.740 
overlapping the inside of his mouth
properly<00:03:09.709> so<00:03:10.400> here<00:03:10.700> you<00:03:11.180> can<00:03:11.209> see<00:03:11.329> the<00:03:11.569> teeth

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
properly so here you can see the teeth

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.979 
properly so here you can see the teeth
pressing<00:03:12.230> through<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.590> bottom<00:03:12.950> of<00:03:13.069> the<00:03:13.190> mouth

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
pressing through the bottom of the mouth

inside of the mouth just going to sort
of<00:03:21.889> gym<00:03:22.069> open<00:03:22.910> my<00:03:23.060> mash<00:03:23.299> and<00:03:23.720> look<00:03:23.840> it<00:03:23.959> over

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
of gym open my mash and look it over

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.809 
of gym open my mash and look it over
everything<00:03:24.650> overlapping<00:03:25.130> so<00:03:25.519> there's<00:03:25.700> the

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
everything overlapping so there's the

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.289 
everything overlapping so there's the
body<00:03:26.030> in<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.389> arm<00:03:27.639> the<00:03:28.639> arm<00:03:28.790> piece<00:03:29.090> is<00:03:29.269> a

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
body in the arm the arm piece is a

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.050 
body in the arm the arm piece is a
closed<00:03:29.660> loop<00:03:30.170> and<00:03:31.069> I<00:03:31.160> see<00:03:31.549> that<00:03:31.670> it's<00:03:31.819> pressing

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
closed loop and I see that it's pressing

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.870 
closed loop and I see that it's pressing
through<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.540> torso<00:03:32.750> completely<00:03:33.790> then<00:03:34.790> we

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
through the torso completely then we

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.370 
through the torso completely then we
have<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.120> torso<00:03:35.480> to<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:35.810> legs<00:03:36.019> and<00:03:38.079> I'm<00:03:39.079> just

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
have the torso to the legs and I'm just

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.280 
have the torso to the legs and I'm just
looking<00:03:39.680> through<00:03:40.389> the<00:03:41.389> mesh<00:03:41.569> itself<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:42.169> main

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
looking through the mesh itself the main

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.500 
looking through the mesh itself the main
idea<00:03:42.440> here<00:03:42.709> is<00:03:42.919> that<00:03:43.040> if<00:03:43.730> you<00:03:43.970> have<00:03:44.120> your<00:03:44.209> hold

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
idea here is that if you have your hold

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.909 
idea here is that if you have your hold
mesh<00:03:44.870> as<00:03:45.230> one<00:03:45.709> piece<00:03:47.230> and<00:03:48.230> you<00:03:48.410> were<00:03:48.500> to<00:03:48.620> drill

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:48.919 
mesh as one piece and you were to drill

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:50.619 
mesh as one piece and you were to drill
a<00:03:48.950> hole<00:03:49.040> in<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.340> top<00:03:49.549> of<00:03:49.760> it<00:03:49.879> and<00:03:50.000> try<00:03:50.329> to<00:03:50.360> fill

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
a hole in the top of it and try to fill

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:51.850 
a hole in the top of it and try to fill
it<00:03:50.720> up<00:03:50.780> with<00:03:50.840> water<00:03:50.959> would<00:03:51.470> it<00:03:51.560> leak<00:03:51.739> out

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
it up with water would it leak out

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.920 
it up with water would it leak out
anywhere<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:52.519> the<00:03:53.150> thing<00:03:53.450> is<00:03:53.510> is<00:03:53.720> that<00:03:53.810> you

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
anywhere and the thing is is that you

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:54.190 
anywhere and the thing is is that you
can

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
can

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.420 
can
have<00:03:54.379> it<00:03:54.530> leaked<00:03:54.709> it<00:03:54.920> has<00:03:55.040> to<00:03:55.190> be<00:03:55.280> completely

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
have it leaked it has to be completely

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.199 
have it leaked it has to be completely
closed<00:03:57.069> so<00:03:58.069> here<00:03:58.250> I'm<00:03:58.340> just<00:03:58.370> going<00:03:58.760> through

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
closed so here I'm just going through

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.550 
closed so here I'm just going through
all<00:03:59.300> the<00:03:59.390> separate<00:03:59.690> pieces<00:03:59.870> and<00:04:00.170> making<00:04:00.410> sure

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
all the separate pieces and making sure

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.869 
all the separate pieces and making sure
that<00:04:00.590> everything<00:04:01.040> is<00:04:01.099> overlapping<00:04:01.519> fully

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
that everything is overlapping fully

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.119 
that everything is overlapping fully
looking<00:04:02.810> at<00:04:02.900> the<00:04:03.019> Little<00:04:03.230> Rock's<00:04:03.470> that<00:04:03.920> I

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129 
looking at the Little Rock's that I

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.580 
looking at the Little Rock's that I
stuck<00:04:04.940> into<00:04:05.090> my<00:04:05.239> base<00:04:05.480> I<00:04:05.840> just<00:04:06.110> put<00:04:06.290> those<00:04:06.410> in

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
stuck into my base I just put those in

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.589 
stuck into my base I just put those in
at<00:04:06.709> the<00:04:06.800> end<00:04:06.890> to<00:04:07.040> kind<00:04:07.310> of<00:04:07.430> spice<00:04:08.090> it<00:04:08.300> up<00:04:08.360> and

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
at the end to kind of spice it up and

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.680 
at the end to kind of spice it up and
make<00:04:08.720> it<00:04:08.750> look<00:04:08.989> a<00:04:09.019> little<00:04:09.260> more<00:04:09.410> interesting

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
make it look a little more interesting

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:17.110 
make it look a little more interesting
and<00:04:11.690> then<00:04:12.410> on<00:04:12.709> to<00:04:14.410> decimating<00:04:15.410> the<00:04:16.340> separate

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
and then on to decimating the separate

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.259 
and then on to decimating the separate
sub<00:04:17.329> tools<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:18.729> what<00:04:19.729> I'm<00:04:19.820> going<00:04:19.940> to<00:04:19.970> do<00:04:20.120> is

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
sub tools and what I'm going to do is

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.879 
sub tools and what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:04:20.419> going<00:04:20.450> to<00:04:20.570> decimate<00:04:20.870> each<00:04:21.560> piece

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
I'm going to decimate each piece

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.010 
I'm going to decimate each piece
individually<00:04:22.130> and<00:04:22.850> then<00:04:22.910> merge<00:04:23.780> them

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
individually and then merge them

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.920 
individually and then merge them
together<00:04:24.139> at<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:24.590> end<00:04:24.620> into<00:04:24.860> one<00:04:25.720> final<00:04:26.720> piece

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
together at the end into one final piece

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.480 
together at the end into one final piece
I<00:04:27.850> do<00:04:28.850> this<00:04:29.120> just<00:04:29.419> because<00:04:29.510> I<00:04:30.280> don't<00:04:31.280> think<00:04:31.340> my

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
I do this just because I don't think my

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.710 
I do this just because I don't think my
computer<00:04:31.970> could<00:04:32.120> handle<00:04:33.580> merging<00:04:34.580> Oh<00:04:34.790> hold<00:04:35.600> on

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
computer could handle merging Oh hold on

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.409 
computer could handle merging Oh hold on
hold<00:04:36.050> on<00:04:36.229> I<00:04:36.729> hear<00:04:37.729> i'm<00:04:37.820> zooming<00:04:38.030> in<00:04:38.240> on<00:04:38.330> the

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
hold on I hear i'm zooming in on the

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.540 
hold on I hear i'm zooming in on the
teeth<00:04:38.630> and<00:04:38.840> i'm<00:04:39.139> just<00:04:39.290> doing<00:04:39.950> this<00:04:40.040> again<00:04:40.370> to

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
teeth and i'm just doing this again to

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.510 
teeth and i'm just doing this again to
show<00:04:42.040> sort<00:04:43.040> of<00:04:43.130> decimating<00:04:44.620> appropriately<00:04:45.620> so

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
show sort of decimating appropriately so

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.640 
show sort of decimating appropriately so
the<00:04:46.970> teeth<00:04:47.180> make<00:04:47.479> up<00:04:47.630> a<00:04:47.720> very<00:04:47.930> small<00:04:48.290> part<00:04:48.590> of

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
the teeth make up a very small part of

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.969 
the teeth make up a very small part of
the<00:04:48.710> mesh<00:04:49.690> it'll<00:04:50.690> make<00:04:50.810> a<00:04:50.840> very<00:04:51.080> small<00:04:51.290> part<00:04:51.860> of

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
the mesh it'll make a very small part of

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:53.290 
the mesh it'll make a very small part of
the<00:04:52.040> print<00:04:52.400> when<00:04:52.700> it's<00:04:52.850> done<00:04:53.000> so<00:04:53.210> i<00:04:53.270> can

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
the print when it's done so i can

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.659 
the print when it's done so i can
decimate<00:04:53.720> those<00:04:53.930> a<00:04:53.990> lot<00:04:54.290> the<00:04:54.919> head<00:04:55.190> the<00:04:55.460> torso

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
decimate those a lot the head the torso

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.730 
decimate those a lot the head the torso
of<00:04:56.000> the<00:04:56.030> legs<00:04:56.300> you<00:04:57.139> know<00:04:57.229> these<00:04:57.380> are<00:04:57.440> bigger

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
of the legs you know these are bigger

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.070 
of the legs you know these are bigger
pieces<00:04:58.010> so<00:04:58.370> i<00:04:58.400> want<00:04:58.639> to<00:04:58.729> decimate<00:04:59.120> them<00:04:59.270> you

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
pieces so i want to decimate them you

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.779 
pieces so i want to decimate them you
know<00:05:00.169> less<00:05:00.440> in<00:05:00.680> comparison<00:05:01.280> because<00:05:01.400> i<00:05:01.580> want

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
know less in comparison because i want

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.020 
know less in comparison because i want
that<00:05:01.910> detail<00:05:02.300> to<00:05:02.479> remain<00:05:03.700> Harry<00:05:04.700> I'm<00:05:04.880> just

that detail to remain Harry I'm just

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.570 
that detail to remain Harry I'm just
open<00:05:05.470> opening<00:05:06.470> the<00:05:06.590> decimation<00:05:06.979> master<00:05:07.430> i'm

open opening the decimation master i'm

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.909 
open opening the decimation master i'm
going<00:05:07.729> to<00:05:07.789> run<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.150> preprocess<00:05:08.750> current<00:05:09.169> mmm

going to run the preprocess current mmm
on<00:05:10.070> the<00:05:10.250> head<00:05:10.780> this<00:05:11.780> is<00:05:11.900> just<00:05:12.050> going<00:05:12.200> to<00:05:12.289> give

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
on the head this is just going to give

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.779 
on the head this is just going to give
me<00:05:12.639> the<00:05:14.289> it's<00:05:15.289> going<00:05:15.440> to<00:05:15.520> create<00:05:16.520> the

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
me the it's going to create the

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:18.310 
me the it's going to create the
different<00:05:17.150> decimation<00:05:17.510> levels<00:05:17.930> that<00:05:18.050> I<00:05:18.110> can

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
different decimation levels that I can

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.930 
different decimation levels that I can
bring<00:05:18.500> it<00:05:18.560> to<00:05:18.800> good<00:05:19.490> thing<00:05:19.639> about<00:05:19.729> the

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
bring it to good thing about the

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.000 
bring it to good thing about the
decimation<00:05:20.360> master<00:05:20.840> is<00:05:20.960> that<00:05:21.169> you<00:05:21.320> can<00:05:21.530> undo

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
decimation master is that you can undo

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.390 
decimation master is that you can undo
your<00:05:23.440> decimation<00:05:24.440> you<00:05:24.800> have<00:05:24.919> to<00:05:25.010> do<00:05:25.100> the<00:05:25.220> pre

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
your decimation you have to do the pre

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.610 
your decimation you have to do the pre
process<00:05:25.820> once<00:05:26.139> which<00:05:27.139> will<00:05:27.289> take<00:05:27.440> a<00:05:27.470> little

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
process once which will take a little

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.900 
process once which will take a little
while<00:05:27.740> and<00:05:28.130> then<00:05:28.220> you<00:05:28.460> can<00:05:28.639> choose<00:05:28.880> the

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
while and then you can choose the

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.890 
while and then you can choose the
appropriate<00:05:29.860> decimation<00:05:30.860> level<00:05:31.280> afterwards

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
appropriate decimation level afterwards

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.330 
appropriate decimation level afterwards
so<00:05:32.900> I'm<00:05:33.080> doing<00:05:33.260> is<00:05:33.530> nice<00:05:33.950> because<00:05:34.160> you<00:05:34.280> can

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
so I'm doing is nice because you can

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.310 
so I'm doing is nice because you can
decimate<00:05:34.940> it<00:05:35.210> you<00:05:35.360> know<00:05:35.450> like<00:05:35.600> fifty<00:05:35.960> percent

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
decimate it you know like fifty percent

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.870 
decimate it you know like fifty percent
and<00:05:36.590> then<00:05:36.680> you<00:05:36.770> say<00:05:36.950> well<00:05:36.979> maybe<00:05:37.280> I<00:05:37.430> have<00:05:37.669> to<00:05:37.760> do

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
and then you say well maybe I have to do

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.420 
and then you say well maybe I have to do
much<00:05:38.060> more<00:05:38.300> than<00:05:38.360> that<00:05:38.630> maybe<00:05:38.900> I<00:05:39.020> want<00:05:39.260> it<00:05:39.430> you

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
much more than that maybe I want it you

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.580 
much more than that maybe I want it you
know<00:05:40.520> two<00:05:40.820> percent<00:05:41.180> of<00:05:41.300> the<00:05:41.419> original<00:05:41.810> or<00:05:41.990> five

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
know two percent of the original or five

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.529 
know two percent of the original or five
percent<00:05:43.010> or<00:05:43.099> whatever<00:05:43.460> so<00:05:44.060> here<00:05:44.210> I'm<00:05:44.330> just

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:44.539 
percent or whatever so here I'm just

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:46.629 
percent or whatever so here I'm just
kind<00:05:45.260> of<00:05:45.349> run<00:05:45.560> through<00:05:45.590> the<00:05:45.919> levels<00:05:46.280> and<00:05:46.550> I'm

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 
kind of run through the levels and I'm

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:48.279 
kind of run through the levels and I'm
clicking<00:05:46.910> the<00:05:47.120> frame<00:05:47.389> button<00:05:47.630> so<00:05:47.870> i<00:05:47.930> can<00:05:48.110> see

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
clicking the frame button so i can see

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:51.370 
clicking the frame button so i can see
that<00:05:48.490> the<00:05:49.490> density<00:05:49.789> of<00:05:50.300> the<00:05:50.419> the<00:05:50.900> decimated

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
that the density of the the decimated

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.150 
that the density of the the decimated
mesh<00:05:51.710> and<00:05:52.280> if<00:05:52.400> the<00:05:52.580> detail<00:05:53.000> is<00:05:54.010> you<00:05:55.010> know

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
mesh and if the detail is you know

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.279 
mesh and if the detail is you know
brought<00:05:56.150> down<00:05:56.330> within<00:05:56.539> reason<00:05:56.930> here's<00:05:57.110> the

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
brought down within reason here's the

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:59.560 
brought down within reason here's the
really<00:05:57.620> triangulated<00:05:58.370> decimated<00:05:59.180> mashed<00:05:59.389> it

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
really triangulated decimated mashed it

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.500 
really triangulated decimated mashed it
turns<00:05:59.750> it<00:05:59.900> into<00:06:00.020> kind<00:06:00.289> of<00:06:00.380> a<00:06:00.470> mess<00:06:01.240> so<00:06:02.240> i'm

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
turns it into kind of a mess so i'm

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.390 
turns it into kind of a mess so i'm
using<00:06:02.960> the<00:06:03.110> move<00:06:03.289> tool<00:06:03.320> he'll<00:06:03.710> just<00:06:03.919> appear<00:06:04.250> to

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
using the move tool he'll just appear to

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.500 
using the move tool he'll just appear to
show<00:06:04.610> that<00:06:04.849> mmm<00:06:05.690> it's

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
show that mmm it's

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.960 
show that mmm it's
the<00:06:07.810> mesh<00:06:07.990> is<00:06:08.200> not<00:06:08.440> exactly<00:06:08.920> workable<00:06:09.430> after

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
the mesh is not exactly workable after

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.950 
the mesh is not exactly workable after
it's<00:06:10.090> been<00:06:10.320> decimated<00:06:12.210> you<00:06:13.210> can<00:06:13.420> you<00:06:13.660> can<00:06:13.780> kind

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
it's been decimated you can you can kind

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.030 
it's been decimated you can you can kind
of<00:06:14.050> moving<00:06:14.200> around<00:06:14.350> a<00:06:14.500> little<00:06:14.590> bit<00:06:14.800> but<00:06:14.980> i

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.040 
of moving around a little bit but i

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.790 
of moving around a little bit but i
think<00:06:15.280> the<00:06:15.400> real<00:06:15.550> idea<00:06:15.880> is<00:06:16.090> that<00:06:16.120> you<00:06:16.680> run<00:06:17.680> the

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
think the real idea is that you run the

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.230 
think the real idea is that you run the
decimation<00:06:18.220> master<00:06:18.670> and<00:06:18.760> you<00:06:18.820> kind<00:06:19.000> of<00:06:19.090> leave

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
decimation master and you kind of leave

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.820 
decimation master and you kind of leave
it<00:06:19.360> at<00:06:19.450> that<00:06:19.480> you<00:06:19.750> don't<00:06:19.900> want<00:06:20.170> to<00:06:20.260> play<00:06:20.650> with

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
it at that you don't want to play with

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.770 
it at that you don't want to play with
it<00:06:21.010> after<00:06:21.550> you've<00:06:21.670> done<00:06:21.910> that<00:06:21.970> it's<00:06:22.360> the<00:06:22.600> mesh

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
it after you've done that it's the mesh

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.050 
it after you've done that it's the mesh
is<00:06:22.930> just<00:06:23.140> so<00:06:23.320> weird<00:06:23.590> that<00:06:23.860> it's<00:06:24.550> not<00:06:24.730> a<00:06:24.790> good

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
is just so weird that it's not a good

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:31.800 
is just so weird that it's not a good
idea<00:06:29.910> without<00:06:30.910> getting<00:06:31.300> into<00:06:31.420> every<00:06:31.630> little

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
idea without getting into every little

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.450 
idea without getting into every little
piece<00:06:31.960> here<00:06:32.020> I've<00:06:32.380> decimated<00:06:33.100> each<00:06:33.220> piece

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
piece here I've decimated each piece

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.860 
piece here I've decimated each piece
separately<00:06:33.790> then<00:06:34.180> I've<00:06:34.270> merge<00:06:34.540> them<00:06:34.750> together

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
separately then I've merge them together

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.470 
separately then I've merge them together
and<00:06:35.380> I'm<00:06:35.530> just<00:06:35.710> kind<00:06:35.860> of<00:06:35.950> giving<00:06:36.130> my<00:06:37.030> character

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.480 
and I'm just kind of giving my character

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.860 
and I'm just kind of giving my character
a<00:06:37.510> final<00:06:38.160> once-over<00:06:39.160> it's<00:06:39.970> just<00:06:40.240> making<00:06:40.720> sure

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
a final once-over it's just making sure

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.320 
a final once-over it's just making sure
it's<00:06:41.080> ready<00:06:41.170> to<00:06:41.350> print<00:06:41.790> so<00:06:42.790> here's<00:06:42.940> ooh<00:06:43.090> minute

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
it's ready to print so here's ooh minute

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.610 
it's ready to print so here's ooh minute
on<00:06:43.420> the<00:06:43.510> arm<00:06:43.690> a<00:06:43.840> little<00:06:43.960> bit<00:06:44.140> you<00:06:44.290> can<00:06:44.380> see<00:06:44.530> the

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
on the arm a little bit you can see the

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.470 
on the arm a little bit you can see the
details<00:06:44.980> kind<00:06:45.250> of<00:06:45.310> chunky<00:06:45.520> compared<00:06:46.240> to<00:06:46.330> what

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:46.480 
details kind of chunky compared to what

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.740 
details kind of chunky compared to what
we<00:06:46.570> had<00:06:46.750> there<00:06:46.960> but<00:06:47.200> it's<00:06:47.350> plenty<00:06:47.770> for<00:06:48.750> what

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 
we had there but it's plenty for what

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.960 
we had there but it's plenty for what
you<00:06:49.930> want<00:06:50.110> to<00:06:50.320> print<00:06:50.560> you<00:06:51.400> just<00:06:51.580> have<00:06:51.700> to<00:06:51.730> keep

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:51.970 
you want to print you just have to keep

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.220 
you want to print you just have to keep
thinking<00:06:52.210> with<00:06:52.390> the<00:06:52.510> scale<00:06:52.810> of<00:06:52.840> the<00:06:53.020> piece

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:53.230 
thinking with the scale of the piece

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.280 
thinking with the scale of the piece
here<00:06:53.710> is<00:06:54.040> the<00:06:54.190> neck<00:06:54.400> detail<00:06:54.790> a<00:06:55.270> backplate<00:06:56.170> in

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:56.290 
here is the neck detail a backplate in

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.660 
here is the neck detail a backplate in
the<00:06:56.350> front<00:06:56.590> plate<00:06:56.770> you<00:06:56.980> can<00:06:57.070> see<00:06:57.190> the<00:06:57.310> muscles

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:57.670 
the front plate you can see the muscles

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.790 
the front plate you can see the muscles
going<00:06:57.970> under<00:06:58.180> that<00:06:58.330> Center<00:06:58.720> plate<00:06:59.530> that

00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800 
going under that Center plate that

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.510 
going under that Center plate that
detail<00:07:00.130> worked<00:07:00.340> out<00:07:01.440> so<00:07:02.440> I<00:07:02.470> just<00:07:02.770> like<00:07:03.340> where

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 
detail worked out so I just like where

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.240 
detail worked out so I just like where
it's<00:07:03.640> at<00:07:03.760> and<00:07:03.790> it's<00:07:04.120> ready<00:07:04.300> to<00:07:04.420> print<00:07:05.250> so

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:06.250 
it's at and it's ready to print so

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.520 
it's at and it's ready to print so
that'll<00:07:06.550> be<00:07:06.640> the<00:07:06.760> end<00:07:06.790> of<00:07:06.910> this<00:07:07.030> chapter<00:07:07.530> next
