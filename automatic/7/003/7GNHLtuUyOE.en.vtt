 and they were born by chance seismic help and crazy is a warrock with the mythical 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.790
 This farkie causes them to move around

 so special q7 off to pump so much 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.390
 live everything you need 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.310
 immediately remember that the point of view is smoke on the water 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.210
 it has the most difficult parts of the bass, its nice text-making step 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.730
 prof 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:53.950

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.850
 the keyboard 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.250
 and this is why there is a way a cartoon passage I really have to copy 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.109
 the guitar 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:20.740
 those two sounds one above the plateau 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.360

 the step towards the continuous unlucky suicide of 1500 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.140
 that is if something 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.449
