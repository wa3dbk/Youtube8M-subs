00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.869
 hello everybody here is the fall of canada by 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.240
 Brazilians and in this video of today in 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.790
 The continuation is serious in 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.349
 different months different months but 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.539
 a continuation of a video I already 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.869
 I had already made about the the bridge 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.820
 the world's broadest that it stays is that 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.340
 just before that point on the road 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.260
 what we are doing now 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.400
 that day was passing the program on 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.620
 other videos 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.840
 so if you want to see it and the sequence that 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.700
 comes before him has a video that is the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.550
 bridge over the longest bridge in the 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.430
 world is just looking at the channel is that you 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.160
 it can be seen there that who before being 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.350
 of this route and the kibon has or had to 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.940
 to practice ok is here in the interior of 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.480
 Colombia's balance is 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.239
 about an hour and a half is the 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.600
 center of contest 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.390
 approximately 50 minutes to one hour is 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.840
 where I live I can conclude the idea and 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:17.640
 decided to make up some of the videos there is 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:21.030
 For you and the good I'm doing this. 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.880
 video for three reasons, the first of them 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.340
 Do you like watching the videos here? 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.800
 Vancouver and the region and has the 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.190
 most people here with us 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.920
 follow our work blog youtube the 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.080
 facebook is the majority of people have the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.530
 intention to migrate to travel or to 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.720
 exchange here for here beach club more 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.700
 specifically with curve then the 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.500
 The first reason is logical that you 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.599
 want to see more is there about the area and 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.970
 The second reason is that I just 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:55.349
 I got home from Japan and stayed there 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.780
 a little more than a month 

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:59.459
 and really gave to rest was guess 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.729
 that the first phase in the vacations that I 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:04.679
 took years I am that I did not really 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.629
 nothing, I did not work, I did nothing then 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.410
 It gave you enough rest. 

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:12.400
 I just arrived these days 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:16.060

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.520
