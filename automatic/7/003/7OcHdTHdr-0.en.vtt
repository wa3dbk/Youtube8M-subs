00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:20.750

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.460
 select the profit option 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.200
 we have to keep 50 activities 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.180
 let's program part number 1 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.180
 here we are going to put the amount of round 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.180
 10 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.090
 in this option the minutes 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.950
 for 20 minutes 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.730
 until the seconds 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.730
 30 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.280
 here we are going to program it can 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.680
 program it up or 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.250
 descending in this case let's do it 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.829
 descending are 2 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.690
 Here we are the rest option 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:10.030
 Lets put 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.030
 0 minutes and 10 seconds 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:21.399
 and we record we go out and go to menu 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.399
 let's select option number 1 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.280
 we will be a number one 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.820
 when 10 seconds are missing, the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.820
 Bell 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.200
 ah 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:59.229
 and there they mark the end of the round 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.229
 now we are at rest 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.840
 and we started the second round 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.810
 good if we want to leave our 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.599
 configuration 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.599
 we give escape and we go back to the time
