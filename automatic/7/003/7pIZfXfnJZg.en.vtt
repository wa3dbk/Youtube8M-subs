00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:06.490
 hello biker community friends today 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.590
 circumstances of life or not apply 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.080
 how to remove a radio or match a 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.850
 bicycle for those who do not know us 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.469
 go to put anywhere or anything 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.400
 here we can see that it is a question 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.630
 radio has parted to the bottom 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.449
 according to the breasts parting from the door of 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.890
 above we will explain how it is done 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.189
 so for this we will need a 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.410
 radio key and we can see the 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.410
 numbering we observe we turn around 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.920
 more or less it's about the key 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.060
 number 13 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.249
 we put the key in the radio 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.249
 [Applause] 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:49.430
 once placed we will take it and 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.660
 we will rotate the radio we will double it 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:56.070
 once we have the shape of l 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.070
 we will go around 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.910
 and see how little is going to 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.989
 little radio 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.989
 of your being 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.040
 and back from schumacher as 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.630
 and then that part 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.070
 I'm here 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.800
 then this will not be removed anymore and this 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.750
 he will take it out of our mechanic because 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.480
 as this leads the rim carries a 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.860
 protective cover this will be there giving 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.880
 Maybe you heard noises 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.350
 rare of those things and even there stays 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.660
 but we do not talk about that fat radio 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.270
 has done because it gets on the disk or 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.979
 reduce the radius we will proceed to put it 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.210
 inside the backpack in this case we're going 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.210
 before his owner that the camera 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.730
 since I'm doubling the 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.430
 and the key to the operator's backpack that 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.430
 It's me
