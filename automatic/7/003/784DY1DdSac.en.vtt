about how to do hang wheels men
basically<00:00:37.080> this<00:00:37.200> trick<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.440> very<00:00:37.860> similar<00:00:38.190> to

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
basically this trick is very similar to

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.340 
basically this trick is very similar to
a<00:00:38.610> regular<00:00:39.090> manual<00:00:39.270> except<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.110> instead<00:00:40.230> of

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
a regular manual except that instead of

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.900 
a regular manual except that instead of
having<00:00:40.560> one<00:00:40.740> foot<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.250> front<00:00:41.490> plate<00:00:41.700> and

having one foot on the front plate and

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.580 
having one foot on the front plate and
once<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.210> on<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.390> back<00:00:42.540> plate<00:00:42.810> both<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.500> your

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
once it on the back plate both of your

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.690 
once it on the back plate both of your
feet<00:00:43.710> are<00:00:43.860> going<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.040> be<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.280> back<00:00:44.460> plane

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
feet are going to be on the back plane

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.640 
feet are going to be on the back plane
you<00:00:44.970> can<00:00:45.090> do<00:00:45.180> all<00:00:45.210> you're<00:00:45.390> balancing<00:00:46.050> both

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
you can do all you're balancing both

flat ground go feed on the back plate
pretty<00:01:12.430> easy<00:01:12.670> but<00:01:13.030> if<00:01:13.360> you<00:01:13.479> don't<00:01:13.630> have<00:01:13.750> either

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
pretty easy but if you don't have either

pretty easy but if you don't have either
one<00:01:14.049> of<00:01:14.170> those<00:01:14.290> two<00:01:14.350> tricks<00:01:14.860> mastered<00:01:15.369> I

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
one of those two tricks mastered I

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.460 
one of those two tricks mastered I
wouldn't<00:01:15.909> move<00:01:16.180> on<00:01:16.330> and<00:01:16.479> trying<00:01:16.659> this<00:01:16.869> white

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
wouldn't move on and trying this white

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.560 
wouldn't move on and trying this white
man<00:01:17.500> okay<00:01:18.250> so<00:01:18.310> once<00:01:18.610> you've<00:01:18.700> got<00:01:18.850> manuals<00:01:19.299> and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
man okay so once you've got manuals and

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.270 
man okay so once you've got manuals and

master<00:01:21.700> you're<00:01:22.149> ready<00:01:22.360> to<00:01:22.509> begin<00:01:22.690> trying

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
master you're ready to begin trying

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.770 
master you're ready to begin trying
deals<00:01:23.800> manual<00:01:24.160> now<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.060> hardest<00:01:25.450> part<00:01:25.630> of<00:01:25.720> the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
deals manual now the hardest part of the

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.420 
deals manual now the hardest part of the
trick<00:01:26.470> is<00:01:26.620> really<00:01:26.890> actually<00:01:27.040> just<00:01:27.340> the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
trick is really actually just the

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.770 
trick is really actually just the
beginning<00:01:27.820> which<00:01:27.970> is<00:01:28.090> getting<00:01:28.270> into<00:01:28.660> it

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
beginning which is getting into it

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.630 
beginning which is getting into it
getting<00:01:29.290> that<00:01:29.320> front<00:01:29.710> foot<00:01:29.770> back<00:01:30.190> here<00:01:30.460> is

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
getting that front foot back here is

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.360 
getting that front foot back here is
tricky<00:01:31.090> but<00:01:31.780> if<00:01:32.050> you<00:01:32.470> know<00:01:33.160> the<00:01:33.280> little

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
tricky but if you know the little

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.860 
tricky but if you know the little
secrets<00:01:33.880> you<00:01:34.060> can<00:01:34.180> actually<00:01:34.420> work<00:01:34.570> your<00:01:34.750> way

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
secrets you can actually work your way

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.380 
secrets you can actually work your way
into<00:01:35.020> it<00:01:35.140> not<00:01:35.380> have<00:01:35.560> to<00:01:35.680> just<00:01:35.890> take<00:01:36.340> a<00:01:36.400> leap<00:01:36.700> so

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
into it not have to just take a leap so

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.270 
into it not have to just take a leap so
there's<00:01:38.380> two<00:01:38.530> different<00:01:38.680> ways<00:01:38.800> to<00:01:38.890> get<00:01:39.070> into

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
there's two different ways to get into

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.700 
there's two different ways to get into
it<00:01:39.400> first<00:01:39.970> one<00:01:40.210> which<00:01:40.330> is<00:01:40.360> a<00:01:40.480> lot<00:01:40.600> easier<00:01:40.750> is<00:01:41.140> to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
it first one which is a lot easier is to

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.800 
it first one which is a lot easier is to
get<00:01:42.010> riding<00:01:42.220> at<00:01:42.460> your<00:01:42.580> speed<00:01:42.820> up<00:01:42.850> and<00:01:43.120> then<00:01:43.570> hop

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
normal manual now that's that's the

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.500 
normal manual now that's that's the
easier<00:01:54.610> way<00:01:54.730> and<00:01:54.850> that's<00:01:54.970> a<00:01:55.000> good<00:01:55.120> way<00:01:55.300> to<00:01:55.330> get

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
easier way and that's a good way to get

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.810 
easier way and that's a good way to get
started<00:01:55.570> learning<00:01:56.110> this<00:01:56.320> trick<00:01:56.470> but<00:01:57.100> if

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
started learning this trick but if

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.450 
started learning this trick but if
you're<00:01:58.000> a<00:01:58.030> G<00:01:58.360> and<00:01:59.050> you<00:01:59.140> want<00:01:59.320> to<00:01:59.470> get<00:02:00.220> some<00:02:00.340> good

you're a G and you want to get some good
footage<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:01.210> best<00:02:01.420> way<00:02:01.570> to<00:02:01.630> do<00:02:01.810> it<00:02:01.930> is<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.440> be

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
footage the best way to do it is to be

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.080 
footage the best way to do it is to be
rolling<00:02:02.979> and<00:02:03.160> just<00:02:03.550> take<00:02:03.670> that<00:02:03.760> front<00:02:04.030> foot

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090

rolling and just take that front foot
off<00:02:04.500> jump<00:02:05.500> all<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.770> way<00:02:05.890> back<00:02:06.130> in<00:02:06.369> one<00:02:06.520> shot

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
off jump all the way back in one shot

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.240 
off jump all the way back in one shot
