00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.310
 they can play troops, I don't like to play 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.680
 with the british fast and river but me 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.750

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.030
 not much but a thief and must die 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.170

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.150
 could lift but my team fought more 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.590
 my not by what he on top 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.420
 state 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.090
 I understand then my team has me 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.260
 by being his better question you can 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.910
 fine tune 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.430
 I don't know but he's already a boy 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.400
 split split apart 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.190
 oh my god and i also do myself and i optima 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.530
 You always bring those things all that on one 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.420
 somehow to throw it on me 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.340
 there is such a bait for that 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.930
 talk wrong if you know think so 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.220
 everyone thinks if I feel like that too 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.780
 They play all those things upside down 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.780
 I think yes too 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.220
 why i think both being because there 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.840
 so much pleasant will be invoked 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.610
 that's always when there are five 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.810
 invoked or so they usually only have 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.520
 because one becomes in groups and that 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.540
 do you always think if you are the one 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.050
 the death goes on 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.710
 it is not that you do remember 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.710
 that's why 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.360
 these guys didn't put a nice bow 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.360
