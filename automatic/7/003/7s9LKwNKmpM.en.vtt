and use those for some dots too and I'm
truly<00:03:51.190> experimenting<00:03:52.150> on<00:03:52.330> this<00:03:52.540> right<00:03:52.720> now<00:03:52.840> I

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
truly experimenting on this right now I

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.700 
truly experimenting on this right now I
didn't<00:03:53.320> create<00:03:53.560> a<00:03:53.620> sample<00:03:54.130> ahead<00:03:54.370> of<00:03:54.490> time<00:03:54.700> so

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
didn't create a sample ahead of time so

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.370 
didn't create a sample ahead of time so
I'm<00:03:56.710> sort<00:03:56.980> of<00:03:57.300> your<00:03:58.300> walking<00:03:58.750> along<00:03:59.020> the<00:03:59.230> road

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
I'm sort of your walking along the road

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.550 
I'm sort of your walking along the road
with<00:03:59.680> me<00:03:59.860> here<00:04:00.150> I'm<00:04:01.150> going<00:04:01.450> to<00:04:01.570> try<00:04:02.050> and<00:04:02.080> do<00:04:02.440> the

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
with me here I'm going to try and do the

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.970 
with me here I'm going to try and do the
dots<00:04:02.800> in<00:04:03.100> between<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:04.390> red<00:04:04.630> and<00:04:04.830> you<00:04:05.830> can

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
dots in between the red and you can

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.920 
dots in between the red and you can
decide<00:04:06.280> whether<00:04:06.580> you<00:04:06.760> like<00:04:06.970> liked<00:04:07.600> it<00:04:07.780> better

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
decide whether you like liked it better

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.310 
decide whether you like liked it better
with<00:04:08.230> dots<00:04:08.530> without<00:04:09.040> dots<00:04:09.630> with<00:04:10.630> both<00:04:10.870> colored

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
with dots without dots with both colored

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:20.699 
with dots without dots with both colored
dots<00:04:15.600> and<00:04:16.600> then<00:04:17.470> instead<00:04:17.830> of<00:04:17.890> going<00:04:18.040> up<00:04:19.709> with

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
dots and then instead of going up with

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.710 
dots and then instead of going up with
the<00:04:20.860> white<00:04:21.040> dots<00:04:21.310> in<00:04:21.610> between<00:04:21.640> I'm<00:04:22.450> going<00:04:22.660> to

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
the white dots in between I'm going to

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.400 
the white dots in between I'm going to
actually<00:04:22.870> just<00:04:23.200> create<00:04:23.590> a<00:04:23.860> line<00:04:24.810> of<00:04:25.810> dots<00:04:26.080> to

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
actually just create a line of dots to

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.920 
actually just create a line of dots to
go<00:04:26.530> right<00:04:26.800> next<00:04:27.100> to<00:04:27.220> it<00:04:27.660> that<00:04:28.660> one<00:04:28.780> got<00:04:28.870> a

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
go right next to it that one got a

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.540 
go right next to it that one got a
little<00:04:29.110> large<00:04:30.510> okay<00:04:31.510> I<00:04:32.160> think<00:04:33.160> that<00:04:33.340> one's

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
little large okay I think that one's

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.440 
little large okay I think that one's
kind<00:04:33.760> of<00:04:33.850> fun<00:04:34.030> actually<00:04:35.670> so<00:04:36.670> it<00:04:36.790> makes<00:04:36.970> a<00:04:37.150> neat

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
kind of fun actually so it makes a neat

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.510 
kind of fun actually so it makes a neat
little<00:04:37.690> peppermint<00:04:38.200> swirl<00:04:40.920> so<00:04:41.920> then<00:04:42.280> what<00:04:42.430> I'm

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
little peppermint swirl so then what I'm

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.120 
little peppermint swirl so then what I'm
going<00:04:42.640> to<00:04:42.700> do<00:04:42.880> let<00:04:43.510> that<00:04:43.540> dry<00:04:44.050> for<00:04:44.080> just<00:04:44.740> a

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
going to do let that dry for just a

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.040 
going to do let that dry for just a
minute<00:04:46.470> okay<00:04:47.470> so<00:04:47.890> here<00:04:48.280> it<00:04:48.460> is<00:04:48.640> I<00:04:49.270> put<00:04:49.810> one

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
minute okay so here it is I put one
