cross and then start twisting here and

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.630 
cross and then start twisting here and
like<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.090> said<00:01:27.270> um<00:01:28.009> you<00:01:29.009> all<00:01:29.130> have<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.430> do<00:01:29.549> your

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
like I said um you all have to do your

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.100 
like I said um you all have to do your
twist<00:01:29.939> those<00:01:30.090> big<00:01:32.000> for<00:01:33.000> me<00:01:33.180> some<00:01:33.810> Thai<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.079> a

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
twist those big for me some Thai have a

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.350 
twist those big for me some Thai have a
lot<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.320> hair<00:01:34.740> my<00:01:35.520> hair<00:01:35.549> stick<00:01:36.200> long<00:01:37.200> um<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:38.360> had

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
lot of hair my hair stick long um I had

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.899 
lot of hair my hair stick long um I had
to<00:01:39.570> do<00:01:39.689> my<00:01:39.840> twist<00:01:40.140> bigger<00:01:40.920> because<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.729> just

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
to do my twist bigger because it's just

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.590 
to do my twist bigger because it's just
easier<00:01:42.270> for<00:01:42.299> me<00:01:42.509> if<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.500> have<00:01:43.680> shorter<00:01:44.159> hair

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
easier for me if you have shorter hair

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.080 
easier for me if you have shorter hair
maybe<00:01:45.600> it's<00:01:45.840> easier<00:01:45.990> for<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.560> do<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
maybe it's easier for you to do the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:55.819 
maybe it's easier for you to do the
small<00:01:48.090> twist<00:01:48.950> so<00:01:52.100> you<00:01:53.100> can<00:01:53.310> do<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:55.530> then

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
small twist so you can do that and then

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.749 
small twist so you can do that and then
I<00:01:55.950> just<00:01:56.189> keep<00:01:56.430> going<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.969> end<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:58.399> then<00:01:59.399> I

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
I just keep going to the end and then I

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.859 
I just keep going to the end and then I
kind<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.740> twist<00:02:01.740> like<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:03.149> for<00:02:03.600> leakage

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
kind of twist like that and for leakage
