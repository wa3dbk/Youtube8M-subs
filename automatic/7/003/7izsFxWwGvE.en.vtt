 unlimited main components of the oslo 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.950
 has in three sets are the ring and the 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.200
 base station on the base station finds 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.399
 her two regulators dork and smith with those 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.300
 you can fine tune the ring more exactly 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.710
 Also here is one 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.360
 Calibration button with the the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.250
 Adjustment of the ring calibrated 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.110
 can be 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.670
 the status led shows you if the ring 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.590
 correctly coupled or not 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.920
 On the connection side we find here a 3 5 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.600
 mm and 1 63 millimeter plug the 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.290
 smaller is used for source audio effects 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.140
 the larger one is also needed for fag 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.369
 Devices from other manufacturers suitable for 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.470
 I play the following tips 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.299
 beautiful woman sak 1974 it goes this 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.770
 in each EffektgerÃ¤te I with 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.259
 the skin in three of source audio 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.619
 steurer and then into a lousy boogie 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.439
 mark 5 combo is taken off the whole 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.820
 quite classic with a shoe asm 58 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.860
 micro directly into the camera 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.350
 For the following example I play 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.689
 a source audio sound loks classic 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.409
 historical and steer the drive with 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.409
 the hand 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.960
 mini 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.250
 I am 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.360
 the hotten 3 works with both 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.550
 Effects at first on audio as well 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.040
 with other manufacturers 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.660
 the only requirement is an expression 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.310
 pedal input then with the 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.310
 base station is connected 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.640
 clouds 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:01.489
 then source audio effects can be 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.500
 thanks to the multi-function and output 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.659
 pair with each other so that with the hot 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.400
 and here several source or defective 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.670
 the avenue can be controlled simultaneously 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.670
 can 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.060
 oho 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.380
 O 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.769
 The hot and ring can be applied to the whole 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.629
 customize your own needs 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.659
 either one manages to infect with the 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:06.659
 x-axis with the y axis or with the 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:08.489
 Z axis integrates a lithium 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:10.859
 ion battery located within 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.780
 about 90 minutes is fully charged 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:15.590
 and up to six hours of gameplay 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.590
 guaranteed 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.070
 with the hot n 3, source audio has one 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.290
 important step in the future of 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.240
 effect pedals made musician can 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.130
 their sounds are only more creative 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.790
 and more impressive in her game 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.340
 bring 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.960
 the hot n 3 works with a sound 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.420
 blogs sound blocks 2 and sound blocks 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.240
 per pedals of source audio together 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.070
 the clou, however, is that with the place 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.170
 end effect devices of other manufacturers 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.090
 only one can be controlled 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:22.470
 requirement is an expression pedal 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:25.700
 input on the device so off in the store 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.700
 and check it out
