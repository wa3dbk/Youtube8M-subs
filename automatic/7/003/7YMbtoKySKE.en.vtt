00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.710 
right looks like thought is under a lot
of<00:02:36.800> pressure<00:02:39.550> you<00:02:40.550> can't<00:02:40.850> use<00:02:41.150> part<00:02:41.570> of<00:02:41.660> the

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
of pressure you can't use part of the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.340 
of pressure you can't use part of the
horde<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.440> ice<00:02:42.920> block<00:02:43.370> unfortunately<00:02:44.180> so<00:02:44.480> he

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
horde and ice block unfortunately so he

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.070 
horde and ice block unfortunately so he
needs<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.709> UM<00:02:45.920> find<00:02:46.850> some<00:02:47.060> other<00:02:47.180> creative<00:02:47.900> way

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080

to<00:02:48.110> stay<00:02:48.410> alive<00:02:48.530> I<00:02:49.270> think<00:02:50.270> the<00:02:50.360> only<00:02:50.390> way

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
to stay alive I think the only way

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.590 
to stay alive I think the only way
really<00:02:51.020> is<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.470> call<00:02:52.310> at<00:02:52.490> Oracle<00:02:52.880> into<00:02:53.180> a<00:02:53.209> frost

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
really is to call at Oracle into a frost

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.199 
really is to call at Oracle into a frost
