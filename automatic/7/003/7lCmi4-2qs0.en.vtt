video we're going to start with a bead
on<00:00:25.689> the<00:00:25.930> head<00:00:25.960> pin<00:00:26.700> and<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.779> way<00:00:28.960> we<00:00:29.140> make<00:00:29.320> our

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
on the head pin and the way we make our

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.060 
on the head pin and the way we make our
wrap<00:00:29.740> loop<00:00:30.099> is<00:00:30.869> we're<00:00:31.869> gonna<00:00:31.990> grip<00:00:32.379> the<00:00:32.860> bead

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070

bent chain nose pliers gonna bend the
wire<00:00:38.559> over<00:00:38.949> 90<00:00:39.640> degrees<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.660> now<00:00:46.870> that<00:00:47.080> we

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
wire over 90 degrees and now that we

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.770 
wire over 90 degrees and now that we
have<00:00:47.379> the<00:00:47.680> wire<00:00:47.860> bent<00:00:48.159> 90<00:00:48.370> degrees<00:00:48.780> we're

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
have the wire bent 90 degrees we're

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.149 
have the wire bent 90 degrees we're
going<00:00:49.900> to<00:00:49.960> use<00:00:50.110> our<00:00:50.290> round<00:00:50.530> nose<00:00:50.650> pliers<00:00:51.040> to

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159

going to use our round nose pliers to
make<00:00:51.339> a<00:00:51.489> loop<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:54.460> I<00:00:54.790> want<00:00:55.600> to<00:00:55.690> grip<00:00:55.900> the<00:00:56.080> wire

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
make a loop and I want to grip the wire

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.100 
make a loop and I want to grip the wire
on<00:00:56.620> the<00:00:57.210> horizontal<00:00:58.210> segment<00:00:58.629> here<00:00:58.780> with<00:00:58.930> my

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
round nose pliers but as close to the

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:03.000 
round nose pliers but as close to the
bend<00:01:01.119> as<00:01:01.299> possible<00:01:01.900> and<00:01:02.229> now<00:01:02.530> I'm<00:01:02.680> just<00:01:02.890> gonna

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
bend as possible and now I'm just gonna

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.140 
bend as possible and now I'm just gonna
push<00:01:03.309> the<00:01:03.460> wire<00:01:03.640> up<00:01:03.940> and<00:01:04.119> over<00:01:04.770> and<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.909> order

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
push the wire up and over and in order

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.060 
push the wire up and over and in order
to<00:01:07.270> complete<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:07.900> loop<00:01:08.080> I<00:01:08.290> have<00:01:08.350> to<00:01:08.650> reorient

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
to complete the loop I have to reorient

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.170 
to complete the loop I have to reorient
the<00:01:10.060> wire<00:01:10.330> on<00:01:10.659> my<00:01:10.990> pliers<00:01:11.290> and<00:01:11.799> then<00:01:12.610> I<00:01:12.700> push<00:01:12.970> it

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
the wire on my pliers and then I push it

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.789 
the wire on my pliers and then I push it
the<00:01:13.299> rest<00:01:13.510> of<00:01:13.689> the<00:01:13.750> way<00:01:13.869> around<00:01:14.229> to<00:01:14.380> complete

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
the rest of the way around to complete

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.190 
the rest of the way around to complete
the<00:01:14.979> loop<00:01:15.189> and<00:01:15.909> while<00:01:16.420> I<00:01:16.450> have<00:01:16.689> the<00:01:16.840> loop<00:01:17.049> in

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
the loop and while I have the loop in

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.050 
the loop and while I have the loop in
this<00:01:17.320> position<00:01:17.860> what<00:01:18.430> I<00:01:18.460> want<00:01:18.729> to<00:01:18.820> do<00:01:18.909> is

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
this position what I want to do is

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.350 
this position what I want to do is
adjust<00:01:19.180> it<00:01:19.630> so<00:01:20.350> that<00:01:20.380> the<00:01:20.860> loop<00:01:21.070> is<00:01:21.360> centered

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
adjust it so that the loop is centered

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.770 
adjust it so that the loop is centered
over<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:23.470> wire<00:01:23.770> through<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.190> bead<00:01:24.520> and<00:01:24.910> so

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
over the wire through the bead and so

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.940 
over the wire through the bead and so
now<00:01:26.020> I<00:01:26.320> have<00:01:26.410> that<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:29.200> can<00:01:29.350> see<00:01:29.560> I<00:01:29.590> have<00:01:29.920> a

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
now I have that you can see I have a

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.370 
now I have that you can see I have a
loop<00:01:30.220> and<00:01:30.430> the<00:01:30.550> loop<00:01:30.580> is<00:01:30.850> centered<00:01:31.240> and<00:01:31.420> now

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
loop and the loop is centered and now

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:41.210 
loop and the loop is centered and now
I'm<00:01:32.620> going<00:01:32.860> to<00:01:32.980> just<00:01:33.160> add<00:01:33.430> an<00:01:33.640> ear<00:01:33.940> wire<00:01:34.180> and

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.750 

got<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:42.340> ear<00:01:42.550> wire<00:01:42.730> connected<00:01:43.360> and<00:01:44.640> now<00:01:45.640> I'm

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
got the ear wire connected and now I'm

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.690 
got the ear wire connected and now I'm
going<00:01:45.909> to<00:01:46.000> use<00:01:46.240> my<00:01:46.510> chain<00:01:46.810> nose<00:01:46.840> pliers<00:01:47.700> to

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
going to use my chain nose pliers to

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.670 
going to use my chain nose pliers to
grab<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.270> loop<00:01:49.480> that<00:01:49.720> we<00:01:49.900> made<00:01:50.140> it<00:01:50.260> and<00:01:50.470> hold

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680

it<00:01:50.860> while<00:01:51.040> I<00:01:51.070> wrap<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:51.610> wire<00:01:53.040> now<00:01:54.040> I'm<00:01:54.159> going

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
it while I wrap the wire now I'm going

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.710 
it while I wrap the wire now I'm going
to<00:01:54.370> grab<00:01:54.550> the<00:01:54.730> loop<00:01:54.909> with<00:01:55.060> my<00:01:55.090> chain<00:01:55.480> nose

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
to grab the loop with my chain nose

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.100 
to grab the loop with my chain nose
pliers<00:01:55.960> like<00:01:56.230> that<00:01:56.530> I<00:01:56.800> want<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.370> switch<00:01:58.110> my

around<00:02:06.100> and<00:02:06.729> wrap<00:02:07.000> it<00:02:07.180> around<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:08.110> I<00:02:08.319> want<00:02:08.500> to

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
around and wrap it around and I want to

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.100 
around and wrap it around and I want to
make<00:02:08.739> sure<00:02:08.920> that<00:02:09.069> I<00:02:09.129> keep<00:02:09.399> this<00:02:09.700> wire

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
make sure that I keep this wire

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.539 
make sure that I keep this wire
perpendicular<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:11.140> this<00:02:11.500> winner<00:02:11.799> as<00:02:12.099> I<00:02:12.280> wrap

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
perpendicular to this winner as I wrap

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.759 
perpendicular to this winner as I wrap
and<00:02:12.909> that<00:02:13.360> helps<00:02:13.840> me<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:14.019> keep<00:02:14.290> my<00:02:14.470> back

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
and that helps me to keep my back

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.520 
and that helps me to keep my back
straight<00:02:14.799> and<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:16.390> keeps<00:02:16.629> the<00:02:16.870> spacing<00:02:17.319> nice

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
straight and it keeps the spacing nice

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.740 
straight and it keeps the spacing nice
and<00:02:17.799> tight<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:21.220> I<00:02:21.970> just<00:02:22.269> want<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.540> wrap<00:02:22.720> it

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
and tight and I just want to wrap it

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.530 
and tight and I just want to wrap it
around

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
around

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.500 
around
a<00:02:24.599> couple<00:02:25.469> times<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:28.560> so<00:02:29.129> now<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:30.060> rap<00:02:30.269> is

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
a couple times and so now the rap is

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.339 
a couple times and so now the rap is
completed<00:02:32.060> but<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.090> have<00:02:33.299> that<00:02:33.629> extra<00:02:34.079> piece<00:02:34.319> of

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
completed but I have that extra piece of

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.589 
completed but I have that extra piece of
wire<00:02:34.680> there<00:02:35.099> at<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.549> end<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:35.969> I<00:02:36.090> need<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.390> cut

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
wire there at the end and I need to cut
