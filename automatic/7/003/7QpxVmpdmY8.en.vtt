00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
medicine I was on that morphine man it

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.210 
medicine I was on that morphine man it
was<00:00:21.180> really<00:00:21.480> jacking<00:00:21.900> with<00:00:21.930> me<00:00:22.170> so<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.350> put<00:00:23.070> in

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
was really jacking with me so I put in

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.740 
was really jacking with me so I put in
the<00:00:23.250> request<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.820> my<00:00:23.880> doctor<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.390> day<00:00:24.539> that

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
the request of my doctor that day that

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.140 
the request of my doctor that day that
had<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.500> get<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.710> changed<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.279> they<00:00:26.400> actually

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
had to get it changed and they actually

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.570 
had to get it changed and they actually
changed<00:00:27.599> me<00:00:27.779> over<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.650> oxycontin

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
changed me over to oxycontin

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.010 
changed me over to oxycontin
I<00:00:30.119> think<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.019> 20<00:00:31.320> milligram<00:00:32.420> oxycontin<00:00:33.420> so

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
I think it's a 20 milligram oxycontin so

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.569 
I think it's a 20 milligram oxycontin so
I<00:00:34.050> stopped<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.440> morphine<00:00:34.829> immediately<00:00:35.309> and

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
I stopped the morphine immediately and

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.030 
I stopped the morphine immediately and
started<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:37.380> took<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.680> couple<00:00:37.860> of

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
started that and it took a couple of

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.430 
started that and it took a couple of
days<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.250> definitely<00:00:38.969> notice<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.629> good<00:00:40.140> effect

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
days I definitely notice a good effect

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.190

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
the next day my head started being a

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.200 
the next day my head started being a
little<00:00:43.379> bit<00:00:43.469> more<00:00:43.590> clear<00:00:43.829> but<00:00:44.040> over<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
little bit more clear but over the the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.299 
little bit more clear but over the the
next<00:00:45.239> few<00:00:45.600> days<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.960> over<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.260> weekend<00:00:46.590> this

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.569 
know is kind of sore right after the
walk<00:01:57.420> but<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:58.259> next<00:01:58.500> morning<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.950> got<00:01:59.219> up<00:01:59.280> and

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.160 
felt really good and was able to do it
again<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.820> I<00:02:02.820> noticed<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.689> little<00:02:03.840> bit<00:02:04.020> more

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
again so I noticed a little bit more

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.310 
again so I noticed a little bit more

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
you know I was kind of leaning on one

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.770 
you know I was kind of leaning on one
side<00:02:16.520> and<00:02:16.760> then<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:16.910> other<00:02:17.030> but<00:02:17.390> now<00:02:17.480> I<00:02:17.510> can

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
side and then the other but now I can

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.800

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
kind of start to get back to normal that

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.510 
kind of start to get back to normal that
way<00:02:22.270> earlier<00:02:23.270> in<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.630> week<00:02:23.810> I<00:02:24.080> drove<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.400> go

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
way earlier in the week I drove to go

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.630 
way earlier in the week I drove to go
pick<00:02:25.730> up<00:02:25.880> some<00:02:26.060> food<00:02:26.240> and<00:02:26.630> I<00:02:27.310> was<00:02:28.310> kind<00:02:28.580> of

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
pick up some food and I was kind of

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.440 
pick up some food and I was kind of
debate<00:02:28.850> I<00:02:28.970> didn't<00:02:29.150> know<00:02:29.210> if<00:02:29.330> I<00:02:29.420> should

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
debate I didn't know if I should

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.320 
debate I didn't know if I should
actually<00:02:30.320> kind<00:02:30.680> of<00:02:30.790> twisting<00:02:31.790> around<00:02:31.910> and

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
actually kind of twisting around and

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.210 
actually kind of twisting around and
kind<00:02:32.720> of<00:02:32.750> looking<00:02:33.110> for<00:02:33.290> oncoming<00:02:33.650> traffic<00:02:33.920> or

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
kind of looking for oncoming traffic or

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.220 
kind of looking for oncoming traffic or
something<00:02:34.310> wasn't<00:02:34.610> probably<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.870> easiest

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
something wasn't probably the easiest

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.700 
something wasn't probably the easiest
thing<00:02:36.410> but<00:02:37.270> overall<00:02:38.270> I<00:02:38.390> mean<00:02:38.870> I<00:02:38.900> am<00:02:39.080> driving<00:02:39.410> if

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
thing but overall I mean I am driving if

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.800 
thing but overall I mean I am driving if
I<00:02:39.830> need<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.130> my<00:02:40.400> my<00:02:40.820> head<00:02:41.060> is<00:02:41.210> a<00:02:41.240> lot<00:02:41.450> clearer

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
I need to my my head is a lot clearer

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.750 
I need to my my head is a lot clearer
now<00:02:42.050> so<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.290> definitely<00:02:42.680> feel<00:02:43.040> more<00:02:43.220> confident

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
now so I definitely feel more confident

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.760 
now so I definitely feel more confident
doing<00:02:43.880> that<00:02:44.000> rather<00:02:44.930> than<00:02:45.140> last<00:02:45.320> week<00:02:45.560> because

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
doing that rather than last week because

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.040 
doing that rather than last week because
I've<00:02:45.860> not<00:02:46.760> only<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.120> physical<00:02:47.300> limitations

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
I've not only the physical limitations

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.750 
I've not only the physical limitations
but<00:02:48.200> just<00:02:48.380> mentally<00:02:48.740> I<00:02:48.770> knew<00:02:49.280> I<00:02:49.310> shouldn't<00:02:49.670> be

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
but just mentally I knew I shouldn't be

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.600 
but just mentally I knew I shouldn't be
driving<00:02:50.180> I<00:02:50.270> just<00:02:50.450> couldn't<00:02:50.690> focus<00:02:50.870> so<00:02:51.610> but

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
driving I just couldn't focus so but

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.460 
driving I just couldn't focus so but
this<00:02:52.700> week<00:02:52.880> I've<00:02:53.180> driven<00:02:53.420> several<00:02:53.780> times<00:02:54.110> and

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
this week I've driven several times and

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.670 
this week I've driven several times and
it's<00:02:55.100> been<00:02:55.280> okay<00:02:55.550> just<00:02:55.910> got<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:57.530> know<00:02:57.590> you

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
it's been okay just got a you know you

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.790

can't<00:02:57.890> have<00:02:58.040> those<00:02:58.250> quick<00:02:58.610> reactions<00:02:59.210> which

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
can't have those quick reactions which

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.790 
can't have those quick reactions which
I'm<00:03:00.800> how<00:03:01.010> safe<00:03:01.310> that<00:03:01.490> is<00:03:01.580> to<00:03:01.730> be<00:03:01.820> driving<00:03:02.240> but

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
I'm how safe that is to be driving but

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.200 
I'm how safe that is to be driving but
overall<00:03:03.800> it's<00:03:04.040> not<00:03:04.100> bad<00:03:04.370> it's<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:04.760> little<00:03:04.970> sore

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
overall it's not bad it's a little sore

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.390 
overall it's not bad it's a little sore
still<00:03:05.570> you<00:03:05.870> know<00:03:05.960> because<00:03:06.170> you're<00:03:06.320> in<00:03:07.160> the

your incision but overall it's
manageable<00:03:12.230> I<00:03:12.380> can<00:03:12.770> start<00:03:13.010> getting<00:03:13.190> around<00:03:13.340> so

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640

of the incision it's definitely healed
nice<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.880> most<00:03:22.880> of<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.060> dura<00:03:23.240> bond<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.720> stuff

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
nice the most of the dura bond and stuff

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.140 
nice the most of the dura bond and stuff
has<00:03:24.020> come<00:03:24.140> off<00:03:24.350> and<00:03:24.650> everything<00:03:25.400> looks<00:03:25.880> pretty

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
has come off and everything looks pretty

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.760 
has come off and everything looks pretty
good<00:03:26.330> it's<00:03:26.660> it's<00:03:27.140> still<00:03:27.320> a<00:03:27.350> little<00:03:27.470> sensitive

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
good it's it's still a little sensitive

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.990 
good it's it's still a little sensitive
but<00:03:29.500> you<00:03:30.500> know<00:03:30.620> it<00:03:30.770> seriously<00:03:31.640> gets<00:03:31.790> better

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
but you know it seriously gets better

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.570 
but you know it seriously gets better
every<00:03:32.270> day<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:32.660> I<00:03:33.160> think<00:03:34.160> over<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.520> next

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
every day and I think over the next

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.570 
every day and I think over the next
couple<00:03:34.850> weeks<00:03:35.000> I'll<00:03:35.390> I'm<00:03:35.720> you<00:03:35.750> know<00:03:36.459> I'll<00:03:37.459> be

couple weeks I'll I'm you know I'll be
in<00:03:37.670> pretty<00:03:37.850> good<00:03:37.940> shape<00:03:38.000> so<00:03:38.590> I'm<00:03:39.590> actually

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
in pretty good shape so I'm actually

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.220 
in pretty good shape so I'm actually
really<00:03:39.980> surprised<00:03:40.610> at<00:03:40.790> three<00:03:41.000> weeks<00:03:41.180> how<00:03:41.540> up

on<00:03:49.160> my<00:03:49.400> own<00:03:49.520> I<00:03:49.700> kind<00:03:49.910> of<00:03:49.970> thought<00:03:50.330> I'd<00:03:50.450> be<00:03:50.600> down

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
on my own I kind of thought I'd be down

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.180 
on my own I kind of thought I'd be down
for<00:03:50.989> a<00:03:51.050> little<00:03:51.230> bit<00:03:51.320> longer<00:03:51.500> than<00:03:51.680> I<00:03:51.709> have<00:03:51.920> been

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
for a little bit longer than I have been

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.520 
for a little bit longer than I have been
and<00:03:52.780> probably<00:03:53.780> would<00:03:53.870> have<00:03:53.959> been<00:03:54.080> up<00:03:54.230> even

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
and probably would have been up even

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.780 
and probably would have been up even
sooner<00:03:54.739> if<00:03:55.040> I<00:03:55.130> didn't<00:03:55.340> have<00:03:55.459> that<00:03:55.489> little

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
sooner if I didn't have that little

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.770 
sooner if I didn't have that little
mishap<00:03:55.940> with<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.330> medication<00:03:57.020> so<00:03:58.780> overall

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
mishap with the medication so overall

really think that it's all just pain

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.060 
really think that it's all just pain
from<00:04:14.209> the<00:04:14.330> incision<00:04:14.630> itself<00:04:15.140> and<00:04:15.590> the

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
from the incision itself and the

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.890 
from the incision itself and the
procedure<00:04:16.489> so<00:04:16.850> I<00:04:17.090> know<00:04:17.239> that'll<00:04:17.660> go<00:04:17.810> away

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
procedure so I know that'll go away

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.670 
procedure so I know that'll go away
overtop<00:04:18.440> with<00:04:18.590> time<00:04:18.830> and<00:04:20.169> if<00:04:21.169> I<00:04:21.260> keep<00:04:21.440> doing

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
overtop with time and if I keep doing

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.210
