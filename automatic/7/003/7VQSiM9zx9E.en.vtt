00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.850 
only the beginning the hard part comes
when<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.640> take<00:02:13.850> to<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.120> water<00:02:14.410> its<00:02:15.410> dignity

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
when you take to the water its dignity

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.120 
when you take to the water its dignity
of<00:02:16.340> this<00:02:16.490> sport<00:02:16.880> it<00:02:17.780> is<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:17.930> perhaps<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:19.040> most

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
of this sport it is a perhaps the most

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.030 
of this sport it is a perhaps the most
wonderful<00:02:19.520> thing<00:02:19.880> about<00:02:20.740> sliding<00:02:21.740> along

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
wonderful thing about sliding along

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:39.550 
wonderful thing about sliding along
one's<00:02:22.610> positive<00:02:23.090> in<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.270> foreign<00:02:23.630> land<00:02:38.560> well

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
one's positive in the foreign land well

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.500 
one's positive in the foreign land well
I<00:02:39.890> can<00:02:40.459> obviously<00:02:40.670> do<00:02:40.910> with<00:02:41.090> a<00:02:41.120> bit<00:02:41.330> more

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
I can obviously do with a bit more

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.380 
I can obviously do with a bit more
practice<00:02:41.860> but<00:02:42.860> Hugo's<00:02:43.310> going<00:02:43.550> to<00:02:43.610> show<00:02:43.790> us<00:02:43.970> how

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
practice but Hugo's going to show us how

00:02:44.390 --> 00:03:01.080 
practice but Hugo's going to show us how
it<00:02:44.570> should<00:02:44.720> be<00:02:44.750> done<00:02:44.840> properly

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.040 

I<00:03:01.379> would<00:03:02.379> have<00:03:02.470> got<00:03:02.590> there<00:03:02.769> eventually
