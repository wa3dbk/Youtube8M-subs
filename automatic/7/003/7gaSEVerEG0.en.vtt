00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 
names for you sure so I don't think the

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.200 
names for you sure so I don't think the
names<00:06:39.740> were<00:06:39.860> written<00:06:40.040> down<00:06:40.250> ahead<00:06:40.460> of<00:06:40.610> time<00:06:40.910> so

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.540 
names were written down ahead of time so
I<00:06:41.240> think<00:06:41.600> someone<00:06:41.870> just<00:06:41.900> had<00:06:42.260> the<00:06:42.710> goofy<00:06:43.310> names

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.830 
I think someone just had the goofy names
in<00:06:43.670> there<00:06:43.790> now<00:06:44.030> they<00:06:44.330> had<00:06:44.510> to<00:06:44.540> have<00:06:44.720> them
