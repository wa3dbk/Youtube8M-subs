00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:19.010
 this is our new top of the range 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:23.750
 of our brand 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:26.689
 pf 11.4 2014 and a frame that is 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.140
 the evolution of gf 0 that will always remain 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.330
 in the leg 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.910
 a frame and having the same 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.910
 features therefore very light 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.130
 to the same type therefore not loom which 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.130
 exceptional for those who want to run but 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.750
 also 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.300
 wants to ride a bike on the mind 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.570
 perverse the match of 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.130
 if you want 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.280
 a frame that unlike tf 0 e 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.770
 ipod 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.059
 of this we have worked on this 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.649
 we could also work a lot 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.340
 on the athletic part 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.310
 the tube 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.260
 oblique 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.320
 a drop in the part 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.300
 it is high and for everything 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.220
 is 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.810
 the sagona le in the lower part of sino 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.390
 to the movement box to have a lot 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.770
 more dignity the same thing also for the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.490
 horizontal tube 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:22.320
 the director remains 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.890
 round like super tf 0 and the cart 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.140
 rear 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.270
 we made a three piglet 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.790
 attack points contrary to this for 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.310
 give maximum visibility to the changes 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:38.080
 so the best has changed this is 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.570
 the new tf 4 is seen from the line 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.450
 is part of the fondriest e family 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.590
 then it follows the line of tf 3 and the tf 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:50.890
 2 is a mid-range chassis has the 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:54.850
 the first one is the dual brakes 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:58.690
 pivot that comes in the rear brake 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.600
 mounted under the movement box 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.470
 central one of the particularity doors 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.030
 of this frame is that we have inserted 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.720
 introduced the brakes with the dual system 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.700
 pivot and you see the brake is positioned 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.030
 the rear brake positioned under the 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.340
 bottom bracket box has the 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.880
 function of being a brake which is a lot 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.400
 very functional it returns very well 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.430
 aesthetically the bicycle changes 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.370
 in this way he sees of the car 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.700
 the rear is no longer the brake 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.980
 to a very clean line very much 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.350
 beautiful and we believe we have 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.700
 made a product of this type of 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.700
 truly exceptional range
