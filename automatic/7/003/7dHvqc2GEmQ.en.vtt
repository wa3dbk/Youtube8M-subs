00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.539
 we will be able now 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.219
 so dress it up to dress up my box 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.259
 I will start from the sides and I 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:45.229

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.200
 proceed the same now on the other 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.269
 side here I finished dressing but 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.919
 two sides I will now proceed to 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:11.870
 background dressing using a map 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:13.459
 bull that is 13 4 on 15 cm I'm going 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.400

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.400
 So here I recognize my net card I 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.590
 to put it on my paper I turn 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.870
 I'm slouching well and I'm going to rail and 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:30.319
 both sides of 15 cm the first and the 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.000
 second in the same way voila voila 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.260
 I dress and my card net of funds I 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.079
 can I put it up on my 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.910
 case so jean paul the back of my 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:42.420
 map honest and I will place 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.460
 inside my case here and 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.560
 so I stick mayrand edge upside down 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.820
 of the ong case here is the case is 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.710
 completed so let's proceed 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.840
 the covering of the outer cover 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.450
 for that I cut a strip of 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.120
 imitation paper of 17 out of 38 on which I 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.100
 will stick the different elements that 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.700
 are the cover so we 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:06.150
 so have a two right stream after a 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:12.620
 small side the top right measure 9 8 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:20.160
 on 14 cm a small side of 1 5 on 14 cm 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:25.260
 a cardboard of under 14 of 15 cm a 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:30.390
 small side of 1 5 on 14 cm and 1,200 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:33.780
 left of 5 1 on 14 cm so I place 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.250
 a heavy ruler 1 cm from the edge so 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.470
 to be able to correctly align my 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.700
 cartons and I'm going to start sticking the 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.920
 right side I put it at 1.5 from the edge I 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.510
 the lily between my two boxes between 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.580
 each of the boxes I will leave a 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.520
 hinge of 4 mm which corresponds to two 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.500
 cardboard thicknesses to do this I 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.330
 makes a jig by gluing 2 small 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.340
 cardboard falls of 2 and so I like 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.710
 so my template of 4 mm that I'm going 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.870
 put between each carton to be able to 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.100
 the collar is correctly 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:07.230
 so I start I continue with the 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:09.419
 little side I put my little cardboard I 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.970
 stick my little side along my ruler 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:15.330
 euros gourd and the day after my 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.970
 4mm jig I can remove my 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.290
 template and move on to the next step on 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.290
 slap on the other side 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.560
 here
