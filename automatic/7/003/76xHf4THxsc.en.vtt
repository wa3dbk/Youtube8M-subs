00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
crypto currencies is because sir they're

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.410 
crypto currencies is because sir they're
actually<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.979> mathematical<00:01:08.790> algorithm<00:01:09.299> and

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
actually a mathematical algorithm and

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.750 
actually a mathematical algorithm and
stronger<00:01:09.960> they're<00:01:10.470> actually<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.040> technology

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
stronger they're actually the technology

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.820 
stronger they're actually the technology
is<00:01:11.820> going<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.210> be<00:01:12.299> used<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.320> financial

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
is going to be used in the financial

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.950 
is going to be used in the financial
system<00:01:13.979> because<00:01:14.490> they<00:01:14.610> see<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.390> potential<00:01:15.750> of

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
system because they see the potential of

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.609 
system because they see the potential of
it<00:01:16.140> being<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.400> strong<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.180> big<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.229> basic

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
it being so strong the big the basic

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.710 
it being so strong the big the basic
power<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.250> cryptocurrency<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.240> how<00:01:21.360> strong

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
power of cryptocurrency and how strong

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.749 
power of cryptocurrency and how strong
it<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.140> how<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.350> can't<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:22.740> cracked<00:01:23.040> can't

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
it is and how it can't be cracked can't

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.080 
it is and how it can't be cracked can't
be<00:01:23.880> just<00:01:24.060> altered<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.020> can't<00:01:25.229> be<00:01:25.380> changed<00:01:25.409> and

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
be just altered it can't be changed and

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.039 
be just altered it can't be changed and
so<00:01:27.590> it's<00:01:28.590> going<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.920> be<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.189> future<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.579> help

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
so it's going to be the future and help

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.240 
so it's going to be the future and help
help<00:01:31.049> businesses<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.250> people<00:01:32.970> save<00:01:33.960> money

help businesses and people save money

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.649 
help businesses and people save money
and<00:01:35.250> people<00:01:35.460> are<00:01:35.640> going<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.880> move<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.150> crypto

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
and people are going to move to crypto

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.499 
and people are going to move to crypto
purses<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> reason<00:01:37.439> why<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.619> for<00:01:38.009> two<00:01:38.189> reasons

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
purses the reason why is for two reasons

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.580 
purses the reason why is for two reasons
is<00:01:39.509> one<00:01:40.640> low<00:01:41.640> transaction<00:01:42.150> fees<00:01:42.600> fees<00:01:43.020> between

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
is one low transaction fees fees between

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.289 
is one low transaction fees fees between
transferring<00:01:44.130> money<00:01:44.250> between<00:01:44.399> people<00:01:45.149> is

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
transferring money between people is

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.670 
transferring money between people is
very<00:01:45.930> low<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.710> also<00:01:47.840> when<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.960> save<00:01:49.320> in

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
very low and also when you save in

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.200 
very low and also when you save in
crypto<00:01:49.979> currencies<00:01:50.430> unlike<00:01:50.820> when<00:01:51.060> you're

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
crypto currencies unlike when you're

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
saving immobile curses it will slowly go

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.050 
saving immobile curses it will slowly go
up<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:54.990> value<00:01:55.020> today<00:01:55.500> it's<00:01:55.950> fluctuating<00:01:56.670> up

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
up in value today it's fluctuating up

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.270 
up in value today it's fluctuating up
and<00:01:57.270> down<00:01:57.740> currents<00:01:58.740> cryptocurrencies<00:01:59.250> are

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
one is low transaction fees and two when
