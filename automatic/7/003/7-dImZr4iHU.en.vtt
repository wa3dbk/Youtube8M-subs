00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
you guys remember I got five fish and

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.829 
you guys remember I got five fish and
three<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.500> them<00:00:13.620> have<00:00:13.920> died<00:00:14.219> unfortunately

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
three of them have died unfortunately

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.170 
three of them have died unfortunately
now<00:00:15.839> that<00:00:16.199> could<00:00:17.039> be<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.609> know<00:00:17.730> for<00:00:17.970> any

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
now that could be you know for any

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.810 
now that could be you know for any
number<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.630> reasons<00:00:18.779> really<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:20.220> honestly

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
number of reasons really I honestly

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.920 
number of reasons really I honestly
think<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.180> was<00:00:21.270> because<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.720> temperature

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
think it was because of the temperature

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.769 
think it was because of the temperature
for<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.439> most<00:00:22.619> part<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.789> was<00:00:23.910> fluctuating<00:00:24.330> I

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
for the most part it was fluctuating I

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.939 
for the most part it was fluctuating I
got<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.189> digital<00:00:26.189> thermometer<00:00:26.789> up<00:00:27.599> there<00:00:28.230> that

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
got a digital thermometer up there that

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.950 
got a digital thermometer up there that
tells<00:00:29.160> me<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.490> temperature<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.779> water

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
tells me the temperature in the water

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.560 
tells me the temperature in the water
and<00:00:31.199> that's<00:00:31.439> actually<00:00:31.769> four<00:00:32.430> degrees<00:00:32.880> off<00:00:33.210> I

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
and that's actually four degrees off I

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.500 
and that's actually four degrees off I
went<00:00:33.899> over<00:00:34.170> like<00:00:34.320> right<00:00:34.380> now<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:35.070> says<00:00:35.520> 82<00:00:35.969> and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
went over like right now it says 82 and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.959 
went over like right now it says 82 and
if<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.140> come<00:00:37.380> over<00:00:37.530> here<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.160> actually<00:00:38.640> look

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
if you come over here and actually look

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.869 
if you come over here and actually look
at<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.300> thermometer<00:00:39.750> it's<00:00:40.739> really<00:00:41.100> about<00:00:41.190> 78

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
at this thermometer it's really about 78

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.510 
at this thermometer it's really about 78
and<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.420> kept<00:00:42.660> fluctuating<00:00:43.469> or<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.950> kept

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
and I kept fluctuating or I kept

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.950 
and I kept fluctuating or I kept
changing<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.120> temperature<00:00:45.420> because<00:00:45.809> it

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
changing the temperature because it

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.319 
changing the temperature because it
wasn't<00:00:46.289> right<00:00:46.410> but<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:47.149> think<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.300> really

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
wasn't right but I think that really

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.630 
wasn't right but I think that really
kind<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.870> contributed<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.890> there's<00:00:50.340> blue

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
kind of contributed to it there's blue

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.660 
kind of contributed to it there's blue

what are these little things they're
actually<00:02:11.250> fake<00:02:11.700> anemones<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.750> didn't<00:02:13.379> get<00:02:13.470> real

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
actually fake anemones I didn't get real

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.170 
actually fake anemones I didn't get real
ones<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.160> actually<00:02:14.340> like<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.700> way<00:02:14.790> this<00:02:15.000> one

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
ones I actually like the way this one

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.840 
ones I actually like the way this one
looks<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.960> whole<00:02:16.080> lot<00:02:16.140> better<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:17.370> one<00:02:17.550> I

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
looks a whole lot better that one I

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.150 
looks a whole lot better that one I
don't<00:02:18.300> know<00:02:18.360> it's<00:02:18.690> not<00:02:18.810> bad<00:02:19.050> but<00:02:19.709> does<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.040> look

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
don't know it's not bad but does it look

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.090 
don't know it's not bad but does it look
as<00:02:20.400> real<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:21.270> one<00:02:21.450> does<00:02:21.959> i<00:02:22.110> guess<00:02:22.740> i<00:02:23.010> don't

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
as real is that one does i guess i don't

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.580 
as real is that one does i guess i don't
know<00:02:23.569> anemones<00:02:24.569> are<00:02:24.600> very<00:02:25.020> hard<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.380> actually

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
know anemones are very hard to actually

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.559 
know anemones are very hard to actually
take<00:02:26.040> care<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.670> they're<00:02:26.970> actually<00:02:27.120> living

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
take care of and they're actually living

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.840 
take care of and they're actually living
creatures<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.020> they<00:02:28.230> move<00:02:28.470> around<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:29.130> they

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
creatures and they move around and they

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.540 
creatures and they move around and they
sometimes<00:02:30.120> will<00:02:30.420> actually<00:02:30.750> kill<00:02:31.020> your<00:02:31.260> fish

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
sometimes will actually kill your fish

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.520 
sometimes will actually kill your fish
now<00:02:32.550> I<00:02:32.580> know<00:02:32.670> clownfish<00:02:33.330> usually<00:02:33.959> host<00:02:34.260> with

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
now I know clownfish usually host with

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.190 
now I know clownfish usually host with
them<00:02:34.680> they<00:02:34.830> usually<00:02:35.130> adapt<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.730> them<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.720> oh

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
them they usually adapt to them and oh

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.650 
them they usually adapt to them and oh
there<00:02:37.440> goes<00:02:37.560> silver<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:38.480> usually<00:02:39.480> they're

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
there goes silver and usually they're

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.390 
there goes silver and usually they're
pretty<00:02:39.840> fine<00:02:40.050> but<00:02:40.290> depending<00:02:40.860> on<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.370> know

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
pretty fine but depending on you know

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.910 
pretty fine but depending on you know
the<00:02:41.790> kind<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.570> anemone<00:02:43.020> you<00:02:43.170> get<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.560> have<00:02:43.739> I

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
the kind of anemone you get you have I

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.080 
the kind of anemone you get you have I
mean<00:02:44.069> they're<00:02:44.190> actually<00:02:44.459> hard<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.700> take<00:02:44.910> care

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
mean they're actually hard to take care

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.180 
mean they're actually hard to take care
of<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:45.420> an<00:02:45.660> easier<00:02:46.410> way<00:02:46.590> was<00:02:46.800> just<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:47.040> get

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
of so an easier way was just to get

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.699 
of so an easier way was just to get
these<00:02:47.459> and<00:02:47.790> like<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.630> said<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:48.959> really<00:02:49.140> looks

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
these and like I said that really looks

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.490 
these and like I said that really looks
pretty<00:02:50.580> real<00:02:50.850> if<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.270> ask<00:02:51.450> me<00:02:51.630> that<00:02:52.140> one<00:02:52.320> looks

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
pretty real if you ask me that one looks

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.290 
pretty real if you ask me that one looks
a<00:02:52.620> little<00:02:52.769> bit<00:02:52.950> more<00:02:53.070> fake<00:02:53.400> maybe<00:02:53.940> because<00:02:54.180> it

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
a little bit more fake maybe because it

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.910 
a little bit more fake maybe because it
doesn't<00:02:54.570> move<00:02:54.630> around<00:02:54.780> as<00:02:55.140> much<00:02:55.320> I<00:02:55.620> don't<00:02:55.860> know

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
doesn't move around as much I don't know

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.820 
doesn't move around as much I don't know
but<00:02:56.160> I<00:02:56.370> have<00:02:56.730> such<00:02:56.880> a<00:02:56.910> small<00:02:57.150> tank<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.660> its<00:02:58.470> kind

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
but I have such a small tank I its kind

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.040 
but I have such a small tank I its kind
of<00:02:58.950> overkill<00:02:59.459> I<00:02:59.730> guess<00:03:00.180> maybe<00:03:00.360> having<00:03:00.720> two<00:03:00.900> of

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
of overkill I guess maybe having two of

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.990 
of overkill I guess maybe having two of
them<00:03:01.200> in<00:03:01.290> there<00:03:01.320> but<00:03:02.070> I<00:03:02.100> just<00:03:02.250> love<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.760> color

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
them in there but I just love the color

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.400 
them in there but I just love the color
of<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.390> adds<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:03.989> I<00:03:04.080> think<00:03:04.140> it's

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
of that it adds to it I think it's

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.410 
of that it adds to it I think it's
absolutely<00:03:04.650> gorgeous<00:03:04.980> next<00:03:05.880> step<00:03:06.060> will<00:03:06.269> be<00:03:06.300> to

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
absolutely gorgeous next step will be to

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.009 
absolutely gorgeous next step will be to
