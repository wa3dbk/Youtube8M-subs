00:00:31.330 --> 00:01:14.620 

okay<00:00:32.230> really<00:00:32.920> see<00:00:33.250> it

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.160 

but<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:16.050> mean

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:30.880 

mr.<00:01:19.830> your<00:01:20.010> degrees<00:01:20.280> outside<00:01:20.700> right<00:01:20.970> now<00:01:21.270> so

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.470 

okay<00:01:31.890> these<00:01:32.610> are<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.850> second<00:01:33.150> ones<00:01:33.300> they're

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
okay these are the second ones they're

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.760 
okay these are the second ones they're
kind<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:33.960> pilling<00:01:34.200> up<00:01:34.260> but<00:01:34.440> that's<00:01:34.530> not

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
kind of pilling up but that's not

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.510 
kind of pilling up but that's not
affecting<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:35.670> battery<00:01:36.710> razor's<00:01:37.710> edge<00:01:37.890> these

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
affecting the battery razor's edge these

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.380 
affecting the battery razor's edge these
are<00:01:38.700> awesome

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
are awesome

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.300 
are awesome
you'll<00:01:39.750> notice<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.080> actually<00:01:40.260> the<00:01:41.100> truck

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
you'll notice that actually the truck

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.920 
you'll notice that actually the truck
will<00:01:41.460> go<00:01:41.580> faster<00:01:42.000> with<00:01:42.150> these<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.479> there<00:01:42.810> are

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
will go faster with these in there are

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.300 
will go faster with these in there are
forty<00:01:43.170> four<00:01:43.320> hundred<00:01:43.350> milliamps<00:01:43.800> instead<00:01:44.190> of

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
forty four hundred milliamps instead of

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.070 
forty four hundred milliamps instead of
a<00:01:44.430> three<00:01:44.700> thousand<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.540> they'll<00:01:45.720> hold<00:01:45.900> a

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
a three thousand so they'll hold a

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.750 
a three thousand so they'll hold a
higher<00:01:46.950> charge<00:01:47.840> okay<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.050> have<00:01:49.320> actually

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
higher charge okay so I have actually

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.850 
higher charge okay so I have actually
shaved<00:01:50.760> these<00:01:51.030> down<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.600> little<00:01:51.630> bit<00:01:51.990> so

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
shaved these down just a little bit so

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.800 
shaved these down just a little bit so
because<00:01:53.700> you'll<00:01:53.850> notice<00:01:54.030> with<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.390> Traxxas

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
because you'll notice with the Traxxas

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.340 
because you'll notice with the Traxxas
plugs

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
plugs

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.850 
plugs
they've<00:01:55.800> become<00:01:55.979> harder<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.840> insert<00:01:57.840> into<00:01:58.050> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
they've become harder to insert into the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.790 
they've become harder to insert into the
batteries<00:01:59.520> so<00:01:59.790> I<00:02:00.390> have<00:02:00.750> shaved<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.200> plastic

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
batteries so I have shaved this plastic

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.700 
batteries so I have shaved this plastic
portion<00:02:01.920> down<00:02:02.220> just<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.610> tad<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.810> it's<00:02:04.110> really

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
portion down just a tad so it's really

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:36.850 
portion down just a tad so it's really
easy<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.100> get<00:02:05.399> them<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:05.640> but<00:02:06.119> they<00:02:06.240> are<00:02:06.390> secure

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:03:04.600 

-<00:02:37.520> no<00:02:37.640> problem<00:02:38.120> no<00:02:38.270> problem

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.839 

now<00:03:05.610> for<00:03:05.879> that<00:03:05.909> sprinting<00:03:06.659> challenge<00:03:07.849> cross

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
now for that sprinting challenge cross

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:25.300 
now for that sprinting challenge cross
country

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:05:03.890 

to<00:03:26.310> give<00:03:26.430> you<00:03:26.549> an<00:03:26.610> idea<00:03:26.849> how<00:03:26.909> far<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:27.299> is

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.160 

I<00:05:04.220> keep<00:05:05.220> in<00:05:05.370> mind<00:05:05.610> these<00:05:05.970> motors<00:05:06.450> are<00:05:06.600> like<00:05:06.780> 20

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
I keep in mind these motors are like 20

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.820 
I keep in mind these motors are like 20
bucks<00:05:07.380> apiece

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
bucks apiece

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.000 
bucks apiece
compared<00:05:08.460> to<00:05:09.230> two<00:05:10.230> hundred<00:05:10.530> and<00:05:10.620> fifty

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
compared to two hundred and fifty

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.090 
compared to two hundred and fifty
dollars<00:05:11.400> for<00:05:11.430> the<00:05:11.700> brushless<00:05:12.380> so<00:05:13.380> it's<00:05:13.890> still

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
dollars for the brushless so it's still

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:37.480 
dollars for the brushless so it's still
pretty<00:05:14.310> darn<00:05:14.670> fast<00:05:14.970> for

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.129 

even<00:05:38.490> brushed<00:05:38.760> Emax<00:05:39.180> license<00:05:39.570> okay<00:05:39.660> watch<00:05:39.900> car

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
even brushed Emax license okay watch car

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:46.640 
even brushed Emax license okay watch car
all<00:05:40.470> right<00:05:40.500> great

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.350 

they're<00:05:47.280> doing<00:05:47.610> that<00:05:47.760> the<00:05:47.910> spoon<00:05:48.150> live<00:05:48.270> on

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
they're doing that the spoon live on

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.129 
they're doing that the spoon live on
that<00:05:48.479> streets<00:05:48.840> 25<00:05:50.630> so<00:05:51.630> they're<00:05:51.840> doing<00:05:51.990> at

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
that streets 25 so they're doing at

00:05:52.139 --> 00:06:47.719 
that streets 25 so they're doing at
least<00:05:52.290> 30<00:06:03.500> these<00:06:04.500> batteries<00:06:04.949> last<00:06:05.130> much

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:47.729 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:57.129 

edit<00:06:48.729> that<00:06:48.759> out<00:06:48.969> too

00:06:57.129 --> 00:06:57.139 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:06:59.199
