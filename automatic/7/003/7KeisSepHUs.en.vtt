00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.050
 Hello dear viewers to 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.090
 God favors us, jake 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.420
 hatches 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.369
 presenting my new knife which I 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.720
 fashioned 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:26.400
 literally yesterday I finished well finished in 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.310
 Generally this knife here you see it on 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.800
 screen he sheathed 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:35.760
 everything is completely necessary to do the knife itself except 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.210
 blade and dusk ordered master 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:47.640
 lively coastal blades from the coastal 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:49.829
 steel chrome 12 m by characteristics 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.539
 let's go but in the closed state it 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.539
 25 centimeters length 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:02.180
 look it up so closed first 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.400
 condition 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.400
 Mykarta green handle 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.630
 can i have a separate story 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.840
 we get 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:57.430
 free scabbard hole 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:57.430
 hanger strap soft leather rivet 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.960
 brass ring 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.880
 here on such a mounting execution 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:20.780
 This hard sheath knife can be like this 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.870
 say invest in two positions 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.780
 can be here for this hole here when 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:32.750
 he is a carpenter here is easier 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:34.910
 pull out low hunt give way over 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.880
 held tight in the sheath it is necessary 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:42.820
 drown away everything and he's already here 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:48.769
 no way to get out 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:50.320
 overall very nice so i need you 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:59.890
 showed 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:59.890
 Peresom but first show so look 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:20.580
 the knife is called warner attacking griner about 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:23.240
 than the engraving I did well here it is 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:31.130
 will be my brand icon 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:35.240
 beak callisto and this is the name of the knife warner 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.240
 here you can see steel grade 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:44.360
 knife sharpened brass bolster 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:04:03.880
 such an unusual grip lighting 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.800
 probably the camcorder turned on well and 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.800
 Basically, it looks normal too 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:24.780
 small finger grooves two times 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:29.360
 three here under my arm and so this is where I am 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.360
 the handle sticks out about a centimeter 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.370
 Here are the lines from this gitenaksa 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:43.800
 aluminum tube inserts that 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:46.590
 the sharpness is lost the camera turn them on 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.050
 I'll show you again where is the balance in it but 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.690
 the handle is heavy naturally even here 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:55.620
 there is a hole like and a 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:59.280
 the handle made it easier but the balance is not songs by 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.700
 the middle here now I'll show it somewhere 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.700
 here 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.539
 the grooves I didn't make such too such 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:14.479
 how to say concave make such 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:17.470
 small baking to grab that is 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:23.860
 just lava hand squeeze stronger he already 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:23.860
 much better held in the hand 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:35.060
 here if in principle it is even possible here 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:37.229
 here for this hole 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:40.639
 fencing grip well, just if 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:44.009
 let's use it for the most 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:47.330
 for self defense from possible from forefinger 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.330
 finger and hold back here 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.470
 so seemingly showed him from all sides 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.470
 now i 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:15.810
 characteristics quickly say 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:15.810
 knife length 24 centimeters blade length 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:26.560
 12 centimeters exactly well means the handle 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:32.800
 also 12 by 12 centimeters it is sharp 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:39.310
 is decreasing while u clock 5 is ok so 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:41.790
 the thickness of the handle is 19 20 millimeters 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.790
 full thickness 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:50.460
 blade thickness well approximately 3 millimeters 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:53.140
 I ruler measuring not calipers 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.560
 about 3 millimeters on and goes on 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:07:00.760
 narrowing the tip 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:04.920
 here the width of the blade is three centimeters 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.920
 again comes to narrowing 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:10.080
 In principle, such a knife turned out 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:18.990
 Thank you for your attention all the best 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.990
 good luck, bye
