00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
tutorial this tutorial is on VirtualBox

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.759 
tutorial this tutorial is on VirtualBox
in<00:00:08.160> what<00:00:08.340> is<00:00:08.460> VirtualBox<00:00:09.050> it<00:00:10.050> is<00:00:10.200> a<00:00:10.230> software

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
in what is VirtualBox it is a software

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.610 
in what is VirtualBox it is a software
it's<00:00:11.040> an<00:00:11.160> open<00:00:11.519> source<00:00:11.750> software<00:00:12.750> where<00:00:13.530> you

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
it's an open source software where you

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.910 
it's an open source software where you
can<00:00:13.769> install<00:00:15.109> multiple<00:00:16.109> operating<00:00:16.500> systems

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
can install multiple operating systems

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.029 
can install multiple operating systems
like<00:00:17.070> virtual<00:00:17.730> operating<00:00:17.880> systems<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:19.260> then

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
like virtual operating systems and then

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.410 
like virtual operating systems and then
you<00:00:20.100> can<00:00:20.250> operate<00:00:20.550> on<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.850> again<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.210> can<00:00:21.330> do

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
you can operate on it again you can do

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.220 
you can operate on it again you can do
whatever<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.810> want<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:23.869> it's<00:00:24.869> like<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> virtual

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
whatever you want so it's like a virtual

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.050 
whatever you want so it's like a virtual
machine<00:00:25.740> so<00:00:26.189> if<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.369> want<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.609> install

machine so if you want to install

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.400 
machine so if you want to install
VirtualBox<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.840> just<00:00:28.019> have<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.260> visit

system<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:44.070> VirtualBox<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.879> better<00:00:45.059> search

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
system on VirtualBox you better search

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.940 
system on VirtualBox you better search

is well to learn how to share files like
to<00:00:56.010> enable<00:00:56.190> file<00:00:56.520> sharing<00:00:56.570> abilities<00:00:57.739> between

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
to enable file sharing abilities between

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.599 
to enable file sharing abilities between
a<00:00:58.949> host<00:00:59.430> operating<00:00:59.760> system<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.390> guest

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
a host operating system and guest

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.640 
a host operating system and guest
operating<00:01:02.609> system<00:01:02.940> let's<00:01:03.239> say<00:01:03.420> right<00:01:04.320> now<00:01:04.350> I'm

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.370 
using Ubuntu so the host operating
system<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.310> Ubuntu<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.060> guest<00:01:09.990> operating

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
system is Ubuntu and the guest operating

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.719 
system is Ubuntu and the guest operating

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
right so after installing VirtualBox

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.830 
right so after installing VirtualBox
okay<00:01:29.040> after<00:01:29.189> doing<00:01:29.729> everything<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.810> just

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
okay after doing everything you just

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.800 
okay after doing everything you just
start<00:01:31.259> your<00:01:32.119> VM<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.570> virtual

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
start your VM that is the virtual

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.469 
start your VM that is the virtual
machine<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:35.040> when<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.430> load<00:01:36.240> up<00:01:36.420> your

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
machine and when you load up your

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.660 
machine and when you load up your
operating<00:01:37.110> system<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.770> check<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.520> I

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670
