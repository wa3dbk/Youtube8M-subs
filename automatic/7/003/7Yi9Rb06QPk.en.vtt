00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
when I get out from the cold and I think

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.630

something everybody can beat everybody

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.680 
something everybody can beat everybody
so<00:02:08.320> it's<00:02:08.649> tough<00:02:08.920> to<00:02:09.100> say<00:02:09.310> who<00:02:09.340> can<00:02:09.580> be<00:02:10.000> the

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
so it's tough to say who can be the

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.760 
so it's tough to say who can be the
first<00:02:10.930> one<00:02:12.390> would<00:02:13.390> like<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:13.720> play<00:02:14.020> Petra<00:02:14.440> with

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
first one would like to play Petra with

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.770 
first one would like to play Petra with
the<00:02:14.890> left<00:02:15.070> hand<00:02:15.250> especially<00:02:15.460> off<00:02:15.850> so<00:02:16.630> it's

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
the left hand especially off so it's

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.990 
the left hand especially off so it's
very<00:02:16.960> tough<00:02:17.320> she<00:02:17.710> is<00:02:17.950> one<00:02:18.160> of<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.550> cleanest

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
very tough she is one of the cleanest

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.660 
very tough she is one of the cleanest
ball<00:02:19.780> strikers<00:02:20.290> out<00:02:20.500> there<00:02:20.740> and<00:02:21.370> then<00:02:21.490> she's

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
ball strikers out there and then she's

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.190 
ball strikers out there and then she's
also<00:02:21.850> a<00:02:21.970> lefty<00:02:22.330> so<00:02:22.480> that<00:02:22.630> makes<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:22.960> even<00:02:23.050> more

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
also a lefty so that makes it even more

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.820 
also a lefty so that makes it even more
tricky

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
tricky

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.560 
tricky
I<00:02:24.310> was<00:02:25.180> just<00:02:25.330> amazing<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.870> see<00:02:25.900> how<00:02:26.290> well<00:02:26.560> she

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
I was just amazing to see how well she

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.730 
I was just amazing to see how well she
handled<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.660> pressure<00:02:28.990> of<00:02:29.290> being<00:02:29.560> in<00:02:29.650> her

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
handled the pressure of being in her

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.560 
handled the pressure of being in her
