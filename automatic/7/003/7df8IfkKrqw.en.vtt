more<00:01:14.909> players<00:01:15.150> because<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.810> don't<00:01:16.350> get<00:01:16.470> as

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
more players because you don't get as

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.170 
more players because you don't get as
much<00:01:16.650> RP<00:01:17.009> because<00:01:17.310> you're<00:01:17.430> not<00:01:17.549> dying<00:01:17.790> as<00:01:17.939> fast

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
much RP because you're not dying as fast

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.210 
much RP because you're not dying as fast
but<00:01:18.390> basically<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.409> rest<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.040> really

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
but basically the rest of this is really

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.830 
but basically the rest of this is really
simple<00:01:20.520> all<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.060> have<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.299> do<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.570> once<00:01:21.750> you

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
simple all you have to do is once you

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.630 
simple all you have to do is once you
start<00:01:22.080> up<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.229> map<00:01:22.380> take<00:01:22.830> any<00:01:23.009> car<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
start up the map take any car to the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.179 
start up the map take any car to the
military<00:01:23.880> base<00:01:24.180> hop<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.170> basically<00:01:25.830> from

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
military base hop in and basically from

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.890 
military base hop in and basically from
there<00:01:26.340> all<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.610> have<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.790> do<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.090> die<00:01:27.330> over<00:01:27.750> and

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
there all you have to do is die over and
