been using it for two days six hours and
56<00:01:46.590> minutes<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.130> that's<00:01:47.340> how<00:01:47.460> old<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:48.320> you

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
56 minutes so that's how old it is you

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.480 
56 minutes so that's how old it is you
can't<00:01:49.470> ever<00:01:49.560> sound<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.159> off<00:01:50.250> which<00:01:50.460> is

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
can't ever sound on and off which is

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.359 
can't ever sound on and off which is
just<00:01:50.790> them<00:01:50.909> beeps<00:01:51.180> every<00:01:51.450> now<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.720> again<00:01:51.750> and

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
just them beeps every now and again and

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.889 
just them beeps every now and again and
you<00:01:53.369> can<00:01:53.460> reset<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.880> pet<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.360> don't<00:01:54.689> know<00:01:54.750> why

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
you can reset the pet I don't know why

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.200 
you can reset the pet I don't know why
you'd<00:01:55.020> want<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.229> do<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.729> after<00:01:56.729> growing<00:01:56.939> one

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
you'd want to do that after growing one

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.810 
you'd want to do that after growing one
for<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.450> long<00:01:58.130> that's<00:01:59.130> pretty<00:01:59.280> much<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.460> it's<00:01:59.759> a

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
for so long that's pretty much it it's a

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.399 
for so long that's pretty much it it's a
really<00:01:59.969> simple<00:02:00.180> up<00:02:00.509> against<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.990> job<00:02:01.170> done

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
really simple up against the job done

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.260 
really simple up against the job done
and<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:02.340> kind<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.610> reminds<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.090> how

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
and it kind of reminds you of how

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.780 
and it kind of reminds you of how
virtual<00:02:03.719> pets<00:02:03.960> we're<00:02:04.170> back<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.560> day<00:02:04.799> now

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
virtual pets we're back in the day now

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.280 
virtual pets we're back in the day now
my<00:02:06.000> only<00:02:06.119> issue<00:02:06.299> with<00:02:06.479> this<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.869> because

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
my only issue with this is that because

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.229 
my only issue with this is that because
of<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.560> technology<00:02:07.770> available<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.700> an<00:02:08.819> iPhone

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
of the technology available on an iPhone

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.880 
of the technology available on an iPhone
they<00:02:09.780> could<00:02:09.929> have<00:02:09.959> actually<00:02:10.170> added<00:02:10.470> some<00:02:10.770> more

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
they could have actually added some more

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.710 
they could have actually added some more
to<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.220> may<00:02:11.370> be<00:02:11.430> included<00:02:12.000> some<00:02:12.150> sort<00:02:12.660> of

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
to it may be included some sort of

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.670 
to it may be included some sort of
social<00:02:12.959> element

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
social element

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.890 
social element
or<00:02:14.159> giving<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:14.790> better<00:02:15.150> options<00:02:15.569> than<00:02:15.629> just

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
or giving you better options than just

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.220 
or giving you better options than just
bouncing<00:02:16.409> a<00:02:16.469> ball<00:02:16.620> when<00:02:16.769> you<00:02:16.890> click<00:02:17.069> on<00:02:17.189> this

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
bouncing a ball when you click on this

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.899 
bouncing a ball when you click on this
but<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:20.040> fact<00:02:20.219> that<00:02:20.280> they<00:02:20.430> kept<00:02:20.609> it<00:02:20.730> simple

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
but the fact that they kept it simple

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.479 
but the fact that they kept it simple
might<00:02:21.719> work<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.049> their<00:02:22.170> favor<00:02:22.200> because<00:02:22.769> they

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
might work in their favor because they

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.009 
might work in their favor because they
might<00:02:23.640> ruined<00:02:24.060> if<00:02:24.150> they<00:02:24.299> try<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.540> add<00:02:24.719> too<00:02:24.900> many

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
might ruined if they try to add too many

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.020 
might ruined if they try to add too many
features<00:02:25.439> to<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.769> so<00:02:26.310> for<00:02:26.489> that<00:02:26.579> reason<00:02:26.640> I'll

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
features to it so for that reason I'll

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.750 
features to it so for that reason I'll
give<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:27.329> the<00:02:27.510> powerful<00:02:27.959> vote<00:02:28.400> powerful<00:02:29.400> so
