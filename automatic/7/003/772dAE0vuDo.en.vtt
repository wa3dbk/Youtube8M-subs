00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 continue the topic of running training on 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.680
 treadmill them or treadmills 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.260
 tracks like sometimes it's called in 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.280
 Russian community 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.599
 I already said in the previous lesson that 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.969
 happens absolutely when impossible 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.150
 train in the street and then she and no 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.550
 at the side of the playpens winter 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.500
 and how when one should not be afraid and go and 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.840
 to train for 3 rotten there are a number 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.730
 good athletes and very fast 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.340
 runners and especially runners and 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.320
 Scandinavian countries that were preparing for 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.570
 its very high achievement on 3 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.079
 rotten and then won the biggest 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.230
 start 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.940
 But there are features training on 3 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:48.510
 lovely and there are some nuances of choosing these 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.870
 the most ancient and so the most important need 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.390
 understand that it is much better to run on 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.340
 treadmill electrically driven than 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.640
 on the mechanical internet which you 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.570
 rotate your legs with your own efforts 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.939
 feet then if you still have a choice 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.500
 and these 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.799
 electrically driven then 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.369
 one should choose as many as possible 3 heed 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.759
 the more treadmill the better he should 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.530
 be as stable as possible and does not have 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.740
 virtually no hesitation 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:27.119
 not in the transverse plane not 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.740
 vertical because any fluctuations 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.930
 any return 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.829
 This is of course an additional burden. 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.470
 on on legs and especially tense with equal 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.100
 and including by the way on the hip 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.890
 joint 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.780
 that is, on the buttocks so if there is 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.200
 choose big 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.990
 steady rotted until recently 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.100
 it was thought that in order to commission 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.229
 quit no shortage by the end with full 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.420
 lack of air resistance at 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.540
 Running on the Internet is necessary 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.549
 raise the treadmill by 1 percent that is 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.369
 lift this treadmill by 1 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.780
 percentage up however last 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.660
 research the very last trace on 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.429
 2013 and 2014 showed that even 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.799
 of this 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.879
 do that basically run even at 0 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:17.750
 the rise is quite adequate to run in the fresh 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:23.060
 the air 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:26.750
 so do not be afraid to use it even 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:30.049
 with zero rise and just a hem 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.639
 lifting the running belt is necessary 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.810
 use when preparing for 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:36.609
 competitions but we'll talk about it 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.769
 separately if you do not have the opportunity 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:41.689
 you run at such trading steadily 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:45.079
 treadmill and of course you can choose and 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:51.079
 small they are not so stable with them 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:55.099
 there is a return up that is some kind of 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:58.280
 a pulse that goes up the leg 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:00.769
 sometimes transverse oscillations and to 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.950
 this is applied very carefully it is not 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:07.400
 so scary if you gradually come up 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.669
 to volume training it can even 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:16.129
 strengthen the musculoskeletal system and and 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:18.919
 in general, even the muscles of the body but it is necessary 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:22.190
 observe the basic principle of gradualness 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:24.260
 but by the way I want to say that in general 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.840
 all on the treadmill training they need 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.060
 observe this principle of gradualness then 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:34.010
 eat if you have to run three 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:36.319
 sweet ones then you must first learn it 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.689
 use first to run there for 30-40 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.180
 minutes maybe a week maybe 2 and 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:44.269
 little by little increases 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.759
 training and bringing to the right 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:50.229
 duration and desired intensity and 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:52.699
 I want to say once again that 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:56.769
 train room in running 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:59.959
 it is necessary well in cool and good 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:02.720
 ventilated halls otherwise it will be 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:06.280
 additionally and absolutely unnecessary 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.280
 load on the cardiovascular system
