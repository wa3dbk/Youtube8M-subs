00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.769
 only on the quality of spinning and drying 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.590
 but also on the energy efficiency of the device 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:09.060
 there is a class a + + a + 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:13.410
 and from a to g affects efficiency 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.300
 wash the higher and the cluster to the wash 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.610

 800 many recommend if it is completely

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.750
 if it will be duvet pillows 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.550
 jackets of course and spend on 1400 1200
