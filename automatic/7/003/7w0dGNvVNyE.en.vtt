00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.610
 hello world of the sun in the eye will be so 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.800
 talk or charge continue 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.189
 practically found by freeride 2 series 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.289
 we are with you here and who forgot 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.699
 last time talked about the minimum 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.109
 equipment that is needed for when they 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.539
 we are not talking about skiing today 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.099
 besides, let's go run just dove 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.740
 in Europe as they say, I just 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.440
 tell you what are in two lines 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.899
 globally without going into details well 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.809
 In principle, it is interesting further on the site to her husband 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.430
 to them this topic means well first first 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.050
 the very first eat you really 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.890
 gathered to go to his freeride needs 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.700
 collects my skis 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.140
 but there is such a situation but why so 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.300
 because but completely different 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.010
 lagged behind in fact again 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.800
 talk we talk about normal free 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.559
 for the sake of combat patsansky they are there three meters 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.610
 slope here we are talking about normal 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.199
 of the company 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.330
 we are talking about what we will learn 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.670
 okay skate basically of course 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.260
 powerful corfu skiing on downhill skiing 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.060
 it is quite possible u have to talk about 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.830
 that its impossible impossible not by this 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.830
 liabilities can be on the salon skis 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.240
 Basically the question how to ride a much 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.369
 it will be correct in terms of 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.290
 technology as far as it will bring you 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.050
 pleasure as you understand something 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.820
 will understand how to how to you 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.820
 what points what places on them 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.539
 be able to go in full say 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.610
 yes very limited answer refuse then 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.229
 There is a kind of collected to engage in but this is something 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.720
 same as i wanna walk nice 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.960
 let the track buy a universal beam well 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.399
 meaning like an idiot so waffles right 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.929
 with very strongly you 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.090
 I recommend immediately buy normal 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.729
 proton immediately buy on the growth immediately 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.490
 buy with progress immediately buy on 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.590
 the future is not necessary to think that there I am 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.509
 I buy and long only a meter 90 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.700
 it will be hard for them you will not be for them 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.890
 well that's right for them you will 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.770
 ok now let's see what 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.959
 still freeride skiing I share them 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.989
 into three global groups 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:09.580
 the first group is the so -called olya 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:12.610
 freeride carving and skiing 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.870
 they are often called freeride wagons 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:19.209
 This skis have become from 100 and with obvious 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.420
 carving geometry that is wide 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.900
 nose constriction rolled out of the extension on 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:30.610
 backdrop ah usually these skis 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:33.340
 soft enough they very much allow 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.430
 good ride longitudinal 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.260
 snow cutting 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.120
 give a very good reaction in turn 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.330
 very easy to make them sure 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.670
 turns but lose they lose 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.620
 they are in principle in lateral ascend and 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.660
 lateral slippage about the game then they 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.910
 on the trails 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.739
 really but how to start on 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.290
 The initial stage in my opinion is 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.970
 optimal solution because some 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.220
 easy solutions they allow to achieve 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.490
 get some definite clear 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.440
 reactions you 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.370
 understand you will feel on them 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.600
 surely they allow you to commit 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.070
 serious mistakes which 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.180
 the following categories are no longer better 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.130
 allow you to commit 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.140
 the next ski category is this 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.990
 draw an analogy with ms carving skis 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.670
 for slopes this is what i would say 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.070
 the giant ski category is skiing already with 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:26.300
 smaller geometry less clearly visible 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:29.110
 a little bit wider three geometries 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.060
 such a wide waist and already harder 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.240
 the harder they are needed for more 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.880
 aggressive skating for probably more 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.620
 speed skating 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.070
 so they are actually harder they give 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.480
 good excellent reactions on the longitudinal and 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.630
 cross- mix and because they are wider 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.850
 they allow you to ride more aggressively 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:54.980
 they allow more crap on corpses 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.750
 work out better naturally drops from 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.620
 cons because the party is still like 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:03.170
 chic skis with minuses they are more hard 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.210
 managed they require skill skills 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.820
 already 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:10.810
 they are more like let's say so heavy here 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:14.540
 in sensations until they are more such 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.940
 sullen yes and the third category of skis 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.010
 This here is gigantic to chigorin quite still 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:24.910
 Hardy has a bathroom that is even more 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:28.850
 hard skis are even more direct skis 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.010
 but this is quite such an aggression in pros 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.240
 who's here wet in a straight line there through 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.100
 all the stones that is it you do 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.170
 focused on speed skating on 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.710
 drop and this is the world freeride championship 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:42.410
 This downhill such skis of course you 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.600
 consider not and generally think about 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.910
 They do not need you in fact me too on 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.740
 I don't like these skis as if they are 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.750
 very sullen and they are very heavy they 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.540
 very yes they have their advantages on them 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.370
 wet in general is certainly gorgeous but but in 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.290
 Generally it is not for the tourist map no 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.540
 the sport you lowered as now 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.610
 choose size and width choose 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.130
 not even very important 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.450
 the length of the skis is not there not the width of the total area 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.270
 sliding surface up 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.400
 for heavier people there is such 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.480
 connection with weight to gain by the way 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.670
 none of our former has yet 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.810
 for heavier people need to take skis 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:21.390
 wider and winked at more area 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.980
 surfaces for lighter smaller 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.260
 naturally yes because well how would 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.960
 meaning no ski freeride we have 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.920
 the ratio of length and width I would I 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.590
 call like 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.930
 elongation of the ski track is you very 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.090
 wide but very short these skis are very 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.710
 maneuverable allow you to drive on very 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.520
 low speed getting good 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:45.480
 cross laugh that is technically but 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.860
 very good at driving fast in any way 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.900
 would be a speed ride that is it for 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.630
 some narrow moments of narrow 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.320
 spaces long skis may already be 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.560
 narrower 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.320
 I already call there somewhere waist 100 all 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.450
 that will give but in general, as it were not interested 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.370
 here is waist 100 115 is it possible to pass 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.550
 such medium widths and skies freeride and 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:08.370
 that's if you take them with a man weighs 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:12.570
 90 kilograms only better to take the length 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:15.900
 and there are 180 and more I advise you even to take 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:19.280
 190 in the area so 190 and considered 115 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:22.760
 if steel from 120 can be taken shorter 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.860
 can go along the length 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:28.620
 women, in principle, can take the same 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:31.230
 you are like men but a little shorter when 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.580
 Do not try to shorten them 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.830
 there is believe in my opinion here 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.660
 optimal patina with there skating which 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.720
 we all have access to this without a helicopter 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.070
 without any travel 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:46.950
 the best combination for women in my 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:52.770
 the look is 170-180 sacrifice 175-180 53 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:55.080
 waist from 100 to 115 110 beautiful skis 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.270
 then choose how you like yours 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.740
 glance first category or 2 if 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.930
 choose to progress much already 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:04.230
 know exactly what you want then take better 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:08.460
 certainly more straight skis tougher 

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:10.320
 and cut and how to get simple 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.720
 decisions results take more 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.530
 carving mines for width with narrow 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.770
 hoist 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:20.110
 that's basically everything but remember any 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.060
 case of not trying to give birth to free 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.780
 on from racial skiing it will only spoil 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:27.370
 you feeling will break you the whole picture and 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.960
 most likely you will have the wrong just 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.330
 view free radio is that such 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.159
 freeride about how anything from korea 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.379
 we can all you do not even like everything 

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:37.120
 the next series is already going to type and 

00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:39.099
 we start to take almost not to 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.060
 skip subscribe set like this 

00:07:39.099 --> 00:07:44.789
 bye everyone 

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.789
 I, too, for that's where
