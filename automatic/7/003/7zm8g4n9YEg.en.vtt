means that we're going to play the chord

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.359 
means that we're going to play the chord
one<00:01:36.630> half<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.350> tone<00:01:37.729> higher<00:01:38.729> end<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:41.100> 9th

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
and then go down to the C so we play C

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:56.780 
and then go down to the C so we play C
sharp<00:01:44.729> 9<00:01:45.860> c9<00:01:47.329> and<00:01:48.329> we<00:01:48.420> play<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.810> like<00:01:48.990> this

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
between here and our C sharp line you

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.900 
between here and our C sharp line you
can<00:02:29.019> do<00:02:29.230> a<00:02:29.470> little<00:02:29.830> piece<00:02:30.040> for<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.280> pentatonic

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
scale down to your C sharp so we get

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:54.809 
scale down to your C sharp so we get
this<00:02:51.239> okay<00:02:52.239> and<00:02:52.750> now<00:02:53.260> we've<00:02:53.470> reached<00:02:53.500> our<00:02:54.100> last
