hey<00:00:05.850> everybody<00:00:06.299> its<00:00:06.509> Jason<00:00:07.080> Blaha<00:00:07.379> here<00:00:07.649> and

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
hey everybody its Jason Blaha here and

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.280 
hey everybody its Jason Blaha here and
we're<00:00:08.250> at<00:00:08.429> part<00:00:08.790> five<00:00:09.030> at<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.450> Q<00:00:09.660> &amp;<00:00:09.780> A<00:00:09.840> so<00:00:09.900> let's

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
we're at part five at the Q &amp; A so let's

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.839 
we're at part five at the Q &amp; A so let's
get<00:00:10.530> it<00:00:10.679> done<00:00:10.860> right<00:00:11.639> question<00:00:13.580> barbell<00:00:14.580> rows

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
get it done right question barbell rows

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.349 
get it done right question barbell rows
versus<00:00:15.240> pen<00:00:15.509> lay<00:00:15.660> rows<00:00:15.900> strictly<00:00:16.619> for<00:00:16.920> mass<00:00:17.550> it

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
versus pen lay rows strictly for mass it

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.980 
versus pen lay rows strictly for mass it
sounds<00:00:18.630> pretty<00:00:18.869> simple<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.880> barbell<00:00:20.880> row<00:00:21.150> you

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
sounds pretty simple a barbell row you

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.290 
sounds pretty simple a barbell row you
use<00:00:22.199> more<00:00:22.439> muscle<00:00:22.769> groups<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.340> therefore<00:00:24.180> you

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
use more muscle groups and therefore you

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.230 
use more muscle groups and therefore you
can<00:00:24.480> use<00:00:24.510> more<00:00:24.960> weight<00:00:25.820> which<00:00:26.820> means<00:00:27.090> your

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
can use more weight which means your

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.790 
can use more weight which means your
conforms<00:00:27.750> gonna<00:00:27.900> be<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.050> little<00:00:28.289> sloppier<00:00:28.680> you

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
conforms gonna be a little sloppier you

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.050 
conforms gonna be a little sloppier you
can<00:00:28.949> cheat<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.279> weight<00:00:29.429> up<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.640> little<00:00:29.820> better

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
can cheat the weight up a little better

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.569 
can cheat the weight up a little better
and<00:00:30.269> then<00:00:30.599> have<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> heavier<00:00:31.500> negative<00:00:32.040> which

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
and then have a heavier negative which

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.150 
and then have a heavier negative which
is<00:00:32.730> going<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.059> produce<00:00:33.270> more<00:00:33.899> overall<00:00:34.800> muscle

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
is going to produce more overall muscle

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.910 
is going to produce more overall muscle
growth<00:00:35.460> at<00:00:35.730> least<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.329> theory<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:37.380> pen<00:00:37.680> lay

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
growth at least in theory the pen lay

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.090 
growth at least in theory the pen lay
row<00:00:38.450> puts<00:00:39.450> more<00:00:39.719> direct<00:00:40.140> isolation<00:00:40.860> on<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
row puts more direct isolation on the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.639 
row puts more direct isolation on the
primary<00:00:41.550> movers<00:00:41.989> there's<00:00:42.989> less<00:00:43.350> room<00:00:43.620> for

primary movers there's less room for

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.709 
primary movers there's less room for
cheating<00:00:44.550> it's<00:00:44.700> quite<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> strict<00:00:45.300> movement

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
cheating it's quite a strict movement

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.750 
cheating it's quite a strict movement
and<00:00:45.870> often<00:00:46.140> times<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.530> xscape<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.250> eccentric

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
and often times you xscape the eccentric

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.430 
and often times you xscape the eccentric
rep<00:00:48.000> you're<00:00:48.329> not<00:00:48.450> controlling<00:00:48.960> eccentric

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
rep you're not controlling eccentric

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.580 
rep you're not controlling eccentric
you're<00:00:49.559> letting<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.829> drawl<00:00:50.390> fairly<00:00:51.390> fast<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
you're letting it drawl fairly fast the

you're letting it drawl fairly fast the
pen<00:00:52.829> lay<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> great<00:00:53.960> explosive<00:00:54.960> power

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
pen lay is a great explosive power

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.520 
pen lay is a great explosive power
training<00:00:56.610> tool<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.660> great<00:00:57.960> strength

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
training tool is a great strength

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.130 
training tool is a great strength
training<00:00:58.980> tool<00:00:59.309> it's<00:01:00.000> still<00:01:00.449> good<00:01:00.690> for<00:01:00.899> mass

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
training tool it's still good for mass

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.100 
training tool it's still good for mass
but<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.890> feel<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.120> has<00:01:03.239> less<00:01:03.600> mass

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
but I feel that it has less mass

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.679 
but I feel that it has less mass
potential<00:01:04.890> than<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> conventional<00:01:06.000> barbell

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
potential than a conventional barbell

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.010 
potential than a conventional barbell
row<00:01:07.340> but<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.369> am<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> big<00:01:09.090> fan<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.689> pen<00:01:09.840> lay

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
row but I am a big fan of the pen lay

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.740 
row but I am a big fan of the pen lay
row<00:01:10.340> because<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.549> performance<00:01:12.090> aspects<00:01:12.630> I

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
row because of the performance aspects I

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.149 
row because of the performance aspects I
would<00:01:12.990> much<00:01:13.200> rather<00:01:13.229> have<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> strength

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
would much rather have a strength

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.880 
would much rather have a strength
athlete<00:01:14.670> doing<00:01:15.390> pin<00:01:15.720> lay<00:01:15.869> rows<00:01:16.140> than<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.590> would

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
athlete doing pin lay rows than I would

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.679 
athlete doing pin lay rows than I would
a<00:01:16.920> conventional<00:01:17.460> barbell<00:01:17.790> row<00:01:18.000> but<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.360> might

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
a conventional barbell row but I might

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.410 
a conventional barbell row but I might
push<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.560> competitive<00:01:20.490> bodybuilder<00:01:20.640> more<00:01:21.330> in

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
push a competitive bodybuilder more in

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.710 
push a competitive bodybuilder more in
the<00:01:21.479> direction<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.880> regular<00:01:23.880> 45<00:01:24.390> degree

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
the direction of the regular 45 degree

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.080 
the direction of the regular 45 degree
barbell<00:01:25.110> row<00:01:25.320> than<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.619> pin<00:01:25.740> lay<00:01:25.890> rail<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.909> for

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
barbell row than the pin lay rail so for

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.700 
barbell row than the pin lay rail so for
mass<00:01:27.270> I've<00:01:27.540> got<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.810> go<00:01:27.900> with<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.140> barbell<00:01:28.560> row

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
mass I've got to go with the barbell row

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.590 
mass I've got to go with the barbell row
for<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:29.130> pure<00:01:29.369> mass<00:01:29.520> all<00:01:30.270> right<00:01:30.390> next

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
for just pure mass all right next

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.719 
for just pure mass all right next
question<00:01:30.810> what<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.350> your<00:01:31.380> opinion<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:31.979> Olympic

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
question what is your opinion on Olympic

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.249 
question what is your opinion on Olympic
lifting<00:01:33.090> compared<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.540> powerlifting<00:01:34.110> it

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
lifting compared to powerlifting it

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.719 
lifting compared to powerlifting it
sounds<00:01:34.590> like<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.799> same<00:01:35.009> prince<00:01:35.280> will<00:01:35.520> lift

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
sounds like the same prince will lift

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.760 
sounds like the same prince will lift
heavy<00:01:36.210> but<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.540> Olympic<00:01:36.990> lifting<00:01:37.350> seems

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
heavy but the Olympic lifting seems

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.370 
heavy but the Olympic lifting seems
more<00:01:38.100> technical<00:01:38.840> anyways<00:01:39.840> would<00:01:40.079> love<00:01:40.259> to

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
more technical anyways would love to

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.100 
more technical anyways would love to
hear<00:01:40.530> your<00:01:40.740> opinion<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.810> honestly<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:42.960> is

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
hear your opinion on it honestly this is

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.999 
hear your opinion on it honestly this is
like<00:01:43.140> comparing<00:01:43.590> apples<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.220> Hajus<00:01:46.009> they're

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
like comparing apples to Hajus they're

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.249 
like comparing apples to Hajus they're
so<00:01:47.340> vastly<00:01:47.759> different<00:01:48.240> yeah<00:01:48.509> they<00:01:48.810> have

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
so vastly different yeah they have

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.420 
so vastly different yeah they have
weight<00:01:49.500> classes<00:01:50.210> you<00:01:51.210> have<00:01:51.860> heavy<00:01:52.860> lifts<00:01:53.340> they

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
weight classes you have heavy lifts they

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.819 
weight classes you have heavy lifts they
are<00:01:53.579> about<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.939> 1<00:01:54.329> rep<00:01:54.509> max<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:55.530> that's<00:01:55.710> what

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
are about a 1 rep max so that's what

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.560 
are about a 1 rep max so that's what
they<00:01:55.920> have<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.189> common<00:01:56.340> but<00:01:56.759> once<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.210> get

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
they have in common but once you get

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.850 
they have in common but once you get
past<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:58.520> these<00:01:59.520> two<00:01:59.909> sports<00:02:00.270> are<00:02:00.659> almost<00:02:01.619> as

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
past that these two sports are almost as

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.649 
past that these two sports are almost as
different<00:02:02.369> as<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.640> can<00:02:02.820> possibly<00:02:03.030> get

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
different as you can possibly get

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.870 
different as you can possibly get

them for Olympic lifting and they still

them for Olympic lifting and they still
may<00:03:16.900> very<00:03:17.230> well<00:03:17.470> get<00:03:17.709> their<00:03:17.829> ass<00:03:18.010> handed<00:03:18.040> to

Olympic lifter who maybe squats a

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
hundred less kilos in them just because

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:29.550 
hundred less kilos in them just because
his<00:03:25.870> technique<00:03:26.530> is<00:03:26.680> better<00:03:26.980> he<00:03:27.790> is<00:03:27.819> faster<00:03:28.569> and

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
his technique is better he is faster and

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.400 
his technique is better he is faster and
so<00:03:29.769> rahl<00:03:30.069> strength<00:03:30.579> alone<00:03:31.000> will<00:03:31.690> not<00:03:31.930> cut<00:03:32.260> it

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
to recomposition just a little bit and

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.539 
to recomposition just a little bit and
then<00:04:08.139> assess<00:04:08.470> from<00:04:08.620> there<00:04:08.889> if<00:04:09.010> you<00:04:09.130> need<00:04:09.310> to<00:04:09.430> go

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
then assess from there if you need to go

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.430

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
to do a slow cut for a little longer

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.949 
to do a slow cut for a little longer
trim<00:04:15.579> back<00:04:15.730> down<00:04:15.970> before<00:04:16.299> you<00:04:16.389> go<00:04:16.510> back<00:04:16.630> into<00:04:16.840> a

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
you're gonna have to end the bulk itself

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.310 
you're gonna have to end the bulk itself
and<00:04:21.820> if<00:04:22.000> you<00:04:22.090> go<00:04:22.270> right<00:04:22.479> into<00:04:22.690> a<00:04:22.810> cut<00:04:23.110> you're

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
what you want at that point and for most

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.190 
what you want at that point and for most
guys<00:04:27.700> a<00:04:27.760> strength<00:04:28.180> is<00:04:28.300> a<00:04:28.330> real<00:04:28.570> concern<00:04:28.780> go

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
guys a strength is a real concern go

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.690 
guys a strength is a real concern go
ahead<00:04:29.440> and<00:04:29.590> drop<00:04:29.740> down<00:04:29.920> to<00:04:30.070> maintenance<00:04:30.490> and

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
ahead and drop down to maintenance and

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.370 
ahead and drop down to maintenance and
just<00:04:30.790> recomposition<00:04:31.450> for<00:04:31.900> a<00:04:31.930> little<00:04:32.230> while

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
just recomposition for a little while

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.140 
just recomposition for a little while
before<00:04:32.680> you<00:04:33.040> decide<00:04:33.370> what<00:04:33.580> you<00:04:33.730> want<00:04:33.760> to<00:04:33.970> do

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
before you decide what you want to do

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.540 
before you decide what you want to do
because<00:04:35.020> if<00:04:35.260> you<00:04:35.380> are<00:04:35.530> training<00:04:35.889> for<00:04:36.220> strength

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
because if you are training for strength

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.460 
because if you are training for strength
it's<00:04:36.970> gonna<00:04:37.120> be<00:04:37.360> a<00:04:37.389> big<00:04:37.900> blow<00:04:38.260> to<00:04:38.290> you

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
it's gonna be a big blow to you

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.290 
it's gonna be a big blow to you
psychologically<00:04:39.280> when<00:04:39.430> you<00:04:39.520> go<00:04:39.700> into<00:04:39.850> a<00:04:39.940> cut

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
psychologically when you go into a cut

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.620 
psychologically when you go into a cut
particularly<00:04:41.200> if<00:04:41.260> you<00:04:41.320> try<00:04:41.470> to<00:04:41.530> cut<00:04:41.740> fast<00:04:42.630> so

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
particularly if you try to cut fast so

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.240 
particularly if you try to cut fast so
at<00:04:43.840> the<00:04:43.930> very<00:04:43.960> least<00:04:44.200> if<00:04:44.500> you<00:04:44.590> go<00:04:44.710> into<00:04:44.860> a<00:04:44.980> cut

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
at the very least if you go into a cut

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.310 
at the very least if you go into a cut
you<00:04:45.460> need<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:45.730> cut<00:04:45.940> very<00:04:46.360> very<00:04:46.690> slowly<00:04:47.020> as<00:04:47.230> a

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320

you need to cut very very slowly as a
strength<00:04:47.560> athlete<00:04:48.100> none<00:04:48.310> of<00:04:48.340> this<00:04:48.550> ten<00:04:49.450> pounds
