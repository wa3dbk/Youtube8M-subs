but<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.399> does<00:00:41.550> give<00:00:41.700> us<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.910> one-nil<00:00:42.270> lead

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
but it does give us a one-nil lead

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.110 
but it does give us a one-nil lead
however<00:00:43.170> almost<00:00:43.530> instantly<00:00:44.309> he<00:00:44.730> manages<00:00:45.059> to

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
however almost instantly he manages to

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.000 
however almost instantly he manages to

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
their keeper probably could have done a

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.970

but because we still had some bronzes
left<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.329> thought<00:01:39.840> some<00:01:40.079> people<00:01:40.200> might<00:01:40.500> get<00:01:40.650> a

left I thought some people might get a
little<00:01:40.890> bit<00:01:41.040> pissed<00:01:41.310> off<00:01:41.490> maybe<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:42.420> we<00:01:42.600> was

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
not doing it systematically I suppose

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.670 
not doing it systematically I suppose
you<00:01:45.149> could<00:01:45.299> say<00:01:45.450> well<00:01:45.930> as<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.320> see<00:01:46.470> we<00:01:46.649> are
