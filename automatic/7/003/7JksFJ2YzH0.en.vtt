00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
skin and out of my pores and so again

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.780 
skin and out of my pores and so again

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
this is vibrating at a pretty high

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.390 
this is vibrating at a pretty high
frequency<00:02:25.660> so<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.530> can't<00:02:26.860> even<00:02:27.010> see<00:02:27.130> it

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
frequency so you can't even see it

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.040 
frequency so you can't even see it
vibrating<00:02:27.910> but<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.150> can<00:02:28.270> definitely<00:02:28.690> feel<00:02:28.989> it

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
vibrating but you can definitely feel it

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.880 
vibrating but you can definitely feel it

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
and all this is doing is just getting

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.180 
and all this is doing is just getting
all<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.220> crud<00:02:34.180> off<00:02:34.480> it's<00:02:34.870> helping<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.650> unclog

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
all the crud off it's helping to unclog

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.710

it's a great way to exfoliate without

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.940 
it's a great way to exfoliate without
over<00:03:00.209> stimulating<00:03:01.209> your<00:03:01.599> oil<00:03:01.870> glands<00:03:02.680> which

great job of exfoliating the skin and

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.750 
great job of exfoliating the skin and
then<00:03:41.319> this<00:03:41.500> other<00:03:41.739> button<00:03:42.010> if<00:03:42.280> you<00:03:42.370> see<00:03:42.580> there

then this other button if you see there

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.910 
then this other button if you see there
I<00:03:42.790> just<00:03:43.030> pushed<00:03:43.300> it<00:03:43.480> in<00:03:43.569> this<00:03:43.629> red<00:03:43.989> after<00:03:44.620> you

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
I just pushed it in this red after you

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.640 
I just pushed it in this red after you
put<00:03:45.190> on<00:03:45.220> your<00:03:45.519> serum<00:03:46.000> you<00:03:46.540> turn<00:03:46.930> it<00:03:47.170> over<00:03:47.349> like

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
put on your serum you turn it over like

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.740 
put on your serum you turn it over like
that<00:03:47.830> and<00:03:48.370> it<00:03:48.550> helps<00:03:48.879> the<00:03:49.000> product<00:03:49.269> to

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
that and it helps the product to

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.250 
that and it helps the product to
penetrate<00:03:50.349> into<00:03:50.620> your<00:03:51.370> skin<00:03:51.989> isn't<00:03:52.989> that

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
penetrate into your skin isn't that

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.860 
penetrate into your skin isn't that
great<00:03:53.470> and<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:54.760> can<00:03:54.909> literally<00:03:55.209> hear<00:03:55.599> it<00:03:55.750> you

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
great and you can literally hear it you

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.809 
great and you can literally hear it you
can<00:03:56.050> hear<00:03:56.080> it<00:03:56.440> out<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.890> vibrations<00:03:57.580> you

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
can hear it out the vibrations you

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.089 
can hear it out the vibrations you
obviously<00:03:58.239> can't<00:03:58.480> hear<00:03:58.659> now<00:03:58.900> I<00:03:59.200> should

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
obviously can't hear now I should

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.300 
obviously can't hear now I should
probably<00:04:00.250> turn<00:04:00.580> the<00:04:00.700> water<00:04:00.909> off<00:04:02.010> did<00:04:03.010> you<00:04:03.099> hear

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
probably turn the water off did you hear

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.949 
probably turn the water off did you hear
the<00:04:03.430> water<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:03.940> whole<00:04:04.090> time<00:04:04.299> I<00:04:04.330> bet<00:04:04.599> you<00:04:04.720> could

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
the water the whole time I bet you could

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.339 
the water the whole time I bet you could
it<00:04:05.110> was<00:04:05.290> probably<00:04:05.849> drowning<00:04:06.849> me<00:04:07.000> out<00:04:07.349> so

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
it was probably drowning me out so

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.710 
it was probably drowning me out so
anyway<00:04:08.680> once<00:04:09.159> you<00:04:09.250> put<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.489> serum<00:04:09.730> on<00:04:09.879> can<00:04:10.629> you

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
anyway once you put the serum on can you

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.940 
anyway once you put the serum on can you
hear<00:04:10.900> that<00:04:11.970> you<00:04:12.970> probably<00:04:13.330> can

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
hear that you probably can

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.229 
hear that you probably can
you<00:04:14.950> can<00:04:15.069> probably<00:04:15.250> also<00:04:15.610> hear<00:04:15.760> my<00:04:15.849> toilet

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
you can probably also hear my toilet

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.520 
you can probably also hear my toilet
running<00:04:16.419> because<00:04:16.629> I<00:04:16.780> need<00:04:16.989> to<00:04:17.079> get<00:04:17.199> it<00:04:17.319> fixed

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
running because I need to get it fixed

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.049 
running because I need to get it fixed
so<00:04:18.720> there<00:04:19.720> you<00:04:19.840> go<00:04:19.989> that's<00:04:20.499> it<00:04:20.829> and<00:04:21.639> that<00:04:21.879> helps

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:22.059 
so there you go that's it and that helps

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:24.600 
so there you go that's it and that helps
