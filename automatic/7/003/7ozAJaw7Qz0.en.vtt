00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.820
 it's a big institution in football 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.800
 but it also has conflicts and 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.990
 all over the world descents of 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.480
 great teams and soccer follows 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.070
 so I think that they already 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.230
 it will touch solve your problems 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.070
 We are focused on doing our 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.290
 I work on trying to get points and 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.170
 look for salvation that is weird not 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.239
 because as you say it's a big one it's 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.550
 someone who is always fighting 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:45.170
 titles but good I do not know the 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.760
 situation why is it I think if I 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.230
 can affect Mexican soccer a bit 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:54.059
 but this one I say soccer follows 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.860
 descended ribera the juve descended 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.989
 then nothing happens not, it's not over 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.720
 there as I repeat to you they will have their 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.160
 conflicts they will have their solutions 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.110
 we are focused on lions 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.080
 blacks in trying to save the team in 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.210
 to keep working in the follow 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.690
 improving to meet the 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.690
 objectives 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.950
 I can talk to you for my team 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.740
 we have been working well is 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.570
 true that we have an improvement but not 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.969
 we have achieved nothing we do not have to continue 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.720
 fighting the good chivas has its 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:36.630
 conflicts has its problems I think that 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.610
 we have to worry about doing 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.860
 good is all our work 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.360
 equal for what chivas means so 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.460
 that moves chivas good because the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.560
 comparison or that we're fighting the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.509
 decline but we in our struggle 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.610
 it's not against chivas or against people 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.799
 against veracruz our percentage is 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.209
 more volatile then our problem 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.310
 our conflict is ourselves 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:58.470
 while we are winning and 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.209
 let's get points , it's not going to be 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.399
 simply chivas or puebla and they 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:03.959
 are going to commission then I think the 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.060
 morbo or whoever is chiva has 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:09.060
 involved then if it attracts you more and you 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.660
 pull more morbid more be more 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.660
 conflict 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.280
 we see ourselves doing a good 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.989
 equal match every match there is that 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.930
 play it is from one as a player wants 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.359
 not those matches 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.180
 aside from that it's the descent because 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:36.790
 because good for us does not define it 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.709
 not because we said yes if we win this and 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.569
 we lose all the others descend on us 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.849
 or if you lose this and win all the 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.590
 others save the category not for 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.780
 we are one more final because 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.139
 we have been playing since the date 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.969
 1 all the finals not then if you 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:54.010
 visualize and visualize yourself gaining 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:55.719
 doing a good game and I tell you 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.340
 improving so that not to be 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:03:00.579
 simply above them be up 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.879
 Village of Veracruz and a little step to 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.879
 objective
