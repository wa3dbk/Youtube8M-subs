string formerly string go to the fifth

00:01:50.220 --> 00:02:21.170 
string formerly string go to the fifth
of<00:01:50.400> be<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.580> man

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.350 

you

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.130 

what<00:02:29.360> I<00:02:29.390> do<00:02:29.540> normally<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:31.010> note<00:02:31.840> which<00:02:32.840> is<00:02:33.020> an

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
what I do normally the note which is an

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.050 
what I do normally the note which is an
F<00:02:33.320> so<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.310> third<00:02:34.580> on<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.320> low<00:02:36.320> D<00:02:36.500> string<00:02:37.060> that

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
F so the third on the low D string that

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.450 
F so the third on the low D string that
should<00:02:38.780> be<00:02:38.930> vibrated<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.620> little<00:02:40.040> bit<00:02:40.190> to<00:02:40.340> keep

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
should be vibrated a little bit to keep

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:55.190 
should be vibrated a little bit to keep
it<00:02:40.610> that<00:02:40.640> feels

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:04.940

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:50.640 
index finger then behind the fit of note
so<00:05:35.810> again<00:05:36.080> this<00:05:36.229> part

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650
