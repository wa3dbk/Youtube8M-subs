00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
so far away from the equator on tropic

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:16.170 
so far away from the equator on tropic
of<00:02:04.510> cancer<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:05.230> United<00:02:05.980> States<00:02:10.980> -<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:15.180> there

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180
