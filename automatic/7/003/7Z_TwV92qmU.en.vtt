00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
my first impression of the butter

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.319 
my first impression of the butter
glosses<00:01:30.960> are<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:32.070> they<00:01:32.310> um<00:01:32.640> they<00:01:33.210> don't

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
glosses are that they um they don't

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:42.140 
glosses are that they um they don't
really<00:01:33.630> come<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:35.960> not<00:01:36.960> take<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.350> back<00:01:41.150> okay

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
really come in not take that back okay

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.969 
really come in not take that back okay
so<00:01:42.210> my<00:01:42.450> first<00:01:42.630> impressions<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.649> butter

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
so my first impressions of the butter

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.480 
so my first impressions of the butter
glosses<00:01:44.310> are<00:01:44.810> they<00:01:45.810> do<00:01:45.869> fill<00:01:46.710> buttery<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
glosses are they do fill buttery on the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.899 
glosses are they do fill buttery on the
skin<00:01:47.850> they<00:01:48.840> are<00:01:49.049> not<00:01:49.380> as<00:01:49.649> pigmented<00:01:50.549> as<00:01:50.700> I

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
skin they are not as pigmented as I

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.550 
skin they are not as pigmented as I
would<00:01:51.090> have<00:01:51.210> liked<00:01:51.509> they<00:01:51.960> are<00:01:52.079> definitely

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
would have liked they are definitely

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.969 
would have liked they are definitely
very<00:01:53.009> very<00:01:53.100> sheer<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.970> was<00:01:54.390> thinking<00:01:54.869> um<00:01:55.259> like

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
very very sheer I was thinking um like

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.649 
very very sheer I was thinking um like
when<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.189> look<00:01:56.399> at<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.909> colors<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.420> they

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
when you look at the colors that they

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.020 
when you look at the colors that they
