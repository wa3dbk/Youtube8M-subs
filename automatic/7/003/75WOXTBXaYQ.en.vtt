class<00:00:38.720> setup<00:00:39.140> for<00:00:39.290> you<00:00:39.379> guys<00:00:39.559> first<00:00:40.250> of<00:00:40.430> all

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
class setup for you guys first of all

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.250 
class setup for you guys first of all
the<00:00:40.670> vector<00:00:41.090> one<00:00:41.300> of<00:00:41.390> its<00:00:41.510> strong<00:00:41.809> points<00:00:41.840> is

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
the vector one of its strong points is

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.020 
the vector one of its strong points is
the<00:00:42.379> fact<00:00:42.620> that<00:00:42.739> it<00:00:42.890> is<00:00:43.070> a<00:00:43.100> very<00:00:43.700> accurate

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
the fact that it is a very accurate

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.880 
the fact that it is a very accurate
weapon<00:00:44.510> it's<00:00:45.079> one<00:00:45.230> of<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:45.410> most<00:00:45.620> accurate

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
weapon it's one of the most accurate

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.279 
weapon it's one of the most accurate
smgs<00:00:46.670> in<00:00:46.850> call<00:00:47.239> duty<00:00:47.420> ghosts<00:00:47.719> at<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:47.960> moment

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
smgs in call duty ghosts at the moment

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:49.690 
smgs in call duty ghosts at the moment
so<00:00:48.530> you<00:00:48.590> really<00:00:48.920> want<00:00:49.070> to<00:00:49.129> take<00:00:49.219> advantage<00:00:49.489> of

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
so you really want to take advantage of

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.819 
so you really want to take advantage of
that<00:00:49.820> accuracy<00:00:50.329> and<00:00:50.600> even<00:00:50.930> improve<00:00:51.140> upon<00:00:51.590> it

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
that accuracy and even improve upon it

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.799 
that accuracy and even improve upon it
to<00:00:52.340> make<00:00:52.520> it<00:00:52.550> just<00:00:52.850> like<00:00:53.000> the<00:00:53.239> best<00:00:53.510> most

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
to make it just like the best most

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.470 
to make it just like the best most
accurate<00:00:54.379> SMG<00:00:54.949> in<00:00:55.129> the<00:00:55.250> game<00:00:55.489> so<00:00:56.270> if<00:00:56.420> that

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
accurate SMG in the game so if that

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.330 
accurate SMG in the game so if that
being<00:00:56.870> said<00:00:57.170> we're<00:00:57.440> going<00:00:57.559> to<00:00:57.649> discuss<00:00:58.129> the

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
being said we're going to discuss the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.610 
being said we're going to discuss the
best<00:00:58.550> way<00:00:58.640> to<00:00:58.789> set<00:00:59.059> this<00:00:59.210> up<00:00:59.449> so<00:00:59.780> the<00:01:00.320> first

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
best way to set this up so the first

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.290 
best way to set this up so the first
attachment<00:01:00.949> that<00:01:01.250> I<00:01:01.309> use<00:01:01.489> on<00:01:01.520> the<00:01:01.789> vector<00:01:02.149> is

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
attachment that I use on the vector is

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.240 
attachment that I use on the vector is
going<00:01:02.480> to<00:01:02.539> be<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:02.899> foregrip<00:01:03.379> attachment<00:01:03.980> it

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
going to be the foregrip attachment it

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.190 
going to be the foregrip attachment it
gives<00:01:04.430> it<00:01:04.550> noticeably<00:01:05.000> less<00:01:05.300> recoil<00:01:05.660> and

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
gives it noticeably less recoil and

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.840 
gives it noticeably less recoil and
makes<00:01:06.560> it<00:01:06.680> a<00:01:06.710> much<00:01:06.979> more<00:01:07.220> accurate<00:01:07.430> weapon

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
makes it a much more accurate weapon

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.210 
makes it a much more accurate weapon
with<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.240> vector<00:01:08.720> having<00:01:09.080> this<00:01:09.259> extra<00:01:09.440> bump

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
with the vector having this extra bump

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.730 
with the vector having this extra bump
in<00:01:10.490> accuracy<00:01:11.270> allows<00:01:11.720> you<00:01:11.929> to<00:01:12.050> take<00:01:12.289> gunfights

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
in accuracy allows you to take gunfights

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.770 
in accuracy allows you to take gunfights
that<00:01:12.950> you<00:01:13.039> want<00:01:13.250> it<00:01:13.340> normally<00:01:13.729> from<00:01:14.270> medium

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
that you want it normally from medium

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.359 
that you want it normally from medium
range<00:01:15.050> and<00:01:15.289> actually<00:01:15.649> try<00:01:15.770> to<00:01:15.860> take<00:01:16.160> some

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
range and actually try to take some

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.040 
range and actually try to take some
shots<00:01:16.580> and<00:01:16.880> take<00:01:17.179> someone<00:01:17.450> from<00:01:17.479> a<00:01:17.660> distance

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
shots and take someone from a distance

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.320 
shots and take someone from a distance
now<00:01:18.170> of<00:01:18.530> course<00:01:18.860> since<00:01:19.160> it<00:01:19.280> is<00:01:19.399> an<00:01:19.580> SMG<00:01:19.940> I<00:01:20.149> would

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
now of course since it is an SMG I would

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.790 
now of course since it is an SMG I would
recommend<00:01:20.599> that<00:01:20.840> if<00:01:20.990> you<00:01:21.110> are<00:01:21.289> trying<00:01:21.560> to<00:01:21.619> pick

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
recommend that if you are trying to pick

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.589 
recommend that if you are trying to pick
someone<00:01:22.009> off<00:01:22.190> in<00:01:22.340> a<00:01:22.399> medium<00:01:22.759> distance<00:01:23.179> that

00:01:23.589 --> 00:01:23.599 
someone off in a medium distance that

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:24.969 
someone off in a medium distance that
you<00:01:23.630> of<00:01:23.810> course<00:01:23.990> make<00:01:24.259> sure<00:01:24.440> that<00:01:24.619> you<00:01:24.740> are<00:01:24.890> the

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
you of course make sure that you are the

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.290 
you of course make sure that you are the
first<00:01:25.190> person<00:01:25.280> to<00:01:25.550> shoot<00:01:25.880> don't<00:01:26.090> try<00:01:26.240> to

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
first person to shoot don't try to

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.730 
first person to shoot don't try to
engage<00:01:26.630> someone<00:01:26.899> who's<00:01:27.110> using<00:01:27.289> an<00:01:27.470> assault

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
engage someone who's using an assault

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.410 
engage someone who's using an assault
rifle<00:01:27.800> if<00:01:28.429> you<00:01:28.550> see<00:01:28.700> someone<00:01:28.910> who's<00:01:29.119> running

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.190 
across the room and you're in a medium
distance<00:01:31.490> then<00:01:32.000> by<00:01:32.119> all<00:01:32.149> means<00:01:32.300> you<00:01:32.929> got<00:01:33.080> the

foregrip attachment on the vector you're

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.680 
foregrip attachment on the vector you're
going<00:01:34.700> to<00:01:34.759> be<00:01:34.849> able<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:35.060> pick<00:01:35.209> them<00:01:35.330> off<00:01:35.479> rather

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
going to be able to pick them off rather

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.449 
going to be able to pick them off rather
easily<00:01:35.959> not<00:01:36.619> have<00:01:36.739> a<00:01:36.800> lot<00:01:36.950> of<00:01:36.979> trouble<00:01:37.369> with

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:37.459 
easily not have a lot of trouble with

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:39.550 
easily not have a lot of trouble with
the<00:01:37.580> recoil<00:01:38.000> especially<00:01:38.660> since<00:01:39.080> you<00:01:39.170> have

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
the recoil especially since you have

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.880 
the recoil especially since you have
that<00:01:39.739> extra<00:01:40.340> added<00:01:40.910> accuracy<00:01:41.630> with<00:01:41.810> the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
that extra added accuracy with the

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.080 
that extra added accuracy with the
foregrip<00:01:42.890> attachment<00:01:43.489> now<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.729> second

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
foregrip attachment now the second

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.370 
foregrip attachment now the second
attachment<00:01:44.330> that<00:01:44.630> I<00:01:44.690> recommend<00:01:44.989> that<00:01:45.229> you<00:01:45.349> use

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
attachment that I recommend that you use

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.410 
attachment that I recommend that you use
is<00:01:45.800> the<00:01:46.009> silencer<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:47.060> want<00:01:47.239> to<00:01:47.300> make<00:01:47.390> sure

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
is the silencer you want to make sure

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.570 
is the silencer you want to make sure
that<00:01:47.750> using<00:01:48.080> the<00:01:48.170> silencer<00:01:48.679> so<00:01:48.890> you<00:01:49.039> take<00:01:49.429> out

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
that using the silencer so you take out

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.400 
that using the silencer so you take out
a<00:01:49.610> group<00:01:49.819> of<00:01:49.970> three<00:01:50.209> people<00:01:50.390> as<00:01:50.869> opposed<00:01:51.259> to

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
a group of three people as opposed to

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.559 
a group of three people as opposed to
killing<00:01:51.830> one<00:01:52.069> person<00:01:52.099> alerting<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.119> next<00:01:53.390> two

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
killing one person alerting the next two

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:55.749 
killing one person alerting the next two
since<00:01:54.140> it<00:01:54.289> is<00:01:54.380> an<00:01:54.530> SMG<00:01:54.890> even<00:01:55.459> though<00:01:55.580> the

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
since it is an SMG even though the

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.370 
since it is an SMG even though the
silencer<00:01:56.209> does<00:01:56.420> kind<00:01:56.599> of<00:01:56.660> take<00:01:56.720> a<00:01:56.899> little<00:01:57.229> bit

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
silencer does kind of take a little bit

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.410 
silencer does kind of take a little bit
off<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.770> range<00:01:58.039> and<00:01:58.220> you<00:01:58.759> know<00:01:58.849> makes<00:01:59.119> it<00:01:59.270> less

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
off the range and you know makes it less

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.809 
off the range and you know makes it less
effective<00:01:59.929> at<00:02:00.140> a<00:02:00.349> more<00:02:00.649> medium<00:02:01.310> range<00:02:01.550> it's

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
effective at a more medium range it's

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.119 
effective at a more medium range it's
still<00:02:02.119> a<00:02:02.360> great<00:02:02.599> option<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:03.050> use<00:02:03.349> because<00:02:03.800> most

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:04.129 
still a great option to use because most

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:05.830 
still a great option to use because most
of<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.340> time<00:02:04.580> when<00:02:04.759> you're<00:02:04.879> using<00:02:05.060> an<00:02:05.239> SMG<00:02:05.539> you

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
of the time when you're using an SMG you

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.479 
of the time when you're using an SMG you
should<00:02:06.080> be<00:02:06.170> on<00:02:06.289> small<00:02:06.590> maps<00:02:06.860> and<00:02:07.129> you're<00:02:07.399> going

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
should be on small maps and you're going

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:09.520 
should be on small maps and you're going
to<00:02:07.610> be<00:02:07.670> able<00:02:07.700> to<00:02:07.970> take<00:02:08.149> out<00:02:08.270> the<00:02:08.390> enemy<00:02:08.530> two

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
to be able to take out the enemy two

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.839 
to be able to take out the enemy two

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
three in a row without them even

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.400 
three in a row without them even
noticing<00:02:11.390> what's<00:02:11.540> going<00:02:11.780> on<00:02:11.900> because<00:02:12.110> they're

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
noticing what's going on because they're

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.170 
noticing what's going on because they're
not<00:02:12.560> hearing<00:02:12.950> any<00:02:13.069> gunshots<00:02:13.580> are<00:02:13.730> seeing<00:02:14.000> any

muzzle flash etc for this weapon class
setup<00:02:17.630> I<00:02:17.750> actually<00:02:17.900> decided<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.470> forego

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
setup I actually decided to forego

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.900 
setup I actually decided to forego
having<00:02:19.130> a<00:02:19.370> grenade

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
having a grenade

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.490 
having a grenade
actually<00:02:20.300> just<00:02:20.420> have<00:02:20.600> a<00:02:20.630> secondary<00:02:21.230> there

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
actually just have a secondary there

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.840 
actually just have a secondary there
might<00:02:21.620> be<00:02:21.650> times<00:02:21.950> where<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.310> run<00:02:22.460> out<00:02:22.610> of<00:02:22.640> ammo

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
might be times where you run out of ammo

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.250 
might be times where you run out of ammo
with<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.240> vector<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:23.810> have<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:24.020> quickly

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
with the vector and you have to quickly

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.870 
with the vector and you have to quickly
switch<00:02:24.530> out<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.950> a<00:02:25.010> pistol<00:02:25.400> or<00:02:25.490> something

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
switch out to a pistol or something

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.970 
switch out to a pistol or something
especially<00:02:26.630> if<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:26.840> are<00:02:26.870> maybe<00:02:27.230> just<00:02:27.680> one

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
especially if you are maybe just one

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.710 
especially if you are maybe just one
kill<00:02:28.220> away<00:02:28.250> from<00:02:28.670> your<00:02:28.820> next<00:02:29.120> kill<00:02:29.330> streak<00:02:29.570> and

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
kill away from your next kill streak and

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.970 
kill away from your next kill streak and
you<00:02:29.780> don't<00:02:29.960> want<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.200> die<00:02:30.380> it<00:02:30.440> would<00:02:30.620> be<00:02:30.770> such<00:02:30.950> a

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
you don't want to die it would be such a

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.550 
you don't want to die it would be such a
horrible<00:02:31.700> waste<00:02:31.940> so<00:02:32.570> of<00:02:32.780> course<00:02:32.960> I<00:02:33.170> recommend

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
horrible waste so of course I recommend

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.050 
horrible waste so of course I recommend
that<00:02:33.590> you<00:02:33.680> have<00:02:33.980> any<00:02:34.190> pistol<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:34.790> this<00:02:34.880> one
