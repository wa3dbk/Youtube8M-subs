this video of course absorbs all those
chemicals<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:56.640> that's<00:01:57.180> what's<00:01:57.750> going<00:01:57.960> on

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
chemicals and and that's what's going on

right now with a bubbling I just added
this<00:02:01.409> tap<00:02:01.680> water<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.490> bubbling<00:02:03.000> means

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
this tap water and that bubbling means

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.330 
this tap water and that bubbling means
it's<00:02:04.229> purifying<00:02:04.770> it's<00:02:05.219> working<00:02:05.670> its<00:02:06.479> magic<00:02:07.340> so

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
it's purifying it's working its magic so

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.430 
it's purifying it's working its magic so
like<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.789> was<00:02:08.879> saying<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.360> absorbs<00:02:09.869> chemicals

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
like I was saying it absorbs chemicals

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.440 
like I was saying it absorbs chemicals
like<00:02:10.830> chlorine<00:02:10.910> anything<00:02:11.910> else<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.270> water

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
like chlorine anything else the water

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.479 
like chlorine anything else the water
throw<00:02:12.750> that

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
throw that

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.130

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
adds the minerals at the oil and it

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.110 
adds the minerals at the oil and it
