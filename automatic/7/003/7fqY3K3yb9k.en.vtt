 vision race his intervention was 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.760
 fundamental not only to find you a 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.350
 home to vinti but also a family 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.390
 that could pay their expensive expenses 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.810
 doctors when he was running out of 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.140
 weather 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.950

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.000
 lidÃ³n hoffman and his daughters bean and sophie 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.880
 had not yet recovered from the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.030
 loss of one of his vice vision who 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:13.290
 he died unexpectedly it was very traumatic 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.230
 and it was not easy to get over it but the girls 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.040
 they suffered a lot the wifi took us 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.200
 enough time to be able to accept it every time 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.080
 I felt very sad because I saw myself 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.810
 he always played with us and barked 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.900
 a lot and that seemed very fun and 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.430
 in me too for the hoffman adopt 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.890
 a rescued dog was an opportunity 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.750
 to show their daughters the process 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.980
 and teach them the responsibility that 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.349
 it implies to have a pet 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.780
 and they understand that there are many dogs 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.280
 in pet stores and that always 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.860
 you can go buy the perfect dog 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.510
 but that's not the only option sometimes 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.390
 it is better to rescue a dog from a 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.489
 donald refuge contacted robyn 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.370

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.200
 view 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.120
 but that was not the end of the story 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.159
 because vinti needed help needed 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.049
 grow for another 8 weeks and then 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.640
