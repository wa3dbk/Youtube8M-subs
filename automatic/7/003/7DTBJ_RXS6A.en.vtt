I'm doing this Bible study
just<00:00:28.460> basically<00:00:28.850> kind<00:00:29.330> of<00:00:29.540> leaning<00:00:30.320> on<00:00:30.500> him

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
just basically kind of leaning on him

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.910 
just basically kind of leaning on him
like<00:00:31.010> I<00:00:31.220> should<00:00:31.850> have<00:00:31.970> been<00:00:32.119> before<00:00:32.390> and

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
like I should have been before and

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.189 
like I should have been before and
