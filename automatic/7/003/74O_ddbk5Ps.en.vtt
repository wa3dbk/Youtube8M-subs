regarde<00:00:00.359> steps<00:00:00.630> on<00:00:00.780> how<00:00:00.900> to<00:00:00.960> replace<00:00:01.290> a<00:00:01.380> sump

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
regarde steps on how to replace a sump

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.789 
regarde steps on how to replace a sump
pump<00:00:02.070> and<00:00:02.280> in<00:00:02.879> this<00:00:02.970> case<00:00:03.240> we<00:00:03.510> have<00:00:03.810> a<00:00:04.170> radon

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
pump and in this case we have a radon

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.130 
pump and in this case we have a radon
mitigation<00:00:05.310> system<00:00:06.000> so<00:00:06.180> you<00:00:06.240> have<00:00:06.330> a<00:00:06.480> two<00:00:06.930> inch

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
mitigation system so you have a two inch

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.799 
mitigation system so you have a two inch
vent<00:00:07.440> for<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.250> radon<00:00:08.700> gas<00:00:08.730> which<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.540> pumped

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
vent for the radon gas which is pumped

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.780 
vent for the radon gas which is pumped
out<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.139> house<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.679> then<00:00:11.280> we<00:00:11.400> have<00:00:11.610> an

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
out of the house and then we have an

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.580 
out of the house and then we have an
inch<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.330> half<00:00:12.360> discharge<00:00:13.019> pipe<00:00:13.349> that's

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
inch and a half discharge pipe that's

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.140 
inch and a half discharge pipe that's
going<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.769> be<00:00:13.830> connected<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.639> sump<00:00:14.910> pump

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
going to be connected to the sump pump

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.200 
going to be connected to the sump pump
and<00:00:15.330> these<00:00:16.049> lids<00:00:16.350> are<00:00:16.680> actually<00:00:17.220> closed<00:00:17.789> and

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
and these lids are actually closed and

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.760 
and these lids are actually closed and
locked<00:00:18.539> in<00:00:18.840> place<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.439> you're<00:00:19.619> going<00:00:19.740> to

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
locked in place so you're going to

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.890 
locked in place so you're going to
remove<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.220> screws<00:00:20.609> all<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.240> way<00:00:21.390> around<00:00:21.720> the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
remove the screws all the way around the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.720 
remove the screws all the way around the
top<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.410> then<00:00:23.010> we're<00:00:23.130> going<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.279> have<00:00:23.400> rubber

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
top and then we're going to have rubber

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.849 
top and then we're going to have rubber
gaskets<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:24.660> are<00:00:25.080> sealing<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
gaskets that are sealing in the

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.490 
gaskets that are sealing in the
electrical<00:00:26.670> cords<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.300> then<00:00:27.900> both<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.230> these

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
electrical cords and then both of these

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.000 
electrical cords and then both of these
pipes

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
pipes

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.700 
pipes
so<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.670> first<00:00:29.910> step<00:00:30.090> I've<00:00:30.840> already<00:00:31.199> taken<00:00:31.410> out

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
so the first step I've already taken out

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.160 
so the first step I've already taken out
all<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.489> screws<00:00:32.790> now<00:00:33.480> I'm<00:00:33.630> going<00:00:33.930> to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
all of the screws now I'm going to

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.119 
all of the screws now I'm going to
disconnect<00:00:34.770> all<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.250> rubber<00:00:35.550> gaskets

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
disconnect all of the rubber gaskets

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.470 
disconnect all of the rubber gaskets
next<00:00:38.129> thing<00:00:38.219> I'm<00:00:38.340> going<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.550> do<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.030> unplug

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
next thing I'm going to do is I unplug

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.450 
next thing I'm going to do is I unplug
the<00:00:39.750> unit<00:00:40.290> itself<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.980> I'm<00:00:41.129> going<00:00:41.430> to

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460

that<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.120> disconnected<00:00:48.120> with<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.239> pipe<00:00:48.510> wrench

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
that I disconnected with a pipe wrench

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.840 
that I disconnected with a pipe wrench
or<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.469> may<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.890> check<00:00:50.190> valve<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.789> has

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.060 
hose clamps that you're going to need to
unscrew<00:00:53.719> once<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.809> unscrew<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.289> nut<00:00:55.559> it

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
unscrew once you unscrew that nut it

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.270 
unscrew once you unscrew that nut it
just<00:00:56.489> separates<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.030> easy<00:00:57.890> so<00:00:58.890> now<00:00:59.010> I'm<00:00:59.100> just

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
just separates that easy so now I'm just

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.250 
just separates that easy so now I'm just
going<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.579> take<00:00:59.850> off<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.239> rubber<00:01:00.449> gasket<00:01:01.079> that

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
going to take off the rubber gasket that

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.070 
going to take off the rubber gasket that
holds<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.980> electrical<00:01:02.670> cords<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.090> place<00:01:03.390> and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
holds the electrical cords in place and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.649 
holds the electrical cords in place and
I<00:01:04.379> loosened<00:01:04.860> there<00:01:05.250> were<00:01:05.400> four<00:01:06.270> screws<00:01:06.630> on

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
I loosened there were four screws on

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.640 
I loosened there were four screws on
this<00:01:07.320> rubber<00:01:08.189> seal<00:01:08.549> here<00:01:09.170> before<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.260> radon

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
this rubber seal here before the radon

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.080 
this rubber seal here before the radon
and<00:01:11.010> I'll<00:01:11.189> just<00:01:11.369> pull<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.640> out<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.909> place

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
and I'll just pull this out of place

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.510 
and I'll just pull this out of place
sometimes<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.689> may<00:01:12.900> have<00:01:13.340> silicone<00:01:14.340> that

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
sometimes you may have silicone that

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.980 
sometimes you may have silicone that
holds<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:14.939> place<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.540> just<00:01:15.659> have<00:01:15.930> to

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
holds it in place so you just have to

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.960 
holds it in place so you just have to
use<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> razor<00:01:16.530> knife<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:17.070> cut<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.460> free<00:01:17.759> and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
use a razor knife to cut that free and

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.170 
use a razor knife to cut that free and
now<00:01:18.570> I'm<00:01:18.750> going<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.140> lift<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.610> see<00:01:20.970> if<00:01:21.060> we

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
now I'm going to lift this and see if we

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.410 
now I'm going to lift this and see if we
can<00:01:21.330> unscrew<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.990> discharge<00:01:22.380> pipe<00:01:23.420> once

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
can unscrew the discharge pipe once

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.570 
can unscrew the discharge pipe once
these<00:01:24.540> gaskets<00:01:24.750> are<00:01:25.110> loose<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:26.040> allows<00:01:26.340> me

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
these gaskets are loose this allows me

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.179 
these gaskets are loose this allows me
to<00:01:26.610> lift<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.600> lid<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.259> now<00:01:28.290> what<00:01:28.890> I'm<00:01:28.979> going

pipe from the pump and I wasn't able to
get<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> good<00:01:44.310> hold<00:01:44.579> on<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.939> because<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.960> pipe

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
get a good hold on it because this pipe

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.319 
get a good hold on it because this pipe
that<00:01:46.799> they're<00:01:46.950> using<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.340> get<00:01:47.610> radon<00:01:48.030> out<00:01:48.210> of

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
that they're using to get radon out of

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.480 
that they're using to get radon out of
the<00:01:48.390> house<00:01:48.600> didn't<00:01:49.350> have<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.619> coupling<00:01:50.220> or<00:01:50.460> a

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
the house didn't have a coupling or a

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.940 
the house didn't have a coupling or a
union<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.570> what<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.750> did<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.290> ran<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.920> I

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
union so what I did is I ran and I

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.100 
union so what I did is I ran and I
picked<00:01:53.280> up<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.700> coupling<00:01:54.270> for<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:54.780> two-inch

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
picked up a coupling for this two-inch

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.200 
picked up a coupling for this two-inch
pipe<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:56.040> picked<00:01:56.280> up<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.490> coupling<00:01:56.909> for<00:01:57.090> this

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
pipe and I picked up a coupling for this

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.870 
pipe and I picked up a coupling for this
women<00:01:57.479> 1/2<00:01:57.689> inch<00:01:57.960> pipe<00:01:58.170> just<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.619> case<00:01:58.920> once<00:01:59.729> I

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
women 1/2 inch pipe just in case once I

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.510 
women 1/2 inch pipe just in case once I
unscrew<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.540> gasket<00:02:01.259> if<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:02.009> can't<00:02:02.280> get<00:02:02.430> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
unscrew this gasket if I can't get the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.280 
unscrew this gasket if I can't get the
mail<00:02:02.700> at<00:02:02.850> day-after<00:02:03.240> through<00:02:03.479> here<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:04.200> what

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
mail at day-after through here so what

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.660 
mail at day-after through here so what
I'm<00:02:04.380> going<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.560> do<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:04.890> I'm<00:02:05.040> going<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.340> cut

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
I'm going to do is I'm going to cut

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.490 
I'm going to do is I'm going to cut
through<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.030> pipe<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.630> then<00:02:07.110> we'll<00:02:07.320> have<00:02:07.469> a

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
through this pipe and then we'll have a

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.870 
through this pipe and then we'll have a
coupling<00:02:08.099> here<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.580> future<00:02:08.849> when<00:02:09.660> they

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
coupling here so in the future when they

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.220 
coupling here so in the future when they
change<00:02:10.150> the<00:02:10.390> sump<00:02:10.630> pump<00:02:10.840> it's<00:02:10.990> going<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:11.170> be

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
change the sump pump it's going to be

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.540 
change the sump pump it's going to be
very<00:02:11.440> easy<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.770> change<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:18.160> now<00:02:18.280> it's<00:02:18.370> going<00:02:18.460> to

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
very easy to change so now it's going to

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.790 
very easy to change so now it's going to
be<00:02:18.610> very<00:02:18.790> easy<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.240> pull<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.870> sump<00:02:20.380> pump<00:02:20.410> out

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
be very easy to pull the sump pump out

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.460 
be very easy to pull the sump pump out
and<00:02:21.250> disconnect<00:02:22.150> it<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:22.420> then<00:02:22.990> we'll<00:02:23.200> just

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
and disconnect it and then we'll just

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.200 
and disconnect it and then we'll just
use<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:23.650> coupling<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.310> reconnect<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:24.910> radon

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
use a coupling to reconnect the radon

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.410 
use a coupling to reconnect the radon
pipe<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.890> we<00:02:26.980> just<00:02:27.130> lift<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.460> old<00:02:27.640> sump<00:02:28.150> pump

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
pipe so we just lift the old sump pump

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.240 
pipe so we just lift the old sump pump
out<00:02:29.110> of<00:02:29.320> the<00:02:29.380> pit<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:32.670> now<00:02:33.670> I'll<00:02:33.880> just<00:02:33.910> unscrew

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
out of the pit and now I'll just unscrew

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.890 
out of the pit and now I'll just unscrew
this<00:02:36.250> discharge<00:02:36.520> pipe<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.450> male<00:02:37.630> adapter

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
this discharge pipe and the male adapter

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:49.410 
this discharge pipe and the male adapter
from<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:38.440> old<00:02:38.710> pump<00:02:47.910> so<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.030> sump<00:02:49.210> pump<00:02:49.240> I'm

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
from the old pump so the sump pump I'm

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.120 
from the old pump so the sump pump I'm
going<00:02:49.570> to<00:02:49.630> be<00:02:49.690> using<00:02:50.020> to<00:02:50.140> replace<00:02:50.500> is<00:02:50.800> from

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
going to be using to replace is from

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.680 
going to be using to replace is from
flow<00:02:51.430> tech<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:51.910> I<00:02:51.970> really<00:02:52.180> like<00:02:52.330> this<00:02:52.510> one

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
flow tech and I really like this one

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.660 
flow tech and I really like this one
because<00:02:53.080> it<00:02:53.230> has<00:02:53.260> a<00:02:53.410> zinc<00:02:53.800> body<00:02:54.130> which<00:02:54.460> is

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
because it has a zinc body which is

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.970 
because it has a zinc body which is
corrosion<00:02:55.000> resistant<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:55.870> also<00:02:56.440> dissipates

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
corrosion resistant and also dissipates

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.770 
corrosion resistant and also dissipates
heat<00:02:57.280> so<00:02:57.520> it's<00:02:57.670> going<00:02:57.850> to<00:02:57.970> extend<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.480> life<00:02:58.630> of

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
heat so it's going to extend the life of

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.810 
heat so it's going to extend the life of
your<00:02:58.900> motor<00:02:59.170> they<00:02:59.800> also<00:02:59.980> use<00:03:00.280> stainless<00:03:00.610> steel

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
your motor they also use stainless steel

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.610 
your motor they also use stainless steel
hardware<00:03:01.600> and<00:03:01.720> screws<00:03:02.050> so<00:03:02.230> it's<00:03:02.320> really<00:03:02.500> a

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
hardware and screws so it's really a

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.700 
hardware and screws so it's really a
nice<00:03:02.830> pump<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:03.630> what<00:03:04.630> I<00:03:04.660> like<00:03:04.900> about<00:03:05.020> this<00:03:05.410> if

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
nice pump and what I like about this if

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.470 
nice pump and what I like about this if
you're<00:03:06.010> if<00:03:06.310> you<00:03:06.460> don't<00:03:06.490> know<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:06.910> size<00:03:07.150> I'll

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
you're if you don't know the size I'll

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.910 
you're if you don't know the size I'll
actually<00:03:07.600> put<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:07.990> phone<00:03:08.230> number<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.830> the

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
actually put the phone number to the

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.740 
actually put the phone number to the
company<00:03:09.370> underneath<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.910> video<00:03:10.270> and<00:03:10.510> you<00:03:10.600> can

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
company underneath the video and you can

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.840 
company underneath the video and you can
give<00:03:10.960> them<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.530> vertical<00:03:12.310> height<00:03:12.550> and<00:03:12.790> the

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
give them the vertical height and the

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.610 
give them the vertical height and the
horizontal<00:03:13.390> length<00:03:13.600> of<00:03:13.780> your<00:03:13.900> discharge<00:03:14.350> pipe

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
horizontal length of your discharge pipe

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.620 
horizontal length of your discharge pipe
and<00:03:14.860> they'll<00:03:14.950> tell<00:03:15.130> you<00:03:15.160> exactly<00:03:15.330> what<00:03:16.330> horse

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
and they'll tell you exactly what horse

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.960 
and they'll tell you exactly what horse
you<00:03:16.780> should<00:03:16.810> have<00:03:17.200> but<00:03:17.890> in<00:03:18.010> general<00:03:18.580> if<00:03:18.820> you

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
you should have but in general if you

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.240 
you should have but in general if you
get<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.180> half<00:03:19.540> horse<00:03:19.900> sump<00:03:20.290> pump<00:03:20.530> with<00:03:21.220> a

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
get a half horse sump pump with a

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.860 
get a half horse sump pump with a
vertical<00:03:21.580> flow<00:03:22.000> switch<00:03:22.360> it's<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.720> most

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
vertical flow switch it's the most

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.660 
vertical flow switch it's the most
versatile<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:23.590> what<00:03:24.250> I<00:03:24.280> like<00:03:24.460> about<00:03:24.550> a

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
versatile and what I like about a

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.000 
versatile and what I like about a
vertical<00:03:24.940> float<00:03:25.870> like<00:03:26.050> this<00:03:26.350> is<00:03:26.590> you<00:03:26.860> can<00:03:26.890> put

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
vertical float like this is you can put

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.250 
vertical float like this is you can put
it<00:03:27.280> into<00:03:27.490> a<00:03:27.520> pit<00:03:27.850> as<00:03:28.000> small<00:03:28.300> as<00:03:28.420> ten<00:03:28.690> inches<00:03:29.050> or

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
it into a pit as small as ten inches or

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.820 
it into a pit as small as ten inches or
larger<00:03:30.720> so<00:03:31.720> now<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:31.900> connect<00:03:32.260> this<00:03:32.380> all<00:03:32.590> I<00:03:32.620> need

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
larger so now to connect this all I need

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.910 
larger so now to connect this all I need
to<00:03:32.920> do<00:03:33.100> is<00:03:33.340> just<00:03:33.700> screw<00:03:34.240> down<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:35.410> discharge

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
to do is just screw down the discharge

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:43.920 
to do is just screw down the discharge
pipe<00:03:36.750> to<00:03:37.750> a<00:03:37.780> new<00:03:37.960> pipe<00:03:42.540> so<00:03:43.540> I<00:03:43.570> pulled<00:03:43.870> the

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
pipe to a new pipe so I pulled the

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.199 
pipe to a new pipe so I pulled the
electric<00:03:44.380> cord<00:03:44.680> up<00:03:44.920> through<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.610> cover<00:03:45.910> and

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
electric cord up through the cover and

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.440 
electric cord up through the cover and
now<00:03:46.750> I'm<00:03:46.810> just<00:03:47.110> going<00:03:47.440> to<00:03:47.740> drop<00:03:48.670> this<00:03:48.730> into<00:03:49.300> the

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
now I'm just going to drop this into the

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.260 
now I'm just going to drop this into the
pit<00:03:49.750> and<00:03:50.010> then<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:51.160> line<00:03:51.459> it<00:03:51.640> up<00:03:51.760> so<00:03:52.420> then<00:03:54.270> the

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
pit and then you line it up so then the

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.470 
pit and then you line it up so then the
float<00:03:55.770> isn't<00:03:56.770> by<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.340> discharge<00:03:57.700> pipe<00:03:58.209> or

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
float isn't by the discharge pipe or

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.570 
float isn't by the discharge pipe or
anything<00:03:58.750> that<00:03:58.870> could<00:03:59.140> be<00:03:59.320> caught<00:04:00.070> on<00:04:00.310> and

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
anything that could be caught on and

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.320 
anything that could be caught on and
we'll<00:04:01.570> adjust<00:04:02.020> this<00:04:02.350> pipe<00:04:03.040> and<00:04:03.370> that<00:04:04.120> would<00:04:04.240> be

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
we'll adjust this pipe and that would be

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.690 
we'll adjust this pipe and that would be
a<00:04:04.360> good<00:04:04.570> time<00:04:04.840> if<00:04:04.870> you<00:04:05.200> have<00:04:05.410> an<00:04:05.590> old<00:04:06.010> pit<00:04:06.370> and

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
a good time if you have an old pit and

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.610 
a good time if you have an old pit and
there's<00:04:07.330> any<00:04:07.480> debris<00:04:07.810> in<00:04:07.900> it<00:04:08.110> make<00:04:08.290> sure<00:04:08.320> that

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
there's any debris in it make sure that

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.930 
there's any debris in it make sure that
you<00:04:08.740> grab<00:04:08.890> a<00:04:08.950> pair<00:04:09.190> of<00:04:09.220> rubber<00:04:09.280> gloves<00:04:09.490> and

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
you grab a pair of rubber gloves and

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.920 
you grab a pair of rubber gloves and
pull<00:04:10.480> out<00:04:10.600> any<00:04:10.750> debris

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
pull out any debris

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.170 
pull out any debris
once<00:04:13.769> I<00:04:13.890> position<00:04:14.310> the<00:04:14.400> sompop<00:04:14.849> now<00:04:15.000> I'm<00:04:15.060> going

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
once I position the sompop now I'm going

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.759 
once I position the sompop now I'm going
to<00:04:15.239> take<00:04:15.390> a<00:04:15.420> cable<00:04:15.870> tie<00:04:16.049> I'm<00:04:16.260> going<00:04:16.380> to<00:04:16.440> pull

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
to take a cable tie I'm going to pull

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.219 
to take a cable tie I'm going to pull
the<00:04:17.010> electric<00:04:17.549> cords<00:04:17.940> up<00:04:18.090> out<00:04:18.510> of<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.750> way<00:04:18.930> and

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
the electric cords up out of the way and

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.039 
the electric cords up out of the way and
cable<00:04:20.160> tie<00:04:20.370> it<00:04:20.430> inside<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.180> pit<00:04:21.449> so<00:04:21.810> that<00:04:21.959> the

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
cable tie it inside the pit so that the

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.159 
cable tie it inside the pit so that the
cords<00:04:22.380> don't<00:04:22.530> get<00:04:22.740> in<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:22.860> way<00:04:22.979> of<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:23.220> float

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
cords don't get in the way of the float

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.210 
cords don't get in the way of the float
now<00:04:25.169> I'm<00:04:25.229> going<00:04:25.350> to<00:04:25.410> push<00:04:25.560> down<00:04:25.590> these<00:04:25.949> rubber

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
now I'm going to push down these rubber

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.820 
now I'm going to push down these rubber
gaskets<00:04:26.820> in<00:04:26.970> place<00:04:27.270> and<00:04:27.690> put<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.680> rubber

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
gaskets in place and put the rubber

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.020 
gaskets in place and put the rubber
gasket<00:04:29.460> around<00:04:29.720> the<00:04:30.720> electric<00:04:31.260> corpse<00:04:32.030> I'm

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
gasket around the electric corpse I'm

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.850 
gasket around the electric corpse I'm
going<00:04:33.180> to<00:04:33.240> take<00:04:33.360> this<00:04:33.510> coupling<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:34.710> I'm

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
going to take this coupling and I'm

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.350 
going to take this coupling and I'm
going<00:04:35.190> to<00:04:35.220> connect<00:04:36.410> this<00:04:37.410> tube<00:04:37.919> for<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.880> radar

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
going to connect this tube for the radar

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.100 
going to connect this tube for the radar
and<00:04:40.250> this<00:04:41.250> just<00:04:41.490> slips<00:04:41.790> on<00:04:42.000> if<00:04:42.330> it's<00:04:42.570> difficult

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
and this just slips on if it's difficult

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.750 
and this just slips on if it's difficult
for<00:04:43.440> you<00:04:43.680> to<00:04:43.770> connect<00:04:44.220> it<00:04:44.340> you<00:04:44.460> can<00:04:44.610> always

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
for you to connect it you can always

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.909 
for you to connect it you can always
just<00:04:45.060> use<00:04:45.150> a<00:04:45.330> little<00:04:45.660> bit<00:04:45.900> of<00:04:46.050> liquid<00:04:46.260> soap<00:04:46.710> on

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
just use a little bit of liquid soap on

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:58.610 
just use a little bit of liquid soap on
this<00:04:47.180> so<00:04:48.180> that<00:04:48.330> it<00:04:48.419> slides<00:04:48.630> on<00:04:49.080> easy<00:04:57.470> then<00:04:58.470> I'm

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
this so that it slides on easy then I'm

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.189 
this so that it slides on easy then I'm
just<00:04:58.710> going<00:04:58.919> to<00:04:58.979> pull<00:04:59.250> this<00:04:59.400> up<00:04:59.639> and<00:05:00.199> then

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
just going to pull this up and then

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.140 
just going to pull this up and then
connect<00:05:01.740> these<00:05:01.919> with<00:05:02.160> this<00:05:02.340> with<00:05:02.850> the<00:05:02.970> hose

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
connect these with this with the hose

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.340 
connect these with this with the hose
clamps<00:05:05.539> so<00:05:06.539> depending<00:05:06.870> on<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.020> type<00:05:07.199> of

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
clamps so depending on the type of

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.810 
clamps so depending on the type of
coupling<00:05:07.650> you<00:05:07.800> get<00:05:08.010> a<00:05:08.160> lot<00:05:08.430> of<00:05:08.550> them<00:05:08.639> will<00:05:08.789> have

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
coupling you get a lot of them will have

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.990 
coupling you get a lot of them will have
a<00:05:09.000> slotted<00:05:09.810> area<00:05:10.650> for<00:05:10.949> a<00:05:10.979> slotted<00:05:11.310> screwdriver

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
a slotted area for a slotted screwdriver

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.460 
a slotted area for a slotted screwdriver
but<00:05:12.300> this<00:05:12.479> one<00:05:12.660> doesn't<00:05:13.080> this<00:05:13.139> one's<00:05:13.350> designed

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
but this one doesn't this one's designed

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.650 
but this one doesn't this one's designed
for<00:05:13.860> a<00:05:13.919> nut<00:05:14.160> driver<00:05:14.340> and<00:05:14.820> if<00:05:15.270> you<00:05:15.330> don't<00:05:15.510> have<00:05:15.630> a

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
for a nut driver and if you don't have a

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.560 
for a nut driver and if you don't have a
nut<00:05:15.900> driver<00:05:16.080> one<00:05:16.800> trick<00:05:17.220> is<00:05:17.430> some<00:05:18.419> of<00:05:18.479> these

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
nut driver one trick is some of these

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.450 
nut driver one trick is some of these
four<00:05:18.870> and<00:05:19.020> one<00:05:19.139> screw<00:05:19.470> drivers<00:05:19.889> just<00:05:20.070> pull<00:05:20.430> out

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
four and one screw drivers just pull out

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.159 
four and one screw drivers just pull out
the<00:05:20.970> tip<00:05:21.270> and<00:05:21.560> then<00:05:22.560> you<00:05:22.740> can<00:05:22.919> use<00:05:23.130> this<00:05:24.110> as<00:05:25.110> a

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
the tip and then you can use this as a

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.640 
the tip and then you can use this as a
nut<00:05:25.530> driver<00:05:26.479> so<00:05:27.479> I<00:05:27.539> connected<00:05:27.900> the<00:05:28.080> check

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
nut driver so I connected the check

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.200 
nut driver so I connected the check
valve<00:05:28.889> and<00:05:29.099> I'm<00:05:29.340> going<00:05:29.550> to<00:05:29.580> plug<00:05:29.789> it<00:05:29.880> in<00:05:29.940> just

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
valve and I'm going to plug it in just

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.550 
valve and I'm going to plug it in just
make<00:05:30.330> sure<00:05:30.450> it<00:05:30.570> works<00:05:30.750> before<00:05:30.900> I<00:05:31.110> screw<00:05:31.440> all

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
make sure it works before I screw all

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.629 
make sure it works before I screw all
this<00:05:31.680> down<00:05:31.889> I'm<00:05:32.039> going<00:05:32.160> to<00:05:32.220> make<00:05:32.340> sure<00:05:32.370> the

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
this down I'm going to make sure the

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.310 
this down I'm going to make sure the
pump<00:05:32.880> is<00:05:33.030> working<00:05:33.060> and<00:05:33.630> it<00:05:33.720> filled<00:05:33.930> with<00:05:33.990> water
