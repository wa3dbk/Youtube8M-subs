the reason why I keep going back there

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.710 
the reason why I keep going back there
is<00:02:18.490> because<00:02:18.850> I<00:02:19.530> do<00:02:20.530> my<00:02:20.680> soul<00:02:20.920> wins<00:02:21.130> I<00:02:21.490> never<00:02:22.300> get

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
is because I do my soul wins I never get

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.660 
is because I do my soul wins I never get
breakage<00:02:23.650> around<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.130> edges<00:02:24.600> or<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.780> back

breakage around the edges or the back

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.220 
breakage around the edges or the back

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.640 
it's easy to take my hair out because
she<00:02:29.410> does<00:02:29.560> such<00:02:29.770> a<00:02:29.800> neat<00:02:30.070> job<00:02:30.220> that<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.000> can
