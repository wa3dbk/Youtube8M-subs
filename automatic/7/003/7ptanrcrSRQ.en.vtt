00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.720
 hello guys how about here Antonio work 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.800
 today we have an excellent 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.930
 routine for chest this time the 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.790
 design of the routine is totally 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.670
 different from what we usually were 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.990
 going up is not this time it's a 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.260
 trench 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.690
 very important in this case and in all 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.460
 the cases but here it would show emphasis 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.290
 also that the building should be 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.660
 pedestre in stonemasons use those 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.510
 trains that really demand you to 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.220
 meet the range of repetitions that 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.500
 indicates the routine ok 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.440
 a lot of attention they met all the 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.450
 indications will feel that upon completion 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.059
 these three series of a chest is 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.640
 really pumped because a good 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.880
 training 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.379
 you see guys now yes but before 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.770
 many times they asked us all the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.070
 costumes or if the guys in this video 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:04.019
 again you can see here the first 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.570
 exercise of this three series is the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.259
 flat bench press with dumbbells 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.450
 this is going to do 6 to 8 repetitions a 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.159
 a slow speed the palms of your 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.130
 hands should always be looking towards 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.990
 front and your forearms should be 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.860
 vertical all the time very important 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.890
 that you must lower until you feel that stretch 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.460
 his pectorals and then his turn until 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.110
 you squeeze them without touching the dumbbells 6 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.539
 to 8 repetitions 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.940
 then you pass without resting 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.909
 next exercise that is the press of 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.159
 inclined bench with bar 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.909
 here you are going to lower the bar to the 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.859
 high of your pecs slow the same as 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.479
 feet implanted in the ground and the 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:52.530
 separation between both hands should be 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.840
 so that your forearms are vertical 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.060
 to go down 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.759
 you should feel that you stretch and that 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.969
 you tighten up you're going to do 8 to 10 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.969
 repetitions 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.399
 then the third exercise is the 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.399
 crossover 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.500
 here you will do 2 to 15 repetitions 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.620
 you should feel that you stretch there and then 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.840
 you squeeze there the straight back is very 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:29.180
 important that so you can stretch 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:33.280
 completely your pectorals should 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.280
 keep your back as straight as possible 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.220
 here the common mistake is to bend a lot 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.170
 back 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.390
 you should keep it as straight as possible 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.560
 so you can work correctly 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.660
 the pectorals 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.880
 both feet can be parallel between 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.880
 yes or one foot in front of the other foot back 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.570
 now yes here is the series 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.060
 repetitions and the rest you will see 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.430
 in this crisis it would be for chest all 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.569
 detailed well that deal with the video of the 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.889
 today 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:10.579
 deputies now if there is work all 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:10.579

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:19.860

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:23.150
