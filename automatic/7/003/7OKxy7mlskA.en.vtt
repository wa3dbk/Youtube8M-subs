of those players that struggles a little
bit<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:56.430> defense<00:00:56.850> Juventus<00:00:57.809> maybe<00:00:58.020> your<00:00:58.230> squad

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
bit on defense Juventus maybe your squad

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.750

if<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.980> know<00:00:59.070> what<00:00:59.160> you're<00:00:59.280> doing<00:00:59.489> attacking

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
if you know what you're doing attacking

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.029 
if you know what you're doing attacking
wise<00:01:00.059> then<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.989> could<00:01:01.170> be<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> squad<00:01:01.739> for<00:01:01.949> you

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
wise then this could be a squad for you

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.380 
wise then this could be a squad for you
and<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.250> first<00:01:02.460> formation<00:01:02.730> we're<00:01:02.969> looking<00:01:03.239> at

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
and the first formation we're looking at

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.550 
and the first formation we're looking at
is<00:01:03.840> going<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.080> be<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> 352<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.540> in<00:01:06.540> terms<00:01:07.409> of

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
is going to be the 352 and in terms of

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.380 
is going to be the 352 and in terms of
tactics<00:01:07.830> i<00:01:08.159> like<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.460> use<00:01:08.490> very<00:01:08.790> slow<00:01:09.030> build-up

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
tactics i like to use very slow build-up

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.050 
tactics i like to use very slow build-up
slower<00:01:09.960> passing<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.770> that's<00:01:11.189> because<00:01:11.640> you

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
slower passing and that's because you

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.100 
slower passing and that's because you
meant<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.299> doesn't<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> lot<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.900> pace

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
meant this doesn't have a lot of pace

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.140 
meant this doesn't have a lot of pace
outside<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.680> Giovinco<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.670> don't<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:15.000> very

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
outside of Giovinco you don't have very

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.399 
outside of Giovinco you don't have very
many<00:01:15.330> speed<00:01:15.659> series<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.049> don't<00:01:16.200> have<00:01:16.290> those

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
many speed series you don't have those

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.560 
many speed series you don't have those
guys<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.830> can<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:16.979> burn<00:01:17.420> opposition<00:01:18.420> on

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
guys that can just burn opposition on

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.719 
guys that can just burn opposition on
counter-attacks<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.860> like<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.310> play<00:01:20.430> very

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
counter-attacks so I like to play very

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.380 
counter-attacks so I like to play very
slow<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.799> they<00:01:22.799> defend<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.369> well<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.119> want

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
slow and they defend so well that I want

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.800 
slow and they defend so well that I want
to<00:01:24.479> give<00:01:25.380> my<00:01:25.409> defense<00:01:26.400> an<00:01:26.689> opportunity<00:01:27.689> to

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
to give my defense an opportunity to

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.539 
to give my defense an opportunity to
make<00:01:27.960> place<00:01:28.200> happen<00:01:28.530> for<00:01:28.680> me<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.950> don't<00:01:29.310> want<00:01:29.490> to

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
make place happen for me I don't want to

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.210 
make place happen for me I don't want to
push<00:01:29.729> too<00:01:29.939> far<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.840> go<00:01:31.590> crazy<00:01:31.979> with

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
push too far in and go crazy with

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.740 
push too far in and go crazy with
counter<00:01:32.520> attacking<00:01:32.759> football<00:01:33.119> that's<00:01:33.570> just

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
counter attacking football that's just

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.230 
counter attacking football that's just
