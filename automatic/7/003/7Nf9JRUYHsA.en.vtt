we eventually started

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.740 
we eventually started
adjusting<00:01:56.200> our<00:01:56.920> menu<00:01:57.340> just<00:01:57.700> constitute<00:01:58.360> what

maple and butter about our waffles

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.749

gonna add these here but it's the

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.749 
gonna add these here but it's the
cinnamon<00:04:51.210> in<00:04:51.300> there<00:04:52.189> there<00:04:53.189> may<00:04:53.310> be<00:04:53.340> some<00:04:53.610> more

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:57.080 
cinnamon in there there may be some more
cinnamon<00:04:55.129> I'd<00:04:56.129> like<00:04:56.310> to<00:04:56.430> go<00:04:56.550> pretty<00:04:56.789> heavy<00:04:56.939> on

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
cinnamon I'd like to go pretty heavy on

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.700 
cinnamon I'd like to go pretty heavy on
the<00:04:57.240> cinnamon<00:04:57.419> when<00:04:57.810> I<00:04:57.840> bake<00:04:58.050> it<00:04:58.110> and<00:04:58.349> stuff

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
the cinnamon when I bake it and stuff

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:08.670 
the cinnamon when I bake it and stuff
because<00:04:59.270> it<00:05:00.270> tends<00:05:00.479> to<00:05:00.569> kind<00:05:00.780> of<00:05:00.930> mellow<00:05:01.379> out

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.830 

we're<00:05:09.280> gonna<00:05:09.490> flatten<00:05:09.820> them<00:05:10.000> out<00:05:10.090> as<00:05:10.479> much<00:05:10.540> as

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
we're gonna flatten them out as much as

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.890 
we're gonna flatten them out as much as
possible<00:05:11.050> that's<00:05:11.620> it<00:05:11.860> about<00:05:12.750> three<00:05:13.750> minutes

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
possible that's it about three minutes

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.300 
possible that's it about three minutes
on<00:05:14.169> each<00:05:14.290> side<00:05:14.320> and<00:05:14.590> I<00:05:14.740> think<00:05:14.860> that<00:05:15.010> should<00:05:15.160> do

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
on each side and I think that should do

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.570 
on each side and I think that should do
it

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
it

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.030 
it
one<00:05:16.570> thing<00:05:16.780> this<00:05:16.930> might<00:05:17.080> be<00:05:17.229> good<00:05:17.440> just<00:05:17.470> on<00:05:18.010> a

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
one thing this might be good just on a

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.810 
one thing this might be good just on a
waffle<00:05:18.280> with<00:05:18.669> strawberries<00:05:19.600> bananas<00:05:20.820> pecans

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
walnuts a little bit of applesauce and I

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.159 
walnuts a little bit of applesauce and I
don't<00:05:25.120> know<00:05:25.240> if<00:05:25.330> you<00:05:25.389> can<00:05:25.479> even<00:05:25.720> see<00:05:26.050> the

don't know if you can even see the

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.490 
don't know if you can even see the
pancake<00:05:26.590> in<00:05:26.740> there<00:05:26.889> but<00:05:27.070> it's<00:05:27.190> in<00:05:27.310> there
