00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
getting the infinity blade and I know

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.060 
getting the infinity blade and I know
others<00:01:45.170> have<00:01:45.380> as<00:01:45.560> well<00:01:45.670> after<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:47.570> update

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
others have as well after the update

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.870 
others have as well after the update
sometimes<00:01:49.070> the<00:01:49.909> game<00:01:51.340> doesn't<00:01:52.340> think<00:01:52.640> you

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
sometimes the game doesn't think you

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.359 
sometimes the game doesn't think you
have<00:01:53.180> bought<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:54.020> infinity<00:01:54.619> weapon<00:01:55.009> or<00:01:55.159> have

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
have bought the infinity weapon or have

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.550 
have bought the infinity weapon or have

gotten all the Infinity weapons I had to

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.910 
gotten all the Infinity weapons I had to
rebuy<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.130> cleaver<00:01:58.850> and<00:02:00.009> I<00:02:01.009> think<00:02:01.280> also<00:02:01.490> the

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
rebuy the cleaver and I think also the

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.160 
rebuy the cleaver and I think also the
daggers<00:02:03.920> are<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:05.090> spirit<00:02:05.420> hammer<00:02:05.600> but<00:02:05.929> some

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
daggers are the spirit hammer but some

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.570 
daggers are the spirit hammer but some
of<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.470> weapons<00:02:06.649> even<00:02:07.039> though<00:02:07.190> I<00:02:07.220> had<00:02:07.429> them

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
of the weapons even though I had them

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.820 
of the weapons even though I had them
mastered<00:02:07.970> all<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.269> way<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.450> ten<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:09.590> game

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
mastered all the way to ten the game

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.949 
mastered all the way to ten the game
removed<00:02:10.550> them<00:02:10.729> from<00:02:10.910> my<00:02:11.030> inventory<00:02:11.330> and<00:02:11.720> I<00:02:11.780> had

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
removed them from my inventory and I had

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.220 
removed them from my inventory and I had
to<00:02:12.080> rebuy<00:02:12.860> them<00:02:13.360> I'm<00:02:14.360> not<00:02:14.510> sure<00:02:14.570> if<00:02:14.810> I<00:02:14.870> had<00:02:15.019> any

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
to rebuy them I'm not sure if I had any

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.979 
to rebuy them I'm not sure if I had any
gems<00:02:15.709> in<00:02:16.070> them<00:02:16.310> at<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:16.970> time<00:02:17.209> but<00:02:17.540> if<00:02:17.630> I<00:02:17.720> did

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
gems in them at the time but if I did

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:18.970 
gems in them at the time but if I did
they<00:02:18.200> were<00:02:18.260> gone

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
they were gone

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.430 
they were gone
so<00:02:19.580> that's<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.420> weird<00:02:21.080> little<00:02:21.350> bug

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
so that's a weird little bug

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.740 
so that's a weird little bug
obviously<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.560> save<00:02:24.800> files<00:02:25.400> have<00:02:26.090> not<00:02:26.269> always

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
obviously the save files have not always

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.500 
obviously the save files have not always
gone<00:02:27.680> smoothly<00:02:28.160> into<00:02:28.730> I'll<00:02:28.970> start<00:02:29.300> rising

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
gone smoothly into I'll start rising

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.370 
gone smoothly into I'll start rising
many<00:02:30.080> people<00:02:30.350> have<00:02:30.470> lost<00:02:30.680> an<00:02:30.980> entire<00:02:31.100> save<00:02:31.640> so

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
many people have lost an entire save so

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.590 
many people have lost an entire save so
share<00:02:33.380> made<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.220> huge<00:02:34.519> mistake<00:02:34.670> in<00:02:35.060> my<00:02:35.180> opinion

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
share made a huge mistake in my opinion

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.289 
share made a huge mistake in my opinion
not<00:02:35.959> allowing<00:02:36.440> manual<00:02:36.860> backups<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:37.700> having

make sure we have the infinity edge

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.319 
make sure we have the infinity edge
