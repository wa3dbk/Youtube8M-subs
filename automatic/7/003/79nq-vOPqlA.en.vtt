00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.549
 Hello, good kids, how are we? 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.230
 I bring 1 video frames in the class of a 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:07.970
 attack in which seeing a little like that to 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.890
 eye the result may look like an attack 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.390
 quite normal but you enter the 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.700
 inside you can see that something weird is there 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.920
 something strange there is something that is wrong there 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.930
 something that does not work out well then we're going to 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.400
 start at the end and let's see the 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.270
 result and the troops that you have used 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.940
 OK 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.420
 it's about 30 minions two bloodhounds of 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:29.300
 wash a bowl in 19 balloons on the sidewalks and 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.269
 the magicians of the castle a king by the king 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.040
 barbarian two guys of rage a success of 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:36.320
 freezing and healing spells 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.579
 so good is a normal army its 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.710
 army that is an army okay 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.020
 powerful and a simple army to use 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.730
 simply release the abuses followed 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.530
 of the balloons followed by the minions 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.690
 loose the stripes so that it goes more 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.360
 fast the healing balloons so that 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.579
 do not hurt the wizard towers so much and 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.440
 others and good then once once as 20 today 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.890
 The whole area always consult the golem 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.390
 with the king and followed the castle to 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.129
 clean the air also to remove the 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.590
 City Hall systems destroyed or what 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.729
 be then we start the attack and 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.030
 loose a shakespeare we are worth to 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.250
 feel the ground a bit 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.360
 results lava abuses and there it is already 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.460
 taking too long to release what 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.590
 next now start to drop all 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.670
 the minions mix the abuses of lava 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.350
 who give year of the center is 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.180
 shooting everything will come out the castle and 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.479
 the services so high with the tower of 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.770
 magicians who are bursting us 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:27.240
 first the second have already died and now 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.950
 the castle goes for those that are left 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.020
 he had let out a rage for the awe 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.909
 he argues that they do almost no harm then he has 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.490
 released there two healing equipment for 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.049
 the styles that have little life and the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.240
 balloons are still there in the tray 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.310
 they say take me out and take us 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.039
 taken out and finally when they deign 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.399
 let them go all the bubbles 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.840
 castle is there giving for ass so much 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.280
 of the defenses shoot the balloons not 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.709
 there is nothing that covers them there are not 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.690
 bloodhounds the king has released also with 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:56.340
 the golem and the magicians and good because it 's 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.679
 listed on one side the castle is 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.209
 ending now with the wizards and now 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.369
 I'm going to frank goals and the balloons 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.770
 between the queen in the internÃ³ and so 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.530
 all the golem have already fallen now 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.970
 they only burst it practically and the king 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.799
 As soon as it reaches the reach of 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.140
 the crossbow on the other defenses is going to 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.780
 fall in a moment and right now and only 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.580
 is is the king and the magician 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.300
 that now goes to go for the queen 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.310
 so they stay 34 percent will be 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.230
 with 34 percent with the troops that 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.350
 has used some troops because they are 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.770
 pretty good a pretty normal attack 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.020
 easy and me and good only get 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.130
 make that percentage with those troops not 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.180
 I know the truth that channel was 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.620
 doing because he did not release the balloons 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.360
 before I should release just after 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.790
 the bloodhounds if I do not know if it has 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.950
 some kind of amnesia or forgot or 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.260
 I just do not know I do not know why he did 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.000
 something so weird that something very strange like that 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.560
 that I do not know is something that I can not explain 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.850
 you know why I left in the 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.920
 Comments something because I really do not 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.239
 I understand it so that's all kid 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.650
 I hope you liked the video a 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.650
