got lots and lots of folds in your
header<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.409> want<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.770> use<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.920> longer<00:01:38.280> pin<00:01:38.610> in

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
header you want to use a longer pin in

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.069 
header you want to use a longer pin in
that<00:01:39.030> case<00:01:39.270> because<00:01:39.540> you're<00:01:39.720> going<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.990> be

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
that case because you're going to be

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.810 
that case because you're going to be
pinning<00:01:40.350> through<00:01:40.710> more<00:01:41.040> layers<00:01:41.400> and

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
pinning through more layers and

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.270 
pinning through more layers and
therefore<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.540> will<00:01:42.659> need<00:01:42.899> more<00:01:43.280> surface

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
therefore you will need more surface

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.160 
therefore you will need more surface
area<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.909> pin<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.329> be<00:01:45.360> able<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.630> go<00:01:45.810> through

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
area of the pin to be able to go through

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.410 
area of the pin to be able to go through
those<00:01:46.409> layers<00:01:46.680> what<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.159> tend<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.640> do<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.270> use

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
those layers what I tend to do is to use

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.980 
those layers what I tend to do is to use
the<00:01:48.780> shorter<00:01:49.259> pins<00:01:49.530> near<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.369> front<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.909> my

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.389 
and the longer pins nearer the back
where<00:01:54.899> my<00:01:55.110> hair<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.350> tied<00:01:55.770> up<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.310> where

the page out tends to slip off of course

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.030 
the page out tends to slip off of course
then<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:34.019> also<00:02:34.170> need<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.500> make<00:02:34.680> sure<00:02:34.830> that<00:02:34.950> you

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
underscore is quite secure and if you

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.289 
underscore is quite secure and if you
find<00:02:37.620> that<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:38.130> can't<00:02:38.400> tie<00:02:38.640> your<00:02:38.670> under<00:02:39.060> scarf
