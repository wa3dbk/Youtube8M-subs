00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.970
 the numbers we meet today 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.769
 apart from Versailles for the first 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.139
 day of the opening of the photo salon 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.910
 2013 a show under the sign of 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.070
 innovation letter many new 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.260
 boxes and we will go directly to 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.510
 the sony stand see the new tease 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:27.720
 especially a big full alpha format 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:30.359
 a77 hervÃ© douard monastery named 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.619
 sony for this show 2013 it's the 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.180
 alfaset then can you 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.530
 present a little the specifics of this 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.090
 product then it's even the star of 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.710
 living room in itself in more than the most 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.680
 than the stand 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.940
 in fact the specificity we see there 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.329
 it's actually a full sensor 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.329
 format 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.700
 a box in a device that is 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.039
 extremely compact and lightweight since the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.570
 as is with their purpose we are 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.340
 a little over 500 grams which 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.219
 is almost half as light as 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.930
 equivalent model competitors so 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.219
 today we are able to propose 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.949
 a camera with objectives 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.530
 interchangeable full format in a 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.110
 clutter that is minimal with a 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.310
 case that still remains extremely 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.320
 extremely well supplied in terms of 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.939
 specificities there it is the alfa 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.220
 this hour it's a 36 million sensor 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.630
 of pixels released will propose it a 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.640
 increase which comes in two versions 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.710
 in fact it comes in two versions 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.659
 the hall face to face 36 million 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.400
 pixels without low pass filter and its 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.100
 alfaset's little brother 24 million 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.600
 pixels with low- pass filter next 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.790
 in the operation in the design 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.619
 in the order the interface will be on the 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.610
 same about them on the same things and 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.439
 it is true that this level of the sensor is 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.680
 there and the resolution that the main 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.140
 difference very aptly interface well 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.079
 there is a screen behind which steerable 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.729
 so interface actually we're going 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.020
 to be able to pilot the aircraft from 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.060
 in the 3-inch swivel screen 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.630
 pretty classic either from the viewfinder 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.250
 digital oled c1 2.3 million points 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.659
 very high resolution and then we go 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.340
 able to fully control the 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.390
 the device with the many cases 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.070
 so we have a wheel in the front a 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.259
 briefcase at the back a wheel of 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.939
 selection here and then a number 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.250
 fully customizable keystrokes 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.990
 united if they unite initiates whose ramp 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.740
 warfare the device that is at his hand to 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.849
 its use 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.890
 something that is entirely 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.709
 customizable and like many 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.480
 sony products they communicate in wifi 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.010
 it's a product that communicate in 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.870
 wifi in fc so that we go 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.760
 be able to stick your cell phone 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.590
 directly on the little more that is 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.599
 here the device 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.739
 the smartphone will recognize themselves and 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.569
 will be able to communicate together or 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.140
 have triggered remotely from 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.090
 his smartphone 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.709
 and then we will also be able to transfer 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.599
 his photos from the camera to the 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.700
 smartphone but behind from the 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.019
 smartphone open a field of 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.120
 opportunities to social networks 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.650
 etc. 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.940
 you already had a range of products 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.890
 compact with interchangeable lenses 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.660
 nex we can put the same 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.910
 optics how is it going 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.349
 so we have a range actually it's 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.980
 the same mount that the 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.280
 nex devices 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.810
 this is called the mount e 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.360
 however these alfa the ones that have 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.290
 benefited from tic a little bit specific 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.819
 since they will be able to 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.950
 cover all of the full format where 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.000
 mount optics so far 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.430
 was not able 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.019
 so it's the same mount we'll be able to 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.239
 set all the related objectives 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.239
 but you just have to know that 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.560
 old nex objective will do that 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.510
 the device will place directly in 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.160
 format aps c so we will not use the 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.450
 entire sensor but just a 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.970
 part a little bit more central and we 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.500
 will multiply the focal length by 1.5 but 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.430
 it's fully usable then the 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.670
 tools available 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.720
 compatible full format here we have the 35th 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.930
 8.6 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:40.150
 we will have a 55 f18 Thai a 24 70 f4 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:42.310
 constanza at 28.70 3.5 5.6 more 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.840
 traditional and then will come to 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.400
 very early spring 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.489
 a tea men of very high quality 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.599
 since it will be a 70 200 f 4 in 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.549
 series so I really have the road 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.549
 optical quality signed sony
