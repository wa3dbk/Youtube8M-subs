materials and all basically the whole

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.880 
materials and all basically the whole
project<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.480> it's<00:00:15.480> very<00:00:15.719> simple<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.170> know<00:00:16.289> I

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
project and it's very simple you know I

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.820 
project and it's very simple you know I
don't<00:00:17.039> want<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.430> remake<00:00:18.210> something<00:00:18.720> or<00:00:18.960> create

don't want to remake something or create

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.740 
don't want to remake something or create
something<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.279> already<00:00:20.789> been<00:00:21.240> made<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.600> mean

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
something that already been made I mean

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.290 
something that already been made I mean
andrew<00:00:22.050> kramer<00:00:22.230> showed<00:00:22.590> how<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.640> create<00:00:24.000> most

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
andrew kramer showed how to create most

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.929 
andrew kramer showed how to create most
of<00:00:24.480> these<00:00:24.630> steps<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.320> know<00:00:25.439> but<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:26.550> course

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
of these steps you know but of course

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.429 
of these steps you know but of course
the<00:00:27.060> material<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.599> color<00:00:27.779> correction<00:00:28.199> light

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
the material the color correction light

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.919 
the material the color correction light
think<00:00:28.710> that's<00:00:28.920> different<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.490> know<00:00:29.779> this<00:00:30.779> is

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
think that's different you know this is

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.630 
think that's different you know this is
after<00:00:31.230> playing<00:00:31.619> around<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.520> know

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
after playing around and you know

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.250 
after playing around and you know
finding<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.120> right<00:00:33.390> setting<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.110> right

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
finding the right setting the right

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.250 
finding the right setting the right
angle<00:00:35.130> all<00:00:35.370> these<00:00:35.850> stuff<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.329> i'll<00:00:36.989> leave<00:00:37.050> a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
angle all these stuff so i'll leave a

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.110 
angle all these stuff so i'll leave a
link<00:00:37.350> description<00:00:37.710> for<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.219> project<00:00:38.430> file<00:00:38.820> so

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
link description for the project file so

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.000 
link description for the project file so
you<00:00:39.149> guys<00:00:39.390> can<00:00:39.629> take<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.930> look<00:00:40.230> at<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.770> mean

you guys can take a look at it I mean
it's<00:00:41.280> very<00:00:41.790> simple<00:00:42.120> i<00:00:42.329> didn't<00:00:42.570> use<00:00:42.690> any

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
it's very simple i didn't use any

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.529 
it's very simple i didn't use any

in the description one thing you guys
will<00:00:55.410> need<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:57.260> it<00:00:58.260> approached<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.160> pro

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
will need is it approached the pro

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.119 
will need is it approached the pro
shader<00:00:59.640> you'll<00:01:00.090> need<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.420> pro<00:01:00.600> shader<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.379> get

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
shader you'll need the pro shader to get

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.070 
shader you'll need the pro shader to get
the<00:01:02.280> same<00:01:02.489> look<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.329> material<00:01:03.570> and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
the same look of this material and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.870 
the same look of this material and
you'll<00:01:04.769> lead<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:06.590> action<00:01:07.590> essential<00:01:08.130> yeah

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
you'll lead the action essential yeah

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.570 
you'll lead the action essential yeah
action<00:01:09.420> essential<00:01:10.670> to<00:01:11.670> i<00:01:11.939> think<00:01:12.710> and<00:01:13.710> one<00:01:14.549> of

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
action essential to i think and one of

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.830 
action essential to i think and one of
the<00:01:14.909> tombs<00:01:15.390> fear<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:16.350> me<00:01:16.470> sphere<00:01:16.740> number<00:01:17.729> 6<00:01:18.060> i'm

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
the tombs fear to me sphere number 6 i'm

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.810 
the tombs fear to me sphere number 6 i'm
not<00:01:19.259> sure<00:01:19.409> if<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.619> guys<00:01:19.770> have<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.460> if<00:01:20.670> you

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
do have the axon essential all you need

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.510 
do have the axon essential all you need
is<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.570> miss<00:01:24.720> fear<00:01:25.850> /<00:01:26.930> 06<00:01:27.930> point<00:01:28.380> movie<00:01:29.310> and

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
is a to miss fear / 06 point movie and

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.810 
is a to miss fear / 06 point movie and
this<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.479> will<00:01:30.659> work<00:01:30.869> with<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:31.770> project<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.790> i

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
this is will work with this project so i

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.999 
this is will work with this project so i
can't<00:01:33.150> give<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.479> it's<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.200> think<00:01:34.259> copyrighted

on all the stuff but yeah you get the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.060 
on all the stuff but yeah you get the
project<00:01:38.759> file<00:01:38.939> with<00:01:39.210> all<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.070> element

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
project file with all of the element

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.760 
project file with all of the element
that<00:01:41.220> been<00:01:41.400> used<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.939> Scorpion<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.770> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
that been used the Scorpion and the
