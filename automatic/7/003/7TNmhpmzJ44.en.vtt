00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello people we are in the workshop 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.260
 Lion's bow kitchen and well I have 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.530
 asked to show the recipe for the 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.389
 berry tablets or not here we have it 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.400
 is one of the best recipes that there are 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.959
 magical finding and obtaining gold from 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.160
 you can see the monsters 30 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:21.599
 minutes 30% magic find 40% gold 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.910
 obtained from the monsters and 10 of 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:27.539
 experience when killing is obviously from 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.849
 level 80 maximum level and good what 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.230
 we have here are the ingredients that 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.250
 We are going to need the berry compote 1 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.050
 bowl of dry ingredients 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.210
 bakers and bowl of ingredients 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.890
 baker liquids if you do not know how 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.260
 get these recipes well the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.020
 bowls of ingredients are in 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.160
 cooking ingredients and they come out when they 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.420
 is going up of level they leave 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.810
 automatically it is not necessary 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.790
 discover them 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.890
 here we have the bowl of ingredients 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.840
 you see that uses liquid vanilla 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.720
 that's why the price also goes up a bit 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.820
 because you already know that vanilla does not come out 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.590
 very often it comes out in a way that is 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.620
 random you can leave or not you 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.110
 you can leave all the ingredients except 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:12.400
 the glass of serum that is by karma all 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.900
 are from drop or obtained in sacks 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.280
 for example the butter bar is 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.560
 get from sacks not 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.659
 and then we have the ingredients here 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.440
 dry baker's and all 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.850
 ingredients are bought in the npc that you 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.720
 they sell the ingredients 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.940
 then we are going to need the compote 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.180
 the compote of berries or less we have 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.720
 here that we will need a berry 1 and a 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.720
 sack of sugar 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.450
 on the fence one is collecting the 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.230
 zone now and the sack of sugar also 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.760
 to buy what we are going to need is 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.800
 have these ingredients and then go to 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.870
 this area to the discovery and when 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.930
 we have to drag them and we will have 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.630
 our recipe is good because this is what 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.110
 I wanted to teach and until the video and 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.110
