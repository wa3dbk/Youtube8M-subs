00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.280
 on this flight 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:11.379
 because we arrived today but good 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.000
 it's the beach where all the people come 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.980
 young ours and where else we 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.020
 we have fun and because there are many girls 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.880
 cute 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.369
 and why else 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.170
 nothing more than nothing to walk 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.810
 signing up a little bit 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.060
 There is a lot of youth many people known 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.419
 it's good to have a good time to be 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.010
 people besides me personally I 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.420
 like it more because there are no qualms 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.420
 many buildings like what 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.680
 Y 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.600
 and what is done at this time and you 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.280
 you can have a drink or you can have a drink 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.469
 a smoothie sunbathes listening to music 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.680
 the boys come playing the guitar 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.539
 everyone usually when again it's a 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.420
 Starting at 4 in the afternoon, you can see that 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.699
 guys come out singing I notice the site 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.619
 and they arrive at four thirty five for 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.140
 start maccanti to the wave that 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.600
 generates every music will change the 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.979
 geography the people themselves have already changing 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.500
 it starts to generate more party so 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.960
 It gets really cute the girls also 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.960
 It puts very good level pretty good 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.780
 [Music] 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.060
 What is it 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.590
 and I think that bristol beach is one of 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.480
 the most popular that's why we come this 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.150
 place 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.570
 it seems to me a note for this place 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.850
 why 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.090
 all the people come here for the comfort 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.310
 we are here two blocks you saw then 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.670
 we come here how long ago a 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.670
 depression 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.940
 20 years I do not know my parents are my dad 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.720
 more latency so we already started in order 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.330
 of year 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.520
 How to find the beach when cleaning 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.689
 take care of a dirt 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.619
 and it is a pity habit, therefore, a worthy 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.580
 city 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.440
 I think that this was also good 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.429
 they made popular somewhere like 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.620
 so that people can also 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.900
 enjoy it but we do not know how to take care of 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.810
 things and you look what this is now 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.629
 that is, no no no, it does not really work 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.939
 let's say the night and well we came to the 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.870
 beach that is closer to us but 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:28.079
 we preferred another beach that is less 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.590
 familiar because what happens here I see a lot 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:33.390
 family little music little party and good 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.629
 we should go out and look for other 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.640
 things for example women uncontrol 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.459
 rock and roll all those things we 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.590
 we are like they give because we like 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.720
 we are used to this little beach 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.800
 so we do not have any difficulty 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.800
 we are very calm 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.570
 [Music] 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.570
 and it was me
