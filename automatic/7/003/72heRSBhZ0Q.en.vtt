00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.210
 hello today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.670
 put the place I call what we're going to 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.279
 need then it will be our pledge or 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.310
 so they start to practice a piece 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.910
 fabric, preferably fabrics 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.329
 like gauds can be siphons some 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.660
 Textured gauze or satin that is art 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.500
 the delgaditas is much better 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:44.030
 we are going to occupy and what we find also 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.430
 This is a very thin transparent thread 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.930
 similar to fishing line but 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.250
 a little thinner do not sell it in 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.340
 any haberdashery 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.830
 well let's start then our 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.810
 piece of cloth can be a step 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.360
 some missing some where we want 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.610
 Preference is given to the bias and 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.280
 they fix is the bias this is because 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.979
 there are more where it is left prettier 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.930
 our figure in the part of the area 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.420
 so preferably the fence is 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.990
 being rich also they are left of adam 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.240
 or not it will not be very smooth but 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.760
 is much better when the fabric is on 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.460
 not good sex let's start then 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.369
 to put good of preference I would 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.500
 I recommend putting it in a machine vo 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.780
 one that do the sides that remains 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.540
 the mini work in side of the little one 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.729
 preference with the little woman and if 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.530
 he does not have anything else with his work 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.180
 change the silver or you have to move the 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.640
 tensions so that the seam does not come out 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.649
 as little as possible if they have 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.630
 at a minimum see the truth now it's a lot 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.670
 our best is much better 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.770
 finished but with the work nothing else 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.869
 we adjust our small stitch or 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.610
 we can change our insert and 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.420
 down here and it makes us one more stitch 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.270
 little 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.700
 I will also teach you how to do it if 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.040
 they do not have over in straight machine but 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.850
 much better what remains 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.850
 with the meter 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.350
 let's start where our piece of 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.330
 remember that this bias if not the 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.440
 they have the pig it does not matter but it's 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.120
 much better with the fabric is sharp and 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.140
 let's grab our and we want it 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.620
 let's put below this is below 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.620
 of our 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.920
 below our plan and what 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.599
 let's do check ok it's very 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.120
 important that our euro does not remain 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.459
 neither very cheap nor very involved because 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.110
 our the work is going to cut has to 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.530
 stay exactly here for the 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:49.180
 districts so that they will hold on well to 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.180
 principle they will battle a little 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.690
 but with practice practice for 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.690
 climb the fabric a little 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.750
 make them more chin 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.219
 climbing and pulling so that we stay 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.219
 already molded 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.840
 and he was ready here they fix it 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.600
 put already our thread and when they have 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.610
 two enter as it lifts a little bit no 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.490
 our fabric is completely down 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.500
 stays more and lift and is 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:41.110
 perfect for escaroles once it will emerge 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:04:03.020
 our escarole is left 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:04:04.550
 and you can not imagine 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.530
 we are going to need the same thing 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:10.590
 I also prefer that the bias be 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.500
 our escarole or our term we are going to 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.650
 do the stitch has to be in a 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.870
 stitch zigzag but tiny and 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.400
 bushy 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.980
 almost as if it were a buttonhole 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.230
 little bit bushy than buttonholes but 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:29.110
 almost as if they were buttonholes 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.850
 well let's give our web and today what 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.630
 we are silent this we are going to put it 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.760
 not on the bottom like the adobe and 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.320
 we are going to hug him with the zig zag there 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:44.040
 have to try to make sure that it fits well 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:47.400
 in the pure little corner of our fairs 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.400
 must stay 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.090
 no this 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.039
 from the same procedure we will heal 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:23.310
 and we are going to go pulling our fabric to 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.310
 send pure schoolgirl 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:48.130
 and here we already had this one and what 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.500
 we change with the line and there is a 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.270
 little hairy if you notice this is 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.699
 because the six by not reaching to give the 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.699
 very good but it also looks good 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.689
 [Music] 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.899
 so we have our machinery 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:06.489
 these are the two options that have 

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:10.729
 for when they do not have a mini side 

00:06:06.489 --> 00:06:12.740
 bird can do it with your imagine 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:14.990
 of the two forms are well left 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.490
 better finished with our machine but 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.939
 with the regia machine is also very 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:22.969
 Well, well, that's all, if you 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:24.499
