I<00:01:49.009> know<00:01:49.430> some<00:01:49.789> of<00:01:49.820> you<00:01:49.939> find<00:01:50.840> is<00:01:50.990> ridiculous<00:01:51.530> to

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
I know some of you find is ridiculous to

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.230 
I know some of you find is ridiculous to
fish<00:01:51.920> with<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:52.219> Sun<00:01:52.399> in<00:01:52.430> your<00:01:52.549> eyes<00:01:52.700> but

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
fish with the Sun in your eyes but

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.660 
fish with the Sun in your eyes but
that's<00:01:53.390> why<00:01:53.600> we<00:01:53.750> wear<00:01:53.899> sunglasses<00:01:54.200> right<00:01:54.860> the

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
that's why we wear sunglasses right the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.550 
that's why we wear sunglasses right the
whole<00:01:55.880> thing<00:01:56.119> about<00:01:56.360> casting<00:01:56.930> into<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.320> Sun

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
whole thing about casting into the Sun

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.840 
whole thing about casting into the Sun
is<00:01:57.799> that<00:01:58.009> it's<00:01:58.789> a<00:01:58.909> more<00:01:59.149> productive<00:01:59.539> cast<00:02:00.850> when

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
is that it's a more productive cast when

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.490 
is that it's a more productive cast when
you're<00:02:02.000> trailing<00:02:02.240> away<00:02:02.630> from<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:02.990> Sun<00:02:03.229> fish

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
you're trailing away from the Sun fish

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.740 
you're trailing away from the Sun fish
are<00:02:03.649> more<00:02:03.799> likely<00:02:04.009> to<00:02:04.189> follow<00:02:04.490> that<00:02:04.880> then

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
are more likely to follow that then

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.229 
are more likely to follow that then
something<00:02:06.380> into<00:02:06.649> the<00:02:06.770> Sun<00:02:07.039> because<00:02:07.850> it's<00:02:08.030> like

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
something into the Sun because it's like

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.089 
something into the Sun because it's like
why<00:02:08.660> would<00:02:08.869> you<00:02:09.019> run<00:02:09.200> right<00:02:09.530> into<00:02:09.560> an<00:02:09.920> oncoming

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
why would you run right into an oncoming

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.870 
why would you run right into an oncoming
train<00:02:10.729> with<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.030> light<00:02:11.209> in<00:02:11.390> your<00:02:11.420> eyes<00:02:11.540> I

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
train with the light in your eyes I

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.309 
train with the light in your eyes I
always<00:02:13.880> find<00:02:14.090> that<00:02:14.269> I'm<00:02:14.930> much<00:02:15.140> more

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319

always find that I'm much more
productive<00:02:15.680> in<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.069> evening<00:02:16.519> when<00:02:16.760> I'm

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
productive in the evening when I'm

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.229 
productive in the evening when I'm

because i keep pulling back little bits
over<00:06:35.380> now<00:06:35.620> and<00:06:35.800> then<00:06:35.950> other<00:06:36.670> guys<00:06:36.940> have<00:06:37.150> come

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390 
over now and then other guys have come

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.990 
over now and then other guys have come
here<00:06:37.840> and<00:06:38.170> fish<00:06:38.410> next<00:06:38.860> to<00:06:38.980> me<00:06:39.130> and<00:06:39.460> didn't<00:06:39.910> do

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 
here and fish next to me and didn't do

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.610 
here and fish next to me and didn't do
very<00:06:40.030> good<00:06:40.300> and<00:06:40.660> kept<00:06:40.810> calling<00:06:41.170> back<00:06:41.320> just

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
very good and kept calling back just

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.640 
very good and kept calling back just
tons<00:06:41.950> of<00:06:42.340> vegetation<00:06:43.020> that's<00:06:44.020> because<00:06:44.440> they

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650 
tons of vegetation that's because they

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.880 
tons of vegetation that's because they
were<00:06:44.710> pretty<00:06:45.670> much<00:06:45.790> skipping<00:06:46.510> the<00:06:46.600> bottom<00:06:46.990> now

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:47.890 
were pretty much skipping the bottom now

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.130 
were pretty much skipping the bottom now
i'm<00:06:48.160> just<00:06:48.430> coming<00:06:48.790> right<00:06:49.180> on<00:06:49.240> top<00:06:49.780> of<00:06:49.990> that

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:50.140 
i'm just coming right on top of that

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.450 
i'm just coming right on top of that
because<00:06:50.800> i'm<00:06:50.980> using<00:06:51.010> a<00:06:51.790> jigging<00:06:52.750> float<00:06:52.990> and

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 
because i'm using a jigging float and

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.650 
because i'm using a jigging float and
kind<00:06:54.460> of<00:06:54.550> bouncing<00:06:54.970> in<00:06:55.150> and<00:06:55.270> out<00:06:55.420> of<00:06:55.570> the

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:55.660 
kind of bouncing in and out of the

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.240 
kind of bouncing in and out of the
vegetation<00:06:56.260> that's<00:06:56.530> where<00:06:56.770> these<00:06:56.890> large

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:57.250 
vegetation that's where these large

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.650 
vegetation that's where these large
mouths<00:06:57.490> are<00:06:58.170> but<00:06:59.170> it<00:06:59.530> was<00:06:59.710> worth<00:06:59.890> pointing<00:07:00.310> out

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660 
mouths are but it was worth pointing out

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.200 
mouths are but it was worth pointing out
so<00:07:01.660> maybe<00:07:02.320> sometime<00:07:02.860> try<00:07:03.400> using<00:07:03.640> a<00:07:03.820> jigging

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.210 
so maybe sometime try using a jigging

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.150 
so maybe sometime try using a jigging
float

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 
float

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:13.920 
float
two<00:07:05.820> fists<00:07:06.480> a<00:07:06.840> week<00:07:07.170> bed

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:13.930 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.580 

All<00:07:14.530> Right<00:07:14.590> see<00:07:14.949> you<00:07:15.160> next<00:07:15.340> time
