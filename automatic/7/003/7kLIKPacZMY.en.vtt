00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
certainly at midfield for and Carlton

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.779 
certainly at midfield for and Carlton
Cole<00:00:45.149> might<00:00:45.480> be<00:00:45.659> available<00:00:45.870> for<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.379> game<00:00:46.789> so

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
that I've just think there's enough

going<00:00:49.079> forward<00:00:49.499> for<00:00:49.739> them<00:00:50.719> then<00:00:51.890> there's

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
going forward for them then there's

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.680 
going forward for them then there's
enough<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.249> this<00:00:53.339> going<00:00:53.579> for<00:00:54.149> me<00:00:54.269> to<00:00:54.390> say<00:00:54.539> that

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
enough in this going for me to say that

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.110 
enough in this going for me to say that
we're<00:00:54.839> stamp<00:00:55.109> the<00:00:55.649> price<00:00:55.859> they<00:00:56.039> are<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.399> think

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
we're stamp the price they are I think

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.180 
we're stamp the price they are I think
are<00:00:57.300> our<00:00:57.719> decent<00:00:58.530> burn<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.949> they<00:00:59.129> were

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
are our decent burn and they were

up and then 32 down and and eventually

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.320 
up and then 32 down and and eventually
got<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> jaw<00:01:04.949> if<00:01:05.489> they<00:01:05.640> were<00:01:05.760> tied<00:01:05.940> to<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.210> back

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
got a jaw if they were tied to the back

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.020 
got a jaw if they were tied to the back
this<00:01:06.510> week<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.280> Burnley<00:01:08.280> posed<00:01:08.490> less<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.969> an

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
this week and Burnley posed less of an

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.459 
this week and Burnley posed less of an
attacking<00:01:09.329> threat<00:01:09.630> than<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.840> then<00:01:10.049> hold<00:01:10.290> it

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:10.469 
attacking threat than you then hold it

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:12.109 
attacking threat than you then hold it
then<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.219> would<00:01:11.369> think<00:01:11.520> they<00:01:11.670> could<00:01:11.700> win<00:01:12.000> it

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
then you would think they could win it

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.420 
then you would think they could win it
yeah<00:01:12.329> you<00:01:12.540> would<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.869> mean<00:01:12.899> that<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.590> jack

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
yeah you would I mean that the jack

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.740 
yeah you would I mean that the jack
collison<00:01:14.729> company<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.270> as<00:01:15.329> I<00:01:15.450> say<00:01:15.600> that

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
collison company and as I say that

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.120 
collison company and as I say that
midfield<00:01:16.140> for<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.500> starting<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.860> look<00:01:16.979> like

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
midfield for is starting to look like

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.380 
midfield for is starting to look like
the<00:01:17.280> midfield<00:01:17.640> for<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.969> served<00:01:18.210> them<00:01:18.329> so

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
the midfield for that served them so

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.929 
the midfield for that served them so
well<00:01:18.659> last<00:01:18.869> year<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.549> there's<00:01:20.549> there's<00:01:20.789> no

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
well last year and there's there's no

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.429 
well last year and there's there's no
doubt<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.210> when<00:01:21.509> those<00:01:21.689> four<00:01:21.930> players<00:01:22.079> play

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
doubt that when those four players play

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.480 
doubt that when those four players play
together<00:01:22.649> then<00:01:23.070> then<00:01:23.490> it's<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.969> good<00:01:24.119> midfield

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
together then then it's a good midfield

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.920 
together then then it's a good midfield
hopefully<00:01:26.490> can't<00:01:26.729> cope<00:01:27.030> as<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.509> say<00:01:27.689> will

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
hopefully can't cope as you say will

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.440 
hopefully can't cope as you say will
will<00:01:28.500> play<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.100> one<00:01:29.909> or<00:01:30.000> two<00:01:30.030> others<00:01:30.299> they've

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
will play and one or two others they've

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.060 
will play and one or two others they've
looked<00:01:30.630> okay<00:01:30.930> going<00:01:31.140> forward<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.710> be<00:01:31.829> fair

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
looked okay going forward to be fair

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.340 
looked okay going forward to be fair
yeah<00:01:32.369> Franco<00:01:32.820> scored<00:01:33.030> last<00:01:33.240> week<00:01:33.539> and<00:01:33.810> you

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
yeah Franco scored last week and you

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.170 
yeah Franco scored last week and you
know<00:01:34.409> they<00:01:34.530> look<00:01:34.890> as<00:01:35.070> if<00:01:35.100> they<00:01:35.219> are<00:01:35.549> capable<00:01:36.000> of

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
know they look as if they are capable of

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.330 
know they look as if they are capable of
scoring<00:01:36.810> goals<00:01:37.049> against<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.920> likes<00:01:38.100> of

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
scoring goals against the likes of

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.700 
scoring goals against the likes of
Berlin<00:01:38.789> yeah<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.509> just<00:01:40.079> think<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.439> home

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
Berlin yeah so I just think that a home

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.080 
Berlin yeah so I just think that a home
would<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.070> think<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.340> off<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.939> guy's

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
would just think this off the guy's

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.429 
would just think this off the guy's
