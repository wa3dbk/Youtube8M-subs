00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 and all by you I will not even show how 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.130
 with mothers 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:13.710
 and first you need to choose either 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.730
 screen area but this for example before 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:25.099
 to shoot games 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:30.170
 and this in order to fraps 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:33.480
 I left it as well as I was then 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:38.010
 here the authors end the condition 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.980
 Yeast can be recorded by time 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:48.360
 to size 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:52.770
 without auto-completion then the video on your 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.579
 choosing any advice this one this 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.020
 eg 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.809
 finish and start video pause it 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.229
 I have what I have here 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.210
 this game 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:11.880
 some kind of this came out when i clicked 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:14.040
 f8 because of this savl is standard here 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.930
 there will be their actions and there is a tick 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.930
 put so you can do without 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.600
 cursor and you will not be here if the site 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.140
 without the cursor you don't be quite the mouse here 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.240
 this hour will see that this one closet 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:35.430
 you will probably like a mouse 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:42.360
 hear a mouse click and so click here 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:47.130
 settings and will come out so in sound 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:50.070
 put a tick here and for example here 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:02:00.719
 me since i have win8 i will leave 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:02:03.869
 windows all if you have windows windows 7 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.770
 and yet there seems to also be written 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.860
 year 2 psy 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.539
 if they are asleep and I do n’t even know that 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.400
 additional device is yours 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.340
 microphone selected is your annual microphone 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.830
 worth 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.840
 I have this common soundtrack 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.300
 together with the main device 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.459
 Yes, there is a little corner here I do not advise 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.099
 set as you when we will compress 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:28.530
 on sleep only you then will go 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:31.480
 the sound and the uncomfortable 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.780
 logo here you can make your 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:40.269
 logo the other day put a tick 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:43.870
 tick seems to have appeared 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:47.019
 take off don't know okay then in one video in 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:52.470
 our main channel 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.470
 this fact was the logo on the top right 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.720
 so we remove the effects that I myself do not 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:09.540
 figured out I don’t know the options either 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:14.819
 ran off okay so cancel the image 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:18.519
 here you can create a fence 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:21.299
 template and do not advise to put as in 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.299
 them figures 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:28.319
 graphics 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.319
 if you want 720p 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:42.010
 then you have to do it like that 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:44.739
 me size 1280 by 720 if you don't have 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:51.359
 of this parameter, we put a special and here 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:55.540
 and write what he needs if you need 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:59.019
 1080p this is this most likely yes here 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:05.250
 it seems i don't know exactly 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:08.859
 tried stupid we put on 30 less than 29 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.390
 settle I do not advise to put as 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:14.580
 will sucks 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:21.030
 when we put grades pak so you can 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:24.390
 for example sony vegas how to say could 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.910
 in the vegas zone and change video but u 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.500
 I do not know the best there, but if a friend 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.220
 put then you will probably 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:36.540
 fig quality we put 80 not having 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:40.020
 seven carry or 60 but if you 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:47.330
 less weak compics you can 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:54.530
 put a sound channel there and set the stereo 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:05:00.890
 the frequency itself is 48000 it is the last code 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:03.060
 rss here is an image here you can 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.400
 look for example 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.160
 do not look and take your picture 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:12.060
 screen or 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:15.810
 the game on the f1 key is repeated capture 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:22.980
 screen every one second or 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:26.390
 up to 1 minute so this is also not advise here 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:30.030
 This if you want and without cursor can be 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:35.220
 grab it what form we set high 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:37.820
 quality and jeep ideas about the program me 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:43.470

 454 and how would you naively be here 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:51.890
 if not a circus type is written 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:54.180
 shot and you will have this one here 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:58.220
 bandicam.com logo
