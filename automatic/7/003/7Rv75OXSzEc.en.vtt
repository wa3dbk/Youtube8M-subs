1,900<00:02:20.290> cyber<00:02:21.290> dragon<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:22.550> guess<00:02:22.910> why<00:02:23.120> you<00:02:23.180> can

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
1,900 cyber dragon and guess why you can

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.010 
1,900 cyber dragon and guess why you can
get<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:23.900> for<00:02:24.080> free<00:02:24.430> but<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:26.150> also<00:02:26.330> Bates<00:02:26.780> them

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
get it for free but it also Bates them

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.650 
get it for free but it also Bates them
out<00:02:27.200> from<00:02:27.800> using<00:02:28.220> their<00:02:28.700> Thunder<00:02:29.150> King<00:02:29.360> Ryu

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
out from using their Thunder King Ryu

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.040 
out from using their Thunder King Ryu
also<00:02:30.640> because<00:02:31.640> Thunder<00:02:31.970> King<00:02:32.180> Rio<00:02:32.390> can

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
also because Thunder King Rio can

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.809 
also because Thunder King Rio can
actually<00:02:33.410> negate<00:02:33.770> the<00:02:33.920> special<00:02:34.040> summon<00:02:34.670> of
