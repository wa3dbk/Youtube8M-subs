00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
steel string guitar first of all they're

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.770 
steel string guitar first of all they're
not<00:01:22.650> going<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.979> fit<00:01:23.250> very<00:01:23.549> well<00:01:23.780> secondly

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
not going to fit very well secondly

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.330 
not going to fit very well secondly
they're<00:01:25.170> not<00:01:25.350> going<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.560> play<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.830> tune<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
they're not going to play in tune the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.840 
they're not going to play in tune the
intonation<00:01:26.640> will<00:01:27.150> be<00:01:27.270> off<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.780> those<00:01:28.080> strings

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
intonation will be off on those strings

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.819 
intonation will be off on those strings
and<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.240> acoustic<00:01:30.780> steel<00:01:30.960> string<00:01:31.020> guitar<00:01:31.530> is

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
and the acoustic steel string guitar is

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.460 
and the acoustic steel string guitar is
braced<00:01:32.610> for<00:01:33.000> heavier<00:01:33.329> for<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> heavier<00:01:34.079> string

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
braced for heavier for a heavier string

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.950 
braced for heavier for a heavier string
so<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.579> guitar<00:01:35.790> will<00:01:36.090> not<00:01:36.210> really<00:01:36.360> resonate

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
so the guitar will not really resonate

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.210 
so the guitar will not really resonate
well<00:01:37.170> with<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.470> nylon<00:01:37.710> string<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.460> if<00:01:39.180> you

well with a nylon string on it if you

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.399 
well with a nylon string on it if you
think<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.520> put<00:01:41.759> steel<00:01:42.720> strings<00:01:43.079> on<00:01:43.350> a

think you can put steel strings on a
classical<00:01:44.189> guitar<00:01:44.640> you'll<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.360> opposite

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
classical guitar you'll have opposite

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.130 
classical guitar you'll have opposite
problems<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:47.100> steel<00:01:47.579> strings<00:01:47.909> are<00:01:48.299> much<00:01:48.930> too

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140
