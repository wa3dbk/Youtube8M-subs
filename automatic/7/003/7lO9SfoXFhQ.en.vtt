00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 very good guys feel come 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.210
 today I present a new video of this 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.069
 channel for a long time has always been 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.320
 asked what is the legendary pokemon 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.690
 more powerful and is is arceo is that if new 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.340
 two what if and then what are the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.550
 which are followed what would be the 10 more 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.050
 powerful what would be the 20 the 30 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.820
 there have always been doubts that 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.490
 travel and have always provoked a lot 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.050
 controversial and in me it has occurred to me 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.820
 what not to do a tournament among the pokémon 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.830
 legendary to decide what would be the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.390
 winner and this is going to be a new 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.390
 miniseries that you will see is from this channel 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.219
 the legendary pokémon tournament I've 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.460
 chosen the 16 legendary pokémon 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.989
 that I consider more powerful and I'm going 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.480
 to face to see which will be the winner 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.430
 of the tournament I am going to tell you the priority 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.530
 what will I have to calculate the winner 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.110
 of this combat the first thing we're going to 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.670
 calculate are the studs as you know the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.940
 pokemon you have different statistics 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.399
 health points attack special attack 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.750
 special arrow defense and speed 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.270
 Well, I'm going to compare the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.770
 statistics of the legendary pokémon 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.719
 to see which stands out more than in another of 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.610
 the statistics for example if 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.070
 let's face for example root 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.200
 I never got to look at the health points 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.480
 who has more health points one point 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.880
 for him who has the most attack has more 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.430
 attack fell he believes then a point for him and 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.320
 so we would see who would be the winner as 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.570
 there are six statistics there may be the 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.940
 possibility of a tie in case of 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.040
 tie we will move to the position that has 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.840
 I 'm going to get them out of little 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.360
 expert the web that I consider more 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.280
 reliable and have different positions 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.440
 according to the statistics they have then 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.930
 have the number one position number 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.509
 20 and peak I can not place number 67 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.520
 the one with the highest position will be 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.430
 the one that passes of round but as we have 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.590
 Pokemon of very equal powers 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.479
 surely more than one will be tied 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.670
 so then I'll go to the third option 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.550
 what would be the special forms like 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.290
 they are mega evolutions or other forms not 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.240
 the first stories because the mega 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.550
 evolutions depend on a coach or 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.320
 mergers depend on other pokemon and 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.090
 in this fight I would like to evaluate them 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.550
 of first then already with many resources 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.220
 I use them but first fighting 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:11.009
 them alone and already as a last option if 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.900
 still tied I'll use the guys 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.610
 the guys I do not give them that much priority anymore 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.920
 they are legendary pokémon and they would know 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.659
 counteract k say that when I say 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.000
 types have that for example if a 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.310
 Pokémon of the psychic type dragon alone 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.170
 may use dragon and psychic attacks 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.930
 because if it would not be very difficult to 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.140
 compare and said this we go with those who 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.670
 the participants of the 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.310
 first generation we have as 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.359
 participant to youtube of the second 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.340
 generation we will have a job or the loggia of 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:44.670
 the third generation we will have here 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.430
 achieve crowd on and remember the fourth 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.329
 generation we will have bankia de alga 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.000
 keratin faces and gas and accesses of the 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:57.480
 fifth generation we will have zekrom 3 and 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.299
 ram and want and the sixth generation 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.790
 sernas and see such here you have the table to 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.859
 which they will face will obviously fit 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.629
 say that this is the extra video but not 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.370
 I 'm going to tell you now, surely 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.930
 a few hours are minutes 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.480
 you will have the two rounds that you see 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.099
 so then good guys I hope 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.379
 that you liked this idea of ​​the tournament 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.670
 it would help me a lot by giving it a like and 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.130
 sharing it with your 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.110

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.290
