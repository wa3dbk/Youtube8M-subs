before a dam was built you could go up

home and cook them but to say that you

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
could probably do it right here at

could probably do it right here at

Nimbus even if the dam was probably

built is more there's more urban legend
than<00:00:41.720> than<00:00:42.080> anything

the fish are crowded into the building

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.730 
the fish are crowded into the building
using<00:00:55.550> a<00:00:55.760> mechanical<00:00:55.910> crowder<00:00:56.510> and<00:00:56.840> then<00:00:57.350> into

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:57.740 
using a mechanical crowder and then into

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.770 
using a mechanical crowder and then into
a<00:00:57.800> tray<00:00:58.100> and<00:00:58.340> then<00:00:58.610> they're<00:00:59.000> administered<00:00:59.570> an

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
a tray and then they're administered an

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.020 
a tray and then they're administered an
electric<00:01:00.140> shock<00:01:00.440> and<00:01:00.770> that<00:01:00.800> Anessa<00:01:01.490> sizes<00:01:01.910> the

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
electric shock and that Anessa sizes the

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.670 
electric shock and that Anessa sizes the
fish<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:02.540> calms<00:01:02.750> them<00:01:02.930> down<00:01:02.990> so<00:01:03.410> that<00:01:03.440> the

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
fish and calms them down so that the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.650 
fish and calms them down so that the
workers<00:01:04.010> can<00:01:04.220> handle<00:01:04.490> them<00:01:04.640> safely<00:01:04.850> they

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
workers can handle them safely they

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.510 
workers can handle them safely they
separate<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.200> males<00:01:06.410> from<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.680> females<00:01:06.770> and

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
separate the males from the females and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.580 
separate the males from the females and
they<00:01:08.180> seal<00:01:08.570> the<00:01:08.780> female's<00:01:09.080> bellies<00:01:09.440> to

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
they seal the female's bellies to

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.350 
they seal the female's bellies to
determine<00:01:10.010> if<00:01:10.130> they're<00:01:10.310> right<00:01:10.610> if<00:01:11.000> their<00:01:11.180> eggs

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
determine if they're right if their eggs

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.450 
determine if they're right if their eggs
are<00:01:11.570> ready<00:01:11.750> to<00:01:11.870> be<00:01:11.990> spawned<00:01:12.320> both<00:01:13.160> male<00:01:13.430> and

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
are ready to be spawned both male and

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.940 
are ready to be spawned both male and
female<00:01:13.820> salmon<00:01:14.540> die<00:01:14.720> after<00:01:15.140> spawning<00:01:15.350> and<00:01:15.770> so

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
female salmon die after spawning and so

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.320 
female salmon die after spawning and so
here<00:01:16.160> at<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.310> hatchery<00:01:16.460> they're<00:01:16.970> killed

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
here at the hatchery they're killed

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.210 
here at the hatchery they're killed
first<00:01:17.780> so<00:01:18.260> that<00:01:18.380> our<00:01:18.470> workers<00:01:18.800> can<00:01:18.920> handle

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
first so that our workers can handle

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.180 
first so that our workers can handle
them<00:01:19.370> safely<00:01:19.760> and<00:01:19.940> quickly<00:01:20.170> they<00:01:21.170> then<00:01:21.410> bleed

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
them safely and quickly they then bleed

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.010 
them safely and quickly they then bleed
out<00:01:22.370> the<00:01:22.520> females<00:01:22.880> they'll<00:01:23.150> cut<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.420> artery

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
out the females they'll cut the artery

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.420 
out the females they'll cut the artery
and<00:01:24.350> let<00:01:24.500> all<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:24.710> blood<00:01:24.890> out<00:01:24.920> of<00:01:25.070> her<00:01:25.250> body

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
and let all the blood out of her body

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.890 
and let all the blood out of her body
because<00:01:25.790> they<00:01:25.940> don't<00:01:26.090> want<00:01:26.210> any<00:01:26.360> blood<00:01:26.570> to<00:01:26.810> get

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
because they don't want any blood to get

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.390 
because they don't want any blood to get
onto<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.290> eggs<00:01:27.470> and<00:01:27.920> prevent<00:01:28.280> them

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
onto the eggs and prevent them

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.190 
onto the eggs and prevent them
fertilizing<00:01:29.180> so<00:01:29.690> once<00:01:29.900> they've<00:01:30.020> done<00:01:30.140> that

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
fertilizing so once they've done that

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.870 
fertilizing so once they've done that
they<00:01:30.380> open<00:01:30.770> up<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:30.950> female's<00:01:31.280> belly<00:01:31.520> and

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
they open up the female's belly and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.820 
they open up the female's belly and
remove<00:01:32.330> her<00:01:32.630> eggs<00:01:32.840> she<00:01:33.110> has<00:01:33.260> an<00:01:33.380> average<00:01:33.500> of

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
remove her eggs she has an average of

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.430 
remove her eggs she has an average of
five<00:01:34.040> to<00:01:34.280> six<00:01:34.520> thousand<00:01:35.030> eggs<00:01:35.150> into<00:01:35.810> a<00:01:36.110> tray

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
five to six thousand eggs into a tray

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.469 
five to six thousand eggs into a tray
and<00:01:36.680> then<00:01:36.979> they<00:01:37.130> take<00:01:37.280> a<00:01:37.340> male<00:01:37.640> and<00:01:37.940> squeeze

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
and then they take a male and squeeze

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.690 
and then they take a male and squeeze
out<00:01:38.660> the<00:01:38.690> milk<00:01:39.020> from<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.470> male<00:01:39.650> mix<00:01:40.580> them

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
out the milk from the male mix them

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.190 
out the milk from the male mix them
together<00:01:40.790> and<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:41.240> eggs<00:01:41.390> are<00:01:41.570> fertilized<00:01:41.990> and

together and the eggs are fertilized and
ready<00:01:42.410> ready<00:01:43.010> to<00:01:43.190> go<00:01:43.340> they<00:01:43.820> then<00:01:44.090> put<00:01:44.300> them

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
ready ready to go they then put them

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.120 
ready ready to go they then put them
into<00:01:44.540> hatching<00:01:44.990> jars<00:01:45.290> that<00:01:45.440> can<00:01:45.770> hold<00:01:45.920> about
