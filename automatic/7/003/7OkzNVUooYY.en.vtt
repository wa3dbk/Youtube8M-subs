00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
but from what we are given we can assume

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:11.520 
but from what we are given we can assume
a<00:01:09.159> lot<00:01:09.369> so<00:01:10.149> we<00:01:10.270> see<00:01:10.420> a<00:01:10.450> male<00:01:10.780> and<00:01:11.020> female

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
species very large very physical I do

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.109 
species very large very physical I do
not<00:01:16.840> think<00:01:17.020> he<00:01:17.229> is<00:01:17.380> a<00:01:17.409> car<00:01:17.740> car<00:01:17.950> odone<00:01:18.310> but<00:01:19.000> he

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
not think he is a car car odone but he

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.240 
not think he is a car car odone but he
looks<00:01:19.360> very<00:01:19.450> shark<00:01:20.200> like<00:01:20.440> when<00:01:20.799> we<00:01:20.950> see<00:01:21.130> the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
looks very shark like when we see the

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.950 
looks very shark like when we see the
other<00:01:21.400> female<00:01:21.790> Inquisitor<00:01:22.150> we<00:01:22.390> see<00:01:22.540> a<00:01:22.570> probe

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
other female Inquisitor we see a probe

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.539 
other female Inquisitor we see a probe
droid<00:01:23.229> beside<00:01:23.619> her<00:01:23.799> this<00:01:24.100> leads<00:01:24.369> me<00:01:24.460> to

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
droid beside her this leads me to

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.940 
droid beside her this leads me to
believe<00:01:24.760> that<00:01:24.970> these<00:01:25.720> inquisitors<00:01:26.290> will<00:01:26.799> have

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
believe that these inquisitors will have

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:27.870 
believe that these inquisitors will have
special<00:01:27.430> skills

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
special skills

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.210 
special skills
hers<00:01:28.150> being<00:01:28.479> droid<00:01:28.750> attacks<00:01:29.110> and<00:01:29.409> his<00:01:29.979> being

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
hers being droid attacks and his being

hers being droid attacks and his being
sheer<00:01:30.580> strength<00:01:31.030> and<00:01:31.270> physicality<00:01:31.689> this<00:01:32.409> of

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
sheer strength and physicality this of

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.289 
sheer strength and physicality this of
course<00:01:32.619> makes<00:01:32.950> sense<00:01:33.070> because<00:01:33.729> those<00:01:34.119> are<00:01:34.270> the

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
course makes sense because those are the

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:35.940 
course makes sense because those are the
two<00:01:34.540> strengths<00:01:34.930> of<00:01:35.080> our<00:01:35.170> rebels<00:01:35.500> Sabine<00:01:35.920> and
