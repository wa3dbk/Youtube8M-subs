probably every second time I wash my
hair<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.619> what<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.129> do<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.879> do<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.510> normal

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
hair and what I do is I do a normal

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.860 
hair and what I do is I do a normal
who<00:02:13.370> first<00:02:13.700> then<00:02:14.240> I<00:02:14.330> give<00:02:14.480> it<00:02:14.510> a<00:02:14.660> really<00:02:14.840> good

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
who first then I give it a really good

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.620 
who first then I give it a really good
towel<00:02:15.290> dry<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:15.800> then<00:02:16.220> apply<00:02:16.610> this<00:02:16.670> shampoo<00:02:17.420> to

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
towel dry and then apply this shampoo to

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.750 
towel dry and then apply this shampoo to
it<00:02:17.780> making<00:02:18.320> sure<00:02:18.530> I<00:02:18.560> don't<00:02:18.710> lather<00:02:19.130> it<00:02:19.400> too

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
it making sure I don't lather it too

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.300 
it making sure I don't lather it too
much<00:02:19.940> because<00:02:20.210> that<00:02:20.360> actually<00:02:20.980> makes<00:02:21.980> the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
much because that actually makes the

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.670 
much because that actually makes the
turning<00:02:22.700> color<00:02:22.910> less<00:02:23.750> effective<00:02:24.320> because<00:02:24.560> it

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
turning color less effective because it

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.320 
turning color less effective because it
kind<00:02:24.860> of<00:02:24.920> lightens<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:25.550> as<00:02:25.700> it's<00:02:25.910> lathering

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
kind of lightens it as it's lathering

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.330 
kind of lightens it as it's lathering
like<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:26.750> lather<00:02:26.990> gets<00:02:27.260> lighter<00:02:27.530> I<00:02:27.800> just

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
like the lather gets lighter I just

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.830 
like the lather gets lighter I just
apply<00:02:28.580> fair<00:02:28.880> amount<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.210> this<00:02:29.360> to<00:02:29.510> my<00:02:29.630> hair

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
apply fair amount of this to my hair

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.440 
apply fair amount of this to my hair
slightly<00:02:30.590> lather<00:02:31.040> it<00:02:31.280> in<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:31.670> leave<00:02:32.210> it<00:02:32.420> for

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
slightly lather it in and leave it for

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.600 
slightly lather it in and leave it for
about<00:02:32.930> five<00:02:33.350> minutes<00:02:33.620> or<00:02:33.860> so<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:34.250> then<00:02:34.400> rinse

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
about five minutes or so and then rinse

hair is fine if it's healthy or porous

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.750 
hair is fine if it's healthy or porous
will<00:02:39.470> depend<00:02:39.800> on<00:02:39.920> how<00:02:40.100> much<00:02:40.250> your<00:02:40.430> time<00:02:40.610> is

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
would not recommend using packet colors

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.010 
would not recommend using packet colors
as<00:02:52.310> toners<00:02:52.790> just<00:02:53.300> because<00:02:53.570> you<00:02:53.690> don't<00:02:53.870> really

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
as toners just because you don't really

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.410 
as toners just because you don't really
know<00:02:54.140> what<00:02:54.530> level<00:02:54.950> peroxide<00:02:55.670> they<00:02:55.850> put<00:02:56.270> with

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
know what level peroxide they put with

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.270 
know what level peroxide they put with
the<00:02:56.570> colors<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.170> they<00:02:57.590> can<00:02:57.800> be<00:02:57.920> a<00:02:57.950> little<00:02:58.190> bit

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
the colors and they can be a little bit

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.820 
the colors and they can be a little bit
unpredictable<00:02:58.960> so<00:02:59.960> I<00:02:59.990> would<00:03:00.260> recommend<00:03:00.680> if

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
unpredictable so I would recommend if

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.800 
unpredictable so I would recommend if
you<00:03:00.980> can<00:03:01.190> why<00:03:01.580> I<00:03:01.610> like<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:02.000> tube<00:03:02.240> colors<00:03:02.630> you

you can why I like the tube colors you

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.810 
you can why I like the tube colors you
can<00:03:02.960> get<00:03:03.080> them<00:03:03.230> from<00:03:03.320> Priceline<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.400> brand<00:03:04.640> is

can get them from Priceline the brand is

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.210 
can get them from Priceline the brand is
self<00:03:05.060> line<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:06.140> then<00:03:06.320> you<00:03:06.410> can<00:03:06.560> pick<00:03:06.920> your

self line and then you can pick your

self line and then you can pick your
developer<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:07.940> go<00:03:08.090> with<00:03:08.270> it<00:03:08.450> most<00:03:09.170> toners<00:03:09.680> or

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
developer to go with it most toners or

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.530 
developer to go with it most toners or
colors<00:03:10.340> actually<00:03:10.520> have<00:03:10.850> a<00:03:10.880> letter<00:03:11.150> next<00:03:11.390> to

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
colors actually have a letter next to

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.950 
colors actually have a letter next to
them<00:03:11.780> so<00:03:12.350> I<00:03:12.440> normally<00:03:13.430> stands<00:03:13.760> for<00:03:14.030> ash<00:03:14.210> and<00:03:14.540> a

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
them so I normally stands for ash and a

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.130 
them so I normally stands for ash and a
is<00:03:15.410> a<00:03:15.620> blue<00:03:15.950> based<00:03:16.400> toner<00:03:16.820> so<00:03:17.180> ash<00:03:17.570> would<00:03:18.020> be

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
is a blue based toner so ash would be

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.800 
is a blue based toner so ash would be
great<00:03:18.410> on<00:03:18.590> anything<00:03:18.920> that<00:03:19.160> is<00:03:19.340> orange<00:03:19.940> or<00:03:20.210> red

great on anything that is orange or red

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.230 
great on anything that is orange or red
in<00:03:21.110> time<00:03:21.410> because<00:03:22.100> blue<00:03:22.430> is<00:03:22.670> opposite<00:03:23.150> of

shampoos the toners

shampoos the toners
everything<00:04:22.380> it's<00:04:22.650> still<00:04:22.800> not<00:04:23.070> working<00:04:23.520> I

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
everything it's still not working I

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.750 
everything it's still not working I
would<00:04:24.450> say<00:04:24.720> that<00:04:25.170> your<00:04:25.350> hair<00:04:25.560> is<00:04:25.860> still<00:04:26.220> in<00:04:26.520> the

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
would say that your hair is still in the

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.150 
would say that your hair is still in the
yellow<00:04:27.240> stage<00:04:27.630> it's<00:04:28.020> still<00:04:28.170> actually<00:04:28.650> not

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
yellow stage it's still actually not

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.730 
yellow stage it's still actually not
lifted<00:04:29.880> high<00:04:30.240> enough<00:04:30.510> it's<00:04:31.050> not<00:04:31.290> colored

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
lifted high enough it's not colored

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.070 
lifted high enough it's not colored
light<00:04:32.130> enough<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.820> allow<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.180> tonus<00:04:33.690> to<00:04:33.900> work

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
light enough to allow the tonus to work

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.320 
light enough to allow the tonus to work
so<00:04:34.590> basically<00:04:35.040> your<00:04:35.310> only<00:04:35.550> option<00:04:35.910> is<00:04:36.030> to

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
so basically your only option is to

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.500 
so basically your only option is to
rebleed<00:04:37.020> sections<00:04:37.860> lighter<00:04:38.430> to<00:04:39.150> ensure<00:04:39.480> that

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
rebleed sections lighter to ensure that

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.510 
rebleed sections lighter to ensure that
the<00:04:39.780> tone<00:04:40.020> is<00:04:40.170> going<00:04:40.380> to<00:04:40.590> work<00:04:40.770> now<00:04:41.340> I<00:04:41.370> know

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
the tone is going to work now I know

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.310 
the tone is going to work now I know
this<00:04:41.760> can<00:04:41.970> sound<00:04:42.240> scary<00:04:42.630> especially<00:04:43.140> when

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
this can sound scary especially when

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.050 
this can sound scary especially when
your<00:04:43.440> hair<00:04:43.650> is<00:04:43.680> already<00:04:43.950> like<00:04:44.250> light<00:04:44.640> at<00:04:44.910> the

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.410 
end these think I don't want to bleach

pre bleached the yellow areas he is

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.410 
pre bleached the yellow areas he is
going<00:06:38.770> to<00:06:38.860> be<00:06:38.950> very<00:06:39.160> porous<00:06:39.610> and<00:06:39.880> the<00:06:40.030> twinners

going to be very porous and the twinners
are<00:06:40.660> quite<00:06:41.080> likely<00:06:41.500> to<00:06:41.950> grab<00:06:42.220> onto<00:06:42.520> those

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:42.850
