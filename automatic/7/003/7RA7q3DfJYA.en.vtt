00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:11.039
 gourmet panettone in the supermarket 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:14.139
 find optics this year 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:15.850
 industrial companies that produce the phase of 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.650
 you must do gourmet panettone 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:21.340
 other than buying it from different brands 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.350
 some will find all prices and at home 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.350
 stuff it as you do in real regions 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.360
 gastronomic then we decline ours 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.610
 panettone in this way we take a 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:36.370
 ruler if we want and mark with the 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:39.159
 knife of the little ones we say signs that 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.050
 they will indicate our cuts exactly 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:46.120
 we make it according to the layers that 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.460
 we wish 1234567 to have eight 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:53.769
 layers that will become four 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:59.649
 sandwich types in this way 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:01:01.389
 let's go to score and cut more 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.510
 regular as possible 

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:07.210
 to the bottom and so we proceed by 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.439
 we have cut our own 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.770
 panettone 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:13.780
 now we have so many possibilities 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.649
 I always recommend having a thread 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.240
 conductor that only assen recipe 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.469
 if for example like our case 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.000
 decide for salmon as an element 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:26.799
 important of the recipe let's avoid 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.979
 put ourselves to say mirror ham 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:32.350
 raw and salami of the kind 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.420
 let's try to get an idea and follow the 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:39.039
 for example we did a first one 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:43.479
 layer that we will spread with some cream 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:46.899
 salmon diluted with a little bit of maiori 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:50.679
 ge we will add some salmon and the states 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:55.420
 later we will fill them with products that 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:57.850
 fine linen such as the 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.360
 omelette or your pastries 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:05.830
 scrambled with a pinch of salt 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.810
 pepper orange juice and milk and then 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.479
 let's proceed with the anchovy sauce 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.060
 with cheese, for example, with herbs 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.680
 and let's try to compose something they have 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.650
 meaning otherwise we only do 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:23.200
 vegetarian or even with cold cuts e 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:27.360
 our cheese with salmon extracts 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.739
 salmon cream cheese and mayonnaise 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.390
 smoked cheese that I read with 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.930
 kato fumes of salmon and cream of 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.900
 herbal cheese scrambled eggs with 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.900
 orange a cream with dried tomatoes 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.959
 and the last smoked cheese 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.540
 still salmon layer with the cream of 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.319
 tuna we make our panettone 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.930
 culinary 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.630
 here is the important thing to say is that if 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.519
 used and raw vegetables as leaves 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.350
 of salad on any etc. 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.110
 it would be better to consume in the day 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.920
 however from 24 hours like ours 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.720
 panettone with let's say bucket flavors 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.010
 however with pairs creatures if you want 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.579
 even grilled courgettes go 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.410
 very well 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.579
 can be stored safely 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.500
 until the next day 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.079
 let's say to me about the two days in 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.260
 refrigerator covered with film lo 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:20.530
 called the panettone shown second 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.720
 layer as you see between layer e 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.060
 the other there is a no seasoned slice 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:30.760
 be able to facilitate cutting as you will see 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:33.549
 then they press well and we go downstairs 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.900
 refrigerator for shooting needs 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.329
 we will immediately cut the panettone 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.549
 naturally to make cutting easier for you 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.859
 keep it in a film 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.390
 tight tight in the refrigerator 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.030
 at least four to five hours earlier 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.859
 Italian skewers 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:54.190
 four to be exact until the end e 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:54.819
 we practice cross cutting in this 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.999
 way 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:01.269
 the knife must be affixed with 

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:05.769
 italy cross we hold four segments that 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:08.680
 we will serve in this way then there will be 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.090
 obviously the top clove for less 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.389
 that you want to make another cut e 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.040
 will be more chubby, however you decide 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:17.459
 you can also do a woodworm so 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.769
 that the hat remains apart and then 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.139
 they are formed like you say dyka 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.740
 clove cutlets so easy to 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:29.919
 manage if we do with the filling 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.599
 all the layers also those that 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.759
 we left free of course not 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:35.169
 would be more decomposable between 20 in 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:37.720
 this way it aggregates everyone 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.340
 stuck in a kind of slice in 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.080
 this way instead the purpose of 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.280
 gastronomic panettone to be able to be 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.280
 served as among Menchino
