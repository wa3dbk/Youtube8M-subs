00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.490 
it's even more relevant for his team of
the<00:01:11.520> year<00:01:11.549> card<00:01:12.030> but<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.600> card<00:01:12.869> really<00:01:13.260> lived

the year card but this card really lived

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.200 
the year card but this card really lived
up<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.680> everything<00:01:14.070> without<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.760> down<00:01:14.970> every

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
department that you look for in a

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.130 
department that you look for in a
