00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 today they were strong emotions in reverse 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.930
 no when maybe he loses them at 92nd 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.920
 but today I really have to say one 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.540
 game very strongly wanted up 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.349
 the very latest, so much so that I saw that 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.179
 when we got together 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.100
 when we scored and then they scored 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.630
 put the ball into play I saw that 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.970
 the team was really really there like 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.039
 as well as birds of prey hawks least 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.410
 it seemed to take the ball back 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.000
 try to score very little goals 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.779
 that remained so I must really say 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.630
 a fantastic match all the way 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.700
 85th after all it was yes 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.680
 disputed a game in which there was none 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.270
 a very clear prevalence of one 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.980
 of the other was a little more the bull 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.230
 but then in the last seven minutes 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.020
 must say i've seen something 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.469
 beautiful and incredible emotions 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.210
 deserved victory and Turin to 48 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.199
 points so we are all very happy 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.940
 goal of still looking for our two bomber 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.309
 top couple real estate couple more 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.510
 prolific of the championships immobile cerci 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.150
 48 points 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:08.060
 better than that before exactly 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.000
 we have to Lazio 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.790
 next Saturday just in Rome 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.549
 important game then still missing 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.470
 however at 34, however, certainly those already one 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.299
 fundamental game then we must 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.390
 we have to prepare it very well but I believe 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:26.030
 however, there is a team 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.860
 the important thing is an important one for 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.259
 we have a fundamental contribution 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.060
 made 13 goals and many assists but we have 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.009
 a team that is a team that has 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.079
 proved to have the values ​​anyway 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.720
 both is therefore and therefore sum would say that 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.920
 we must play it to the greatest 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.409
 trying to really do the best 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.970
 I think it's a date 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.709
 important that we will certainly prepare 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.600
 well who was five finals goes that is the 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:49.640
 last time open seven finals I would say 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.770
 that was fine if I didn't say final 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.569
 actually I said a minister I have 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.299
 read a seven-game mini tournament 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:59.630
 two disputed with full booty 6 points 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.970
 5 are still missing, the mini tournament continues 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.770
 evidently five games are missing e 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.319
 next and next Saturday in Rome 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:10.910
 so let's really try to do the 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:11.209
 best possible but this is not me 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.400
 I say 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.709
 I say I don't say the word but for nothing 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.930
 because in my opinion it is important how to say 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.590
 focus on every single game e 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.930
 have also to say the interest a 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.850
 this tournament that the boys took 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.870
 really seriously not why not 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.640
 let's talk about a full empty word that 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.440
 but a new way to say the word itself is not 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.180
 it means nothing what matters is and 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.519
 how do you get there as if in dispute? 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.980
 that is, games are not the goal in itself 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.900
 the important thing counts as arrivals 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.519
 objective so what counts 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.260
 path and therefore I believe that the thing 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.359
 important is to continue 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.160
 in these five missing games a 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:51.319
 play as you did as you did 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.239
 today as it was done in a khatami 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.489
 however, with the cola with the 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.810
 desire to win and as seen in 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.810
 these last minutes of today 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.900
 so much in foria the people were really 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.340
 happy because it is difficult i am 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.220
 fans have passed so much is difficult 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.840
 think of taking away these two fans 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.450
 players as important as search is 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.489
 immovable one will speak of them shortly 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.900
 future of real estate with juve and chelsea 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.360
 with player himself 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.209
 there are some news not new for the 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.099
 moment the very good relations do not have 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.810
 special news from this point of 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.790
 view because we are not yet met 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.519
 we will see you I don't want to anticipate 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.620
 nothing because he didn't talk to them 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.410
 I think it's fair to wait for 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.590
 meet us talk and talk to us and then 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.329
 for cerci is our player let's see 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.920
 object already so many times of both 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:44.610
 what i think because it's not going to go 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.230
 in a banking partner are the reasons 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.690
 that I will do anything to hold the 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.790
 team all for which and enrich it 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.410
 possibly while redeeming 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.120
 players because we have some that 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.489
 they are blackmailable and then and then maybe 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.160
 improving it is possible in those 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.290
 those in those things that you can 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.690
 do to improve soon because there is 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.690
 feeling that the base is very much 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.840
 good very very young and really if 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.060
 you should make a shortlist of teams 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.859
 of prospects for Turin and the former 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.569
 positions maybe not the very first but 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.289
 definitely a great team 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.060
 growth 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:20.070
 surely I said the goal 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.200
 ours is that of possibly 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.110
 reinforce the team and certainly not 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.520
 then weakening it is essential that i 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.080
 players we have with us that 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.539
 we want to get have the same 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.669
 want to stay with us because then if 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.410
 they obviously don't have it 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.389
 keep a player who can stand though 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.820
 in other words, one is often said 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.800
 perhaps a word about a vintage on gazzi 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.979
 his today is very difficult 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.240
 field other substance the whole median 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.220
 really something extraordinary and one 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.750
 question that makes me happy to be able to 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.360
 answer because we have a player 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.400
 which is truly exceptional he had a 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.889
 troubled start of season for 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.229
 different reasons however continued to 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:02.310
 work with great commitment and then 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:04.770
 then also in a role like saying in a 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.539
 game module that maybe doesn't enhance the 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.919
 its qualities however when it enters the field 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:11.570
 as today from a contribution 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:14.180
 essential and also important today has 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.430
 really done in those 25 30 minutes 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.220
 something very remarkable boy 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:22.070
 exceptional one of the guys really 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.220
 more more more professional than I ever have 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.449
 known for which I must say congratulations 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.370
 president you have already given a gift 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:31.759
 before Easter and fans that I am 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.440
 obviously speaking of the Philadelphia 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:36.110
 well yes not only me certainly 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.650
 I do my part the mom foundation 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:42.410
 cairo let's take part more wanted 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.500
 do one more thing to speed up the 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.990
 that is, things purchased from the project 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:51.020
 architects to be able to give it to the 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:55.220
 Philadelphia foundation and avoid 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:57.260
 let's say a time frame to do 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.030
 calls tenders etcetera that would have 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.979
 lost to the building 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.260
 philadelphia something like 5 months for 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:05.599
 which I would say in this case with the 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.550
 foundation but but cairo buying the 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:08.570
 project and giving to her at the 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.030
 Philadelphia Foundation 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.080
 we recover the five six months that 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.479
 we would have lost 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.789
 having to call a tender to buy the 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:18.949
 project so so in that sense it is 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:21.289
 one thing is a small gift one 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:24.520
 surprise in the fan's easter egg 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:24.520
 grenade for Easter
