things about this book is that it's not

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.160 
things about this book is that it's not
written<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:02.039> chronological<00:01:02.399> order<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.420> starts

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
written in chronological order it starts

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.679 
written in chronological order it starts
off<00:01:04.350> with<00:01:04.379> Chris's<00:01:04.979> death<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.519> then<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.880> drops

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
off with Chris's death and then it drops

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.230 
off with Chris's death and then it drops
back<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.380> forth<00:01:07.680> from<00:01:08.220> different<00:01:08.610> periods<00:01:09.060> in

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
back and forth from different periods in

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.990 
back and forth from different periods in
his<00:01:09.390> journey<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.650> think<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.369> author<00:01:11.520> does

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
his journey and I think the author does

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.480 
his journey and I think the author does
that<00:01:12.240> because<00:01:12.720> he<00:01:13.020> wants<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.409> reveal<00:01:13.860> Chris<00:01:14.310> to

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
that because he wants to reveal Chris to

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.270 
that because he wants to reveal Chris to
you<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.880> his<00:01:15.060> own<00:01:15.210> way<00:01:15.500> he<00:01:16.500> starts<00:01:17.040> off

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
you in his own way he starts off

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.370 
you in his own way he starts off
revealing<00:01:17.759> little<00:01:18.270> bits<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.840> pieces<00:01:18.930> of

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
revealing little bits and pieces of

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.469 
revealing little bits and pieces of
Chris<00:01:19.770> sort<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.280> painting<00:01:21.119> him<00:01:21.240> as<00:01:21.330> this

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
Chris sort of painting him as this

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.020 
Chris sort of painting him as this
eccentric<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:22.320> really<00:01:22.619> intellectual<00:01:23.400> person

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
eccentric but really intellectual person

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.510 
eccentric but really intellectual person
and<00:01:24.240> then<00:01:24.689> slowly<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.380> get<00:01:25.530> deeper<00:01:26.280> and

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
and then slowly you get deeper and

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.340 
and then slowly you get deeper and
deeper<00:01:26.970> into<00:01:27.180> Chris's<00:01:27.540> psyche<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.259> you

understand<00:01:28.920> more<00:01:29.250> than<00:01:29.579> because<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.210> way

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
understand more than because of the way

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.670 
understand more than because of the way
John<00:01:30.720> reveals<00:01:31.259> him

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.460 
I had to read this book for AP English
this<00:05:40.940> year<00:05:41.510> my<00:05:41.690> ears<00:05:41.900> you're<00:05:42.200> just<00:05:42.320> thinking

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
this year my ears you're just thinking

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:50.430 
this year my ears you're just thinking
out<00:05:42.770> again<00:05:43.690> because<00:05:44.690> the<00:05:44.840> really<00:05:45.050> big<00:05:47.770> words

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
out again because the really big words

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.490 
out again because the really big words
and<00:05:51.460> he<00:05:52.460> just<00:05:52.610> goes<00:05:52.940> off<00:05:53.180> and<00:05:53.510> tries<00:05:54.020> to<00:05:54.050> live

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
and he just goes off and tries to live

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.440

and sometimes he doesn't

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.270

and<00:05:56.600> it<00:05:56.690> definitely<00:05:56.990> captured<00:05:57.770> the<00:05:57.860> spirit<00:05:58.100> of

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
and it definitely captured the spirit of

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.200 
and it definitely captured the spirit of
the<00:05:58.340> book<00:05:58.610> that<00:05:58.820> I<00:05:58.850> found<00:05:59.180> in<00:05:59.920> here<00:06:00.920> so<00:06:01.850> I<00:06:01.880> liked
