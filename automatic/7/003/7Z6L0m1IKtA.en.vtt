00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.019
 or the attention in that easy kitchen my 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.460
 name is andy and I give them teach me to 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.590
 make a delicious fried chicken in the 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.450
 oven that is really delicious is 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.619
 super juicy and super crunchy so 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.630
 they will not notice that it's done in the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.740
 oven in the preparation time and the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.779
 Combined cooking time is 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.690
 about an hour I hope that 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.170
 this video like it let's start 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:31.230
 for this recipe we need 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.720
 6 to 8 pieces of chicken without skin can 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.780
 be pieces with bone or without bone 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.850
 I'm using 4 thighs with bone and 2 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.100
 boneless chicken breasts that are 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.840
 cut in half if you prefer 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.180
 can use a whole chicken cut 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.949
 in pieces but remember the chicken has 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.650
 to be skinless so they fit 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.770
 crunchy 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.760
 we also need 5 cups of cereal 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.830
 I leave corn 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.120
 I am using with flakes 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.560
 we also need two thirds cup 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.630
 of wheat flour 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:07.330
 two large eggs 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:10.450
 two tablespoons of fresh thyme 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.300
 a teaspoon of broken chili 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.510
 a spoonful of salt 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.310
 a spoonful of ground black pepper 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.620
 spray oil or some oil 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.720
 olive and we also need a 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.610
 teaspoon garlic powder and half 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.880
 spoonful of dehydrated onion 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.580
 let's start preheat the oven to 220 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.680
 degrees centigrade rinses the pieces of 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.350
 chicken with cold water and dries them very well 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.030
 with paper towels it is important that 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.030
 you rinse the chicken and I know it's very 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.340
 well so that it is crisp right now 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.260
 Season the eggs with salt and pepper 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.330
 taste and beat them until they are well 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.330
 shakes and reserve them for a moment 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.490
 also season the flour with salt and 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.640
 pepper to taste and reserved by a 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.640
 moment 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.760
 now let's break the flakes of 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.590
 corn 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.720
 I'm using a crush for 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.030
 break them but they can put them in a 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.910
 plastic bag and flatten them a little 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.470
 with a roller or with a glass also if 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.210
 they like they can move a little in the 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.490
 blender but only a little 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.470
 because for this recipe it is necessary that 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.630
 the flakes are broken not the 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.850
 they want completely made flour or 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.740
 dust they want them just a little 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.569
 broken so that the chicken is well 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.849
 crunchy 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.849
 since they have crushed the flakes of 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.769
 corn now we are going to season them with a 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.959
 spoonful of salt and a spoonful of 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.269
 pepper remember salt and pepper 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:41.549
 they are to taste they can always add more 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.549
 or less depending on how they want it 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.930
 to the mixture of the leaflets also 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.410
 let's add 2 tablespoons of thyme 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.410
 cool 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.410
 a cube of garlic that amounts to a garlic 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.250
 finely chopped or a teaspoon of 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.250
 garlic powder 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.420
 and I'm also going to add a cube of 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.180
 onion that is equivalent to half a spoonful 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.129
 of dehydrated onion if they do not have the 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.560
 cubes remember you can use garlic in 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.930
 powder and dried onion or onion 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.269
 in powder since they have added all the 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.440
 seasoned flakes now stir the 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.290
 very well so that everything looks good 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.209
 seasoned and right now you can also 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.709
 add the broken chilli to me 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.989
 forgot to add it, so I am 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.670
 adding until the last only what 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.530
 I'm sprinkling on the pieces of 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.360
 chicken that are ready to be 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.860
 baked but if you like what can 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.900
 add right now 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.030
 and now all the ingredients are 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.120
 ready so we can start 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.860
 Breaking the chicken first let's take 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.530
 the chicken tracks and we're going to pass them 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.820
 for the flour and we will cover very well 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.560
 all pieces of chicken with flour 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.160
 they want them to be well covered by 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.160
 everywhere 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.909
 and after the chicken is already 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.310
 floured now we 're going to dip it in 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.900
 mixing the egg before putting it into 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.549
 egg shake the chicken pieces a 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.080
 little for them to drop the excess 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.950
 flour 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.810
 And now metamos egg mixture 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.340
 we want the chicken pieces to remain 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.950
 well covered with the egg by all 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.660
 sides and after this we're going to 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.930
 transfer to the mixture of the leaflets 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.930
 of corn 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.360
 I'm going to add half of the leaflets 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.580
 on an extended plate is recommended 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.380
 do this in parts because the chicken 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.300
 transfers a lot of moisture to the leaflets 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.550
 and I do not want them to soften before 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.580
 time so for now I'm just going to 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.870
 use half of the leaflets since 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.880
 the chicken is covered with the egg 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.340
 now shake the chicken pieces a 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.650
 little to remove the excess egg and 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.810
 now if you transfer them to the mixture of 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.250
 the flakes and we're going to cover the pieces 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.410
 of chicken very well with the mixture of 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.270
 flakes press the chicken very well 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.860
 on the flakes for the cereal 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.860
 adhere very well to chicken meat 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.190
 and since the chicken pieces are fine 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.440
 covered with the leaflets 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.510
 now we are going to place them in a tray 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.070
 for baking mission or baking 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.920
 is sprinkled with a little oil in 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.510
 spray but if they do not have oil in 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.700
 spray can moisten a towel 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.130
 paper and pass it over its mold so that 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.200
 It is well greased and we will continue 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.400
 repeating these steps until they have 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.300
 all chicken pieces all 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.300
 covered with the leaflets 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.210
 remember first we passed the chicken by 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.520
 the flour mixture then what 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.409
 we wet with the egg mixture and for 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.169
 last we will cover it with the 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:29.029
 cornflakes 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.770
 and as he had told me I forgot 

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:33.229
 season the flakes with the broken chili 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.849
 so right now I'm going to sprinkle a 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:37.699
 little chili broken on the pieces of 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:39.919
 chicken and now if the chicken and is ready 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.960
 to be baked so that they are left with 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:43.580
 a more golden color I recommend you 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.979
 they sprayed it with a little oil in 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.199
 spray this is optional if you do not want 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:49.819
 add more oil no matter the chicken 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:51.949
 Anyway, it's going to be crunchy 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:54.020
 what the oil does is that the 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:55.639
 flakes are a little bit more for 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.129
 give them a little more color but the 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:59.689
 oil is not necessary and now we are going 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:01.939
 to bake the chicken in an oven 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:04.759
 preheated to 220 degrees Celsius 

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:07.129
 for 30 to 40 minutes or until the 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:10.490
 pieces of chicken are well cooked 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:13.249
 pieces with bone will take between 35 a 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:16.580
 40 minutes in cooking and the pieces without 

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:18.110
 bone will take 25 to 30 minutes but 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.270
 remember the oven temperatures 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.860
 may vary so to make sure 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.050
 that his chicken is well cooked 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.539
 internal temperature of the chicken already cooked 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:29.240
 it must be 73 to 75 degrees 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:30.979
 centigrade and that's how they look 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.960
 chicken pieces as you can see they are 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:33.980
 super golden and really they are 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.590
 well crunchy 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.060
 they smell delicious the fresh thyme in 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.490
 true that makes all the difference in 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.790
 this recipe gives a delicious flavor to 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.650
 chicken 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.930
 I serve the chicken with a little 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:48.540
 salad potato salad only 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:52.020
 has white onion potatoes green onion 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:54.240
 fresh parsley and bacon and is seasoned 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:58.460
 with salt and pepper and with chipotle in 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.460
 marinade and that's all good profit
