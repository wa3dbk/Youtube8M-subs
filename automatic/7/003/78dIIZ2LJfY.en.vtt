hi I'm Alex grieve aka IV crazy this is
how<00:00:10.570> to<00:00:10.630> be<00:00:10.750> successful<00:00:11.260> at<00:00:11.349> fpv<00:00:11.769> part<00:00:12.370> 5<00:00:12.630> the

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:13.630 
how to be successful at fpv part 5 the

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.810 
how to be successful at fpv part 5 the
ground<00:00:13.870> station<00:00:14.170> as<00:00:14.679> you<00:00:14.889> look<00:00:15.070> around<00:00:15.429> you'll

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
ground station as you look around you'll

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.910 
ground station as you look around you'll
see<00:00:15.910> that<00:00:16.059> there's<00:00:16.599> a<00:00:16.660> lot<00:00:16.960> of<00:00:17.109> emphasis<00:00:17.350> on

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
see that there's a lot of emphasis on

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.029 
see that there's a lot of emphasis on
what<00:00:18.430> systems<00:00:18.880> go<00:00:19.029> on<00:00:19.180> the<00:00:19.300> airplane

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
what systems go on the airplane

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.900 
what systems go on the airplane
unfortunately<00:00:21.039> there's<00:00:21.220> not<00:00:21.369> a<00:00:21.430> whole<00:00:21.699> lot<00:00:21.880> of

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
unfortunately there's not a whole lot of

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.820 
unfortunately there's not a whole lot of
emphasis<00:00:22.150> on<00:00:22.480> what<00:00:23.199> goes<00:00:23.410> on<00:00:23.560> the<00:00:23.619> ground

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 
emphasis on what goes on the ground

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.740 
emphasis on what goes on the ground
believe<00:00:24.760> it<00:00:24.880> or<00:00:24.970> not<00:00:25.060> what<00:00:25.330> goes<00:00:25.480> on<00:00:25.539> the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
believe it or not what goes on the

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.019 
believe it or not what goes on the
ground<00:00:25.960> is<00:00:26.170> a<00:00:26.230> lot<00:00:26.590> more<00:00:26.800> critical<00:00:27.369> than<00:00:27.730> what

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
ground is a lot more critical than what

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.000 
ground is a lot more critical than what
you've<00:00:28.180> got<00:00:28.390> in<00:00:28.539> the<00:00:28.630> sky<00:00:28.900> that<00:00:29.590> might<00:00:29.800> seem

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
you've got in the sky that might seem

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.830 
you've got in the sky that might seem
counterintuitive<00:00:30.369> but<00:00:31.359> the<00:00:31.420> receiver

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
counterintuitive but the receiver

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.530 
counterintuitive but the receiver
station<00:00:32.439> is<00:00:32.590> much<00:00:33.130> more<00:00:33.370> critical<00:00:33.910> than<00:00:34.360> the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
station is much more critical than the

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.900 
station is much more critical than the
aircraft<00:00:34.960> flying<00:00:35.200> around<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:36.610> what's<00:00:36.820> the

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
aircraft flying around so what's the

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.280 
aircraft flying around so what's the
types<00:00:37.120> of<00:00:37.210> stations<00:00:37.660> are<00:00:37.809> there<00:00:37.960> what<00:00:38.110> can<00:00:38.230> I

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
types of stations are there what can I

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.889 
types of stations are there what can I
choose<00:00:38.559> well<00:00:38.890> you've<00:00:39.489> got<00:00:39.670> two<00:00:39.850> choices<00:00:40.090> when

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
choose well you've got two choices when

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.290 
choose well you've got two choices when
it<00:00:40.960> comes<00:00:41.050> to<00:00:41.320> viewing<00:00:41.530> screens<00:00:41.950> so<00:00:42.879> you<00:00:42.969> have

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
it comes to viewing screens so you have

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.139 
it comes to viewing screens so you have
things<00:00:43.960> like<00:00:44.079> goggles<00:00:44.590> these<00:00:45.460> fit<00:00:45.730> nicely<00:00:45.940> on

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
things like goggles these fit nicely on

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:46.799 
things like goggles these fit nicely on
your<00:00:46.270> head

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
your head

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.139

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
thing about a TV screen all you have to

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.700 
thing about a TV screen all you have to
do<00:01:15.250> is<00:01:15.369> look<00:01:15.549> down<00:01:15.790> after<00:01:16.150> launch<00:01:16.390> so<00:01:17.229> what

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
do is look down after launch so what

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.890 
do is look down after launch so what
else<00:01:17.860> is<00:01:18.009> there<00:01:18.070> to<00:01:18.310> a<00:01:18.340> ground<00:01:18.640> station<00:01:18.729> well

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
else is there to a ground station well

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.350 
else is there to a ground station well
now<00:01:20.680> you<00:01:20.740> need<00:01:20.979> to<00:01:21.100> figure<00:01:21.280> out<00:01:21.549> what<00:01:22.119> type<00:01:22.330> of

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
now you need to figure out what type of

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.240 
now you need to figure out what type of
ground<00:01:22.750> station<00:01:23.229> you<00:01:23.439> want<00:01:23.650> you've<00:01:24.100> already

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
ground station you want you've already

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.320 
ground station you want you've already
chosen<00:01:24.549> goggles<00:01:25.270> or<00:01:25.540> a<00:01:25.600> screen<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:27.330> there's

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
chosen goggles or a screen so there's

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.050 
chosen goggles or a screen so there's
the<00:01:29.020> head-mounted<00:01:29.259> ground<00:01:30.220> station<00:01:30.640> very

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
the head-mounted ground station very

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.249 
the head-mounted ground station very
simple<00:01:31.630> a<00:01:31.890> set<00:01:32.890> of<00:01:32.979> goggles<00:01:33.750> with<00:01:34.750> a<00:01:34.780> receiver

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
simple a set of goggles with a receiver

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:36.690 
simple a set of goggles with a receiver
and<00:01:35.470> an<00:01:35.619> antenna<00:01:35.979> on<00:01:36.070> your<00:01:36.310> head

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
and an antenna on your head

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.030 
and an antenna on your head
there's<00:01:37.390> nothing<00:01:37.960> simpler<00:01:38.350> this<00:01:38.560> great<00:01:38.860> thing

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
there's nothing simpler this great thing

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.859 
there's nothing simpler this great thing
is<00:01:39.159> this<00:01:39.250> this<00:01:39.520> is<00:01:39.670> my<00:01:39.790> grab-and-go<00:01:40.390> station

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
is this this is my grab-and-go station

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.039 
is this this is my grab-and-go station
grab<00:01:41.079> it<00:01:41.229> out<00:01:41.290> of<00:01:41.409> the<00:01:41.470> toolbox<00:01:42.570> I'm<00:01:43.570> ready<00:01:43.930> to

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
grab it out of the toolbox I'm ready to

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.609 
grab it out of the toolbox I'm ready to
fly<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:46.540> course<00:01:46.810> you<00:01:47.200> don't<00:01:47.380> have<00:01:47.500> to

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
fly and of course you don't have to

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.060 
fly and of course you don't have to
build<00:01:47.740> your<00:01:47.890> own<00:01:48.869> fat<00:01:49.869> sharks<00:01:50.320> and<00:01:50.470> Fox<00:01:50.740> Tech

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070

like a complete idiot like I do when
you're<00:01:58.420> out<00:01:58.540> there<00:01:58.570> flying<00:01:59.020> now<00:01:59.860> just<00:02:00.159> because

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
you're out there flying now just because

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
second most common ground station out

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.370 
second most common ground station out
there<00:02:25.630> is<00:02:26.019> the<00:02:26.830> tripod<00:02:27.100> station<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:29.140> this

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
there is the tripod station like this

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.800 
there is the tripod station like this
this<00:02:30.069> one<00:02:30.340> happens<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.790> be<00:02:30.880> dual<00:02:31.269> bands<00:02:32.280> okay

the<00:02:34.810> nice<00:02:34.959> thing<00:02:35.110> about<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.290> tripod<00:02:35.830> station<00:02:36.430> is

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
the nice thing about a tripod station is

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.250 
the nice thing about a tripod station is
you<00:02:36.640> get<00:02:36.790> your<00:02:36.910> antenna<00:02:37.209> nice<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.780> up<00:02:37.959> in<00:02:38.110> the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
you get your antenna nice and up in the

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.710 
you get your antenna nice and up in the
air<00:02:38.410> off<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:39.040> ground<00:02:39.280> where<00:02:39.519> it<00:02:39.610> belongs<00:02:39.940> and

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
air off the ground where it belongs and

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.660 
air off the ground where it belongs and
then<00:02:40.870> you<00:02:40.959> can<00:02:41.110> mount<00:02:41.260> anything<00:02:41.769> you<00:02:42.130> want<00:02:42.430> to

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
the problem with this system is the

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.060 
the problem with this system is the
antennas<00:04:40.060> are<00:04:40.210> mounted<00:04:40.630> very<00:04:40.900> very<00:04:41.200> low<00:04:41.560> and
