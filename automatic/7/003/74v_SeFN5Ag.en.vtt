00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.480
 This video on the website rutten dot com with 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.279
 you Bogdan walks recently to our office 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.550
 bestowed a new gaming keyboard 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.800
 from mad catz strike 3 in black 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.990
 coloring, I note that all there are three types 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.000
 coloring black and red and white with 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.039
 first glance you can see why the company 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.960
 worked on this machine is not immediately 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.210
 I wanted to unpack and test 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.860
 this black and red handsome device 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.210
 Comes in pretty bulky on 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.160
 stylish box with logos 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.350
 manufacturer and proprietary information on 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.510
 the back of the inside you will be expected 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.280
 except the device itself stand for 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.589
 keyboard which is attached using 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.180
 two slots and instructions for 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.190
 installation and operation of this 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.290
 unit disk unfortunately software 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.000
 there is therefore no security 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.979
 adjust the keyboard to the desired mode 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.140
 you need to look at the official 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:01.540
 Matt Cut's website 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.519
 there are two kinds of normal paper and 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.350
 also made on a cardboard basis 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.600
 together with drawings pointers and 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.040
 information includes stickers with 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.439
 the manufacturer of the keyboard itself 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.509
 made a very pleasant impression 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.590
 it feels normal 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.450
 they are cheap plastic 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.490
 when unpacking and assembling nothing backlash 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.409
 does not bend or creak 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.299
 the keyboard stand does not fit 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.159
 just go under it special grooves 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.409
 but it does not slip out and not 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.390
 falls out so that's basically good 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.270
 plastic keyboard case solution 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.429
 gloss he sat down but looks during 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.770
 all uses are visible on it 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.630
 fingerprints dust and things like that 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.609
 those though the stand itself was winding 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.590
 directly under the arms are made too 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:43.929
 glossy inserts again nice on 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.090
 touch but brand connect to pc 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.340
 done with black and red 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.530
 thick but flexible enough cord 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.030
 fabric winding is worth the keyboard on 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.100
 stylized their legs which 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.229
 the backlight is removed at will 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.880
 the keyboard is excellent at it completely 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.850
 regulated by functional 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.359
 keys and mold brightness is very wide 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.310
 the limits 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:05.770
 so you can always stop needing and 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.749
 it changes values for itself 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.700
 color depending on one of the three 

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:12.220
 selected modes by which 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.600
 switch sets of macros color can 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.340
 set absolutely any 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.920
 by assigning it to the software menu 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.010
 provide macro keys here 12 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.799
 divided into 2 blocks 1 of 7 keys 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.519
 from m 1 to n 7 in the upper left corner 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.370
 keyboard 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:32.170
 in the same place where the mod 2 mode switch 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.480
 of 5 keys from si van da se five around 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.489
 arrow keys time one dm7 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.440
 does not change color depending on 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.299
 mode selection is always red 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.860
 near them is a mechanical 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.930
 switch that can be turned off 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.150
 function keys win on the keyboard 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.890
 I wanted to make a remark which 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.109
 connected by arrows and additional 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.209
 keys from all onde se five they 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.459
 are right near the shooter because of what 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.470
 Often there is a random pressing of unnecessary 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.510
 flash although the arrow keys are 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.879
 more convex but it is not 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.549
 the real solution to the problem personally I would 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:05.620
 either by the corners of 6 for easy five or 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.720
 just moved the hotkeys down 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.609
 on the concert and keys as in games 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.260
 I have never met them to use 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:14.049
 go to different modes of operation 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.000
 keyboard game for the test I again chose 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.220
 three main test sites are not for 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.079
 FIFA speed and counter strike 1 6 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.840
 start shooter quick response 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.670
 keys and pleasant tactile sensations 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.220
 Here are the main points that paid 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.260
 attention during the movement and jumping 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.480
 also a weapon change keyboard seemed 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.280
 but simply amazing due to removable 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.530
 coasters hand nicely fixed on 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.389
 table thus reducing the possibility 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.650
 pressing extra keys beautiful 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.930
 the solution is two plastic 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.879
 inserts on the stand which helps 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.720
 intuitively find the right location 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.280
 for hands 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.440
 as I mentioned in the section about 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.810
 economy extra cipher keys 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.639
 the essay five is close to the keys to 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.410
 shooter it is really 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:55.449
 important factor like racing such 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.010
 sports simulator, each of the games 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:58.989
 I had incidents when I 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.180
 inadvertently touched the wrong key and in 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.489
 eventually either hit the hail or the ball 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.590
 flew not in the direction I needed but 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.659
 if we talk about the habit then this defect 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.879
 can be omitted since you get used to 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:11.530
 next to the keys can you in 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.449
 assure this especially if you used to 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.579
 used the laptop there all the keys 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:17.380
 are very close except this 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.019
 I have no moment to comment on this 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.280
 device in sight first pluses are nice 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.280
 keyboard tactile interactions 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.500
 2 due to high speed response to you 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.360
 it will be easier to enter 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.820
 sharp turns at high speeds 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.130
 As for the fifa, it appeared here 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.569
 One incomprehensible to me question management 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.369
 player is prompted 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:38.679
 fine until you are 

00:04:36.369 --> 00:04:40.419
 you press the acceleration immediately the player 

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:41.860
 becomes unmanageable and writes only 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.779
 on the x or y axis 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.879
 about any diagonal bumps or 

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:47.949
 the gears are not out of the question 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:50.080
 impression as if pressing acceleration 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:51.819
 any other actions are blocked when 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.800
 this on other keyboards even the most 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:56.199
 old I have not met any flaw 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.330
 although if you for example take this 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:01.300
 keyboard per shooter or lpg 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:04.119
 well or strategy is a factor you will not 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.860
 important typing in this paragraph i would 

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:07.659
 just wanted to shake hands with an engineer 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.270
 who created this keyboard 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:11.979
 typing just great people too 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.779
 noticed that he began to print faster 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.939
 tactile sensation is very pleasant 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:17.860
 the stand perfectly fix the arms that 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:19.659
 important when typing 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.389
 hands around wrist don't get tired 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:24.249
 absolutely worth noting that having 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.809
 digital block on the block will help 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:28.089
 increase the number of hot keys 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:30.550
 your games and also simplify working with 

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:32.199
 digital multimedia documents and in 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.599
 this aspect of the device does not occur 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:36.459
 no questions and the keypad from f5 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.409
 up to f12 combined with extra 

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:40.869
 keys fn offers a wide range 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:42.939
 features you can use to flip a video or 

00:05:40.869 --> 00:05:44.979
 audio file click to pause completely 

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:47.110
 stop the pro from the work to remove 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:49.269
 sound or adjust it switch 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.550
 new tracks launch your media player 

00:05:49.269 --> 00:05:53.259
 let's go to the conclusions summing up 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.059
 This review would like to say that 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:56.800
 keyboard matt cath tract 

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:58.719
 proved to be a wonderful gaming 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.029
 a device that deserves to be on 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:02.409
 someone's desktop is beautiful 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:04.119
 balancing quality device 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:06.069
 daily ergonomics comfortable 

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:08.229
 membrane keys and wide 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:10.419
 customization options keyboard 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:12.339
 has a nice design that you can 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:14.110
 fine-tune in 

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:15.849
 I can say that this device 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.430
 can be your great helper 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:20.669
 as in the margins of the label battles and in terms of 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.669
 work 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.330
