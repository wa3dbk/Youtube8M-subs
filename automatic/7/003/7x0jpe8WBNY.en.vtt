 portal glass and finger all mobile 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.560
 entertainment on glafi.com 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.720
 Hello everyone, huvs and today we are 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.270
 talk about fresh premium brought 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.609
 store packages with equipment and delivered 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.150
 there are two medium tanks that are Soviet 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.930
 worth 4 levla a-32 and american 5 levela 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.699
 roam 2 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:37.280
 they will be sold only one week 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:39.300
 from November 21 to November 28 we will begin our conversation 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.890
 Naturally machine domestic 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.720
 production predecessor 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.010
 legendary t-34 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.390
 after all, it was built on a32 base when 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.390
 in the thirty-ninth year engineer 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.489
 presented finished samples a 20 and a-32 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.070
 Soviet command preference 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.600
 It was given exactly a-32 because of the greater 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.640
 armor and better weapons 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.860
 well, today we will also be friends 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.059
 compare this tank but in terms of the game 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.280
 world of tanks blitz 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.610
 you know what's the most important thing about this tank 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.689
 my opinion is very, very rare 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.549
 the computer version of the game he stands on 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.430
 seventh line list of the rarest 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.560
 tanks and there are more than 300 of them and if 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.720
 big brother brits a-32 could 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.270
 get only the composition of the packages where in 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.090
 load to him was a whole bunch of gold that 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.310
 raised the price of dasha 10 bucks and in sight 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.830
 will cost just six exactly at ten 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.960
 times less so the collector will be 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.760
 much easier to get him your hangar 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.410
 but we will not force friends 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.090
 technique to bathe in the hangar 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.760
 so let's start talking about combat 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.890
 characteristics of a-32 for vigorous cutting 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.860
 fights on it since a-32 is 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.810
 single medium tank 4 level 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.450
 we will be comparing it to fellow t28 and 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.670
 m3 americans who are not 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.100
 we will naturally make premium 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.229
 amendment to the preferential level of battles at a-32 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.510
 in the first place is to highlight it 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.880
 dynamics engine power 540 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.010
 horsepower allows you to set 20 tons a 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.080
 mut ang power density of almost 28 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.370
 horses per ton and combined with 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.039
 maximum speed all miss 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.170
 kilometers per hour and 32 worn on the map with 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.239
 amazing ease even everyone there 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.489
 heights do not notice and therefore 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.379
 ride it is a pleasure and a little 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.319
 who can get us at full speed 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.460
 among competitors only t28 possesses 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.620
 same mobility 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.990
 but compare the size of the tanks you became 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.150
 the tram is much easier but whether m3 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.850
 does not have crazy speed 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.610
 own tower and armor-32 also 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.710
 inferior competitors compare 128 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.590
 we will not be the last one to break through 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.600
 to all what is possible in the forehead of a person 2 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.640
 35 thick armor is located 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.190
 millimeters but its tilt angle is 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.530
 50 7 degrees means an indicator 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.380
 reduced armor is almost 51 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.660
 millimeter in m3 whether even thicker armor 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.850
 but it has large vulnerabilities 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.440
 in the frontal armor in the form of a mechvod hatch and 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.570
 huge commander tower 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.610
 so they are equal in frontal projection 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.670
 ability to start tank shots 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.500
 the third has yet to May 4 was going to 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.440
 no problem punching both tanks 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.770
 noua 32 have dynamics to leave 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.080
 shelling but m3 and and there is no tower armor 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.060
 open 2 has 35 millimeters in any 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.360
 projection capable of reflecting machine guns 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.640
 shots but no more than that what to play 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.980
 From the tower I do not advise better to use 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.830
 dynamics and aggressive style of play 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.320
 more sort of requires that by looking at 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.720
 numbers, many will say that the guns a-32 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.690
 terrible useless but I'm not with you 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.330
 I agree having alpha 160 units 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.800
 strength along with m3 does it have 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.680
 one feature unlike 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.390
 American it is installed on the tower 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.570
 so comfort from its use 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.730
 much higher low accuracy 053 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.440
 It makes playing at close range and 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.260
 good mobility allows you to twist 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.210
 unwieldy opponents time 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.740
 information in two three seconds is not 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.390
 interference as an indicator 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.940
 rate of fire is only five 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.370
 shots per minute with damage per minute ta 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.710
 same trouble he almost cover inferior 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.360
 indicators pumped oh technology NATO 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.960
 from the face of two right behind the preferential level 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.400
 fights yet because of the same kind of low 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.770
 armor penetration rate 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.620
 but for technique 2 through 4 brought it 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.970
 enough of the fifth lagoon advise 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.580
 picks only with land mines 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.380
 another feature of the guns is 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.220
 the presence of cumulative shells place 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.540
 subcaler ago 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.220
 but their armor penetration is only 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.660
 and meters above and therefore I advise 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.300
 use them only in single 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.930
 cases so charging places not 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.610
 land mines 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.100
 will be much more effective when you 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.990
 meet with a 5 level or phasing back 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.450
 he is only 20 millimeters of armor 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:44.320
 so he can easily catch a spank on 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.780
 200 of strength from a landmine in general a-32 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.880
 the most enduring st level 4 with good 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.220
 dynamic and quite with the quran instrument 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.930
 if you know how to use to destroy 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.590
 the opponent will be pretty fun 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.440
 by occupation 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.990
 I do not recommend this newbie tank because 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.780
 it is difficult to learn better take 2 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.030
 Valentine and there everything is simple but in 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.550
 experienced hands of 32 can bend down 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.390
 Random is not worse than any other tank 4 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.220
 level but now it's the turn 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.960
 Americans ram 2g do not often meet 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.120
 the battle that in the blitz that in the computer 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.780
 version of world of tanks he has only 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.220
 one classmate is german t25 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.470
 Once I bought a German from their computer 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.540
 versions for pumping crew on a cast and 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.160
 this tank has proven itself very well 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.260
 the positive side in almost all 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.180
 features except perhaps terrible 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.880
 agility and so it will 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.710
 An excellent comparison item. 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.970
 once noted that Americans are not 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.850
 concessional level fights 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:42.820
 so the developers put on roam 2 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:45.780
 and T25 guns with the expectation that they 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:49.420
 to destroy equipment and 7 left la 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.700
 possessing an alpha of 90 units n as m 34 co 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.680
 American has no punch punch 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.590
 same good accuracy and only a little 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.810
 inferior to the Germans but the rate of fire 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.390
 American engineers clearly spied on 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.830
 so our roam 2 is capable of releasing 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.480
 shells at enemy with speed 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.700
 sixteen and a half pieces per minute 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.070
 hence higher than the German 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.770
 rate of potential damage per minute 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.720
 time information is quite comfortable instrument 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.340
 manages to come down to and continuous 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.560
 firing so on middle distance 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.440
 You can shred opponents very 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.510
 effectively here were breaking through refers to 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.550
 the weak side of the gun 105 millimeters 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:27.010
 enough only for classmates and 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.380
 some sixes but 170 millimeters 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.570
 piercing piercing shells are capable 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:34.450
 pick open even the most evil opponent 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:36.640
 1 of and if you sum up on 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.129
 armament higher potential 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.839
 damage 

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:41.179
 and the ends are compensated by lower 

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:43.189
 armor penetration but bedside I'm here 

00:06:41.179 --> 00:06:45.249
 you can take a position with which you can see 

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:48.339
 weak projections of enemy armor 

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:50.659
 American dynamics clearly inferior to the Germans 

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:52.699
 indicators 2 I was clearly reminded 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:54.159
 mobility t1 heavy by which i 

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:57.289
 recently reviewed 

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:59.300
 16 horses per ton and 38 kilometers 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:01.159
 hour maximum speed all you need 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.330
 in order to have time to occupy 

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:04.099
 key positions 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.409
 but for such an aggressive game 

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:08.179
 the dynamics won't fit here 

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:10.939
 advantage over Germans 

00:07:08.179 --> 00:07:12.709
 is good agility if 

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:14.599
 German will be what turn will not fit 

00:07:12.709 --> 00:07:16.039
 avatar 2 can easily 

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:17.929
 maneuver on the ground 

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:19.039
 you can even try to earn it 

00:07:17.929 --> 00:07:21.619
 German colleague 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:23.809
 as far as booking r2 is quite 

00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:26.179
 able to play from the tower to like us 

00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:28.999
 shorter covers it almost completely yes 

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:30.589
 the tower itself is strong in general frontal 

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:33.429
 body projections have weak points 

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:36.949
 so I advise you to constantly move 

00:07:33.429 --> 00:07:39.379
 general and from on 32 and at epam 2 impressions 

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:40.159
 It turned out nice though they are not simple 

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:42.050
 in mastering 

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:44.509
 but in able hands I can repeat 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.719
 good farm and bend yes yes 

00:07:44.509 --> 00:07:48.709
 roam 2 I can advise how economical 

00:07:46.719 --> 00:07:51.159
 exotic option for earnings 

00:07:48.709 --> 00:07:51.159
 silver 

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.509
 if you have any questions or you 

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.580
 want to see more fights on them
