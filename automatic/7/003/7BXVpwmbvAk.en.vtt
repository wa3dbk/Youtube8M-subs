those<00:01:43.320> two<00:01:43.560> will<00:01:43.770> boost<00:01:43.979> your<00:01:44.130> DPS<00:01:44.520> by<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> lot

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
those two will boost your DPS by a lot

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.240 
those two will boost your DPS by a lot
on<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.750> spreadsheet<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.380> will<00:01:46.619> consider<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
on the spreadsheet it will consider the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.730 
on the spreadsheet it will consider the
slow<00:01:47.460> buff<00:01:47.700> up<00:01:47.909> time<00:01:48.119> on<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.299> mobs<00:01:48.570> has<00:01:49.049> 100%

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
slow buff up time on the mobs has 100%

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.010 
slow buff up time on the mobs has 100%
so<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.640> some<00:01:50.820> cases<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.360> might<00:01:51.509> be<00:01:51.689> inclined

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
so in some cases you might be inclined

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.109 
so in some cases you might be inclined
to think<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.500> lets<00:01:52.860> say<00:01:53.040> polar<00:01:53.310> station<00:01:53.850> is

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119
