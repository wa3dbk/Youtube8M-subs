with the same mic basically the same
thing<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.539> I<00:00:24.539> guess<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.830> see<00:00:26.820> what's<00:00:27.630> new

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
thing and I guess I see what's new

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.679 
thing and I guess I see what's new
oh<00:00:28.199> yeah<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.460> do<00:00:29.880> not<00:00:30.119> know<00:00:30.300> what<00:00:30.449> I'm<00:00:30.539> gonna

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
oh yeah so I do not know what I'm gonna

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.220 
oh yeah so I do not know what I'm gonna
make

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
make

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.280 
make
and<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.679> haven't<00:00:32.070> checked<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.669> pennants

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
and I haven't checked the pennants

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.530 
and I haven't checked the pennants
before<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.320> recorded<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.430> guess<00:00:35.730> now<00:00:36.149> is

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
before I recorded this so I guess now is

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:54.970 
before I recorded this so I guess now is
where<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.899> speed<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.469> up

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.389 

ergo<00:00:56.180> this<00:00:57.180> wrong<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.640> getting<00:00:59.640> really<00:01:00.210> high

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
ergo this wrong is getting really high

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.700 
ergo this wrong is getting really high

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.630 
sent an old non updated version because
I<00:01:26.060> forgot<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.899> said<00:01:28.170> ok<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:29.070> was<00:01:29.220> way<00:01:29.610> too

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
I forgot to so I said ok it was way too

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.600 
I forgot to so I said ok it was way too
hard<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.630> create<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.289> other<00:01:31.440> thing<00:01:31.800> so<00:01:32.490> I'm

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
hard to create the other thing so I'm

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.570 
hard to create the other thing so I'm
not<00:01:32.850> going<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.300> actually<00:01:34.050> redo<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.160> and<00:01:35.369> make

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
not going to actually redo it and make

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.630 
not going to actually redo it and make
it<00:01:35.610> perfect<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.440> I<00:01:37.470> guess<00:01:37.740> I'll<00:01:37.920> just<00:01:37.979> speed<00:01:38.490> up

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
it perfect so I guess I'll just speed up

00:01:38.640 --> 00:02:03.609 
it perfect so I guess I'll just speed up
the<00:01:39.270> building<00:01:39.929> of<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.920> boy

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.609

bye
let's<00:04:14.640> make<00:04:15.239> some<00:04:22.490> okay<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:23.850> I<00:04:24.630> guess<00:04:25.169> we'll

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
let's make some okay and I guess we'll

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.460 
let's make some okay and I guess we'll
just<00:04:25.380> have<00:04:25.560> one<00:04:25.919> more<00:04:26.160> alone<00:04:26.930> guy<00:04:27.930> one<00:04:28.440> more

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
just have one more alone guy one more

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:35.310 
just have one more alone guy one more
forever<00:04:29.010> alone<00:04:29.400> i<00:04:29.850> right<00:04:30.570> here

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.720 

so<00:04:36.320> it<00:04:36.440> just<00:04:36.560> sits<00:04:36.890> by<00:04:37.100> itself<00:04:37.460> and<00:04:38.830> I<00:04:39.830> guess

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
so it just sits by itself and I guess

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.940 
so it just sits by itself and I guess
we'll<00:04:40.940> just<00:04:41.120> make<00:04:41.360> a<00:04:41.690> chest<00:04:42.530> right<00:04:42.950> here<00:04:44.950> it's

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
we'll just make a chest right here it's

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.920 
we'll just make a chest right here it's
basically<00:04:46.400> when<00:04:46.820> you're<00:04:46.970> not<00:04:47.150> Stephanie<00:04:47.630> is

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
basically when you're not Stephanie is

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.730 
basically when you're not Stephanie is
this<00:04:48.860> mrs.<00:04:49.670> chest<00:04:50.060> the<00:04:50.210> back<00:04:50.390> down<00:04:50.810> there<00:04:51.080> but

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
this mrs. chest the back down there but

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.130 
this mrs. chest the back down there but
then<00:04:51.950> if<00:04:52.160> I<00:04:52.280> get<00:04:52.490> a<00:04:52.790> golden<00:04:53.300> shovel<00:04:53.510> a<00:04:53.900> key<00:04:53.960> a

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
then if I get a golden shovel a key a

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.560 
then if I get a golden shovel a key a
lockpick<00:04:54.830> I<00:04:55.040> can<00:04:55.310> go<00:04:55.460> and<00:04:56.210> there<00:04:57.140> it<00:04:57.350> is<00:04:57.500> just

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
lockpick I can go and there it is just

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.550 
lockpick I can go and there it is just
locked<00:04:59.770> unlocked<00:05:00.770> they're<00:05:01.550> perfect<00:05:02.560> further

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
locked unlocked they're perfect further

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.830 
locked unlocked they're perfect further
and<00:05:04.280> then<00:05:04.430> all<00:05:04.550> right<00:05:04.700> in<00:05:04.850> parentheses<00:05:05.480> close

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
and then all right in parentheses close

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:24.659 
and then all right in parentheses close
enough

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:36.400 

so<00:05:25.990> that<00:05:28.120> and<00:05:29.120> then<00:05:29.300> we'll<00:05:29.600> just<00:05:29.810> dude<00:05:35.410> they're

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
so that and then we'll just dude they're

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:37.390 
so that and then we'll just dude they're
perfect

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
perfect

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.730 
perfect
okay<00:05:37.729> so<00:05:38.630> I<00:05:39.130> guess<00:05:40.130> now<00:05:40.430> is<00:05:40.820> just<00:05:41.570> time<00:05:41.900> to

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
okay so I guess now is just time to

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.240 
okay so I guess now is just time to
create<00:05:43.430> the<00:05:43.970> roof<00:05:44.210> this<00:05:44.840> totally<00:05:45.620> wasn't<00:05:45.860> what

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
create the roof this totally wasn't what

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.870 
create the roof this totally wasn't what
I<00:05:46.280> expected<00:05:46.600> it<00:05:47.600> to<00:05:47.810> be<00:05:47.990> in<00:05:48.020> the<00:05:48.440> end<00:05:48.680> but<00:05:49.250> it's

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
I expected it to be in the end but it's

00:05:49.880 --> 00:06:07.280 
I expected it to be in the end but it's
good<00:05:50.720> enough

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.180 

so<00:06:07.800> one<00:06:08.040> more<00:06:08.280> touch<00:06:08.640> and<00:06:09.000> that<00:06:09.030> is<00:06:09.810> I<00:06:10.190> shall

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
so one more touch and that is I shall

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.190
