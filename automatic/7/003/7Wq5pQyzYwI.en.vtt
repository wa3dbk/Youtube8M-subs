to destroy it in his back his be faced
toward<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.520> because<00:00:44.700> he<00:00:44.789> can<00:00:44.879> do<00:00:44.969> 180<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.660> then

the<00:01:39.540> fountain<00:01:40.200> next<00:01:40.890> or<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.430> front<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
the fountain next or in front of the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.819 
the fountain next or in front of the
church<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.450> also<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.350> front<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.649> mansion

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
church and also in front of the mansion

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.190 
church and also in front of the mansion
now<00:01:44.579> nobody<00:01:45.030> could<00:01:45.360> find<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:45.990> here's

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
now nobody could find this but here's

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.319 
now nobody could find this but here's
how<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.380> actually<00:01:46.560> found<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.159> basically<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.000> was

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
how I actually found it basically I was

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.899 
how I actually found it basically I was
playing<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.689> game<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.799> went<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.490> maze<00:01:50.729> in

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
playing a game and I went to the maze in

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.569 
playing a game and I went to the maze in
the<00:01:51.000> back<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.689> saw<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.399> fountain<00:01:53.399> there

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
the back and I saw the fountain there

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.340 
the back and I saw the fountain there
and<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.000> blew<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.299> up<00:01:54.420> with<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.689> ray<00:01:54.899> gun<00:01:55.079> mark<00:01:55.290> 2

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
and I blew it up with the ray gun mark 2

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.770 
and I blew it up with the ray gun mark 2
and<00:01:55.799> then<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.310> heard<00:01:56.460> Leroy<00:01:56.880> making<00:01:57.270> noises<00:01:57.479> so

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
and then I heard Leroy making noises so

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.639 
and then I heard Leroy making noises so
I'm<00:01:57.899> like<00:01:57.990> wait<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.259> minute<00:01:58.439> wait<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.590> minute

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
I'm like wait a minute wait a minute

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.010 
I'm like wait a minute wait a minute
Leroy<00:01:59.460> his<00:01:59.640> back<00:01:59.820> here<00:02:00.090> does<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.780> mean<00:02:00.990> that

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
Leroy his back here does that mean that

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.050 
Leroy his back here does that mean that
he<00:02:01.200> has<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.500> dis<00:02:01.649> recently<00:02:02.100> back<00:02:02.250> here<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:03.030> I

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
he has to dis recently back here so I

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.490 
he has to dis recently back here so I
thought<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.540> was<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.780> fountain<00:02:04.140> back<00:02:04.290> there

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
thought it was the fountain back there

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.380 
thought it was the fountain back there
but<00:02:04.829> apparently<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.460> wasn't<00:02:05.640> cuz<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:05.939> tried<00:02:06.240> it

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
but apparently it wasn't cuz I tried it

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.240 
but apparently it wasn't cuz I tried it
and<00:02:06.540> he<00:02:06.659> just<00:02:06.869> ran<00:02:07.079> into<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.439> then<00:02:07.590> ran<00:02:07.770> past<00:02:08.009> it

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
and he just ran into it then ran past it

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.609 
and he just ran into it then ran past it
so<00:02:08.340> I'm<00:02:08.399> like<00:02:08.550> well<00:02:09.119> maybe<00:02:09.239> that's<00:02:09.599> not<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.989> but

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
so I'm like well maybe that's not it but

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.930 
so I'm like well maybe that's not it but
what<00:02:10.800> else<00:02:10.920> could<00:02:11.039> he<00:02:11.160> destroyed<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.790> then<00:02:11.879> I

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
what else could he destroyed and then I

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.260 
what else could he destroyed and then I
thought

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
thought

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.940 
thought
I'm<00:02:12.570> like<00:02:12.720> wait<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.960> minute<00:02:13.170> there's<00:02:13.890> a

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
I'm like wait a minute there's a

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.610 
I'm like wait a minute there's a
fountain<00:02:14.310> outside<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.050> maze<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.560> the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
fountain outside of the maze in the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.190 
fountain outside of the maze in the
actual<00:02:17.550> part<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.420> front<00:02:18.690> part<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.020> map

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
actual part of the front part of the map

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.320 
actual part of the front part of the map
so<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:19.710> was<00:02:19.860> like<00:02:19.980> wait<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.280> minute<00:02:20.550> does<00:02:21.120> he<00:02:21.240> have

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
so I was like wait a minute does he have

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.560 
so I was like wait a minute does he have
to<00:02:21.420> destroy<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:22.320> I<00:02:22.920> tried<00:02:23.130> it<00:02:23.280> out<00:02:23.340> and

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
to destroy that and I tried it out and

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.730 
to destroy that and I tried it out and
apparently<00:02:24.570> it<00:02:24.660> worked<00:02:24.870> now<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.260> think<00:02:25.620> the

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
apparently it worked now I think the

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.190 
apparently it worked now I think the
reason<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.340> think<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.150> way<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:27.330> treyarch<00:02:27.960> or

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
reason I think the way that treyarch or

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.900 
reason I think the way that treyarch or
whoever<00:02:28.620> made<00:02:28.920> these<00:02:29.100> achievements<00:02:29.280> came<00:02:29.760> up

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
whoever made these achievements came up

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.380 
whoever made these achievements came up
with<00:02:30.030> them<00:02:30.260> they<00:02:31.260> thought<00:02:31.560> they<00:02:31.710> they<00:02:32.390> use

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
with them they thought they they use

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.110 
with them they thought they they use
your<00:02:33.540> words<00:02:33.630> geez<00:02:34.170> they<00:02:35.160> thought<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.400> the

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
your words geez they thought that the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.220 
your words geez they thought that the
way<00:02:36.240> people<00:02:36.390> were<00:02:36.540> going<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.720> find<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.020> because

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
way people were going to find it because

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.840 
way people were going to find it because
you<00:02:37.680> people<00:02:38.010> didn't<00:02:38.310> really<00:02:38.460> know<00:02:38.580> how

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
you people didn't really know how

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.310 
you people didn't really know how
initially<00:02:39.240> how<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.450> use<00:02:39.750> him<00:02:39.960> they<00:02:40.110> didn't

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
initially how to use him they didn't

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.690 
initially how to use him they didn't
know<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:40.440> had<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.680> face<00:02:41.040> towards<00:02:41.460> where<00:02:41.610> you

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
know you had a face towards where you

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.220 
know you had a face towards where you
want<00:02:41.880> him<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.120> run<00:02:42.300> in<00:02:42.540> his<00:02:42.660> back<00:02:42.870> had<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.140> be

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
want him to run in his back had to be

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.720 
want him to run in his back had to be
turned<00:02:43.380> so<00:02:43.950> maybe<00:02:44.130> they<00:02:44.280> were<00:02:44.340> thinking

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
turned so maybe they were thinking

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.430 
turned so maybe they were thinking
because<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.360> water<00:02:45.630> fountain<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:45.960> directly

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
because the water fountain is directly

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.410 
because the water fountain is directly
in<00:02:46.680> front<00:02:46.710> of<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.580> church<00:02:47.880> that<00:02:48.180> when<00:02:48.330> they

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
in front of the church that when they

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.760 
in front of the church that when they
actually<00:02:48.570> went<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.900> go<00:02:49.020> destroy<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.560> church

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
actually went to go destroy the church

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.440 
actually went to go destroy the church
debris<00:02:50.160> they<00:02:50.610> would<00:02:50.760> have<00:02:50.850> made<00:02:51.000> him<00:02:51.150> run<00:02:51.390> the

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
debris they would have made him run the

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.450 
debris they would have made him run the
wrong<00:02:51.720> way<00:02:51.920> accidentally<00:02:52.920> destroying<00:02:53.310> the

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
wrong way accidentally destroying the

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.950 
wrong way accidentally destroying the
fountain<00:02:53.880> I<00:02:54.090> think<00:02:54.510> that's<00:02:54.630> how<00:02:54.750> they<00:02:54.870> would

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
fountain I think that's how they would

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.820 
fountain I think that's how they would
have<00:02:55.080> thought<00:02:55.200> they<00:02:55.350> would<00:02:55.380> have<00:02:55.560> found<00:02:55.650> it

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
have thought they would have found it

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.010 
have thought they would have found it
i'm<00:02:56.280> not<00:02:56.430> sure<00:02:56.490> if<00:02:56.640> anyone's<00:02:57.000> if<00:02:57.270> anyone<00:02:57.930> else

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
i'm not sure if anyone's if anyone else

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.420 
i'm not sure if anyone's if anyone else
has<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.290> tutorial<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:58.950> took<00:02:59.070> about<00:02:59.250> this

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
has a tutorial and you took about this

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.760 
has a tutorial and you took about this
yet<00:02:59.640> but<00:02:59.670> um<00:03:00.090> hopefully<00:03:00.750> on<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.080> first<00:03:01.380> maybe

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
yet but um hopefully on the first maybe

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.460 
yet but um hopefully on the first maybe
not<00:03:01.980> though<00:03:02.220> but<00:03:02.550> if<00:03:02.820> you<00:03:03.030> this<00:03:03.240> did<00:03:03.480> if<00:03:04.350> you

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
not though but if you this did if you
