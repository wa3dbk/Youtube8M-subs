it to plan to fight back against an

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.900 
it to plan to fight back against an
enemy<00:00:48.960> we<00:00:49.350> would<00:00:49.680> know<00:00:49.830> absolutely<00:00:50.550> nothing

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
enemy we would know absolutely nothing

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.140 
enemy we would know absolutely nothing
about<00:00:51.690> well<00:00:52.680> that's<00:00:52.860> absolutely<00:00:53.190> true<00:00:53.430> but<00:00:54.059> at

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
about well that's absolutely true but at

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.150 
about well that's absolutely true but at
the<00:00:54.239> same<00:00:54.390> time<00:00:54.719> we<00:00:55.379> make<00:00:55.620> all<00:00:55.770> kinds<00:00:56.070> of

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
the same time we make all kinds of

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.860 
the same time we make all kinds of
contingency<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.910> war<00:00:57.090> plans<00:00:57.420> against

enemies that we never expected to face

enemies that we never expected to face
in<00:00:59.790> combat<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.170> idea<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.649> maybe<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
in combat and so the idea that maybe the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.130 
in combat and so the idea that maybe the
enemy<00:01:02.489> will<00:01:02.789> have<00:01:02.820> something<00:01:03.360> technological

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
enemy will have something technological

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.620 
enemy will have something technological
or<00:01:04.830> doctrinal<00:01:05.399> that<00:01:05.670> we've<00:01:05.789> never<00:01:06.030> foreseen

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
or doctrinal that we've never foreseen

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.840 
or doctrinal that we've never foreseen
is<00:01:06.930> something<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.770> try<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.009> plan<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.640> any

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
is something that we try to plan for any

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.870 
is something that we try to plan for any
way<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.210> we<00:01:09.270> can<00:01:09.479> well<00:01:10.410> obviously<00:01:10.680> if<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:11.700> did

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
way that we can well obviously if we did

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.389 
way that we can well obviously if we did
get<00:01:12.090> invaded<00:01:12.600> these<00:01:13.050> aliens<00:01:13.530> would<00:01:13.710> be<00:01:13.770> much

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
get invaded these aliens would be much

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.040 
get invaded these aliens would be much
more<00:01:14.640> technologically<00:01:15.330> advanced<00:01:15.630> than<00:01:15.869> we

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
more technologically advanced than we

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.749 
more technologically advanced than we
are<00:01:16.080> because<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:17.100> didn't<00:01:17.340> even<00:01:17.430> know<00:01:17.610> they

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
are because we didn't even know they

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.850 
are because we didn't even know they
were<00:01:17.789> there<00:01:18.200> how<00:01:19.200> would<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.680> go<00:01:19.830> about

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
were there how would you go about

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.070 
were there how would you go about
fighting<00:01:20.340> an<00:01:20.580> enemy<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:20.910> was<00:01:21.210> just<00:01:21.570> so

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
fighting an enemy that was just so

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.190 
fighting an enemy that was just so
infinitely<00:01:22.950> superior<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:24.000> technology<00:01:24.570> well

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
infinitely superior and technology well

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.839 
infinitely superior and technology well
you<00:01:25.649> the<00:01:25.920> first<00:01:26.130> thing<00:01:26.250> you'd<00:01:26.369> want<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.610> try<00:01:26.759> to

00:01:26.839 --> 00:01:26.849 
you the first thing you'd want to try to

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:29.150 
you the first thing you'd want to try to
do<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.270> preserve<00:01:27.840> your<00:01:28.170> forces<00:01:28.619> as<00:01:28.770> best<00:01:28.979> you

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
do is preserve your forces as best you

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.130 
do is preserve your forces as best you
could<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:30.240> would<00:01:30.360> want<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.569> learn<00:01:30.750> as<00:01:30.990> much

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
could you would want to learn as much

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.690 
could you would want to learn as much
about<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.560> enemy<00:01:31.860> as<00:01:31.950> possible<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.670> that

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
about the enemy as possible and that

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.580 
about the enemy as possible and that
would<00:01:32.910> mean<00:01:33.090> things<00:01:33.780> like<00:01:33.869> trying<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.380> find

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
would mean things like trying to find

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.230 
would mean things like trying to find
vulnerabilities<00:01:34.849> trying<00:01:35.849> to<00:01:36.000> capture

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
vulnerabilities trying to capture

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.320 
vulnerabilities trying to capture
technology<00:01:37.080> but<00:01:37.950> survival<00:01:38.550> is<00:01:38.700> your<00:01:39.090> first

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
technology but survival is your first

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.660 
technology but survival is your first
priority<00:01:39.569> because<00:01:40.200> if<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.979> send<00:01:41.340> all<00:01:41.459> of<00:01:41.490> your

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
priority because if you send all of your

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.339 
priority because if you send all of your
forces<00:01:42.090> into<00:01:42.300> the<00:01:42.390> field<00:01:42.660> and<00:01:42.990> have<00:01:43.170> them

00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:43.349 
forces into the field and have them

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:45.770 
forces into the field and have them
destroyed<00:01:43.770> by<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.209> superior<00:01:45.209> enemy<00:01:45.360> force

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
destroyed by that superior enemy force

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.630 
destroyed by that superior enemy force
then<00:01:46.500> when<00:01:46.709> you<00:01:46.830> do<00:01:47.099> find<00:01:47.459> a<00:01:47.550> vulnerability

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
then when you do find a vulnerability

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.520 
then when you do find a vulnerability
you<00:01:48.179> won't<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.539> any<00:01:48.720> opportunity<00:01:49.500> to

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
you won't have any opportunity to

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.949 
you won't have any opportunity to
exploit<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.190> what<00:01:51.179> do<00:01:51.330> you<00:01:51.390> think<00:01:51.660> would<00:01:51.810> be

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:51.959 
exploit it what do you think would be

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:53.900 
exploit it what do you think would be
the<00:01:52.080> alien<00:01:52.200> plan<00:01:52.770> what<00:01:53.160> would<00:01:53.310> they<00:01:53.429> do<00:01:53.489> first

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
the alien plan what would they do first

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.359 
the alien plan what would they do first
that<00:01:54.840> really<00:01:54.869> depends<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:55.619> why<00:01:55.950> they're<00:01:56.220> here

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
that really depends on why they're here

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.279 
that really depends on why they're here
in<00:01:56.489> the<00:01:56.580> first<00:01:56.759> place<00:01:57.060> if<00:01:57.390> they're<00:01:57.840> here<00:01:58.080> for

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
in the first place if they're here for

in the first place if they're here for
the<00:01:58.560> extraction<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.489> specific<00:01:59.940> resource

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
the extraction of a specific resource

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.359 
the extraction of a specific resource
for<00:02:00.569> example<00:02:00.660> they<00:02:01.500> might<00:02:01.739> want<00:02:02.039> to<00:02:02.099> just

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
for example they might want to just

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.490 
for example they might want to just
eliminate<00:02:02.580> any<00:02:03.080> resistance<00:02:04.080> that<00:02:04.289> might

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
eliminate any resistance that might

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.710 
eliminate any resistance that might
block<00:02:04.770> them<00:02:05.099> from<00:02:05.280> their<00:02:05.459> objective<00:02:05.970> if<00:02:06.450> on

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
block them from their objective if on

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.660 
block them from their objective if on
the<00:02:06.840> other<00:02:06.929> hand<00:02:07.020> their<00:02:07.380> goal<00:02:07.590> was<00:02:07.950> actual

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
the other hand their goal was actual

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.969 
the other hand their goal was actual
occupation<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.569> conquest<00:02:10.110> then<00:02:10.709> they<00:02:10.860> would

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
occupation and conquest then they would

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.680 
occupation and conquest then they would
probably<00:02:11.069> have<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.520> prioritize<00:02:11.760> anything

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
probably have to prioritize anything

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.210 
probably have to prioritize anything
that<00:02:12.810> they<00:02:12.900> perceive<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.349> be<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.620> threat<00:02:13.680> to

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
that they perceive to be a threat to

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.550 
that they perceive to be a threat to
their<00:02:14.730> own<00:02:14.849> dominance<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:15.930> that<00:02:16.470> would

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
their own dominance and so that would

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.260 
their own dominance and so that would
probably<00:02:16.770> start<00:02:17.280> by<00:02:17.340> wiping<00:02:17.700> out<00:02:18.000> as<00:02:18.150> many

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
probably start by wiping out as many

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.390 
probably start by wiping out as many
communications<00:02:19.050> networks<00:02:19.440> as<00:02:19.620> possible<00:02:20.129> and

communications networks as possible and

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.119

eliminating<00:02:21.390> as<00:02:21.510> many<00:02:21.540> weapons<00:02:22.440> as<00:02:22.890> might

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
eliminating as many weapons as might

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.309 
eliminating as many weapons as might
represent<00:02:23.849> some<00:02:24.090> form<00:02:24.330> of<00:02:24.390> threat<00:02:24.690> either<00:02:24.989> to

represent some form of threat either to

represent some form of threat either to
them<00:02:25.560> or<00:02:26.069> to<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.700> resources<00:02:27.270> that<00:02:27.420> they're

them or to the resources that they're

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.360 
them or to the resources that they're
trying<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.930> extract<00:02:28.349> so<00:02:28.950> they<00:02:29.069> might<00:02:29.250> very

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
trying to extract so they might very

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.950 
trying to extract so they might very
well<00:02:29.489> want<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.940> counter<00:02:30.360> every<00:02:30.510> nuclear

well want to counter every nuclear

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.870

weapon not because it represented a
threat<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.300> them<00:02:33.450> but<00:02:33.660> the

threat to them but the
