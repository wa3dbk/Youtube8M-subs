00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 good guys the gt5 video online here 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.779
 we are back with subscribers and 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.610
 quiet is a race this 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.429
 race that has been a start a bit 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.990
 strange in like eight tractors on top of 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.820
 lancia that I know is this year of duty and 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.770
 could impact a little public 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.300
 but calm that it is a race not 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.400
 there's nothing strange to the sexy state of 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.130
 back with tractors and my mother 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.810
 tractors that are wanted and are being 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.670
 falling has advanced and this is very rare 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.109
 everything and I do not know that even when this is 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.990
 ended with my life gave playing this 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.910
 kind of racing seriously 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.649
 I always have my goal in winning and 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:42.809
 It fell like a beach umbrella stuck in 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:47.070
 the sand uncle so much the sand what I'm 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.120
 saying is that we are at the eye point 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.170
 you are worth the wall with I appear because 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.989
 they wanted is another point that is going to be a 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.550
 so much villar complex to see to see 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.110
 see a moment seems if what we are 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.219
 ahead first obviously you will already have 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.360
 first behind sometimes some 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.160
 strange 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.719
 we try first guys you do not look 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.930
 allusions but I think so 6 when 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.340
 first, it is worth varying perfect perfect 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.979
 valero I have points 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.000
 there were six control points and they are 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.810
 living tractors in the head 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.810
 exploding and I'm scared 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.010
 the first 20 diego clean me as you see 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.300
 but because exploiting what I understand is worth 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.530
 I do not know if something more will have to be done 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.210
 complicated this more money has been 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.530
 explaining totally impacted with the 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.180
 This vehicle's speed is totally 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.800
 amazing is how oh my god is a 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.630
 vehicle is a super interstellar fighter 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.220
 of the year 2020 I have no idea uncle but 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.220
 it's incredibly fast really 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.770
 some want to crash me and others 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:53.040
 then some tried it to dodge 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:54.710
 when it really is not the goal god 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.119
 really holy what speed 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.220
 that serious this speed I think that 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.060
 right now for me who has all his 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.380
 hair on his face 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.270
 disheveled from the great speed carries 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.700
 behind twisted good so a very career 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.690
 cut it down so I think we can give it to 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.730
 another one that I think it turns 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.650
 with the fastest vehicles of gta 5 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.300
 online and I'm with the same 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.530
 subscribers because it helps us the 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.800
 revenge months win me I think it's 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.800
 all right 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.240
 tractors here 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:33.360
 thanks at first the 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.740
 writers did with Christmas they 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.270
 they will have had enough of polvorones and like that 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.860
 the suppliers offers accept a little 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.120
 the reflexes to see then why do not you 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.360
 it looks very good the eyes races that do not 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.360
 I arrive 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:49.260
 worth the head 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.400
 ok follows a first that passes the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.170
 subscribers arrives arrived arrived at the site 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.300
 has missed getting hooked with the networks is 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.550
 of the typical ones when you have visitors 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.560
 and you get hooked not what a lot of people 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.030
 I have fallen for a piece of guys 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.250
 I go first but here the writers do not 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.540
 they plant good face that relative because 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.950
 I just dropped one during which I did not 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.120
 he wants to win the race and he's going right now 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.980
 ahead or there the one that remains to finish 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.350
 and that I do not like anything guys the thing is 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.990
 Complicated is that this is really 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.640
 as an epic ending but to 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.740
 slow motion you know 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.840
 I can train you a train a picture I think 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.840
 I have been and stop jumping left him 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.470
 confirmed 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.650
 Oh my God 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.709
 that something does not happen 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:55.860
 fighting for me to win 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.860
 well then at the end almost pathetic 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.590
 you can not be a confident winner 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:15.330
 not because it looks like you're going to win but it's 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:15.330
 that at least 20 giants like stefan 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.660
 62 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.479
 yes
