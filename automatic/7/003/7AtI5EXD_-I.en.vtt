00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
she just in terms of you know what they

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.860 
she just in terms of you know what they
what<00:00:32.910> they<00:00:32.940> would<00:00:33.239> think<00:00:33.420> we<00:00:33.570> should<00:00:33.750> do

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
what they would think we should do

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.100 
what they would think we should do
because<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.770> it's<00:00:35.219> quite<00:00:35.430> simple<00:00:35.989> despite<00:00:36.989> all

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
because so it's quite simple despite all

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.479 
because so it's quite simple despite all
the<00:00:37.200> speculation<00:00:37.890> despite<00:00:38.070> all<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
the speculation despite all the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.940 
the speculation despite all the
newspaper<00:00:38.879> column<00:00:39.180> inches<00:00:39.510> we<00:00:40.469> have<00:00:40.590> no<00:00:40.739> bids

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
newspaper column inches we have no bids

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.319 
newspaper column inches we have no bids
we've<00:00:41.850> had<00:00:42.000> no<00:00:42.960> inquiries<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:44.280> Willie's<00:00:45.149> with

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
we've had no inquiries and Willie's with

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.619 
we've had no inquiries and Willie's with
us<00:00:46.430> as<00:00:47.430> long<00:00:47.460> as<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.760> possibly<00:00:48.090> can<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.510> so

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
us as long as you possibly can be so

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.180 
us as long as you possibly can be so
that<00:00:48.750> velocity<00:00:49.200> that's<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.770> position<00:00:49.920> that

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
that velocity that's the position that

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.080 
that velocity that's the position that
sort<00:00:50.550> up<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.820> date<00:00:52.520> no<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.550> think<00:00:53.850> that

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
sort up to date no I think that

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.060 
sort up to date no I think that
obviously<00:00:54.329> Darby<00:00:54.809> hasn't<00:00:55.140> really<00:00:55.710> been<00:00:55.920> in

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
obviously Darby hasn't really been in

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.389 
obviously Darby hasn't really been in
this<00:00:56.190> position<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.760> recent<00:00:57.120> years<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.660> we<00:00:58.559> we

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
this position in recent years so we we

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
do have to accept that we have a player

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.619 
do have to accept that we have a player
who<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.469> covered<00:01:01.920> highly<00:01:02.219> coveted<00:01:02.430> by<00:01:02.910> by<00:01:03.570> the

ourselves tomorrow the reason for that

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.200 
ourselves tomorrow the reason for that
and<00:03:53.820> solving<00:03:54.900> you<00:03:55.900> can<00:03:56.140> get<00:03:56.320> fee<00:03:56.590> for

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
and solving you can get fee for

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.090 
and solving you can get fee for

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:33.700 
of that is probably not true as well but

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.970 
of that is probably not true as well but
you're<00:07:33.820> seeing<00:07:34.120> just<00:07:34.630> as<00:07:34.750> a<00:07:34.900> bit<00:07:35.110> and<00:07:35.230> today

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:35.980 
you're seeing just as a bit and today

today<00:07:36.760> we<00:07:36.940> made<00:07:37.120> some<00:07:37.300> good<00:07:37.419> progress<00:07:37.600> in

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:37.930 
today we made some good progress in

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.350 
today we made some good progress in
terms<00:07:38.290> of<00:07:38.590> recruitment<00:07:39.550> of<00:07:39.790> some<00:07:39.970> additional

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:40.360 
terms of recruitment of some additional

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.150 
terms of recruitment of some additional
or<00:07:40.900> additional<00:07:41.260> players<00:07:41.500> into<00:07:41.830> the<00:07:41.919> squad

or additional players into the squad

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.830 
or additional players into the squad
which<00:07:42.340> I<00:07:42.460> think<00:07:42.640> will<00:07:42.729> be<00:07:42.850> exhausted<00:07:43.270> so<00:07:43.419> the

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:43.840 
which I think will be exhausted so the

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.600 
which I think will be exhausted so the
sudden<00:07:44.140> I<00:07:44.200> think<00:07:44.350> it<00:07:44.410> goes<00:07:44.560> both<00:07:44.770> ways<00:07:45.070> we

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:45.610 
sudden I think it goes both ways we

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.460 
sudden I think it goes both ways we
probably<00:07:46.030> are<00:07:46.330> entering<00:07:46.630> a<00:07:46.720> phase<00:07:46.900> now<00:07:47.229> with

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:47.470 
probably are entering a phase now with

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:48.750 
probably are entering a phase now with
are<00:07:47.650> given<00:07:47.950> a<00:07:48.010> bit<00:07:48.130> of<00:07:48.250> column<00:07:48.370> inches<00:07:48.550> a

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:48.760 
are given a bit of column inches a
