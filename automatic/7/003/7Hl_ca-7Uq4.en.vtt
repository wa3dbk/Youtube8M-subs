were about $80 for the pair speakers and
I<00:01:10.220> looked<00:01:11.220> all<00:01:11.340> over<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.610> mean<00:01:11.820> there<00:01:11.970> were

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
I looked all over I mean there were

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.789 
I looked all over I mean there were
speakers<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.570> were<00:01:12.630> $600<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> pair<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.680> I'm

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
speakers that were $600 a pair and I'm

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.710 
speakers that were $600 a pair and I'm
not<00:01:13.950> there's<00:01:14.280> no<00:01:14.400> way<00:01:14.520> I'm<00:01:14.640> spending<00:01:14.729> $600<00:01:15.509> per

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
not there's no way I'm spending $600 per

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.740 
not there's no way I'm spending $600 per
speaker<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.259> these<00:01:16.710> were<00:01:16.860> 80<00:01:17.600> pretty<00:01:18.600> much

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
speaker so these were 80 pretty much

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.440 
speaker so these were 80 pretty much

they're<00:01:27.330> much<00:01:27.540> much<00:01:27.750> better<00:01:28.049> than<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
they're much much better than the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.710 
they're much much better than the
factory<00:01:29.130> speakers<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:31.850> they're<00:01:32.850> reasonably

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
factory speakers and they're reasonably

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.219 
factory speakers and they're reasonably
priced<00:01:33.990> as<00:01:34.170> well<00:01:34.320> also<00:01:35.420> that<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.900> company

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
priced as well also that the company

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.100 
priced as well also that the company
included<00:01:38.600> with<00:01:39.600> these<00:01:39.920> wiring<00:01:40.920> adapters

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
included with these wiring adapters

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.380 
included with these wiring adapters
these<00:01:43.280> adapters<00:01:44.280> I'm<00:01:44.670> not<00:01:44.939> sure<00:01:45.119> we'll<00:01:45.270> have

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
these adapters I'm not sure we'll have

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.580 
these adapters I'm not sure we'll have
to<00:01:45.450> get<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.659> doors<00:01:45.810> open<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.229> figure<00:01:46.409> out<00:01:46.439> how

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
to get the doors open and figure out how

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.960 
to get the doors open and figure out how
those<00:01:46.770> work<00:01:47.070> these<00:01:47.670> are<00:01:47.759> pretty

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
those work these are pretty

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.120 
those work these are pretty
self-explanatory<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.649> also<00:01:49.799> got<00:01:50.009> these

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
self-explanatory and I also got these

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.460 
self-explanatory and I also got these
speaker<00:01:50.549> baffles<00:01:50.970> now<00:01:51.350> from<00:01:52.350> my

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
speaker baffles now from my

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.170 
speaker baffles now from my
understanding<00:01:53.040> from<00:01:53.189> my<00:01:53.579> research<00:01:53.970> the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
understanding from my research the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.569 
understanding from my research the
reason<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.600> these<00:01:54.780> speakers<00:01:55.340> tend<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.430> die

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
reason that these speakers tend to die

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.569 
reason that these speakers tend to die
this<00:01:56.909> seems<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.240> be<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.360> problem<00:01:57.810> with<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.280> GM

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579
