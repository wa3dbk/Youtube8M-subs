00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:10.480
 We had to react somehow to the result of the last match and today the guys proved that it was just a misunderstanding. 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:24.080
 When there are such defeats, I want to overcome something as soon as possible. The next match and "Siauliai" occurred after our very good attitude. They're a bad team. 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:39.500
 And for the first 20 minutes they played well, but we were lucky, we got a lot. I'm pleased how the guys reacted to that last defeat. 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:52.880
 You know, so matched that E.Zarskis was punished for the first match, L.Artimavičius had not yet acquired a normal form because he was traumatized. 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:05.280
 He also spent his last camp in Cyprus. That's why they played together. J.Raziūnas was playing because Beneta suffered an injury, but we also want to include it. 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:17.400
 I think these three defenders are not bad at the game, although there were mistakes, but I am happy with them. 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:38.000
 A.Paniukovas is not a bad player, criticism has come, invited him to the team, and is monitored by F.Capello. The team does a lot of things for it - it takes away the balls, fights. 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.260
 And he creates opportunities for him, so his task is to score what he does, even though he could have scored more today.
