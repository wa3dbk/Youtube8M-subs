 Guadalajara to the passage of the great savanna long task

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.430
 chair 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.280
 as you know 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.520
 if they know how to read, I suppose they have already realized that the video will be 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.280
 those who can not read because they are 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.479

 secured out 13 help to fs 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.500
 beach boyero this generates a transformation share of the thousand apples in 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.500
 the community to make it more 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.220
 arrived 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.010
 and do not you know what 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.140
 josé mena pajares 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.140
 he ratified that 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.870
 we are going to do 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.959
 do not miss the carmen estefan 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.349
 but his attacks are 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.349
 3 the head of the school 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:24.269
 the school if not them 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:25.979
 it only represents the image 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.539
 a book called iva 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:31.999
 that's why it's shaped like a na 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:34.509
 jones is ranked number five 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:39.069
 and at number four someone they already know and if they do not know it is 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.369
 because they are scary that prefer to keep spike any game of disney 

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:47.280
 that will not contain violent scenes at number four 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.340
 Monica nothing more, nothing less than 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.450
 creamer countries with the intention of stealing this monster is very much like a 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.759
 pterodactyl only that smaller 

00:02:55.759 --> 00:03:00.069
 this monster gets the number four position because you find it in 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.289
 almost the whole game and it's very hard to get rid of it unless you 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:08.549
 you order to take for ass with a firearm this enemy is able to pursue 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.109
 that by minutes and is very annoying because when you think that you already lost sight of it 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.129
 you turn back and ccoo surprises you realize that all the time you have 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.409
 been following 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:22.359
 the meaning of this monster like that of explained jean is not very 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.540
 interesting since it's almost the same it just represents a drawing that 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.409
 found in alessa's favorite book called 'the lost world' with him the 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:34.199
 itf luther is the same thing but its alternative version is that it only 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:38.739
 found in the dark gil zaidín and is much more powerful and resistant 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.819
 and in the position number three in the ass I put the stress hahahahahaha the 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.939
 put number 3 sword 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:46.890
 in the post no 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.279
 but three are 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:53.109
 it's not shit yankee singing her shit song called breaks 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:54.870
 although this monster appears 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.509
 in few areas of the game it is fast and big 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:00.799
 just when you want to attack it is thrown at your feet and deep 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.650
 after love days while you're on the ground 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.859
 which greatly affects the energy level since the damage is very strong 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.749
 also accustomed to attacking by surprise what sometimes we get 

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:15.609
 good scares and when you want to kill him run and run until he turns you 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.529
 and this attack makes you an enemy that is best avoided 

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:23.829
 this enemy has an interesting meaning because it represents fear 

00:04:23.829 --> 00:04:25.900
 that he had adults 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.719
 and in the post 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:31.379
 number 2 in the ass I put it to the rough jajajajajaja that was waiter and with 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:36.239
 the jokes xd and the position number two takes nothing more or nothing less than 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.539
 the great number two place takes him 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:43.599
 incubus or incubator depending on the end of the game you want to get 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:48.899
 this enemy is the final boss no no for being the final boss I put him in this place 

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:53.239
 I put it because it represents the image that the line of shots had this enemy 

00:04:53.239 --> 00:04:57.669
 it's easy, you just have to dodge his attacks and shoot him 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.469
 preference with a rifle or with the shotgun but if you want to kill it with the 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:06.489
 very thick pistol will take - in making a straw that in killing it xd this 

00:05:06.489 --> 00:05:10.769
 enemy has two incubator forms which is the figure that had alessa of 

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:14.869
 studies is represented as a woman with black hair and dressed in 

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:15.639
 White 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.889
 and his other form incubus osama him as some call it is the image that 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.449
 had dahlia god is represented as a flying demon with body of 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:28.990
 woman and goat's head the part of the stomach is incomplete because 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.259
 it is not fully developed 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:33.460
 and in the post 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.479
 but breakfast exists 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:38.550
 but before mentioning the monster that came in first 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.550
 a warning I do not want comments as is 

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:44.689
 You're a shit 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:48.769
 happens to put bags in the first place you are not my friend and I who believed that 

00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:50.020
 it would be desirable 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.759
 but I realize that he does not know that mons 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:55.949
 I'm scared this shadow comic while one what you should do 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:58.330
 the monster that occupies the first 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.119
 the post of this top 5 3 

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:05.270
 jajajajajajajajajaja even believe that this thing is in first place 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.270
 not the real monster that occupies the first place is 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:11.490
 Yes it is 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.810
 this enemy ranks first for several reasons one of the reasons is 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.150
 because it looks like a faceless child and the fact of not having a face creates a 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.759
 feeling of nostalgia and fear of the player 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:26.580
 even though it is the easiest enemy of the whole game it emits a sound 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.300
 very scary that makes your hair stand on end usually this enemy usually 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.210
 appear in groups of two or three worlds in the Japanese bat version 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.870
 the fireman was eliminated and was replaced by the klaus fischer 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.610
 because it looked a lot like a child 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.800
 the world and represents school children who made fun of alessa 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:51.069
 well this was all for today if you liked score 5 and keep favorites and if 

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:55.210
 they did not like going to take for ass but before they score in 5 the video
