the video and let's see what more tips
you<00:00:19.650> can<00:00:19.800> use<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.730> get<00:00:20.880> yourself<00:00:21.150> from<00:00:21.750> silver

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
you can use to get yourself from silver

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.750 
you can use to get yourself from silver
to<00:00:22.109> gold<00:00:22.230> spacing<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.010> other<00:00:23.160> indices<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.670> I

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
to gold spacing the other indices and I

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.759 
to gold spacing the other indices and I
know<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.910> lot<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.269> want<00:00:24.449> those<00:00:24.630> rewards<00:00:24.840> the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
know a lot of you want those rewards the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.009 
know a lot of you want those rewards the
Victoria<00:00:26.160> Morgana<00:00:26.910> skin<00:00:27.240> looks<00:00:27.570> very<00:00:27.840> nice

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
Victoria Morgana skin looks very nice

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.769 
Victoria Morgana skin looks very nice
especially<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.769> particle<00:00:29.189> effects<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.670> the

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
especially the particle effects and the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.240 
especially the particle effects and the
border<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.810> course<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.710> let's<00:00:31.890> just<00:00:32.070> get<00:00:32.189> right

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
border of course so let's just get right

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.479 
border of course so let's just get right
in<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.640> guide<00:00:32.820> here<00:00:33.360> we<00:00:33.450> go<00:00:34.219> so<00:00:35.219> I'm<00:00:35.280> just

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
in the guide here we go so I'm just

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.740 
in the guide here we go so I'm just
going<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.670> start<00:00:35.910> off<00:00:36.030> with<00:00:36.239> saying<00:00:36.450> what<00:00:36.719> I

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
going to start off with saying what I

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.150 
going to start off with saying what I
think<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.350> main<00:00:37.500> difference<00:00:38.010> between

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
think is the main difference between

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.340 
think is the main difference between
silver<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.700> gold<00:00:38.879> players<00:00:39.120> now<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:39.960> think<00:00:40.140> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
silver and gold players now I think the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.440 
silver and gold players now I think the
main<00:00:40.500> difference<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.950> mostly<00:00:41.450> objective

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
main difference is mostly objective

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.260 
main difference is mostly objective
control<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.050> mechanics<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:43.860> general<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:44.789> for

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
control and mechanics in general so for

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.799 
control and mechanics in general so for
Jason<00:00:45.629> control<00:00:45.899> them<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.170> taking<00:00:46.739> towers<00:00:47.250> and

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
Jason control them is taking towers and

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.000 
Jason control them is taking towers and
prioritizing<00:00:48.809> dragons<00:00:49.289> maybe<00:00:49.530> over<00:00:49.770> getting

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
prioritizing dragons maybe over getting

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.729 
prioritizing dragons maybe over getting
kills<00:00:50.250> sometimes<00:00:50.700> things<00:00:51.059> like<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.420> and

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
kills sometimes things like that and

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.410 
kills sometimes things like that and
mechanics<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.949> mean<00:00:53.219> landing<00:00:53.910> skillshots

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
mechanics I mean landing skillshots

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.330 
mechanics I mean landing skillshots
consistently<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.649> knowing<00:00:56.039> what<00:00:56.190> each

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
consistently and knowing what each

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.569 
consistently and knowing what each
champion<00:00:56.670> does<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.300> knowledge<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.840> game

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
champion does so knowledge of the game

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.910 
champion does so knowledge of the game
my<00:00:59.579> first<00:00:59.879> step<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.300> warding<00:01:00.780> properly<00:01:01.320> now

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
my first step is warding properly now

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.380 
my first step is warding properly now
know<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> lot<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.460> you're<00:01:02.640> saying<00:01:02.879> but<00:01:03.059> wards

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
know a lot of you're saying but wards

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.750 
know a lot of you're saying but wards
are<00:01:03.480> for<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.690> support<00:01:04.019> well<00:01:04.680> get<00:01:05.369> out<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.670> that

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
are for the support well get out of that

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.310 
are for the support well get out of that
mindset<00:01:06.000> that's<00:01:06.570> what<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> lot<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:06.990> silver

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
mindset that's what a lot of silver

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.649 
mindset that's what a lot of silver
players<00:01:07.770> think<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.430> not<00:01:08.610> right<00:01:08.939> you

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
players think and it's not right you

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.910 
players think and it's not right you
want<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.900> get<00:01:09.990> into<00:01:10.140> gold<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.590> need<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.799> be

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
want to get into gold you need to be

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.740 
want to get into gold you need to be
warding<00:01:11.310> efficiently<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.600> right

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
warding efficiently and in the right

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.560 
warding efficiently and in the right
places<00:01:13.280> so<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.580> check<00:01:14.790> out<00:01:14.909> maybe<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.299> map

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
places so you can check out maybe a map

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.120 
places so you can check out maybe a map
online<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:16.080> where<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.320> should<00:01:16.350> be<00:01:16.680> warding<00:01:17.009> a

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
online of where you should be warding a

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.770 
online of where you should be warding a
lot<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.430> places<00:01:17.580> obviously<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.360> brushes

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
lot of places obviously in the brushes

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.270 
lot of places obviously in the brushes
and<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:18.990> shouldn't<00:01:19.200> be<00:01:19.259> rewarding<00:01:19.680> generally

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
and you shouldn't be rewarding generally

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.880 
and you shouldn't be rewarding generally
in<00:01:20.670> places<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.270> aren't<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.140> brush<00:01:22.320> if

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
in places that aren't in the brush if

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.740 
in places that aren't in the brush if
you<00:01:23.009> know<00:01:23.100> what<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.250> mean<00:01:23.280> by<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.939> you

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
you know what I mean by that and you

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.359 
you know what I mean by that and you
should<00:01:24.930> be<00:01:25.049> buying<00:01:25.229> awards<00:01:25.619> as<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> top<00:01:26.040> lane<00:01:26.220> as

is<00:01:34.140> not<00:01:34.290> enough<00:01:34.560> for<00:01:34.770> example<00:01:35.579> here's<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.820> game

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
is not enough for example here's a game

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.940 
is not enough for example here's a game
with<00:01:36.270> me<00:01:36.450> playing<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.049> stories<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.650> getting

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030

game if I just bought one or two green
wards<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.600> could<00:01:43.079> have<00:01:43.170> avoided<00:01:43.380> at<00:01:43.680> least<00:01:43.710> two

getting kills to hop the rest of my team
which<00:01:50.909> relates<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.360> my<00:01:51.479> second<00:01:51.960> tip<00:01:52.079> if<00:01:52.430> you're

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
which relates to my second tip if you're

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.120 
which relates to my second tip if you're
winning<00:01:53.790> your<00:01:53.909> lane<00:01:54.060> start<00:01:54.540> roaming<00:01:54.960> now<00:01:55.920> this

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
winning your lane start roaming now this

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.709 
winning your lane start roaming now this
most<00:01:56.430> applies<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.909> mid<00:01:57.090> laners<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.570> top

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
most applies to mid laners and top

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:58.940 
most applies to mid laners and top
laners<00:01:58.079> because<00:01:58.259> if<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.500> guys<00:01:58.649> are<00:01:58.829> winning

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
laners because if you guys are winning

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.380 
laners because if you guys are winning
you<00:01:59.130> should<00:01:59.340> be<00:01:59.460> roaming<00:01:59.850> your<00:01:59.969> other<00:02:00.149> lanes

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
you should be roaming your other lanes

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.630 
you should be roaming your other lanes
if<00:02:00.659> you're<00:02:00.810> winning<00:02:01.170> top<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:02.130> should<00:02:02.340> go<00:02:02.430> mode

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
if you're winning top you should go mode

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.770 
if you're winning top you should go mode
and<00:02:02.820> help<00:02:02.939> them<00:02:03.149> out<00:02:03.270> if<00:02:03.420> they're<00:02:03.509> having<00:02:03.600> a

and help them out if they're having a
hard<00:02:03.960> time<00:02:04.049> if<00:02:04.439> you're<00:02:04.590> mad<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.890> can<00:02:05.009> go<00:02:05.100> top

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
hard time if you're mad you can go top

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.459 
hard time if you're mad you can go top
or<00:02:05.579> bot<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.390> help<00:02:06.540> them<00:02:06.780> win<00:02:06.960> their<00:02:07.170> land<00:02:07.380> and

or bot to help them win their land and
pushed<00:02:07.680> hours<00:02:08.099> now<00:02:08.910> this<00:02:09.090> may<00:02:09.300> seem<00:02:09.330> like<00:02:09.629> a

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
pushed hours now this may seem like a

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.449 
pushed hours now this may seem like a
basic<00:02:10.170> thing<00:02:10.349> but<00:02:10.560> often<00:02:10.979> players<00:02:11.280> you're

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
basic thing but often players you're

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.950 
basic thing but often players you're
winning<00:02:11.760> just<00:02:11.970> forget<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.480> they<00:02:12.569> stay

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
winning just forget and they stay

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.320 
winning just forget and they stay
and<00:02:13.410> maybe<00:02:13.530> form<00:02:13.950> will<00:02:14.640> just<00:02:14.850> get<00:02:14.970> one<00:02:15.150> or<00:02:15.300> two

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
and maybe form will just get one or two

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.300 
and maybe form will just get one or two
more<00:02:15.630> kills<00:02:15.900> on<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.140> enemy<00:02:16.500> middle<00:02:16.830> top<00:02:17.010> laner

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
more kills on the enemy middle top laner

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.640 
more kills on the enemy middle top laner
that<00:02:18.210> is<00:02:18.390> not<00:02:18.630> enough<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.140> should<00:02:19.350> be<00:02:19.440> helping

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
that is not enough you should be helping

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.130 
that is not enough you should be helping
other<00:02:20.010> lanes<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.520> doesn't<00:02:21.000> matter<00:02:21.060> if<00:02:21.210> 103<00:02:22.050> of

map awareness relates to your

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.700 
map awareness relates to your
micromanagement<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.420> game<00:02:33.630> this<00:02:34.440> means

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
micromanagement of the game this means

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.770 
micromanagement of the game this means
item<00:02:35.280> bulbs<00:02:35.640> you're<00:02:35.940> focusing<00:02:36.390> on<00:02:36.480> what<00:02:36.660> your

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
item bulbs you're focusing on what your

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.180 
item bulbs you're focusing on what your
team<00:02:36.990> is<00:02:37.140> buying<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:37.560> what<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.770> other<00:02:37.920> team

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
team is buying and what the other team

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.650 
team is buying and what the other team
is<00:02:38.310> buying<00:02:38.520> so<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.850> you<00:02:38.970> can<00:02:39.090> counter<00:02:39.480> them

is buying so that you can counter them

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.900 
is buying so that you can counter them
for<00:02:40.410> example<00:02:40.800> you<00:02:40.890> don't<00:02:41.040> want<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.340> ages<00:02:41.790> of

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
for example you don't want to ages of

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.670 
for example you don't want to ages of
legions<00:02:42.300> on<00:02:42.450> your<00:02:42.600> own<00:02:42.690> team<00:02:42.990> that<00:02:43.020> would<00:02:43.500> just

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
legions on your own team that would just

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.160 
legions on your own team that would just
be<00:02:43.740> a<00:02:43.830> waste<00:02:43.890> of<00:02:44.250> an<00:02:44.370> effective<00:02:44.820> ability<00:02:45.270> so

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
be a waste of an effective ability so

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.600 
be a waste of an effective ability so
what<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:46.620> want<00:02:46.770> to<00:02:46.830> do<00:02:46.950> when<00:02:47.160> you're<00:02:47.280> looking

the enemy jungler is if you can't see
him<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.420> know<00:02:51.570> he<00:02:51.810> might<00:02:51.990> be<00:02:52.230> ganking<00:02:52.620> you

soon if you can see them like both in
your<00:02:55.140> top<00:02:55.470> then<00:02:55.770> you<00:02:55.890> know<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.070> have<00:02:56.250> some<00:02:56.460> UN
