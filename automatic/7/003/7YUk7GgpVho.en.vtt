00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.519 
cleansing foot bath what we're working
on<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.269> particular<00:00:30.570> principle<00:00:31.080> by<00:00:31.320> using

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
on is that particular principle by using

never see it get very clear there's

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.999 
never see it get very clear there's
always<00:01:17.040> going<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.220> be<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.640> little<00:01:18.270> bit<00:01:18.450> of

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
always going to be a little bit of

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.109 
always going to be a little bit of
coloration<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.430> particularly<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:21.030> the
