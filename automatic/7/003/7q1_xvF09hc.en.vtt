00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
cents I think so we tried we try to do a

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.010 
cents I think so we tried we try to do a
video<00:00:23.280> previous<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.120> this<00:00:24.240> but<00:00:24.510> we<00:00:24.600> hadn't<00:00:24.930> let

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
video previous to this but we hadn't let

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.380 
video previous to this but we hadn't let
them<00:00:25.200> cool<00:00:25.440> and<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.520> learned<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:27.030> these<00:00:27.180> are

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
them cool and I learned that these are

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.810 
them cool and I learned that these are
twice<00:00:27.690> as<00:00:27.900> good<00:00:28.290> when<00:00:28.650> they're<00:00:28.860> cooled<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.700> we

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
twice as good when they're cooled so we

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.659 
twice as good when they're cooled so we
decided<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.330> refill<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.560> instead<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.189> over<00:00:32.460> ice

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
decided to refill so instead of over ice

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.220 
decided to refill so instead of over ice
we<00:00:32.910> try<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.149> pour<00:00:33.450> them<00:00:33.540> over<00:00:33.570> Iceland<00:00:34.079> and

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
we try to pour them over Iceland and
