00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.679
 good afternoon my name is irina zina i 

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:14.959
 I am our own but training manager at home 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.010
 Gerlen in Russia Head of Department 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.720
 learning and 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.690
 expert cosmetologist this 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:24.580
 Today's wonderful brand is ours 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:27.200
 The meeting is dedicated to the two most important stages. 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.920
 cosmetic care one of them 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:37.249
 called cleansing and the second is called 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:39.949
 moisturizing and so we start the procedure 

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:40.600
 any cleansing with cleansing the eye area 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.159
 and lips 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.960
 The most common texture of these 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:47.089
 means this biphasic means you 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.800
 will always see the phase of the water and the phase 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.050
 fat to start using 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.479
 this tool is absolutely necessary 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.780
 pre- mix then the most 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:59.359
 important question how to do it right 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.649
 everything is very simple you pour into two 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.100
 wadded disk 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:08.060
 the amount is to wet 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.720
 both cotton discs on both sides then 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.250
 helping yourself a little with one hand 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.810
 lifting closed eye 1 2 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.120
 naturally you will be open already 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.570
 will watch the mirror you apply 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.090
 cotton pad and give only 10 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.010
 seconds hold on to this 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.560
 slight movement down and slightly to the side 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.990
 slight movement down and slightly to the side 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.400
 and the third time is a slight downward movement and 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.400
 slightly to the side and the mascara has already dissolved 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.170
 then everything is very simple you turn 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.200
 drive the other side 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.750
 and start moving a little bit to the side 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.799
 in order to remove excess 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.520
 not if they are and wipe about each 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.860
 movement you always do to the top 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:01.240
 remember to always move 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.759
 applying makeup applying creams and 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.720
 makeup removal and and removal of pollution from 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.820
 skin surface 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.080
 all movements must be up you see 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.800
 remnants of makeup on sponges then you are very 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.459
 neatly 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.250
 1 and serves turn over turn 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.430
 cone and very gently slightly 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.390
 hold the corner of your eyes go to 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.930
 eyelash growth lines open the eye and 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.500
 do the same thing two this way 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.560
 removing the procedure of dirt and makeup 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.330
 eye and eyelashes finished why do we 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.760
 needed was spam second disk which 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.410
 still remains completely clean for 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.459
 order to clear 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.350
 skin pollution or makeup too 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.510
 all means which are very important 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.780
 always use to cleanse the eyes 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.970
 used to cleanse and since we 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.890
 clear 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.320
 again we remember what we need 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.510
 slightly lift all movements 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.590
 always go up raising 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.650
 own corner 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.020
 you pass first on the lower lip in 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.560
 one side then lifts in 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.650
 corner 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.620
 smile the other way then you 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.530
 pass leaving a finger here a corner 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.030
 mid google one side 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.940
 raise the corner and done too 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.400
 I'll be suddenly tired then you wind up 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.420
 turning our favorite taste 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:31.720
 pre-wadded disc and go through with 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:36.160
 wadded cone pretty well still 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:39.850
 once rubbing in one direction it's done 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.700
 same leadership in this way 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.850
 procedures for cleansing the eyes and lips have 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.820
 completed and so what is gamma 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.490
 gerlen cleansers first and foremost 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.490
 probably the most popular tools in the range 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.260
 cleansing is definitely a foam 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.630
 because it is used with water 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.640
 most people words of purification 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.410
 bind with water that is absolutely 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.290
 fair and so how right 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.300
 use penta modern skins 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.580
 have a special dispenser which 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.739
 helps not to cook the back immediately 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.780
 get her literally two pressing 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.739
 Here is the amount of foam that is one 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.140
 tablespoon 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.650
 necessary to just wash 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.760
 face draw your attention that 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.280
 must necessarily 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.990
 using a foam not just put it on 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.990
 face and evenly distribute 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.500
 be sure to wash your face approximately here 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.380
 such circular ascending movements 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:38.860
 then wash off the foam abundantly with just water and 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.540
 then use the tonic to continue 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.540
 skin preparation procedures for 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.550
 cosmetic care and so it is 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:49.440
 popular tool that is used 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.780
 morning and evening for any skin type and 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.610
 finally probably the most famous 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.680
 skin cleansers 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.620
 people called jelly for 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.760
 purification in terms of texture this 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.230
 certainly an emulsion for cleansing the skin and 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.420
 emulsions to cleanse the skin taken 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.940
 use as easy to cleanse so 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.730
 and for cleansing from makeup 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.100
 the usual most popular way 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.390
 use of milk milk applied 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.790
 on a cotton pad 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.340
 directly dispenser as needed 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.230
 Milk half teaspoons that is 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.480
 two times less than when using 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.620
 without cotton pad 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.170
 then a cotton pad on which is slightly 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:35.960
 distribute milk 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:40.610
 start from the bottom of the face and go through 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:45.680
 to ear paying attention to everything 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:48.260
 surface tight again I repeat 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:52.690
 gliding tightly over the skin but 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.690
 while not stretching
