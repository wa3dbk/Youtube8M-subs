00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.600
 hello today's video is super food 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.269
 easy is a collaborative with bars to 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.860
 low anamarÃ­a diana tips is friend el 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.349
 art in the information box I'm going to 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.570
 leave the links of your channels so that 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.570
 go subscribe and support them 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.470
 a little bit of salt 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.779
 my puree is ready and I want 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.720
 show them how to try the puree 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:33.009
 with a super soft knife the knife 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.009
 has to enter the potato 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.129
 they have to be super super 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.899
 soft and it is better to split it 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.870
 half or in several pieces to make it 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.079
 faster cooking we will take out the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.660
 water and we continue with the next step 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.430
 let's put a pan on low heat 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.820
 but you're going to stop the pan getting hot 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.650
 very well and we put a teaspoon of 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.510
 oil 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:05.940
 you can use olive oil or canola 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.130
 you allow the oil to warm up and in 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:13.280
 that oil we are going to make like a shock 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.280
 thermal of these ingredients and chin 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.840
 onion and throw it 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.729
 let's move a little 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.640
 you can raise the heat from the side a little 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.640
 from the stove 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.570
 we let my prison go up is to say that 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.290
 the onion crystallizes 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.140
 without taking color 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.600
 and without burning the paprika and the 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.950
 onion the next step is to take a 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:52.820
 bowl or bowl where you can mix 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:55.340
 let's mix here I have tuna already 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.430
 Drained tuna in water and it stings 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.730
 parsley 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:04.190
 smooth parsley 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.190
 to this we will put the leg 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:20.800
 and now what we're going to do is oppress 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.800
 so that the potato is mashed 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.730
 if you have a mashed pizza it is much better and 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.210
 if not with a spoon as you see that 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.280
 I am doing 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.110
 it's fine as the potato left you super 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.830
 soft 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.600
 very well cooked then it will not be 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:42.300
 difficult to press 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.300
 and make it become a salt puree 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.550
 and now I'm going to add what I had in the 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.550
 skillet 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.120
 and this to compact we are going to 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.870
 put an egg 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:08.000
 or according to the amount that you make of 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.000
 filling let's put more eggs 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.590
 we mix 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.010
 you are going to wash your hands very well and in 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:38.060
 you are going to put a little bit of oil 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:41.130
 of cooking for this gas as well and with your 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.310
 own hands you are going to take 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.380
 and the filling 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.040
 since we just did for the 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.040
 tortillas 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:54.580
 you will give it the form of an arepa or 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.260
 give it the shape you want and so what 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.260
 let's take to a pan with a 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.970
 little bit of super hot oil no 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.040
 you need a lot of oil so that these 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.750
 Dore is and if you have a very good pan 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.440
 of teflon then less is not going to 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.440
 hit or nothing 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:13.240
 oil 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.240
 I have it at medium low heat 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.850
 so to my proposal of the 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.370
 tortillitas as you can see they were 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.590
 I'm going to 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.000
 accompany this bread but you the 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.120
 you can accompany with a delicious 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.980
 salad or you can make a sandwich and 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.900
 soon make the shape of the tortilla 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.600
 much longer to make it to the 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.210
 measure of bread is something super healthy 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:46.100
 you ate vegetable protein that is in 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:48.440
 the egg and you're going to be super satisfied 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.670
 or satisfied an ideal recipe for 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.470
 singles for students in exchange 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.690
 great I hope you enjoy it cheer up 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.130
 to do it and to go through the channels of 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.750
 the girls that I'm doing the 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.490
 collaborative that I leave in the box 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.850
