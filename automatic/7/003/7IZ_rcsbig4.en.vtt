00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
heat off of the CPU it's possible they

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.039 
heat off of the CPU it's possible they
have<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.159> convex<00:02:02.159> base<00:02:02.689> to<00:02:03.689> put<00:02:03.840> all<00:02:03.960> the

pressure right in the middle of the CPU

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.430 
pressure right in the middle of the CPU
you<00:02:07.049> have<00:02:07.170> six<00:02:07.940> centered<00:02:08.959> six<00:02:09.959> millimeter

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
you have six centered six millimeter

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.070 
you have six centered six millimeter
heat<00:02:10.739> pipes<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.940> whole<00:02:12.180> thing

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
heat pipes and this whole thing

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.140 
heat pipes and this whole thing
is<00:02:13.140> nickel<00:02:13.530> plated<00:02:13.980> these<00:02:14.220> are<00:02:14.430> aluminum<00:02:14.850> fins

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
is nickel plated these are aluminum fins

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.750 
is nickel plated these are aluminum fins
as<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.260> can<00:02:16.380> see<00:02:18.950> so<00:02:19.950> our<00:02:20.040> six<00:02:20.340> heat<00:02:20.520> pipes

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
as you can see so our six heat pipes

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.000 
as you can see so our six heat pipes
there<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.150> they're<00:02:21.240> actually<00:02:21.360> staggered<00:02:22.110> get

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
there and they're actually staggered get

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.910 
there and they're actually staggered get
the<00:02:23.130> best<00:02:23.750> flow<00:02:24.750> through<00:02:25.050> there<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.710> best

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
the best flow through there and the best

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.650 
the best flow through there and the best
efficiency<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:27.260> this<00:02:28.260> actually<00:02:29.360> weighs<00:02:30.360> in

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
efficiency and this actually weighs in

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.800 
efficiency and this actually weighs in
at<00:02:30.860> 860<00:02:31.860> grams<00:02:31.890> with<00:02:32.730> just<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.420> heat<00:02:33.600> sink

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
at 860 grams with just the heat sink

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.780 
at 860 grams with just the heat sink
itself<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:34.440> it's<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.650> very<00:02:34.680> hefty<00:02:35.100> unit<00:02:35.580> and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
itself so it's a very hefty unit and

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.030 
itself so it's a very hefty unit and
that<00:02:36.270> is<00:02:36.360> why<00:02:36.540> they<00:02:36.840> have<00:02:36.870> optimized<00:02:37.770> this

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
that is why they have optimized this

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.320 
that is why they have optimized this
base<00:02:38.280> design<00:02:38.760> here<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:40.850> secure<00:02:41.850> this<00:02:42.000> without

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
base design here to secure this without

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.060 
base design here to secure this without
having<00:02:42.690> any<00:02:42.810> problems<00:02:43.320> with<00:02:43.470> flexing<00:02:43.950> and

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
having any problems with flexing and

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.010 
having any problems with flexing and
breaking<00:02:44.430> in<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.580> motherboard<00:02:45.000> if<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:45.900> look

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
breaking in the motherboard if you look

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.660 
breaking in the motherboard if you look
here<00:02:46.230> at<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.440> back<00:02:46.620> plate<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.550> is

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
here at the back plate this is

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.050 
here at the back plate this is
adjustable<00:02:48.620> get<00:02:49.620> your<00:02:49.740> 775<00:02:50.520> in<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.790> middle

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
adjustable get your 775 in the middle

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.199 
adjustable get your 775 in the middle
and<00:02:51.209> then<00:02:51.300> your<00:02:51.620> 1156<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:52.950> then<00:02:53.040> your<00:02:53.209> 1366

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
and then your 1156 and then your 1366

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.540 
and then your 1156 and then your 1366
all<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.540> way<00:02:54.600> on<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.810> outside<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.500> then<00:02:56.459> you

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
all the way on the outside and then you

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.920 
all the way on the outside and then you
have<00:02:56.670> your<00:02:56.700> little<00:02:56.940> insulating<00:02:57.480> washers

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
have your little insulating washers

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.250 
have your little insulating washers
which<00:02:58.170> you<00:02:58.410> would<00:02:58.530> place<00:02:58.830> on<00:02:59.450> here<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.600> then

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
which you would place on here and then

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.850 
which you would place on here and then
you<00:03:01.380> basically<00:03:01.560> put<00:03:02.100> this<00:03:02.760> through<00:03:03.590> on<00:03:04.590> the

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
you basically put this through on the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.210 
you basically put this through on the
backside<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.310> your<00:03:05.400> motherboard<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:08.010> once

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
backside of your motherboard and once

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.390 
backside of your motherboard and once
you<00:03:08.340> do<00:03:08.630> screw<00:03:09.630> these<00:03:09.750> on<00:03:09.990> top<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.380> that<00:03:10.470> these

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
you do screw these on top of that these

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.610 
you do screw these on top of that these
both<00:03:11.640> have<00:03:12.590> little<00:03:14.150> silicone<00:03:15.320> washers<00:03:16.320> there

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
both have little silicone washers there

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.699 
both have little silicone washers there
to<00:03:17.550> prevent<00:03:17.880> any<00:03:18.030> kind<00:03:18.120> of<00:03:18.450> metal<00:03:19.350> to

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
to prevent any kind of metal to

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.160 
to prevent any kind of metal to
motherboard<00:03:20.130> contact<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.239> this<00:03:21.870> would<00:03:22.019> mount

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
motherboard contact and this would mount

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.420 
motherboard contact and this would mount
on<00:03:22.350> top<00:03:22.410> of<00:03:22.769> that<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.220> then<00:03:23.910> you<00:03:24.060> would<00:03:24.180> mount

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
on top of that and then you would mount

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.810 
on top of that and then you would mount
heatsink<00:03:26.430> here<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:26.970> then<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:27.989> would<00:03:28.110> mount

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
heatsink here and then you would mount

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.280 
heatsink here and then you would mount
pressure<00:03:29.820> adjustment<00:03:30.480> valve<00:03:30.660> on<00:03:30.870> top<00:03:31.140> of

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
pressure adjustment valve on top of

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.920 
pressure adjustment valve on top of
there<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:31.739> then<00:03:31.980> you<00:03:32.130> can<00:03:32.280> adjust<00:03:32.400> from<00:03:32.760> there

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
there and then you can adjust from there

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.170 
there and then you can adjust from there
we'll<00:03:33.930> just<00:03:34.110> leave<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.470> be<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:34.970> be<00:03:35.970> at<00:03:36.060> the

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
we'll just leave it be and be at the

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.860 
we'll just leave it be and be at the
factory<00:03:36.709> set<00:03:37.709> pressure<00:03:38.010> there<00:03:38.600> another<00:03:39.600> thing

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
factory set pressure there another thing

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.290 
factory set pressure there another thing
to<00:03:39.900> note<00:03:40.019> is<00:03:42.590> when<00:03:43.590> mounting<00:03:43.950> on<00:03:44.070> 7<00:03:44.459> 75<00:03:44.970> s<00:03:45.209> are

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
to note is when mounting on 7 75 s are

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.020 
to note is when mounting on 7 75 s are
going<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.510> need<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:45.989> use<00:03:47.090> this<00:03:48.090> little

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
going to need to use this little

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.340 
going to need to use this little
backplate

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.350 

cap<00:03:53.980> here<00:03:54.690> they<00:03:55.690> call<00:03:55.960> it<00:03:56.080> the<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.910> back<00:03:58.060> plate

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
cap here they call it the the back plate

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.790 
cap here they call it the the back plate
cap<00:03:58.660> and<00:03:58.930> basically<00:03:59.170> I<00:03:59.290> guess<00:03:59.350> this<00:03:59.650> is

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
cap and basically I guess this is

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.940 
cap and basically I guess this is
provides<00:04:00.610> better<00:04:00.910> support<00:04:01.480> since<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.990> 1156

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
provides better support since the 1156

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.660 
provides better support since the 1156
and<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.330> 1366<00:04:04.330> motherboards<00:04:04.840> have<00:04:05.050> a<00:04:05.640> quite<00:04:06.640> a

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
bit larger base plate that they use to

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.040 
bit larger base plate that they use to
mount<00:04:10.030> their<00:04:10.270> heat<00:04:10.450> sinks<00:04:10.780> with<00:04:10.960> so<00:04:11.260> that<00:04:12.190> is<00:04:12.520> a

cons<00:04:49.690> are<00:04:50.700> it<00:04:51.700> is<00:04:51.730> a<00:04:51.850> little<00:04:52.090> bit<00:04:52.300> more<00:04:52.510> on<00:04:52.780> the

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
cons are it is a little bit more on the

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.650 
cons are it is a little bit more on the
pricey<00:04:53.530> side<00:04:53.740> but<00:04:54.700> you<00:04:55.000> definitely<00:04:55.240> get<00:04:55.510> what

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
pricey side but you definitely get what

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.520 
pricey side but you definitely get what
you<00:04:55.780> paid<00:04:55.960> for<00:04:57.060> it's<00:04:58.060> very<00:04:58.510> big<00:04:58.870> so<00:04:59.260> it<00:04:59.380> might

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
you paid for it's very big so it might

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.170 
you paid for it's very big so it might
not<00:04:59.590> fit<00:04:59.920> in<00:05:00.040> some<00:05:00.250> cases<00:05:00.520> and<00:05:00.940> it<00:05:01.000> might

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
not fit in some cases and it might

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.080 
not fit in some cases and it might
actually<00:05:01.720> hinder<00:05:02.610> putting<00:05:03.610> in<00:05:03.730> certain

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
actually hinder putting in certain

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.510 
actually hinder putting in certain
cables<00:05:04.600> or<00:05:04.840> stuff<00:05:05.050> like<00:05:05.170> that<00:05:05.250> but<00:05:06.250> if<00:05:06.430> you

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
cables or stuff like that but if you

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.130 
cables or stuff like that but if you
want<00:05:06.700> really<00:05:06.880> good<00:05:07.090> cooling<00:05:07.360> that's<00:05:07.750> what

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
want really good cooling that's what

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.650 
want really good cooling that's what
some<00:05:08.410> of<00:05:08.440> the<00:05:08.590> things<00:05:08.800> that<00:05:08.920> you<00:05:09.070> have<00:05:09.220> to<00:05:09.660> you

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
some of the things that you have to you

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.310 
some of the things that you have to you
know<00:05:10.780> live<00:05:11.230> by<00:05:11.760> other<00:05:12.760> than<00:05:13.030> that<00:05:13.270> the<00:05:14.020> only

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
know live by other than that the only

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.260 
know live by other than that the only
downsides<00:05:14.860> I<00:05:15.040> can<00:05:15.220> see<00:05:15.630> it<00:05:16.630> does<00:05:16.840> not<00:05:16.960> fit<00:05:17.260> AMD

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
downsides I can see it does not fit AMD

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.760 
downsides I can see it does not fit AMD
I'm<00:05:19.270> sure<00:05:19.570> that<00:05:19.780> they<00:05:19.900> might<00:05:20.080> make<00:05:20.320> something

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
I'm sure that they might make something

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.430 
I'm sure that they might make something
aftermarket<00:05:21.460> to<00:05:21.520> fit<00:05:21.700> that<00:05:22.110> another<00:05:23.110> thing<00:05:23.410> is

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
aftermarket to fit that another thing is

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.790 
aftermarket to fit that another thing is
I've<00:05:23.920> heard<00:05:24.340> that<00:05:24.700> this<00:05:25.420> pressure<00:05:26.170> adjustment

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
I've heard that this pressure adjustment

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.400 
I've heard that this pressure adjustment
mount<00:05:27.430> can<00:05:27.910> actually<00:05:28.450> you<00:05:28.780> can<00:05:28.930> tighten<00:05:29.140> it<00:05:29.320> to

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
mount can actually you can tighten it to

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.350 
mount can actually you can tighten it to
the<00:05:29.500> point<00:05:29.710> where<00:05:29.890> can<00:05:30.010> actually<00:05:30.370> damage<00:05:31.150> your

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
the point where can actually damage your

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
made to fit closer to the exhaust fan on

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.260 
made to fit closer to the exhaust fan on
your<00:05:59.980> case<00:06:00.190> so<00:06:00.490> if<00:06:00.610> you're<00:06:00.760> running<00:06:01.150> this

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
your case so if you're running this

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.100 
your case so if you're running this
passive<00:06:01.840> or<00:06:02.140> if<00:06:02.260> you're<00:06:02.410> running<00:06:02.500> it<00:06:02.710> with

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
passive or if you're running it with

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.810 
passive or if you're running it with
and<00:06:03.230> you<00:06:03.740> can<00:06:03.890> set<00:06:04.100> it<00:06:04.130> up<00:06:04.340> to<00:06:04.490> where<00:06:04.520> it<00:06:04.700> will

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
and you can set it up to where it will

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.990 
and you can set it up to where it will
sit<00:06:05.120> say<00:06:05.990> you're<00:06:06.110> lost<00:06:06.350> fans<00:06:06.650> back<00:06:06.950> here<00:06:07.370> you

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
sit say you're lost fans back here you

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.020 
sit say you're lost fans back here you
can<00:06:08.120> have<00:06:08.270> it<00:06:08.360> sit<00:06:08.570> like<00:06:08.720> this<00:06:08.750> and<00:06:10.030> basically

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
can have it sit like this and basically

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.440 
can have it sit like this and basically
it<00:06:11.450> will<00:06:11.510> sit<00:06:11.810> closer<00:06:12.110> there<00:06:12.440> so<00:06:13.300> that<00:06:14.300> about

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
it will sit closer there so that about

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.560 
it will sit closer there so that about
