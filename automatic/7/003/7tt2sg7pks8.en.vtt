so<00:00:34.740> an<00:00:34.890> upgraded<00:00:35.520> version<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.780> process

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
so an upgraded version of that process

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.340 
so an upgraded version of that process
it<00:00:37.440> better<00:00:38.190> for<00:00:38.430> multitasking<00:00:38.760> cetera
