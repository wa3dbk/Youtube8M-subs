00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
modifier which cures most problems not

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.710 
modifier which cures most problems not
quite<00:04:20.289> perfect<00:04:20.859> but<00:04:21.099> pretty<00:04:21.729> good<00:04:21.849> low<00:04:22.419> poly

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
quite perfect but pretty good low poly

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.280 
quite perfect but pretty good low poly
model<00:04:22.840> that

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
model that

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.380 
model that
for<00:04:25.890> a<00:04:25.920> high<00:04:26.100> poly<00:04:26.370> version<00:04:26.790> of<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:26.940> model<00:04:27.240> I

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
for a high poly version of the model I

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.390 
for a high poly version of the model I
found<00:04:27.810> I<00:04:27.960> got<00:04:28.140> the<00:04:28.230> best<00:04:28.440> results<00:04:28.860> by<00:04:29.010> applying

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
found I got the best results by applying

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.520 
found I got the best results by applying
the<00:04:29.760> subdivision<00:04:30.330> surface<00:04:30.660> modifier<00:04:31.170> first

the subdivision surface modifier first

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.860 
the subdivision surface modifier first
so<00:04:32.220> I'm<00:04:32.340> going<00:04:32.610> back<00:04:32.820> to<00:04:33.150> an<00:04:33.270> earlier<00:04:33.630> version

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
so I'm going back to an earlier version

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.990 
so I'm going back to an earlier version
of<00:04:34.170> the<00:04:34.230> model<00:04:34.620> before<00:04:35.010> I<00:04:35.250> added<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.730> boolean

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
of the model before I added the boolean

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.060 
of the model before I added the boolean
modifier<00:04:36.180> I'm<00:04:36.930> gonna<00:04:37.050> select<00:04:37.230> the<00:04:37.440> bishop<00:04:37.830> and

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
modifier I'm gonna select the bishop and

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.770 
modifier I'm gonna select the bishop and
add<00:04:38.640> the<00:04:38.820> subdivision<00:04:39.450> surface<00:04:39.480> modifier<00:04:41.780> set

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
add the subdivision surface modifier set

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.810 
add the subdivision surface modifier set
the<00:04:43.020> level<00:04:43.560> of<00:04:43.620> subdivision<00:04:43.830> to<00:04:44.310> what<00:04:44.430> I<00:04:44.460> want

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
the level of subdivision to what I want

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.530 
the level of subdivision to what I want
and<00:04:45.120> I<00:04:45.930> need<00:04:46.620> to<00:04:46.710> go<00:04:46.800> into<00:04:47.040> edit<00:04:47.340> mode<00:04:47.370> and<00:04:47.910> add

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
and I need to go into edit mode and add

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.660 
and I need to go into edit mode and add
loop<00:04:49.170> cuts<00:04:49.500> to<00:04:49.950> square<00:04:50.310> off<00:04:50.580> edges<00:04:51.650> I'm<00:04:52.670> going

modifier I'm going to add the boolean
modifier<00:05:07.440> and<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:09.180> operation<00:05:09.660> I<00:05:09.750> want<00:05:09.930> is

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
modifier and the operation I want is

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.260

but<00:05:13.050> as<00:05:13.200> soon<00:05:13.350> as<00:05:13.440> I<00:05:13.530> select<00:05:13.830> the<00:05:13.920> cube<00:05:14.190> my

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
but as soon as I select the cube my

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.250 
but as soon as I select the cube my

thousands and thousands of calculations
are<00:05:18.570> done<00:05:18.600> so<00:05:19.410> I'm<00:05:19.500> going<00:05:19.620> to<00:05:19.680> stop<00:05:19.920> the

computer to a halt now I can select the

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.240 
computer to a halt now I can select the

cube and delete it pressing delete on

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.970 
cube and delete it pressing delete on
the<00:05:35.280> keyboard<00:05:35.430> and<00:05:36.060> we<00:05:36.240> get<00:05:36.420> a<00:05:36.600> nice<00:05:36.980> clean

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
the keyboard and we get a nice clean

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.780 
the keyboard and we get a nice clean
edge<00:05:38.340> but<00:05:39.240> unfortunately<00:05:40.140> if<00:05:40.380> I<00:05:40.650> apply<00:05:41.250> smooth

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
edge but unfortunately if I apply smooth

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.830 
edge but unfortunately if I apply smooth
shading<00:05:43.430> we<00:05:44.430> still<00:05:44.700> get<00:05:44.880> problems<00:05:45.360> around<00:05:45.660> the

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
shading we still get problems around the

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.380 
shading we still get problems around the
edge<00:05:46.010> which<00:05:47.010> can<00:05:47.250> be<00:05:47.370> cured<00:05:47.610> to<00:05:47.760> a<00:05:47.790> degree<00:05:48.150> by

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
edge which can be cured to a degree by

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.410 
edge which can be cured to a degree by
adding<00:05:48.810> the<00:05:48.960> edge<00:05:49.170> split<00:05:49.590> modifier<00:05:50.420> which

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
adding the edge split modifier which

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.760 
adding the edge split modifier which
gives<00:05:51.660> a<00:05:51.780> good<00:05:51.810> result<00:05:52.320> but<00:05:53.070> not<00:05:53.100> perfect

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
gives a good result but not perfect

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.100 
gives a good result but not perfect
