your<00:00:17.550> tongue<00:00:17.910> like<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:22.250> and<00:00:23.250> can<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.400> notice

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
your tongue like this and can you notice

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.340 
your tongue like this and can you notice
how<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.210> don't<00:00:24.420> think<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.779> was<00:00:24.930> doing<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.230> on

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
how I don't think I was doing that on

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.769 
how I don't think I was doing that on
the<00:00:25.439> inhale<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:26.390> recommend<00:00:27.390> first<00:00:27.599> you

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
the inhale I recommend first you

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.529 
the inhale I recommend first you
practicing<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.619> exhale<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:30.029> trick<00:00:30.330> to

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
practicing on the exhale the trick to

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.080 
practicing on the exhale the trick to
this<00:00:30.750> though<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.710> actually<00:00:32.309> what<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.700> do<00:00:32.820> is

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
this though is to actually what I do is

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.889 
this though is to actually what I do is
I<00:00:33.180> actually<00:00:33.360> use<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.290> air<00:00:34.500> pressure<00:00:35.070> to

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
I actually use the air pressure to

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.860 
I actually use the air pressure to
manipulate<00:00:36.899> my<00:00:37.110> tongue<00:00:38.059> so<00:00:39.059> without

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
manipulate my tongue so without

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.569 
manipulate my tongue so without
breathing<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.500> impossible<00:00:41.010> for<00:00:41.040> me<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.460> move

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
breathing it's impossible for me to move

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.930 
breathing it's impossible for me to move
my<00:00:41.640> tongue<00:00:41.790> as<00:00:42.149> fast<00:00:46.070> if<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
my tongue as fast if it's so it's the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.340 
my tongue as fast if it's so it's the
air<00:00:48.090> pressure<00:00:48.539> that's<00:00:48.899> actually

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
air pressure that's actually

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.250 
air pressure that's actually
manipulating<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.219> tongue<00:00:50.750> so<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.840> trick<00:00:52.110> is

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
manipulating the tongue so the trick is

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.750 
manipulating the tongue so the trick is
to<00:00:52.289> figure<00:00:52.559> out<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.860> way<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.160> shorten<00:00:53.520> your

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
to figure out a way to shorten your

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.290 
to figure out a way to shorten your
tongue<00:00:54.000> I'm<00:00:55.160> almost<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.520> beginning<00:00:57.149> you

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
tongue I'm almost in the beginning you

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.090 
tongue I'm almost in the beginning you
could<00:00:57.449> try<00:00:57.660> anchoring<00:00:58.230> against<00:00:58.500> your<00:00:58.620> molars

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
could try anchoring against your molars

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.889 
could try anchoring against your molars
but<00:00:59.520> you<00:01:00.000> know<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.180> size<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.570> your<00:01:00.629> tongue

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
but you know the size of your tongue

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.560 
but you know the size of your tongue
against<00:01:01.559> your<00:01:01.710> molars<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.820> time<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.480> you're

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
against your molars in time that you're

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.840 
against your molars in time that you're
gonna<00:01:03.660> want<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.930> loosen<00:01:04.470> up<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.650> anchor<00:01:05.400> so

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
gonna want to loosen up that anchor so

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.859 
gonna want to loosen up that anchor so
it's<00:01:06.000> very<00:01:06.439> relaxed<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.590> your<00:01:07.710> mouth<00:01:08.360> so<00:01:09.360> once

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
it's very relaxed in your mouth so once

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.840 
it's very relaxed in your mouth so once
again<00:01:11.330> try<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.360> like<00:01:13.229> take<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.530> work<00:01:13.890> sukkah

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.310 

right<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.000> think<00:01:18.240> pick<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> little<00:01:18.960> easier<00:01:19.259> to

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
right I think pick is a little easier to

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:31.480 
right I think pick is a little easier to
start<00:01:19.680> with<00:01:21.680> and<00:01:22.680> then<00:01:23.549> try<00:01:23.880> tuck<00:01:24.750> a-tickin

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:39.410 

okay<00:01:38.119> okay

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
okay okay

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.120 
okay okay
here's<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> second<00:01:40.470> thing<00:01:40.500> that's<00:01:40.799> really

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
here's the second thing that's really

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.620 
here's the second thing that's really
important<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.700> helps<00:01:42.119> me<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> lot<00:01:42.299> with<00:01:42.509> this

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
important that helps me a lot with this

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.920 
important that helps me a lot with this
is<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.979> let<00:01:44.220> air<00:01:44.490> pressure<00:01:44.880> leak<00:01:45.270> through<00:01:45.720> my

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
is I let air pressure leak through my

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.679 
is I let air pressure leak through my
nose<00:01:46.259> both<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.340> inhale<00:01:47.850> on<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.210> exhale

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
nose both in the inhale on the exhale

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.149 
nose both in the inhale on the exhale
the<00:01:49.490> advantage<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.520> gives<00:01:50.909> me<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.409> I<00:01:52.409> can

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
the advantage that gives me is I can

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.819 
the advantage that gives me is I can
move<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.549> little<00:01:53.790> more<00:01:53.970> wind<00:01:54.360> as<00:01:55.259> opposed<00:01:55.680> to

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
move a little more wind as opposed to

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.569 
move a little more wind as opposed to
these<00:01:55.979> short<00:01:56.280> breaths<00:01:57.409> it<00:01:58.409> creates<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.219> in

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
these short breaths it creates it you in

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.370 
these short breaths it creates it you in
other<00:01:59.700> words<00:01:59.939> because<00:02:00.509> I'm<00:02:00.810> moving<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.229> little

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
other words because I'm moving a little

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.630 
other words because I'm moving a little
bit<00:02:01.500> more<00:02:01.860> air<00:02:02.810> by<00:02:03.810> letting<00:02:04.290> air<00:02:04.829> out<00:02:05.189> gas

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
bit more air by letting air out gas

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.580 
bit more air by letting air out gas
through<00:02:06.030> my<00:02:06.149> nose<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.899> gas<00:02:07.200> through<00:02:07.500> my

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
through my nose and in gas through my

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.680 
through my nose and in gas through my
nose<00:02:07.860> that's<00:02:08.580> another<00:02:08.849> part<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.239> trick<00:02:09.450> I

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
nose that's another part of the trick I

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.309 
nose that's another part of the trick I
can<00:02:10.050> do<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.319> holding<00:02:10.590> my<00:02:10.739> nose

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
can do it holding my nose

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:27.479 
can do it holding my nose
but<00:02:11.469> I<00:02:11.680> get<00:02:12.069> a<00:02:12.099> little<00:02:12.280> more<00:02:12.489> stuck<00:02:25.650> okay<00:02:26.650> and

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
but I get a little more stuck okay and

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.500 
but I get a little more stuck okay and
the<00:02:27.609> other<00:02:27.730> thing<00:02:27.939> I<00:02:28.000> recommend<00:02:28.420> you

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
the other thing I recommend you

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.990 
the other thing I recommend you
practicing<00:02:29.079> would<00:02:30.069> be<00:02:30.219> just<00:02:30.459> for<00:02:30.579> practice

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
practicing would be just for practice

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:47.159 
practicing would be just for practice
doing<00:02:31.209> short<00:02:31.569> breaths<00:02:31.900> like<00:02:32.109> this<00:02:45.629> and<00:02:46.629> do<00:02:47.139> a

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:47.169 
doing short breaths like this and do a

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:49.860 
doing short breaths like this and do a
lot<00:02:47.379> of<00:02:47.409> jamming<00:02:47.980> in<00:02:48.159> the<00:02:48.280> car<00:02:48.579> without<00:02:49.540> the

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
lot of jamming in the car without the

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.599 
lot of jamming in the car without the
harmonica<00:02:50.409> doing<00:02:50.650> these<00:02:50.769> kind<00:02:50.980> of<00:02:51.010> mouth<00:02:51.219> jam
