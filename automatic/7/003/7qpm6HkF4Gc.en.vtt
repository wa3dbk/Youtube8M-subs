00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:11.600
 Yes, it's Miura, let's do a Yo-Kai Watch 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.600
 This time, let's turn in you clothes Gashakoin is quite accumulated 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:19.960
 Youkai umbrella itself can only be turned 4 times 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:25.080
 If Kudase we have accumulated six Ne and what is coin 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:27.760
 All well so amateur T-That is not here Oh 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.220
 I've forgotten a long time too 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:35.900
 This is six 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:40.840
 If you turn Well today is four times'm not turning only four times 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.840
 You should get a pretty good monster medal 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.720
 Hippers 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.590
 I 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.560
 Oh how Muramasa 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:55.650
 I wonder if it would be better to go to Masamune 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:59.540
 In the Mitaka zone 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.540
 It's synthetic items come out the other 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.470
 Gold Oops Kitter 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.400
 What 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.770
 Oh yes I saw someone muttering on a spring twitter 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.150
 It's a pity that Ageage has come out 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:24.950
 Wow, it's really only two more times 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.620
 I heard that the voice of the skin has been skipped, but the voice of the phlegm has been skipped 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.820
 2 more times 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.820
 Meat noise is also good 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:44.640
 Clothing is not an employee of this double seat employee now 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:49.430
 How long did it take to save 46 coins 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.430
 3 hours 4 hours 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.450
 Is it 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.390
 I do not come out so much medal 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.940
 Come on last one time 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.940
 It's likely to come out or the maersk degree Nyan 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.310
 What a modern 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.720
 It's a bad goal already 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.720
 What is it 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.990
 Naa I'm Nechotto was hoping 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.599
 9 gasa coin 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.599
 I think that the special coin is pretty good 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.860
 here we go 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.950
 Hey , aim at that always blows gasha coin 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.240
 I was doing this mission but special 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.240
 We might try to do now Specials 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.080
 Ayatori-like special cone what's different 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.350
 What do you do to get special coins 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:01.130
 Oh this day scene forty eight 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:08.650
 I can not because this little annoying do it ze but to 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:08.650
 It's the thread also'm quite troublesome of six of fate can not say fate lock one Yeah of Lots 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:15.170
 Phew 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:17.650
 There are no other people who can get special coins 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.560
 2 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.890
 Hey, not a little 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.700
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.150
 It does not seem to be 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.020
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:33.110
 It's not really eh 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.220
 So it's colder and the special act is better than gasacon 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:40.810
 It is above as a position. 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:44.440
 Ayatori Summer Nee I have to defeat in the fate of six Forty eight of the afterfire god 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.319
 It takes a long time, both of them 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.170
 It's was such a thing Oh 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.740
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.630
 Is Now Well 8 buildings 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:57.240
 It's village rain 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.240
 I got it in hand and synthesized it like this 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.890
 You 're wrong here. Oh 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.520
 Hmm 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.520
 never came 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:12.410
 Hmm 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:15.530
 There are some monsters, but it seems that they can be synthesized quite 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.620
 Soul and Tome 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.549
 First of all 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.549
 muramasa hall 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:28.470
 I guess I got to fight with Muramasa and get money 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.470
 was 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:42.460
 Cormorants came 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.460

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.520
 ana 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.400
 Perhaps we will eat at a company 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.560
 denial 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:56.780
 Well a rank will surely be 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:05:02.290
 By the way, after the detonation horn this got it 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:04.940
 It seems like it's a leak to ask if you 're going to booth 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.780
 It was nice to walk around and it was good again 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.780
 And there are two 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.139
 # Bacon 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.180
 Hmm 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.550
 this is 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:26.210
 I guess there are 32 companies 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:32.080
 I will not back but I love you 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:32.080
 It will roar in there is like what or wrapper that is attached around the waist 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.240
 Hmm 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.400
 Hmm 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:45.330
 Alright 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.330
 I think there's a guy who seems to be able to synthesize something on the 4th 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.440
 I do not feel like remembering 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:58.409
 This is Mikage stone 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:58.409
 Maybe this is 8 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:08.120
 That guy from the tank 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:12.420
 I because there is no Mai said Hey now guy or mermaid to always unreasonable 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:15.920
 Such a thing that can be synthesized for the time being 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.920
 It can not be synthesized unexpectedly 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:23.409
 Yes 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:25.849
 Well, I tried to have a monster gacha out of it with the fact that there are six clothes for social workers. 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:30.789
 But it was totally useless 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:30.789
 I think I want to At length you here today in what it
