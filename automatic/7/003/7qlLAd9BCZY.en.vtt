con there's something consistency with

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.190 
con there's something consistency with
the<00:02:53.820> graphical<00:02:54.360> direction<00:02:54.780> from<00:02:54.900> what<00:02:55.080> I've

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
the graphical direction from what I've

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.020 
the graphical direction from what I've
seen<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.950> have<00:02:56.070> some<00:02:56.280> great<00:02:56.460> maps<00:02:56.700> like<00:02:56.910> I

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
seen you have some great maps like I

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.570 
seen you have some great maps like I
said<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:58.170> models<00:02:58.620> on<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:58.770> actual<00:02:59.160> characters

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
said the models on the actual characters

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.510 
said the models on the actual characters
itself<00:03:00.030> look<00:03:00.330> really<00:03:00.870> really<00:03:01.050> bad<00:03:01.520> personally

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
itself look really really bad personally

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.450 
itself look really really bad personally
um<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.590> obviously<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.740> game<00:03:04.920> placed<00:03:05.190> on<00:03:05.370> the

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
um and obviously the game placed on the

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.460 
um and obviously the game placed on the
guiding<00:03:05.730> force<00:03:05.820> of<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.150> game<00:03:06.360> so<00:03:06.990> graphics

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
guiding force of the game so graphics

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.930 
guiding force of the game so graphics
don't<00:03:07.650> have<00:03:07.740> to<00:03:07.860> be<00:03:07.950> good<00:03:08.190> there<00:03:08.400> bearable

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
don't have to be good there bearable

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.580 
don't have to be good there bearable
they're<00:03:09.120> decent<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.780> there<00:03:09.900> they're<00:03:10.320> still

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
they're decent and there they're still

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.380 
they're decent and there they're still
acceptable<00:03:11.040> it's<00:03:11.520> a<00:03:11.580> kind<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:11.850> playing<00:03:12.060> in<00:03:12.270> a

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
acceptable it's a kind of playing in a

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.620 
acceptable it's a kind of playing in a
modern<00:03:12.750> gaming<00:03:13.560> era<00:03:14.090> but<00:03:15.090> there's<00:03:15.480> some

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
modern gaming era but there's some

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.390 
modern gaming era but there's some
inconsistency<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.380> feel<00:03:16.680> at<00:03:16.830> least<00:03:16.920> all<00:03:17.100> around

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
inconsistency I feel at least all around

flight<00:03:51.480> at<00:03:51.630> once<00:03:51.870> so<00:03:52.260> it's<00:03:52.470> very<00:03:52.740> invasive<00:03:53.610> and

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180

it's very helpful and very informative
and<00:03:57.120> then<00:03:57.420> some<00:03:57.690> more<00:03:57.870> cons<00:03:58.170> on<00:03:58.620> game<00:03:59.280> even

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
and then some more cons on game even
