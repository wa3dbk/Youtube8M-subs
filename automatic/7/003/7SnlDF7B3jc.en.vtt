00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:10.440
Hello guys, and welcome to an another review. Today I show you a Raupenschlepper Ost

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.460
with trailer. More in the review. Have fun.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:38.980
Let´s start. I split it up into its parts and start with the main vehicle.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:50.940
The RSO has space for two minifigs, the roof is removable, doors can be open.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.700
The front looks very accurate to the real model.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.140
The hatches in the back are also working.

00:01:06.506 --> 00:01:08.506
Here we go.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.500
And of course we have a lot of space foraccessoires like crates and other stuff.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:33.760
You can also put minifigs in the back. So you have a pretty decent troop carrier.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.500
The chain links working very well on this model.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.980
In the back we have a small glass window, when you have to look backwards...

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.760
...when you get stuck in a russian swamp.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.620
Ok. Let´s continue with the trailer.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.320
The axle is rotatable...

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:06.560
... and the hatches also can be open. The space for stuff is a little bit bigger than in the RSO.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.700
...alot of space for minifigs, crates etc.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.540
It fits perfectly into the tow bar.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:36.660
You need more or less 250 bricks to build this model. Most parts are allotted to the chain links.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:52.780
Which are still very expensive. A big problem when you build a tank, but it is worth it. Later the models look awesome.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:02.880
I will put the stuff and minifigs in the vehicle again. See you in a moment.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.080
Here I am again. I put the stuff etc in the RSO.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.460
Figures fit in the cabin.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:21.980
The size of a minifig reaches approx. a hatch.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.320
Put you two away.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:40.320
I did not fill the full space. As you can see I used crates, links and tools. BrickArms crates would also look good.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.480
"unneccessary German drivel"

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:54.740
So much for this episode. I hope we see us again in the next video. Have a good day and goodbye.
