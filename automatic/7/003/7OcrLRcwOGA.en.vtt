00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.260
 of you dreamed about it myself 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.320
 have dreamed for a long time and I have 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.240

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.920
 present hi to all and what this 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.960
 what I still want to say 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.880
 but I want to introduce myself now 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.949
 What is this story 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.990
 pokey memo so and a free mmog that 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.820
 you can download just as 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.570
 for free in which so you 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.579
 can spell live the adventured pokemon 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.590
 simply with several people 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.120
 so do not pay attention to the pack 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.070
 grimblat for those who know a 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.140
 little the series the background represent 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.030
 the oblivia islands of pokÃ©mon tidy up 3 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.600
 which has nothing to do with what is going 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.520
 to follow 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.489
 we have committed ourselves that I have myself 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.059
 already can start we'll go I'm 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.850
 deceived 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.780
 there and start messi let my 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.799
 password 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:10.110
 what are you talking about is a 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.850
 a little longer here and this part we 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.320
 must be able to show you a little bit 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.180
 what is this mania doing 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.170
 that point the thing was not moving me 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.540
 remember one who is sir this to 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.920
 what this story is me here is the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.119
 diet 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.360
 so here we are so you find yourself in 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.750
 the basic ones in the pokemon game 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.090
 so fire so finally red fire and 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.380
 verfeil and you end up so 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.790
 just to make the adventure quite 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.799
 normal except that there are people all 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.280
 around you can see here there was 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.680
 reduced 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.800
 there are reindeer and 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.290
 the iffhs everywhere i assume that the girl 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.710
 is called leaf is not otherwise 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.480
 I do not want to know otherwise and so 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.070
 here it is really very friendly 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.420
 so where already to talk about 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.350
 features need to know so this is 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.270
 still in an alpha version 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.000
 so there are still a lot of things to 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.530
 a lot of things to develop 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.940
 you know that if there is no 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.490
 music that's normal I bugs like a 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.869
 big when know that a lot of not bad 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.010
 of legs also have my problem it's up to 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.180
 say no sound and is for now 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.619
 but I have not seen one on for the 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.959
 moment so good for now I play 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.640
 samson but you can have the game 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.080
 is in English you have to know since 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.610
 it's a mmo there is only one it's going 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.100
 for the moment he is small but he is 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.239
 overcrowded times yes it's very popular 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.489
 since we are in alpha 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.650
 there are a lot of things to fix 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.290
 so still not bad buggy have not hurt me 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.000
 of scripts animations and fights 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.190
 are not fantastic but you have to 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.709
 admit having a fucking pokemon a mmo 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.850
 worth still not as good 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.750
 are not the only French of time 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.800
 in time and some French who 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.590
 appear in the bed you are in the 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.570
 local last local rather local month 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.900
 in the general chad that you can 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.470
 easily access and discuss 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.150
 quietly so especially so the 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.680
 particularity so this memo dated so 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.030
 to be able to play as much as you 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.739
 want a winner on your own 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.150
 adventure alone where you can so that the 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.739
 do with friends and you swap 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.720
 constantly your pokemon because he is very 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.950
 easy to sell his pokemon to someone 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.840
 of milk and exchange them 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.090
 it's very very ergonomic and very 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.950
 simple does not require much in 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.090
 the more you have to know that you 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.730
 can you beat 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.090
 when you want what in the end bah 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.440
 here it is super nice so to by 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.910
 example you see standing with the 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.820
 master ball that your self that means 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.590
 that he is in combat with someone if he 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.420
 has a normal pokÃ©ball it's either he 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.010
 is in trainers fight either in 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.299
 Wild pokemon fight 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.829
 you have to know that here is the place 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.910
 normally where the rival appears the 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.769
 first time we get to surya 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.120
 that's why and we do not see them 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.620
 because he's fighting against them 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.090
 rival 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.290
 so we continue I beat all 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.340
 the surfs still know some 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.350
 secrets that have not been implanted 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.570
 for example the fact that 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.890
 trainers do not see you if you 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.329
 go in front of the grape he will not you 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.110
 stop the fair you would go talk to him 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.670
 for you to fight so 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.950
 you can avoid in a sense the 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.320
 fighting so where a little bug he has 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.280
 jumped for no reason little fight there 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.690
 it will allow me to show you a 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.590
 little like and the fight keeps on arm 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.240
 I am training a pikachu 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.800
 to beat andy so there we could 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.810
 sell plh is fighting me and 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.620
 all around there is always you can 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.540
 always see what's going on around 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.410
 see people move and as well as 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.830
 access to the chat 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.540
 it's very convenient hours so I'm going 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.680
 try to throw me a pokÃ©ball all 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.670
 simple because I would like to see there 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.670
 down but I do not think it's okay 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.870
 so yes no then am I going 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.980
 to see her 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:32.440
 that's what I'm going to do to you 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:34.000
 catch yes yes yes and there very low 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.500
 simple that's how I at least 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.870
 can lead him to have a good pokemon 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.730
 psychic already that so there as you can 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.750
 see I'm still a little early I 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.490
 am a little stuck because you have to 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.590
 I beat, we say, but let's say that this little 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.300
 this little remains a single is like who 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.020
 would sound loud but not enough to 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.270
 this to fight the star at the cars and 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.800
 so there is none for now 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.360
 no scripting particularity you 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.810
 just play the game but with 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.850
 people around 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.770
 and frankly it's worth it I think 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.330
 that you will agree then we already have it 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.890
 should know that as if full time 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.550
 it's still evolving 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:09.220
 is often covered by beit aimed at 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.110
 so to improve it why he actually 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.490
 what he follows him I do not know and he 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.200
 must also know that many 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.590
 projects are coming as for example 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.390
 the introduction or introduction of 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.919
 region obviously we will not be satisfied 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.110
 money when fighting for shooter 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.040
 we're going to have pretty much everything so here's 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.570
 can be really very friendly 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.150
 especially if you have a friend who is everything 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.370
 also pokÃ©fans that 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.450
 for example that you and I and with 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.290
 that they would like to spend a little 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.770
 nice moment 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:37.920
 however, we must know 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.570
 the installation is relatively good she 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.130
 is not complicated but you have to know 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.290
 the shot and that's why I you 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.580
 now simply offers you 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.070
 show how it's installed in order to 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.350
 help you find yourself right away 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.270
 and here we are again for the installation 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.620
 of mmo poker so already the first 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.410
 thing to do is to install so 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.490
 obviously the pokemon game finally mmo 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.900
 poker same words as you can 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.800
 find obviously envy in the 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.840
 description of the video 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.420
 however you also need 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.630
 to use so a rom so its a 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:11.040
 emulator of the fire raid version so 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:13.500
 red American fire own you in 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.960
 need to play ie 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.580
 this beautiful thing so how to have it 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.170
 downstairs it's simple either you go in the 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.520
 descriptive of the video either you go 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.260
 on rom parked there you will be able to 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.460
 Download 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.360
 so once you have it beautiful 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.910
 little things you simply need 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.470
 to take and put it in the 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:32.130
 Roma folder that's all you have 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:34.860
 to do that's all afterwards if you 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.780
 want to see your pokemon follow you and 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:40.260
 to see the sprites so that is to say the 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.800
 animations and spar years of pokemon 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:46.410
 two cards gold and soul silver so 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:49.080
 heart of gold and soul of money there you 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:50.280
 just download these mds files 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.080
 that you can also find again 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.060
 nothing in this case type of video and 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.230
 you only have to add one 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.580
 you can use one only I have 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.660
 put both without any reason you 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.950
 also put in the back and ram and you 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.350
 just have to launch mmo poker and 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.370
 you will be fixed you must know that 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.140
 nevertheless as it is an alpha version 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.070
 there are a lot of bugs including clint of 

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.690
 mister camus to say you have such
