anyways<00:00:43.530> drop<00:00:43.920> zone<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:45.350> really<00:00:46.350> really<00:00:46.739> fun

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
anyways drop zone is really really fun

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.619 
anyways drop zone is really really fun
and<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:48.329> highly<00:00:49.020> recommend<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.620> basically

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
and I highly recommend it basically

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.590 
and I highly recommend it basically
there's<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.750> there's<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.410> zone<00:00:52.649> around<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.070> map

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
there's a there's a zone around the map

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.750 
there's a there's a zone around the map
where<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.949> your<00:00:55.949> team<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.219> trying<00:00:56.640> to

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
where I you your team is trying to

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.189 
where I you your team is trying to
control<00:00:57.120> for<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.420> certain<00:00:57.719> amount<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.960> time<00:00:58.140> I

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
control for a certain amount of time I

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.160 
control for a certain amount of time I
think<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.829> 7500<00:00:59.760> or<00:00:59.850> something<00:01:00.170> correct

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
think it's to 7500 or something correct

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.420 
think it's to 7500 or something correct
me<00:01:01.230> if<00:01:01.320> I'm<00:01:01.500> wrong<00:01:01.530> but<00:01:01.710> I'm<00:01:01.980> pretty<00:01:02.100> sure<00:01:02.219> at

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure at

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.320 
me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure at
7,500<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.920> basically<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.129> just<00:01:05.189> chill<00:01:06.060> in

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
7,500 and basically you just chill in

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.750 
7,500 and basically you just chill in
the<00:01:06.450> drop<00:01:07.140> zone<00:01:07.170> which<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.740> circle<00:01:08.580> around

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
the drop zone which is a circle around

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.590 
the drop zone which is a circle around
the<00:01:09.210> wherever<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.200> defend<00:01:11.119> weird<00:01:12.119> shape<00:01:12.360> is

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
the wherever the defend weird shape is

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.590 
the wherever the defend weird shape is
and<00:01:12.920> then<00:01:13.920> if<00:01:14.220> you're<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> first<00:01:15.090> one<00:01:15.330> there

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
actual zone itself every second you get

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.130 
actual zone itself every second you get
plus<00:01:50.340> 10<00:01:50.820> or<00:01:51.030> 20<00:01:51.479> XP<00:01:51.930> or<00:01:51.960> something<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.700> um
