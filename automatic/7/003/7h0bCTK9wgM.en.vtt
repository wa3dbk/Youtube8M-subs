quality is really clear and you can see

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.230 
quality is really clear and you can see
me<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.050> it's<00:02:42.800> just<00:02:43.040> this<00:02:43.220> is<00:02:43.670> a<00:02:43.730> really<00:02:44.120> good

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
me and it's just this is a really good

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.729 
me and it's just this is a really good
professional<00:02:44.600> camera<00:02:45.080> so<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.290> quality<00:02:45.530> is

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
professional camera so the quality is

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.310 
professional camera so the quality is
Grambling<00:02:46.250> this<00:02:46.400> again<00:02:47.180> it's<00:02:47.450> just<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.720> audio

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
Grambling this again it's just the audio

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.470 
Grambling this again it's just the audio
I<00:02:48.350> think<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:48.950> audio<00:02:49.250> is<00:02:49.430> fine<00:02:49.730> as<00:02:50.030> I<00:02:50.270> said

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
I think the audio is fine as I said

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.000 
I think the audio is fine as I said
there's<00:02:50.660> three<00:02:50.720> mics<00:02:51.290> in<00:02:51.590> this<00:02:52.040> camera<00:02:52.550> and<00:02:54.010> so

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
there's three mics in this camera and so

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.400 
there's three mics in this camera and so
it<00:02:55.220> kind<00:02:55.430> of<00:02:55.489> picks<00:02:55.730> up<00:02:55.940> sound<00:02:56.570> from<00:02:56.780> F<00:02:57.140> like

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
it kind of picks up sound from F like

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.260 
it kind of picks up sound from F like
this<00:02:57.709> way<00:02:57.890> this<00:02:58.130> way<00:02:58.340> this<00:02:58.370> way<00:02:58.610> even<00:02:58.880> or<00:02:59.090> mean

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
this way this way this way even or mean

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.640 
this way this way this way even or mean
so<00:02:59.420> that's<00:02:59.510> probably<00:02:59.840> why<00:03:00.080> you<00:03:00.140> can<00:03:00.380> sound

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
so that's probably why you can sound

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.830 
so that's probably why you can sound
like<00:03:00.770> it<00:03:01.010> echoes<00:03:01.280> a<00:03:01.310> little<00:03:01.670> bit<00:03:01.820> but<00:03:02.690> yeah

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
like it echoes a little bit but yeah

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.240 
like it echoes a little bit but yeah
