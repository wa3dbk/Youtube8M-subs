00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hey people welcome to 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.029
 next video this time it's about 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.810
 Ultrabook namely one of fujitsu 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.519
 have fun 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:14.070
 the fujitsu ultrabook 772 left its departure 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.650
 to ifa reached me in the match of ours 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.650
 from fujitsu this is an unboxing of 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.859
 bing i pack this out now we 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.140
 had a new ultrabook of the u 772 and 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.429
 I thought it is a u 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.669
 boat s acts when over bach 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.370
 that's why 772 did not tell me now 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.070
 necessarily so much but I already had 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.070
 in a press release seen that 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.950
 that pretty strong stylish stylish that 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.820
 the right is the reason I get it 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.629
 take over today 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.980
 that's not supposed to look in a hurry 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.840
 boxing here is all empty because of that 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.340
 I wanted, among other things, a 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:03.539
 picture make great construction that 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.909
 Accessories consists of cables that belongs 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.540
 also to and and should it for 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.920
 possibilities 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.330
 Here you see, keep that pure 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.220
 an ultra book is missing because of the lan 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.610
 connection but this is one 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.890
 could charge construction of usb 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.580
 Some manufacturers make a slice of 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.310
 cut off 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.850
 because that is often missing in red rough 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.180
 group exactly where I wanted to stand 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.610
 make picture of the judgment looks very 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.759
 Stylish from different than others 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.070
 manufacturer of sets Fujitsu in the case 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.540
 not silver now or what I know 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.680
 but it is bright red and because of it alone 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.540
 the coloring gives gurus 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.420
 Ultrabook is always ultra fast 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.780
 ultralight ultra economical 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.030
 that's the mentality behind it 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.579
 this ultrabooks stands and you can see that 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.770
 Coloring is really unique or 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.960
 Do you have such a nice red ever 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.720
 in any case , I still motorize 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.920
 not that is the first ultrabook so 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.190
 it looks 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.010
 this is ok lettering foil to this 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.950
 Maybe something curved it like that 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.180
 who knows who knows what that is then 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.050
 write the simple and mini 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.630
 comments the ultrabook has in the 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.489
 Contrary to a few others, the books 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.100
 already met in this series 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:35.280
 have once the connection with the 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.110
 I call him the maric ligator 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.709
 have for a connection here one 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.959
 hdmi-connection two usb 3.0 sockets the 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.620
 are highlighted in blue to recognize it 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:50.819
 that here is a card reader up front 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.010
 Do you see the status LEDs in operation 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.569
 then of course be addressed and 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.760
 here at the side you see 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.640
 I have to see what we do again 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.709
 Of course, this is not the charging cable 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.110
 charging cable but here you see the 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.720
 socket for the charging cable so does the 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.540
 Ten options here Kensington 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.340
 connected to connect a normal usb 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.069
 connection and here a connection for 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:18.989
 a headset just like you see 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.579
 this ultrabook is ultra thin that 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.440
 Maybe you do not see me like that now 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.840
 I've prepared something like that so nice 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.070
 is a competitive product yes we 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.070
 Compare a bit today 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.830
 there are also other manufacturers to 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.970
 We do not need names now 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.580
 mention is not so important 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.870
 not even the collectors already that something 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.810
 yes very thin 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:51.090
 if you now for example that next 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:54.690
 you actually see what works 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:59.970
 right then that means the other product 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:01.890
 we do very quickly gone so comes 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.310
 are to the performance in here 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.430
 installed 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.510
 the five or 7 percent 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:15.030
 depending on the equipment ssds or normal 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:19.470
 hdds with sata 3.0 connection 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.810
 I'll do that for the good now 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.820
 piece still has a few 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.950
 special features in stock that too 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.720
 so are absolutely normal translucent ultrabook 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.630
 in order to squeak it is great when you see them 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.729
 pulls over the table 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.190
 there is something here you see what 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:38.640
 that could well be so black 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.789
 and unobtrusive and does a whole lot 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:49.640
 for the safety of the ultrabook that 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:52.350
 is a fingerprint fingerprint that is 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:56.479
 that's a fair print reader so 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:58.500
 in fact you can do this ultrabook 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.780
 if you go on business with it 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.900
 be with your thumbprint 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.520
 fingerprint whatever secure 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.260
 with the appropriate software could 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.510
 then now you with the appropriate 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:13.160
 Fingerprint back to your data ran 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:17.370
 that's what I call cool and 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:20.780
 innovative would be a pity the camera is not 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:23.760
 maybe it is 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.640
 the battery will soon be empty 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.000
 Battery does not go so fast here 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.220
 the charging time for the ultrabook of the u 772 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.670
 is about 120 minutes 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.320
 that's what the ultrabook says and says 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.720
 Write up to ten hours in the 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.910
 I have the ten 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.420
 Do not verify hours now 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.340
 can 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.800
 but I noticed in my 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.300
 stay in berlin where i like this 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.900
 I had to work a bit with it because I did 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.150
 nothing else had with that one 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.830
 to work really very long 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.510
 So I was at the same time 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.940
 internet on the way wrote texts 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.430
 partly for my blog have europe 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.590
 on youtube and facebook dare photos and 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.810
 that's all there with and right 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.490
 really long and that at all 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:12.030
 connect a plug somewhere 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.860
 Of course, the whole thing would have to go with WiFi 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.870
 a man is doing this 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.030
 adapter here's the page then there's synonymous 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.800
 a lan connection, too, is like that 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:22.110
 already mentioned not necessarily standard 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.610
 the whole thing is standing here from behind 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:28.410
 of course, a product that's just too shut 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:32.100
 Here there is a ventilation and even a 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:34.110
 ventilation slot that's it else me 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.020
 think the whole thing is cool down here 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.580
 there is also a reset button 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.560
 is that ok, now I'm doing that 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.180
 she can hear them there and in the background 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.690
 Write a cat that has bad 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.600
 mood 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.760
 that too can happen so i will 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.750
 this ultrabook a bit more 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.750
 can test 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:54.090
 I mean, I had to look like 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.030
 I actually do this for a long time 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.980
 can get before the battery runs out 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.140
 I suppose it will definitely be more than 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.970
 be six hours 

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:05.040
 here is a core i5 installed that 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.500
 you the whole thing is there too 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.600
 another core i7 a minus point 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.460
 maybe for the gamer among you too 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:15.330
 the thing is not suitable for play 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:17.100
 a pure office in an office a pure one 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.710
 office notebook resp 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:22.650
 netbook in the sense are an ultrabook 

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:24.540
 and I think it's cool the whole thing is 14 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.800
 kilogram heavy and can be really 

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.350
 take it everywhere 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.139
 this is my first impression impression 

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:33.469
 to see from the foyer 

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:35.210
 Linking you do the whole thing 

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:38.779
 again with the product page of 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:40.340
 fujitsu in the article descriptions in 

00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:43.159
 the video description is not 

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:45.650
 article description i take care of it 

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:47.150
 Now continue to build the serial gamer pc 

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:49.759
 I'm a bit here now 

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.860
 by the ifab in time pressure and 

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:53.539
 you can in the meantime yes 

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.240
 let's watch the video 

00:07:53.539 --> 00:07:59.229
 Finally, there's a little one again 

00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:01.400
 video recommendation to build the gamer pc 

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:03.199
 there announce your job 

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.479

 and here it goes to the video now 

00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:12.279
 a pc himself at
