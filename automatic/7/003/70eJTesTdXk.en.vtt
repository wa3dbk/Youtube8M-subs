warm warm enough for you to even touch
it<00:02:02.400> it<00:02:02.940> should<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.840> feel<00:02:04.200> warm<00:02:04.590> that's<00:02:05.310> it

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610

it it should just feel warm that's it
it's<00:02:05.850> already<00:02:06.180> warm<00:02:06.510> I<00:02:06.690> will<00:02:07.290> switch<00:02:07.560> off<00:02:07.770> the

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
it's already warm I will switch off the

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.339 
it's already warm I will switch off the
gas<00:02:08.239> now<00:02:09.239> what<00:02:09.479> I'm<00:02:09.599> going<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.810> do<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.110> I'm

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
gas now what I'm going to do is I'm

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.100 
gas now what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.619> set<00:02:10.890> yogurt<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.640> pots<00:02:12.510> like<00:02:12.840> these

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
going to set yogurt in pots like these

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.259 
going to set yogurt in pots like these
these<00:02:13.379> are<00:02:13.560> earthenware<00:02:13.950> pots<00:02:14.430> specially<00:02:15.060> for

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
these are earthenware pots specially for

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.870 
these are earthenware pots specially for
yogurt<00:02:15.690> what<00:02:16.290> happens<00:02:16.709> is<00:02:16.920> since<00:02:17.580> this<00:02:17.700> is

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
yogurt what happens is since this is

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.410 
yogurt what happens is since this is
made<00:02:18.150> with<00:02:18.420> clay<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.740> quite<00:02:20.040> porous<00:02:20.420> so

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
made with clay it is quite porous so

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.370 
made with clay it is quite porous so
once<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.810> yogurt

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
once the yogurt

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.440 
once the yogurt
sets<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.800> this<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.250> stays<00:02:23.550> quite<00:02:23.970> thick

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
sets in this it stays quite thick

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.290 
sets in this it stays quite thick
because<00:02:25.080> whatever<00:02:25.830> excess<00:02:26.310> moisture<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:27.150> is

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
because whatever excess moisture that is

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.300 
because whatever excess moisture that is
there<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:27.720> all<00:02:27.900> absorbed<00:02:28.560> by<00:02:28.680> this<00:02:28.890> clay

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
there is all absorbed by this clay

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.480 
there is all absorbed by this clay
leaving<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.330> yogurt<00:02:30.810> nice<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.470> thick<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:32.370> if

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
leaving the yogurt nice and thick so if

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.550 
leaving the yogurt nice and thick so if
it's<00:02:32.670> possible<00:02:32.940> for<00:02:33.240> you<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.690> set<00:02:33.930> yogurt<00:02:34.350> in

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
it's possible for you to set yogurt in

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.580 
it's possible for you to set yogurt in
earthen<00:02:35.010> pots<00:02:35.340> like<00:02:35.640> this<00:02:35.850> do<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.210> if<00:02:36.720> not<00:02:36.780> no

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
earthen pots like this do it if not no

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.200 
earthen pots like this do it if not no
problem<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:38.130> can<00:02:38.160> also<00:02:38.520> set<00:02:38.850> this<00:02:38.970> in<00:02:39.120> a

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
problem you can also set this in a

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.210 
problem you can also set this in a
stainless<00:02:39.630> steel<00:02:39.660> dubba<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.860> can<00:02:41.070> use

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
stainless steel dubba you can use

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.040 
stainless steel dubba you can use
plastic<00:02:41.550> container<00:02:42.240> something<00:02:42.780> which<00:02:42.930> you

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
plastic container something which you

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.740 
plastic container something which you
can<00:02:43.230> keep<00:02:43.470> exclusively<00:02:44.220> for<00:02:44.460> yogurt<00:02:44.940> so<00:02:45.570> the

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
can keep exclusively for yogurt so the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.590 
can keep exclusively for yogurt so the
milk<00:02:46.020> is<00:02:46.230> right<00:02:46.560> now<00:02:46.800> absolutely<00:02:47.790> warm<00:02:48.210> just

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
milk is right now absolutely warm just

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.020 
milk is right now absolutely warm just
the<00:02:48.870> way<00:02:49.020> I<00:02:49.260> need<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.620> actually<00:02:50.460> speaking<00:02:50.790> of

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
the way I need it actually speaking of

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.910 
the way I need it actually speaking of
technically<00:02:51.660> speaking<00:02:51.990> this<00:02:52.320> milk<00:02:52.620> will<00:02:52.890> be

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
technically speaking this milk will be

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.760 
technically speaking this milk will be
about<00:02:53.220> 40<00:02:53.700> degrees<00:02:53.850> Celsius<00:02:54.570> so<00:02:55.110> 40<00:02:55.470> degrees

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
about 40 degrees Celsius so 40 degrees

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.100 
about 40 degrees Celsius so 40 degrees
is<00:02:55.860> where<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.250> can<00:02:56.430> easily<00:02:56.910> feel<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.600> warmth<00:02:57.960> of

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
is where I can easily feel the warmth of

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.200 
is where I can easily feel the warmth of
the<00:02:58.170> milk<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:59.400> shouldn't<00:02:59.700> be<00:02:59.850> something

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
the milk and it shouldn't be something

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.580 
the milk and it shouldn't be something
where<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:00.690> are<00:03:00.720> not<00:03:00.900> able<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.200> put<00:03:01.440> your

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
where you are not able to put your

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.250 
where you are not able to put your
finger<00:03:01.980> inside<00:03:02.130> I<00:03:02.580> can<00:03:03.120> do<00:03:03.510> that<00:03:03.720> which<00:03:03.990> means

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
finger inside I can do that which means

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.620 
finger inside I can do that which means
this<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:05.400> right<00:03:05.610> temperature<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:06.420> set

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
this is the right temperature to set

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.500 
this is the right temperature to set
yogurt<00:03:07.080> what<00:03:07.860> we<00:03:08.040> will<00:03:08.250> do<00:03:08.430> now<00:03:08.610> is<00:03:08.850> we<00:03:09.360> will

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
yogurt what we will do now is we will

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:18.970 
yogurt what we will do now is we will
pour<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.870> milk<00:03:10.320> in<00:03:10.740> these<00:03:11.010> containers<00:03:17.750> okay

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
pour the milk in these containers okay

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.340 
pour the milk in these containers okay
so<00:03:19.980> after<00:03:20.280> we<00:03:20.760> have<00:03:20.850> done<00:03:21.030> this<00:03:21.330> what<00:03:21.930> do<00:03:22.080> we<00:03:22.200> do

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
so after we have done this what do we do

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.800 
so after we have done this what do we do
now<00:03:22.560> so<00:03:23.310> now<00:03:23.490> we<00:03:23.550> need<00:03:23.820> to<00:03:23.910> notice<00:03:24.330> how<00:03:24.570> much

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
now so now we need to notice how much

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.260 
now so now we need to notice how much
