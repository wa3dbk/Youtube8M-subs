00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
of this was kind of box-ticking just

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.210 
of this was kind of box-ticking just
making<00:00:42.629> sure<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.960> had<00:00:43.140> every<00:00:43.440> little<00:00:43.860> medium

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
to do but as you can see I kind of went

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.140 
to do but as you can see I kind of went
on<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.700> little<00:00:47.850> tangent<00:00:48.270> about<00:00:48.809> sound<00:00:50.150> can't

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150

are three I'm comparing his work to my
work<00:03:05.520> as<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:06.210> poor<00:03:06.630> old<00:03:07.580> this<00:03:08.580> is<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.790> genuine<00:03:09.270> mad

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
work as a poor old this is a genuine mad

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.800 
work as a poor old this is a genuine mad
even<00:03:10.560> at<00:03:11.070> four<00:03:11.400> years<00:03:11.610> old<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.420> classic

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
even at four years old so the classic

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.260 
even at four years old so the classic
kind<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:13.050> thing<00:03:13.230> that<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.950> would<00:03:14.100> have<00:03:14.220> drawn<00:03:14.460> by

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
kind of thing that I would have drawn by

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.970 
kind of thing that I would have drawn by
the<00:03:15.330> way<00:03:15.570> there's<00:03:16.230> so<00:03:16.440> obviously

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
the way there's so obviously

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.460 
the way there's so obviously
illustration<00:03:17.730> it<00:03:18.060> kind<00:03:18.330> of<00:03:18.450> changed<00:03:19.050> me<00:03:19.170> to

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
illustration it kind of changed me to

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.050 
illustration it kind of changed me to
think<00:03:20.130> that<00:03:20.160> I<00:03:20.280> didn't<00:03:20.610> really<00:03:20.760> know<00:03:20.970> what

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
think that I didn't really know what

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.750 
think that I didn't really know what
illustration<00:03:21.630> was<00:03:21.810> at<00:03:21.960> this<00:03:22.050> point<00:03:22.700> this<00:03:23.700> is

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
illustration was at this point this is

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.520 
illustration was at this point this is
like<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.000> full<00:03:24.270> story<00:03:24.600> that<00:03:25.020> I<00:03:25.110> just<00:03:25.350> made<00:03:25.500> up

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
like a full story that I just made up

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.650 
like a full story that I just made up
whilst<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:26.190> was<00:03:26.340> growing<00:03:26.670> these<00:03:26.880> characters<00:03:27.390> I

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
whilst I was growing these characters I

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.000 
whilst I was growing these characters I
think<00:03:28.170> they're<00:03:28.620> pretty<00:03:28.770> cool<00:03:30.650> there<00:03:31.650> is<00:03:31.800> where

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
think they're pretty cool there is where

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.600 
think they're pretty cool there is where
deviantART<00:03:32.850> sort<00:03:33.390> of<00:03:34.250> materialized<00:03:35.250> in<00:03:35.490> my

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
deviantART sort of materialized in my

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.970 
deviantART sort of materialized in my
life<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:36.060> think<00:03:36.120> I<00:03:36.660> just<00:03:36.780> did<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.290> bunch<00:03:37.560> of<00:03:37.740> cute

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
life I think I just did a bunch of cute

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.699 
life I think I just did a bunch of cute
drawings<00:03:38.430> again<00:03:39.180> very<00:03:39.690> loosely<00:03:40.020> trying<00:03:40.620> to

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
drawings again very loosely trying to

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.600 
drawings again very loosely trying to
fit<00:03:40.920> in<00:03:41.160> what<00:03:41.459> I<00:03:41.489> wanted<00:03:41.880> to<00:03:42.000> do<00:03:42.560> to<00:03:43.560> what<00:03:43.830> the

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
fit in what I wanted to do to what the

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.150 
fit in what I wanted to do to what the
actual<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:45.180> level<00:03:45.510> was<00:03:45.810> asking<00:03:46.290> for<00:03:46.320> but<00:03:46.890> you

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
actual a level was asking for but you

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.210 
actual a level was asking for but you
know<00:03:47.190> it's<00:03:47.430> all<00:03:47.580> boring<00:03:47.880> I<00:03:48.239> can't<00:03:48.270> have<00:03:48.810> too

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
know it's all boring I can't have too

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.610 
know it's all boring I can't have too
too<00:03:50.220> much<00:03:50.400> drawing<00:03:50.970> but<00:03:51.570> kind<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:51.870> fitting<00:03:52.500> it

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
too much drawing but kind of fitting it

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.290 
too much drawing but kind of fitting it
into<00:03:52.739> a<00:03:52.830> bigger<00:03:53.190> I<00:03:53.370> suppose<00:03:53.730> more<00:03:54.150> life

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
into a bigger I suppose more life

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.150 
into a bigger I suppose more life
growing<00:03:54.570> there<00:03:54.810> which<00:03:55.440> i<00:03:55.590> think<00:03:55.650> is<00:03:55.920> pretty

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
growing there which i think is pretty

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.270 
growing there which i think is pretty

more<00:04:49.240> sparse<00:04:49.599> around<00:04:50.139> the<00:04:50.259> end<00:04:50.409> I<00:04:50.680> think<00:04:50.949> the

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:51.129 
more sparse around the end I think the

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:52.439 
more sparse around the end I think the

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
toward the final piece but it has one of

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.240 
toward the final piece but it has one of
my<00:04:55.180> favourite<00:04:55.539> senses<00:04:56.080> at<00:04:56.740> the<00:04:56.889> end<00:04:57.009> of<00:04:57.129> it

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
which is an unfinished sentence that I

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:01.320 
which is an unfinished sentence that I
didn't<00:05:00.280> realize<00:05:00.520> that<00:05:00.669> I<00:05:00.759> was<00:05:00.879> writing<00:05:01.120> to<00:05:01.180> him

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
didn't realize that I was writing to him

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.450 
didn't realize that I was writing to him
about<00:05:01.509> the<00:05:01.599> time<00:05:01.780> and<00:05:02.710> if<00:05:02.830> you<00:05:02.919> can't<00:05:03.129> read<00:05:03.340> it

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
about the time and if you can't read it

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
there and the white gel pen it says

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.610
