I've<00:01:38.080> not<00:01:38.259> seen<00:01:38.590> this<00:01:38.770> method<00:01:39.280> done<00:01:39.580> online

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
I've not seen this method done online

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.139 
I've not seen this method done online
I've<00:01:42.460> seen<00:01:42.700> other<00:01:42.850> methods<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:45.369> think<00:01:46.000> this

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
I've seen other methods I think this

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:47.580 
I've seen other methods I think this
one's<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.479> best<00:01:46.750> and<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.080> reason<00:01:47.380> why<00:01:47.530> this

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
one's the best and the reason why this

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.680 
one's the best and the reason why this
isn't<00:01:48.159> such<00:01:48.550> a<00:01:48.580> bad<00:01:48.819> thing<00:01:48.880> I<00:01:49.210> know<00:01:49.270> that<00:01:49.539> we're

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
isn't such a bad thing I know that we're

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.950 
isn't such a bad thing I know that we're
adding<00:01:49.869> heat<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:51.340> back<00:01:51.549> of<00:01:51.759> it<00:01:51.880> is<00:01:52.090> that

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
adding heat to the back of it is that

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.919 
adding heat to the back of it is that
the<00:01:53.789> polarizer<00:01:54.789> which<00:01:55.119> would<00:01:55.360> discolor

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
the polarizer which would discolor

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:02.910 
the polarizer which would discolor
normally<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:58.740> actually<00:01:59.740> going<00:01:59.890> to<00:01:59.950> be<00:02:01.920> not

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
normally is actually going to be not

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.160 
normally is actually going to be not
getting<00:02:03.220> too<00:02:03.490> hot<00:02:03.759> it's<00:02:04.119> going<00:02:04.810> to<00:02:04.869> heat

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
getting too hot it's going to heat

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.870 
getting too hot it's going to heat
through<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.649> back<00:02:05.860> of<00:02:06.039> the<00:02:06.130> display<00:02:06.280> which<00:02:06.729> is

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
through the back of the display which is

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.359 
through the back of the display which is
fine<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:07.720> we're<00:02:08.679> only<00:02:08.739> going<00:02:08.920> to<00:02:09.009> have<00:02:09.160> it<00:02:09.310> on

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
fine and we're only going to have it on

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:19.840 
fine and we're only going to have it on
here<00:02:09.640> for<00:02:09.910> a<00:02:10.769> minute<00:02:11.769> or<00:02:12.010> so

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:38.369 

you

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.780 

and<00:02:39.379> cleaning<00:02:39.739> off<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:39.920> glue<00:02:40.310> always<00:02:40.609> watch

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
and cleaning off the glue always watch

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.280 
and cleaning off the glue always watch
out<00:02:40.969> for<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:41.120> little<00:02:41.329> static<00:02:41.870> bar<00:02:42.049> at<00:02:42.200> the

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
out for that little static bar at the

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:54.599 
out for that little static bar at the
top<00:02:49.030> then<00:02:50.030> you<00:02:50.930> don't<00:02:51.109> want<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.909> just<00:02:52.909> run

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
top then you don't want to just run

00:02:54.609 --> 00:03:05.349 
top then you don't want to just run
along<00:02:55.609> the<00:02:55.939> sides<00:03:03.939> I'm<00:03:04.939> going<00:03:05.180> to<00:03:05.239> go<00:03:05.329> ahead

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
along the sides I'm going to go ahead

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:12.220 
along the sides I'm going to go ahead
and<00:03:05.569> get<00:03:05.719> a<00:03:05.780> fresh<00:03:10.359> and<00:03:11.359> just<00:03:11.750> going<00:03:12.019> to<00:03:12.079> go

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
and get a fresh and just going to go
