you would in the actual MMO all right
the<00:02:04.500> reason<00:02:04.860> for<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.070> is<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:05.700> allows<00:02:06.060> the

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
the reason for this is this allows the

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.930 
the reason for this is this allows the
game<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.540> have<00:02:06.689> an<00:02:06.899> actual<00:02:07.079> economy<00:02:07.829> so<00:02:08.489> now

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
game to have an actual economy so now

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
now that I've explained all this I'm

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.890 
now that I've explained all this I'm
going<00:02:31.850> to<00:02:31.940> go<00:02:32.030> ahead<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.240> get<00:02:32.450> on<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:32.690> server

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
going to go ahead and get on the server

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.840 
going to go ahead and get on the server
and<00:02:33.020> I'm<00:02:33.170> going<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.320> show<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:33.560> to<00:02:33.590> you<00:02:33.850> alrighty

and I'm going to show it to you alrighty
so<00:02:35.150> as<00:02:35.300> you<00:02:35.510> can<00:02:35.630> see<00:02:35.840> we<00:02:35.990> are<00:02:36.020> on<00:02:36.140> the

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
so as you can see we are on the

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.690 
so as you can see we are on the
multiplayer<00:02:36.709> selection<00:02:37.250> list<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.610> what

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
multiplayer selection list and what

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.470 
multiplayer selection list and what
you're<00:02:37.820> going<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:38.000> do<00:02:38.060> is<00:02:38.180> going<00:02:38.209> to<00:02:38.330> wait<00:02:38.450> for

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
you're going to do is going to wait for

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.960 
you're going to do is going to wait for
all<00:02:38.690> of<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.050> different<00:02:39.530> lists<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.220> pop<00:02:40.430> up<00:02:40.640> and

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
all of the different lists to pop up and

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.490 
all of the different lists to pop up and
then<00:02:41.300> you're<00:02:41.390> going<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.600> sort<00:02:41.870> them<00:02:42.110> by<00:02:42.140> name

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
then you're going to sort them by name

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.230 
then you're going to sort them by name
so<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.130> question<00:02:43.430> marks<00:02:43.610> at<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.790> top<00:02:44.000> this

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
so the question marks at the top this

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.910 
so the question marks at the top this
sorts<00:02:44.540> them<00:02:44.690> alphabetically<00:02:45.020> by<00:02:45.890> a

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
sorts them alphabetically by a

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.830 
sorts them alphabetically by a
descending<00:02:46.730> order<00:02:46.910> meaning<00:02:47.270> the<00:02:47.420> a<00:02:47.450> will<00:02:47.750> be

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
descending order meaning the a will be

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.229 
descending order meaning the a will be
first<00:02:48.080> all<00:02:48.320> right<00:02:48.739> so<00:02:48.860> we're<00:02:48.950> gonna<00:02:49.040> go<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.430> B

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
first all right so we're gonna go a B

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.990 
first all right so we're gonna go a B
and<00:02:50.510> then<00:02:50.959> see<00:02:51.380> all<00:02:51.650> righty<00:02:51.890> as<00:02:52.130> you<00:02:52.550> can<00:02:52.700> see

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
and then see all righty as you can see

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.360 
and then see all righty as you can see
