all balances out so for example you want

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
you buy low you sell low it balances out

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.479 
you buy low you sell low it balances out
you're<00:00:49.200> buying<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.500> high<00:00:49.680> market<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.340> buy

you're buying in a high market you buy

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.250 
you're buying in a high market you buy
high<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.789> sell<00:00:51.149> higher<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.660> just<00:00:51.899> all<00:00:52.020> pans

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
high you sell higher so it just all pans

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.950 
high you sell higher so it just all pans
out<00:00:52.469> it's<00:00:52.829> all<00:00:52.949> about<00:00:52.980> adding<00:00:53.550> value<00:00:53.960> one

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
out it's all about adding value one

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.450 
out it's all about adding value one
hundred<00:00:55.289> percent<00:00:55.320> profit<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> name<00:00:56.280> in

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
hundred percent profit is the name in

the<00:00:56.520> renovating<00:00:56.969> game<00:00:57.230> profit<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.469> guess

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
the renovating game profit and I guess

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.229 
the renovating game profit and I guess
speed<00:00:59.010> which<00:00:59.219> will<00:00:59.399> come<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.789> in<00:00:59.940> just<00:01:00.090> a

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
speed which will come to in just a

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.810 
speed which will come to in just a
moment<00:01:00.539> banks<00:01:01.500> willing<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.010> lend<00:01:02.250> against<00:01:02.730> a

my<00:02:12.030> next<00:02:12.300> question<00:02:12.629> which<00:02:12.750> is<00:02:12.900> what<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.260> the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
my next question which is what is the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.220 
my next question which is what is the
ideal<00:02:13.830> time<00:02:14.569> do<00:02:15.569> you<00:02:15.629> do<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.810> lot<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:16.080> the

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
ideal time do you do a lot of the

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.140 
ideal time do you do a lot of the
planning<00:02:16.680> before<00:02:17.099> you<00:02:17.280> settle<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.760> property

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
planning before you settle the property

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.150 
planning before you settle the property
is<00:02:18.269> that<00:02:18.420> how<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:18.629> that<00:02:19.530> how<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:19.709> can<00:02:19.890> get<00:02:20.010> in

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
is that how you that how you can get in

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.979 
is that how you that how you can get in
so<00:02:20.280> quickly<00:02:20.459> now<00:02:21.090> we<00:02:21.390> have<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.599> do<00:02:21.720> all<00:02:21.750> the

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
so quickly now we have to do all the

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.050 
so quickly now we have to do all the
planning<00:02:22.170> before<00:02:22.620> we<00:02:22.739> buy<00:02:22.920> so<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:23.819> that's<00:02:23.940> the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
planning before we buy so and that's the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.490 
planning before we buy so and that's the
difference<00:02:24.209> with<00:02:24.480> professional<00:02:25.019> renovators

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
then exactly what they're going to do to

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.250 
then exactly what they're going to do to

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
the property they do all the

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.080 
the property they do all the
pre-planning<00:02:28.769> they<00:02:29.160> know<00:02:29.220> their<00:02:29.519> time<00:02:29.730> frames

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
pre-planning they know their time frames

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.720 
pre-planning they know their time frames
or<00:02:30.390> before<00:02:30.690> they<00:02:30.780> buy<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:30.989> property<00:02:31.730> what's

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
or before they buy the property what's

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.910 
or before they buy the property what's
the<00:02:32.910> worst<00:02:33.150> renovation<00:02:33.720> you've<00:02:33.870> done<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.290> don't

down<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.160> got<00:02:59.250> in<00:02:59.340> trouble<00:02:59.459> with<00:02:59.670> council<00:03:00.209> and

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
down and got in trouble with council and

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:01.640 
down and got in trouble with council and
it<00:03:00.390> actually<00:03:00.510> meant<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:00.959> our<00:03:01.079> da<00:03:01.349> got

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
it actually meant that our da got

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.180 
it actually meant that our da got
delayed<00:03:02.030> so<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.150> did<00:03:03.239> result<00:03:03.480> in<00:03:03.810> not<00:03:04.769> as<00:03:04.980> not<00:03:05.160> a

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
delayed so it did result in not as not a

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.770 
delayed so it did result in not as not a
profitable<00:03:05.879> renovation<00:03:06.390> as<00:03:06.480> what<00:03:06.660> we<00:03:06.750> had

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
profitable renovation as what we had

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.089 
profitable renovation as what we had
like<00:03:07.019> we<00:03:07.110> still<00:03:07.290> made<00:03:07.440> money<00:03:07.620> on<00:03:07.829> it<00:03:07.950> but

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
like we still made money on it but

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.039 
like we still made money on it but
certainly<00:03:08.549> not<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.940> returns<00:03:09.540> that<00:03:09.690> we<00:03:09.870> could

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
certainly not the returns that we could

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:11.900 
certainly not the returns that we could
have<00:03:10.140> made<00:03:10.379> so<00:03:10.769> it<00:03:11.220> was<00:03:11.370> just<00:03:11.549> a<00:03:11.640> learning

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
have made so it was just a learning

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.220 
have made so it was just a learning
experience<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.569> as<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:12.780> professional

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
want to minimize them wherever possible

want to minimize them wherever possible
we've<00:03:18.569> done<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.810> few<00:03:19.380> renovations<00:03:19.680> personally

and one of the hardest things I find is

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.199 
and one of the hardest things I find is
that<00:03:22.680> cutoff<00:03:23.130> point<00:03:23.519> you<00:03:23.639> know<00:03:23.760> where<00:03:23.940> do<00:03:24.090> you

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
that cutoff point you know where do you

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.729 
that cutoff point you know where do you
stop<00:03:25.670> renovating<00:03:26.670> it<00:03:26.790> for<00:03:26.970> yourself<00:03:27.359> or

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
you need to have your strategy very very

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.640 
you need to have your strategy very very
clear<00:03:33.150> before<00:03:33.299> you<00:03:33.569> started<00:03:34.079> are<00:03:34.290> you<00:03:34.440> going

clear before you started are you going

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.170 
clear before you started are you going
to<00:03:34.799> be<00:03:34.859> renovating<00:03:35.370> this<00:03:35.489> is<00:03:35.670> your<00:03:35.819> owner

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
to be renovating this is your owner

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.940 
to be renovating this is your owner
occupier<00:03:36.660> residents<00:03:37.170> because<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.530> decisions

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
occupier residents because the decisions

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.550 
occupier residents because the decisions
that<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.190> make<00:03:38.540> as<00:03:39.540> a<00:03:39.599> owner<00:03:40.139> occupier

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.319 
that you make as a owner occupier
renovation<00:03:41.130> are<00:03:41.250> very<00:03:41.489> different<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.150> the

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
renovation are very different to the

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.509 
renovation are very different to the
decisions<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:42.750> you'll<00:03:42.959> make<00:03:43.139> as<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.739> seller

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
decisions that you'll make as a seller

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.120 
decisions that you'll make as a seller
as<00:03:45.180> in<00:03:45.660> terms<00:03:45.900> of<00:03:46.019> renovating<00:03:46.470> for<00:03:46.620> profit<00:03:47.010> so

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
as in terms of renovating for profit so

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.740 
as in terms of renovating for profit so
you<00:03:47.220> need<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.579> get<00:03:47.760> back<00:03:47.940> to<00:03:48.000> your<00:03:48.269> strategy

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
you need to get back to your strategy

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.659 
you need to get back to your strategy
and<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:48.900> needs<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.349> be<00:03:49.530> determined<00:03:49.889> before

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
and that needs to be determined before

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.550 
and that needs to be determined before
you<00:03:50.790> buy<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:50.970> property<00:03:51.450> you've<00:03:52.410> obviously

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
you buy the property you've obviously

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.470 
you buy the property you've obviously
got<00:03:52.919> a<00:03:52.980> good<00:03:53.190> association<00:03:53.910> with<00:03:54.000> your<00:03:54.120> bank<00:03:54.359> or

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
got a good association with your bank or

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.390 
got a good association with your bank or
bankers<00:03:55.019> do<00:03:55.290> you<00:03:55.380> use<00:03:55.530> different<00:03:55.950> bankers<00:03:56.280> on

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
bankers do you use different bankers on

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.220 
bankers do you use different bankers on
different<00:03:56.669> projects<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.150> certainly<00:03:57.569> do<00:03:57.930> they

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
different projects I certainly do they

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.110 
different projects I certainly do they
spread<00:03:58.650> your<00:03:58.709> loans<00:03:59.010> across<00:03:59.639> all<00:03:59.940> different

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
spread your loans across all different

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.860 
spread your loans across all different
lenders<00:04:00.690> so<00:04:01.380> that<00:04:01.560> you<00:04:02.090> can<00:04:03.090> basically<00:04:03.269> free

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
lenders so that you can basically free

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.830 
lenders so that you can basically free
up<00:04:03.989> any<00:04:04.200> money<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.829> go<00:04:05.160> and<00:04:05.310> do<00:04:05.400> other<00:04:05.519> deals

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
up any money to go and do other deals

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.900 
up any money to go and do other deals
what<00:04:06.840> about<00:04:07.079> a<00:04:07.470> lender<00:04:07.919> wanting<00:04:08.250> to<00:04:08.400> capture

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
what about a lender wanting to capture

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.400 
what about a lender wanting to capture
all<00:04:09.060> your<00:04:09.239> deals<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:09.690> they<00:04:09.750> try<00:04:09.959> and<00:04:10.109> do<00:04:10.230> that

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
all your deals and they try and do that

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.039 
all your deals and they try and do that
they<00:04:10.980> do<00:04:11.040> because<00:04:11.609> the<00:04:12.000> reality<00:04:12.359> is<00:04:12.690> banks

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
they do because the reality is banks

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.210 
they do because the reality is banks
want<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.290> stitch<00:04:13.440> you<00:04:13.590> up<00:04:13.620> for<00:04:13.919> the<00:04:13.980> rest<00:04:14.010> of

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
want to stitch you up for the rest of

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.039 
want to stitch you up for the rest of
your<00:04:14.310> financial<00:04:14.760> future<00:04:14.940> but<00:04:15.480> it's<00:04:15.510> very<00:04:15.840> very

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
your financial future but it's very very

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.180 
your financial future but it's very very
dangerous<00:04:16.229> to<00:04:16.590> do<00:04:16.709> that<00:04:16.859> it's<00:04:16.979> a<00:04:17.039> professional

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
dangerous to do that it's a professional

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.949 
dangerous to do that it's a professional
renovator<00:04:17.880> so<00:04:18.150> we<00:04:18.239> certainly<00:04:18.450> spread<00:04:18.840> our

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
renovator so we certainly spread our

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.560 
renovator so we certainly spread our
loans<00:04:19.139> across<00:04:19.560> many<00:04:20.190> many<00:04:20.430> banks<00:04:20.820> it<00:04:21.359> just

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
loans across many many banks it just

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.300 
loans across many many banks it just
means<00:04:21.750> that<00:04:21.959> our<00:04:22.229> debt<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:22.740> service<00:04:23.099> ratio

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
means that our debt to service ratio

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.570 
means that our debt to service ratio
isn't<00:04:23.849> maximal

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
isn't maximal

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.219 
isn't maximal
and<00:04:24.970> it<00:04:25.180> gives<00:04:25.270> us<00:04:25.449> the<00:04:25.539> opportunity<00:04:25.720> to<00:04:26.080> go

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
and it gives us the opportunity to go

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.559 
and it gives us the opportunity to go
and<00:04:26.259> do<00:04:26.500> our<00:04:27.009> next<00:04:27.220> deal<00:04:27.550> I<00:04:27.819> mentioned<00:04:28.449> at<00:04:28.509> the
