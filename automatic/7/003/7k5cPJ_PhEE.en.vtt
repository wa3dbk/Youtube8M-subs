here's<00:01:54.929> the<00:01:55.020> rear<00:01:55.289> view<00:01:55.909> with<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:56.939> 28<00:01:57.600> there

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
here's the rear view with the 28 there

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.599 
here's the rear view with the 28 there
are<00:01:58.289> 12<00:01:58.579> 12<00:01:59.579> yeah<00:02:00.539> 12<00:02:00.990> on<00:02:01.380> 14<00:02:01.950> s<00:02:02.130> they're<00:02:02.369> wide

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
are 12 12 yeah 12 on 14 s they're wide

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:13.789 
are 12 12 yeah 12 on 14 s they're wide
man<00:02:03.380> those<00:02:04.380> are<00:02:06.020> logs<00:02:07.020> 29<00:02:07.920> 5<00:02:08.220> 12<00:02:12.019> and<00:02:13.019> again<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
man those are logs 29 5 12 and again the

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:18.110 
man those are logs 29 5 12 and again the
clearance<00:02:14.269> in<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.450> rear<00:02:16.280> as<00:02:17.280> opposed<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.730> the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
clearance in the rear as opposed to the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:30.920 
clearance in the rear as opposed to the
clearance<00:02:18.450> in<00:02:18.629> the<00:02:18.750> rear<00:02:29.269> the<00:02:30.269> Sun<00:02:30.569> keeps

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
clearance in the rear the Sun keeps

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.420 
clearance in the rear the Sun keeps
ducking<00:02:31.200> in<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.500> out<00:02:31.709> make<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.280> lot<00:02:32.400> easier

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
ducking in and out make it a lot easier

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:48.890 
ducking in and out make it a lot easier
if<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:32.819> stay<00:02:33.090> away<00:02:33.299> for<00:02:33.510> five<00:02:33.660> minutes

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:03:02.010 

so<00:02:49.900> little<00:02:50.970> sound<00:02:51.970> comparison<00:02:52.600> I<00:03:00.750> think<00:03:01.750> so

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
so little sound comparison I think so

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:11.020 
so little sound comparison I think so
smooth<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:02.740> quiet

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:18.110 

this<00:03:12.030> thing<00:03:12.620> is<00:03:13.620> so<00:03:14.180> mechanical

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.089 

course<00:03:18.780> you've<00:03:18.930> got<00:03:18.959> a<00:03:19.110> swamp<00:03:19.409> series<00:03:19.769> on<00:03:19.920> it

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
course you've got a swamp series on it

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.509 
course you've got a swamp series on it
so<00:03:20.220> it's<00:03:20.310> gonna<00:03:20.430> be<00:03:20.519> a<00:03:20.640> little<00:03:20.849> louder<00:03:21.090> but

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519
