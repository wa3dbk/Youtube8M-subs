in<00:00:09.260> today's<00:00:09.590> lesson<00:00:09.830> we're<00:00:10.280> going<00:00:10.550> to<00:00:10.670> talk

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 
in today's lesson we're going to talk

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.420 
in today's lesson we're going to talk
about<00:00:11.260> how<00:00:12.260> to<00:00:12.290> do<00:00:12.710> some<00:00:12.950> simple<00:00:13.370> calculations

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.430 
about how to do some simple calculations

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.800 
about how to do some simple calculations
when<00:00:14.360> a<00:00:14.389> patient<00:00:14.840> has<00:00:15.490> hyponatremia

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
when a patient has hyponatremia

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.769 
when a patient has hyponatremia
hyponatremia<00:00:17.810> is<00:00:18.140> one<00:00:18.500> of<00:00:18.590> more<00:00:18.740> common

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
hyponatremia is one of more common

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.240 
hyponatremia is one of more common
electrolyte<00:00:20.779> disturbances<00:00:21.410> that<00:00:22.099> you'll

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
electrolyte disturbances that you'll

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.889 
electrolyte disturbances that you'll
find<00:00:22.640> in<00:00:23.000> the<00:00:23.210> hospital<00:00:23.689> and<00:00:24.070> there<00:00:25.070> is<00:00:25.520> a

00:00:25.889 --> 00:00:25.899 
find in the hospital and there is a

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:30.069 
find in the hospital and there is a
systematic<00:00:26.899> way<00:00:27.079> of<00:00:27.430> determining<00:00:28.779> what<00:00:29.779> to<00:00:29.930> do

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:30.079 
systematic way of determining what to do

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.170 
systematic way of determining what to do
in<00:00:30.320> order<00:00:30.529> to<00:00:30.649> correct<00:00:31.130> hyponatremia<00:00:31.910> and

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
in order to correct hyponatremia and

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.660 
in order to correct hyponatremia and
before<00:00:32.989> we<00:00:33.110> begin<00:00:33.440> this<00:00:33.680> lesson<00:00:33.920> and<00:00:34.370> it's

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
before we begin this lesson and it's

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.210 
before we begin this lesson and it's
broken<00:00:35.030> into<00:00:35.420> two<00:00:35.630> parts<00:00:35.989> this<00:00:36.140> is<00:00:36.200> the<00:00:36.380> first

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
broken into two parts this is the first

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.500 
broken into two parts this is the first
part<00:00:37.460> where<00:00:37.579> we<00:00:37.700> walk<00:00:37.970> through<00:00:38.149> a<00:00:38.239> simple

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
part where we walk through a simple

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.330 
part where we walk through a simple
calculation<00:00:39.260> and<00:00:39.590> then<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:39.859> second<00:00:40.190> part

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
calculation and then the second part

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.919 
calculation and then the second part
we'll<00:00:40.969> do<00:00:41.090> something<00:00:41.300> a<00:00:41.480> little<00:00:41.600> bit<00:00:41.719> more

00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:41.929 
we'll do something a little bit more

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:44.020 
we'll do something a little bit more
sophisticated<00:00:42.219> there<00:00:43.219> are<00:00:43.309> two<00:00:43.609> key<00:00:44.000> things

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
sophisticated there are two key things

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.090 
sophisticated there are two key things
that<00:00:44.570> you<00:00:44.690> have<00:00:44.870> to<00:00:45.019> know<00:00:45.230> when<00:00:45.859> doing

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
that you have to know when doing

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.459 
that you have to know when doing
calculations<00:00:46.129> for<00:00:46.760> hyponatremia<00:00:47.480> the<00:00:48.199> first

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
calculations for hyponatremia the first

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.419 
calculations for hyponatremia the first
is<00:00:48.710> that<00:00:49.179> sodium<00:00:50.179> changes<00:00:51.280> concentration<00:00:52.280> of

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:52.429 
is that sodium changes concentration of

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:55.479 
is that sodium changes concentration of
sodium<00:00:52.609> changes<00:00:53.149> specifically<00:00:53.839> are<00:00:54.739> due<00:00:55.160> to

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
sodium changes specifically are due to

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:07.120 
sodium changes specifically are due to
changes<00:00:55.999> in<00:00:56.030> water<00:01:03.250> and<00:01:05.260> the<00:01:06.260> second<00:01:06.710> piece<00:01:06.920> of

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
changes in water and the second piece of

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.640 
changes in water and the second piece of
information<00:01:07.370> that's<00:01:08.000> equally<00:01:08.510> critical<00:01:09.080> is

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
information that's equally critical is

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.280 
information that's equally critical is
that<00:01:09.710> changes<00:01:10.400> in<00:01:10.610> sodium<00:01:11.000> concentration<00:01:12.970> are

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
that changes in sodium concentration are

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:26.649 
that changes in sodium concentration are
not<00:01:17.110> due<00:01:18.110> to<00:01:18.320> changes<00:01:18.890> in<00:01:18.920> sodium<00:01:25.420> what<00:01:26.420> this

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
not due to changes in sodium what this

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.480 
not due to changes in sodium what this
means<00:01:26.990> is<00:01:27.259> that<00:01:27.320> when<00:01:27.860> we<00:01:28.040> do<00:01:28.219> our

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
means is that when we do our

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.080 
means is that when we do our
calculations<00:01:29.329> for<00:01:30.079> hyponatremia<00:01:31.090> we're

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
calculations for hyponatremia we're

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.690 
calculations for hyponatremia we're
going<00:01:32.360> to<00:01:32.509> rely<00:01:33.020> on<00:01:33.049> this<00:01:33.799> particular<00:01:34.280> feature

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
going to rely on this particular feature

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.270 
going to rely on this particular feature
of<00:01:34.850> hyponatremia<00:01:35.270> that<00:01:36.229> the<00:01:36.380> total<00:01:36.829> amount<00:01:37.189> of

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
of hyponatremia that the total amount of

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.730 
of hyponatremia that the total amount of
sodium<00:01:37.640> which<00:01:38.390> is<00:01:38.539> represented<00:01:39.170> as<00:01:39.320> milli

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
sodium which is represented as milli

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.590 
sodium which is represented as milli
equivalents<00:01:40.399> of<00:01:40.719> sodium<00:01:41.979> does<00:01:42.979> not<00:01:43.310> change<00:01:43.700> so

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
equivalents of sodium does not change so

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.749 
equivalents of sodium does not change so
if<00:01:44.869> we<00:01:45.079> come<00:01:45.350> up<00:01:45.530> with<00:01:45.799> some<00:01:46.070> calculations

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
if we come up with some calculations

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.300 
if we come up with some calculations
that<00:01:46.969> represent<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:48.259> total<00:01:48.649> amount<00:01:49.130> of

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
that represent the total amount of

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.440 
that represent the total amount of
sodium<00:01:49.610> we<00:01:50.299> can<00:01:50.479> then<00:01:50.659> use<00:01:51.020> that<00:01:51.079> number<00:01:51.530> to

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
sodium we can then use that number to

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.969 
sodium we can then use that number to
determine<00:01:53.450> how<00:01:53.659> much<00:01:53.869> water<00:01:54.289> has<00:01:54.560> to<00:01:54.710> change

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
determine how much water has to change

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.730 
determine how much water has to change
in<00:01:55.520> order<00:01:55.729> to<00:01:56.000> reach<00:01:56.270> a<00:01:56.479> desired

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
in order to reach a desired

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.380 
in order to reach a desired
concentration<00:01:57.740> of<00:01:57.859> sodium<00:01:58.130> so<00:01:59.000> these<00:01:59.149> are<00:01:59.299> the

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
concentration of sodium so these are the

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.480 
concentration of sodium so these are the
two<00:01:59.689> key<00:02:00.170> points<00:02:00.469> that<00:02:00.680> you<00:02:00.950> need<00:02:01.039> to<00:02:01.340> know

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
two key points that you need to know

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.580 
two key points that you need to know
when<00:02:01.789> you're<00:02:01.880> doing<00:02:02.180> calculations<00:02:02.899> regarding

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
when you're doing calculations regarding

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.209 
when you're doing calculations regarding
hyponatremia<00:02:04.549> and<00:02:04.969> so<00:02:05.090> let's<00:02:05.270> walk<00:02:05.539> through<00:02:05.570> a

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
hyponatremia and so let's walk through a

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.550 
hyponatremia and so let's walk through a
particular<00:02:07.219> example<00:02:08.050> so<00:02:09.050> you<00:02:09.110> have<00:02:09.289> a<00:02:09.320> better

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
particular example so you have a better

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.530 
particular example so you have a better
understanding<00:02:10.190> so<00:02:10.880> what<00:02:11.030> we're<00:02:11.150> going<00:02:11.240> to<00:02:11.300> say

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
understanding so what we're going to say

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.300 
understanding so what we're going to say
is<00:02:11.750> that<00:02:11.780> we<00:02:12.050> have<00:02:12.080> a<00:02:12.200> patient<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:15.130> we'll<00:02:16.130> give

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
is that we have a patient and we'll give

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.160 
is that we have a patient and we'll give
you<00:02:16.340> some<00:02:16.640> basic<00:02:17.210> parameters<00:02:17.510> of<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:18.020> patient

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
you some basic parameters of the patient

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.449 
you some basic parameters of the patient
it's<00:02:20.319> a<00:02:20.410> female<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:23.110> weight<00:02:23.319> is<00:02:23.500> 70<00:02:23.950> kilograms

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459

00:02:49.260 --> 00:03:02.070 

140<00:02:59.730> this<00:03:00.730> is<00:03:01.060> what<00:03:01.330> we're<00:03:01.480> going<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:01.810> try<00:03:01.959> to

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
140 this is what we're going to try to

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.600 
140 this is what we're going to try to
figure<00:03:02.350> out<00:03:02.500> how<00:03:02.769> much<00:03:02.920> water<00:03:03.190> does<00:03:03.459> the

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
figure out how much water does the

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.479 
figure out how much water does the
patient<00:03:03.760> have<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.180> urinate<00:03:04.450> or<00:03:05.430> perspire<00:03:06.430> or

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
patient have to urinate or perspire or

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.210 
patient have to urinate or perspire or
both<00:03:07.120> in<00:03:08.080> order<00:03:08.350> to<00:03:08.440> get<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.680> a<00:03:08.709> concentration

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
both in order to get to a concentration

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.520 
both in order to get to a concentration
of<00:03:09.370> sodium<00:03:09.580> of<00:03:09.850> 140<00:03:10.480> so<00:03:10.959> let's<00:03:11.170> figure<00:03:11.410> this

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
of sodium of 140 so let's figure this

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.979 
of sodium of 140 so let's figure this
out

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.210 

let's<00:03:16.989> put<00:03:17.140> our<00:03:17.230> patient<00:03:17.530> parameters<00:03:17.920> up<00:03:18.040> here

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
let's put our patient parameters up here

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.460 
let's put our patient parameters up here
so<00:03:18.400> we<00:03:18.580> remember<00:03:18.880> 70<00:03:19.720> kilograms<00:03:20.170> is<00:03:20.350> the

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
so we remember 70 kilograms is the

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.520 
so we remember 70 kilograms is the
weight<00:03:20.700> it's<00:03:21.700> a<00:03:21.880> female<00:03:22.269> or<00:03:22.989> she's<00:03:23.290> a<00:03:23.320> female

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
weight it's a female or she's a female

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.620 
weight it's a female or she's a female
and<00:03:24.090> we're<00:03:25.090> starting<00:03:25.360> out<00:03:25.480> with<00:03:25.510> a

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
and we're starting out with a

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.210 
and we're starting out with a
concentration<00:03:26.290> of<00:03:26.380> sodium<00:03:26.560> which<00:03:26.890> I'm<00:03:27.070> going

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
concentration of sodium which I'm going

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:36.090 
concentration of sodium which I'm going
to<00:03:27.280> label<00:03:27.670> in<00:03:27.850> blue<00:03:28.209> now<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:32.400> 110<00:03:35.010> while<00:03:36.010> the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
to label in blue now of 110 while the

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.750 
to label in blue now of 110 while the
equivalents<00:03:36.579> per<00:03:36.640> liter<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:37.420> our<00:03:37.959> target

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
equivalents per liter and our target

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:49.540 
equivalents per liter and our target
concentration<00:03:39.760> of<00:03:40.180> sodium<00:03:42.959> is<00:03:44.100> 140

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.940 

how<00:03:50.030> do<00:03:50.090> we<00:03:50.240> do<00:03:50.390> this<00:03:50.570> when<00:03:51.260> we<00:03:51.410> know<00:03:51.440> that<00:03:51.830> the

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
how do we do this when we know that the

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.710 
how do we do this when we know that the
patient<00:03:52.130> will<00:03:52.490> have<00:03:52.520> to<00:03:52.940> lose<00:03:53.150> some<00:03:53.450> water

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
patient will have to lose some water

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.660 
patient will have to lose some water
because<00:03:54.410> the<00:03:54.530> only<00:03:54.710> way<00:03:55.010> you<00:03:55.040> can<00:03:55.430> get<00:03:55.640> a

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
because the only way you can get a

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.840 
because the only way you can get a
concentration<00:03:56.300> of<00:03:56.510> sodium<00:03:56.720> of<00:03:57.050> 110<00:03:58.040> is<00:03:58.280> if<00:03:58.700> you

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
concentration of sodium of 110 is if you

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.450 
concentration of sodium of 110 is if you
have<00:03:59.030> taken<00:03:59.390> in<00:03:59.570> too<00:04:00.050> much<00:04:00.200> water<00:04:00.260> so<00:04:01.190> we<00:04:01.310> know

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460 
have taken in too much water so we know

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.100 
have taken in too much water so we know
that<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:01.790> patient<00:04:02.000> in<00:04:02.360> this<00:04:02.690> particular

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
that the patient in this particular

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.280 
that the patient in this particular
state<00:04:03.620> is<00:04:04.490> water<00:04:04.880> overloaded<00:04:07.750> so<00:04:08.750> we're<00:04:09.140> going

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
state is water overloaded so we're going

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.040 
state is water overloaded so we're going
to<00:04:09.380> have<00:04:09.530> to<00:04:09.710> lose<00:04:09.920> some<00:04:10.460> amount<00:04:10.910> of<00:04:11.060> water<00:04:11.300> to

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
to have to lose some amount of water to

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.950 
to have to lose some amount of water to
get<00:04:12.230> to<00:04:12.380> a<00:04:12.410> concentration<00:04:13.010> of<00:04:13.280> 140<00:04:14.210> but

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:14.960 
get to a concentration of 140 but

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.050 
get to a concentration of 140 but
remember<00:04:15.380> our<00:04:15.410> second<00:04:16.010> rule<00:04:16.190> when<00:04:16.790> doing

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
remember our second rule when doing

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.930 
remember our second rule when doing
calculations<00:04:17.320> about<00:04:18.320> hyponatremia<00:04:19.010> which<00:04:19.760> is

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
calculations about hyponatremia which is

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.920 
calculations about hyponatremia which is
that<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.209> actual<00:04:20.630> content<00:04:21.500> of<00:04:21.950> sodium<00:04:22.930> which

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
that the actual content of sodium which

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.150 
that the actual content of sodium which
we're<00:04:24.200> going<00:04:24.380> to<00:04:24.470> label<00:04:24.620> as<00:04:25.090> read<00:04:27.010> the<00:04:28.010> actual

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
we're going to label as read the actual

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.090 
we're going to label as read the actual
milli<00:04:28.610> equivalents<00:04:29.210> of<00:04:29.390> sodium<00:04:29.950> does<00:04:30.950> not

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
milli equivalents of sodium does not

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.780 
milli equivalents of sodium does not
change<00:04:32.050> so<00:04:33.050> whatever<00:04:33.470> this<00:04:33.890> patients<00:04:34.310> total

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
change so whatever this patients total

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.830 
change so whatever this patients total
sodium<00:04:35.390> content<00:04:36.020> is<00:04:37.360> that's<00:04:38.360> what<00:04:38.600> it's<00:04:38.720> going

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
sodium content is that's what it's going

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.030 
sodium content is that's what it's going
to<00:04:38.900> be<00:04:39.940> when<00:04:40.940> she<00:04:41.120> achieves<00:04:41.570> a<00:04:42.040> concentration

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
to be when she achieves a concentration

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.020 
to be when she achieves a concentration
of<00:04:43.190> sodium<00:04:43.400> of<00:04:44.110> 140<00:04:45.110> so<00:04:45.980> let's<00:04:46.220> find<00:04:46.460> out<00:04:46.670> how

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
of sodium of 140 so let's find out how

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.330 
of sodium of 140 so let's find out how
much<00:04:47.240> sodium<00:04:47.540> this<00:04:48.020> person<00:04:48.380> actually<00:04:48.530> has<00:04:48.980> and

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
much sodium this person actually has and

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.830 
much sodium this person actually has and
to<00:04:50.240> do<00:04:50.390> that<00:04:50.570> we're<00:04:51.290> going<00:04:51.440> to<00:04:51.560> take<00:04:52.510> the<00:04:53.510> total

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
to do that we're going to take the total

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:00.670 
to do that we're going to take the total
body<00:04:53.960> water<00:04:58.630> multiplied<00:04:59.630> by<00:04:59.840> that<00:05:00.110> by<00:05:00.470> her

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
body water multiplied by that by her

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:08.190 
body water multiplied by that by her
concentration<00:05:01.460> of<00:05:01.580> sodium<00:05:01.790> currently<00:05:06.940> and

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
concentration of sodium currently and

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.370 
concentration of sodium currently and
that<00:05:09.200> should<00:05:09.910> approximately<00:05:10.910> give<00:05:11.150> us<00:05:11.380> the

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
that should approximately give us the

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.680 
that should approximately give us the
total<00:05:12.650> amount<00:05:13.010> of<00:05:13.070> sodium<00:05:13.340> that<00:05:13.820> she<00:05:14.150> has<00:05:14.360> in

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
total amount of sodium that she has in

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:23.929 
total amount of sodium that she has in
her<00:05:14.870> body

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:23.939 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:28.409 

so<00:05:24.939> we<00:05:25.569> figured<00:05:25.960> this<00:05:26.110> out<00:05:26.289> already<00:05:26.430> and<00:05:27.430> what

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
so we figured this out already and what

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:41.640 
so we figured this out already and what
you'll<00:05:28.569> get<00:05:28.840> here<00:05:31.830> is<00:05:33.120> approximately<00:05:40.650> three

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
you'll get here is approximately three

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.719 
you'll get here is approximately three
thousand<00:05:42.099> eight<00:05:42.280> hundred<00:05:42.400> and<00:05:42.580> fifty

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
thousand eight hundred and fifty

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:45.809 
thousand eight hundred and fifty
millions<00:05:43.719> of<00:05:43.900> sodium<00:05:44.319> not<00:05:45.099> millions<00:05:45.580> per

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:45.819 
millions of sodium not millions per

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:48.149 
millions of sodium not millions per
liter<00:05:46.060> just<00:05:46.360> milliequivalents<00:05:46.800> now<00:05:47.800> this

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:48.159 
liter just milliequivalents now this

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:50.700 
liter just milliequivalents now this
number<00:05:48.550> which<00:05:49.539> represents<00:05:49.569> a<00:05:50.020> total<00:05:50.349> body

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
number which represents a total body

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.309 
number which represents a total body
sodium<00:05:51.280> or<00:05:51.699> the<00:05:51.969> total<00:05:52.210> sodium<00:05:52.629> content<00:05:52.870> does

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:53.319 
sodium or the total sodium content does

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:57.089 
sodium or the total sodium content does
not<00:05:53.349> change<00:05:53.969> so<00:05:54.969> she's<00:05:55.419> going<00:05:55.689> to<00:05:55.810> end<00:05:56.080> up<00:05:56.740> with

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
not change so she's going to end up with

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:59.399 
not change so she's going to end up with
this<00:05:57.370> much<00:05:57.759> sodium<00:05:58.210> the<00:05:58.810> same<00:05:59.080> amount<00:05:59.379> of

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409 
this much sodium the same amount of

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:03.149 
this much sodium the same amount of
sodium<00:05:59.590> that<00:05:59.830> she<00:05:59.979> started<00:06:00.310> with<00:06:02.009> except<00:06:03.009> this

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:03.159 
sodium that she started with except this

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:05.459 
sodium that she started with except this
time<00:06:03.430> she's<00:06:03.789> going<00:06:03.969> to<00:06:04.029> have<00:06:04.120> to<00:06:04.180> lose<00:06:04.539> some

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:05.469 
time she's going to have to lose some

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:08.040 
time she's going to have to lose some
amount<00:06:05.919> of<00:06:06.099> water<00:06:06.520> in<00:06:07.150> order<00:06:07.360> to<00:06:07.539> get<00:06:07.750> to<00:06:07.960> one

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
amount of water in order to get to one

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.129 
amount of water in order to get to one
hundred<00:06:08.319> and<00:06:08.379> forty<00:06:08.770> so<00:06:09.039> all<00:06:09.279> we<00:06:09.460> do<00:06:09.669> is<00:06:10.360> divide

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:11.139 
hundred and forty so all we do is divide

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.019 
hundred and forty so all we do is divide
by<00:06:11.409> the<00:06:11.469> total<00:06:11.800> body<00:06:12.069> water

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:15.029 

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:23.899 

-<00:06:16.029> that<00:06:16.539> amount<00:06:17.439> that<00:06:17.620> we<00:06:17.889> want<00:06:18.129> her<00:06:18.250> to<00:06:18.279> lose

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:23.909 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:29.010 

to<00:06:24.909> get<00:06:25.180> the<00:06:25.750> concentration<00:06:26.409> of<00:06:26.500> sodium<00:06:28.020> which

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
to get the concentration of sodium which

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:36.990 
to get the concentration of sodium which
we<00:06:29.319> have<00:06:29.759> stipulated<00:06:30.759> to<00:06:31.300> be<00:06:31.419> 140<00:06:34.800> and<00:06:35.879> so<00:06:36.879> if

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000 
we have stipulated to be 140 and so if

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.909 
we have stipulated to be 140 and so if
you<00:06:37.089> do<00:06:37.240> all<00:06:37.270> this<00:06:37.599> math<00:06:37.839> you're<00:06:38.319> going<00:06:38.589> to<00:06:38.710> get

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 
you do all this math you're going to get

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:42.839 
you do all this math you're going to get
a<00:06:39.099> value<00:06:39.909> for<00:06:40.270> X<00:06:40.479> and<00:06:40.919> X<00:06:41.919> turns<00:06:42.339> out<00:06:42.550> to<00:06:42.819> be

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:42.849 
a value for X and X turns out to be

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:53.169 
a value for X and X turns out to be
about

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:53.179 

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:57.549 

so<00:06:54.179> that's<00:06:54.479> how<00:06:54.749> much<00:06:54.959> water<00:06:55.669> 7.5<00:06:56.669> liters<00:06:57.059> you

00:06:57.549 --> 00:06:57.559 
so that's how much water 7.5 liters you

00:06:57.559 --> 00:07:00.439 
so that's how much water 7.5 liters you
will<00:06:58.559> have<00:06:58.770> to<00:06:58.979> lose<00:06:59.159> if<00:06:59.610> you're<00:06:59.999> going<00:07:00.149> to<00:07:00.330> go

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:00.449 
will have to lose if you're going to go

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:03.559 
will have to lose if you're going to go
from<00:07:00.689> a<00:07:00.779> concentration<00:07:01.169> of<00:07:01.559> 110<00:07:02.069> to<00:07:02.939> 140

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:03.569 
from a concentration of 110 to 140

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:05.719 
from a concentration of 110 to 140
keeping<00:07:04.289> in<00:07:04.379> mind<00:07:04.559> that<00:07:04.739> the<00:07:04.949> total<00:07:05.249> amount<00:07:05.669> of

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:05.729 
keeping in mind that the total amount of

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:09.949 
keeping in mind that the total amount of
sodium<00:07:06.800> never<00:07:07.800> changes<00:07:08.249> and<00:07:08.719> that's<00:07:09.719> the

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:09.959 
sodium never changes and that's the

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:12.519 
sodium never changes and that's the
simple<00:07:10.139> way<00:07:10.379> to<00:07:10.619> do<00:07:11.159> a<00:07:11.429> calculation<00:07:11.699> on

00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:12.529 
simple way to do a calculation on

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:15.019 
simple way to do a calculation on
hyponatremia<00:07:13.529> in<00:07:13.800> the<00:07:14.309> next<00:07:14.550> lesson<00:07:14.849> we'll

00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:15.029 
hyponatremia in the next lesson we'll

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:17.389 
hyponatremia in the next lesson we'll
complicate<00:07:15.689> this<00:07:15.809> a<00:07:15.869> little<00:07:16.259> bit<00:07:16.379> further<00:07:16.679> but

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:17.399 
complicate this a little bit further but

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:19.419 
complicate this a little bit further but
we'll<00:07:17.580> use<00:07:17.759> the<00:07:17.939> same<00:07:18.179> principles<00:07:18.779> that

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:19.429 
we'll use the same principles that

00:07:19.429 --> 00:07:22.309 
we'll use the same principles that
concentration<00:07:20.429> of<00:07:20.610> sodium<00:07:20.929> changes<00:07:21.929> because

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 
concentration of sodium changes because

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:23.869 
concentration of sodium changes because
of<00:07:22.499> changes<00:07:22.949> in<00:07:22.979> water<00:07:23.429> and<00:07:23.849> that

00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:23.879 
of changes in water and that

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:27.019 
of changes in water and that
concentration<00:07:24.869> of<00:07:25.169> sodium<00:07:25.379> does<00:07:25.889> not<00:07:26.339> occur

00:07:27.019 --> 00:07:27.029 
concentration of sodium does not occur

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:29.540 
concentration of sodium does not occur
because<00:07:27.539> of<00:07:27.779> changes<00:07:28.289> in<00:07:28.319> total<00:07:28.919> body<00:07:29.069> sodium

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:29.550 
because of changes in total body sodium

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.629 
because of changes in total body sodium
we're<00:07:30.089> going<00:07:30.240> to<00:07:30.300> use<00:07:30.569> these<00:07:30.779> two<00:07:31.139> rules<00:07:32.009> to

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 
we're going to use these two rules to

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:34.219 
we're going to use these two rules to
come<00:07:32.789> up<00:07:32.909> with<00:07:33.089> some<00:07:33.269> more<00:07:33.479> formulas<00:07:34.050> and

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:34.229 
come up with some more formulas and

00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:36.230 
come up with some more formulas and
calculations<00:07:34.409> and<00:07:35.099> hopefully<00:07:35.939> you'll<00:07:36.089> have<00:07:36.119> a

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 
calculations and hopefully you'll have a

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.999 
calculations and hopefully you'll have a
better<00:07:36.479> idea<00:07:36.719> of<00:07:36.959> how<00:07:37.050> to<00:07:37.169> perform<00:07:37.589> these<00:07:37.830> on

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:38.009 
better idea of how to perform these on

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:39.589 
better idea of how to perform these on
the<00:07:38.129> floor<00:07:38.369> when<00:07:38.939> you<00:07:39.029> have<00:07:39.149> a<00:07:39.179> patient<00:07:39.389> with

00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 
the floor when you have a patient with

00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:50.180 
the floor when you have a patient with
hyponatremia<00:07:40.229> thank<00:07:41.219> you<00:07:41.339> very<00:07:41.519> much

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:50.190
