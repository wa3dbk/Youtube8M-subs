00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
to keep the whole range but also add a

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.600 
to keep the whole range but also add a
frequency<00:01:40.290> control<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.890> allows<00:01:41.160> you<00:01:41.400> to

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
frequency control that allows you to
