00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.250
 Egyptian opposition refuses 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.889
 negotiations with the authorities of cars 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:05.850
 million passes in cairo alexandria and 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.330
 Other cities in the country have a climax. 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.959
 is close because more and more appears 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:13.019
 wishing to leave the republic and the capital 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.639
 should today take out about two hundred 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.020
 Russian students to send them 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.200
 a plane from ufa however difficulties can 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.670
 arise at the Cairo airport according to 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.170
 eyewitnesses there chaos reigns canceled all 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.640
 airline detail flights in the thick 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.570
 Event is Vyacheslav Goose 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.370
 direct connection with the studio Vyacheslav if 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.570
 on a ten point hazard scale 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.040
 defining the situation in cairo as far as 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.180
 give 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.790
 I would probably put 5 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.130
 failed the dangers are not very high but also 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.450
 the name is low and about 22 lives in a career 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.510
 million people or according to the opposition a 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.710
 over a million of them today came on 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.020
 Tahrir area to express 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.020
 your position mmvb marks go away such 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.630
 the slogan became the main anna march million 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.850
 a lot of people are extremely aggressive not 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.020
 the desire to fight and the army times the way square 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.560
 cordoned off by military technology 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.760
 and questions about the btr tank 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.820
 Davydov and military equipment but no one 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.790
 scares it seems that the army of Dagestan 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.580
 maternity although before our eyes oy oh bayan and all 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.360
 detained even change track pack from 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.090
 the demonstrators maybe they were 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.020
 most guide hotheads m now mind 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.240
 the rally continues on tahrir square until 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.110
 so far people are flocking the mail we were the most 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.080
 thicker 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.080
 an event right in the middle of it 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.070
 but its rally in general, I would not say that there 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.950
 very much too dangerous 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.590
 to foreigners little but immediately differ and 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.070
 we spent every detail to explain 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.980
 why are they here how and why 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.730
 what happens here so on 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.220
 periodically on the square passes 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.220
 prayer and then everything starting from praying 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.040
 percentage so there is generally little march 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.980
 million and i think that this is really 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.710
 you can call a million people 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.290
 maybe 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.780
 and here only in Cairo the worker came 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.019
 I know what's interesting 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.189
 m in career 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.109
 in on the square the tahrir goes on in general rally 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:16.629
 a little side a passes separately 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.689
 female and let's hear the opinion 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:19.769
 people 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.269
 hotel it gave want to give this trash 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.689
 party husni mubarak someone else wants 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.019
 keep his party someone wants to give them 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.909
 money there is some fees and cheaters and their leader 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:31.319
 real expanse 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.319
 for a long time they understood that we were not 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.950
 we can stay at home and others 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.079
 candidates on the streets of the city we had to 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.400
 come here and support 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.259
 protesters 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:42.489
 it is our right to speak out that we are 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:43.769
 think we shouldn't be afraid 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.719
 Armenia arbitration we want change she 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:47.279
 wanted to 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:50.279
 this night 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.950
 now it really all depends on 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.849
 positions of the army of the ravens of the forces of Egypt 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.409
 on whose side for example if its 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:01.769
 own business date it will be 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.870
 whether Egypt will be civil or 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.129
 on 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:05.479
 or 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:08.229
 dairy slogan ooo husni mubarak go away and 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:10.419
 all the same work and the president will have to 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:12.839
 all people leave my post and I will remind you 

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:14.699
 that he is on the eve of the first time in 30 years 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:16.909
 still appointed her deputy 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:18.219
 spent on permutations 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:19.819
 small permutations in 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.849
 government however it all looks like 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.549
 half measure because today 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.609
 only according to official data 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.869
 call the death toll of about 140 a 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:30.089
 human according to unofficial data 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:32.409
 we were told that more than three hundred and 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.119
 injured more than two thousand conflict came 

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:36.339
 too far and half measures i think 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:38.809
 here is not limited to tatyana 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:40.899
 Well, thank you, glory, we will wait for development 

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:43.319
 August events escalator
