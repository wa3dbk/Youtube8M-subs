of move packs with a pair of 88 the
first<00:00:21.960> thing<00:00:22.080> we<00:00:22.170> had<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.320> do<00:00:22.500> was<00:00:22.619> overpower

the Sun so when one head I had about two
stops<00:00:26.039> over<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.119> ambient<00:00:28.019> light<00:00:28.199> just<00:00:28.800> to

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
stops over the ambient light just to

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.710 
stops over the ambient light just to
really<00:00:29.010> give<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> nice<00:00:29.429> strong<00:00:29.760> highlight<00:00:30.000> and

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
went down as it got darker you know the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.600 
went down as it got darker you know the

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
strobes we have dialed the power down

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.580 
strobes we have dialed the power down
two<00:00:41.879> or<00:00:41.910> three<00:00:42.149> stops<00:00:42.390> even<00:00:42.780> four<00:00:43.050> stops<00:00:43.350> later

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
two or three stops even four stops later

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.529 
two or three stops even four stops later
on<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.160> cool<00:00:44.370> thing<00:00:44.520> about<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.820> move<00:00:45.000> pack<00:00:45.270> is

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
on the cool thing about the move pack is

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.540 
on the cool thing about the move pack is
even<00:00:46.050> though<00:00:46.140> my<00:00:46.289> camera<00:00:46.770> only<00:00:46.980> syncs<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.460> at

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
even though my camera only syncs it at

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.790 
even though my camera only syncs it at
250th<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.300> second<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.050> move<00:00:49.260> pack<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
250th of a second the move pack the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.560 
250th of a second the move pack the
flash<00:00:50.010> duration<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.489> super<00:00:50.789> fast<00:00:51.030> like<00:00:51.360> one

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
flash duration is super fast like one

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.150 
flash duration is super fast like one
eight<00:00:51.780> thousand<00:00:52.170> five<00:00:52.260> hundred<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.770> second

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
eight thousand five hundred of a second

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.040 
eight thousand five hundred of a second
which<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:54.000> know<00:00:54.090> incredible<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.629> stop<00:00:54.840> any

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
which is you know incredible to stop any

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.600 
which is you know incredible to stop any
action<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.860> don't<00:00:56.010> really<00:00:56.129> have<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.370> worry

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
action so I don't really have to worry

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.430 
action so I don't really have to worry
about<00:00:56.699> my<00:00:57.030> shutter<00:00:57.360> speed<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.870> know<00:00:58.230> as<00:00:58.320> long

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
about my shutter speed you know as long

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.869 
about my shutter speed you know as long
as<00:00:58.530> I'm<00:00:58.710> balancing<00:00:59.100> out<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.370> ambient<00:00:59.760> light

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
as I'm balancing out the ambient light

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.400 
as I'm balancing out the ambient light
so<00:01:00.090> I'm<00:01:00.149> not<00:01:00.270> getting<00:01:00.420> any<00:01:00.719> ghosting<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.289> know

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
so I'm not getting any ghosting you know

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.900 
so I'm not getting any ghosting you know
it<00:01:01.469> works<00:01:01.649> great<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.550> cool<00:01:02.730> thing<00:01:02.879> about

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
it works great and the cool thing about

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.060 
it works great and the cool thing about
the<00:01:03.210> power<00:01:03.420> 88<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.170> it's<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.920> can

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
the power 88 is it's it's that you can

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.520 
the power 88 is it's it's that you can
zoom<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:05.880> like<00:01:06.080> focus<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.320> light

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
zoom it in and out like focus the light

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.740 
zoom it in and out like focus the light
either<00:01:07.770> really<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.520> spot<00:01:08.909> almost<00:01:09.299> or<00:01:09.510> pull

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
either really on a spot almost or pull

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.510 
either really on a spot almost or pull
it<00:01:09.780> back<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.500> really<00:01:10.710> spread<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.130> light<00:01:11.280> out

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
it back and really spread the light out

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.550 
it back and really spread the light out
so<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.180> really<00:01:12.450> adjustable<00:01:13.020> modifier

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
so it's a really adjustable modifier

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.899 
so it's a really adjustable modifier
which<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:13.860> really<00:01:14.189> cool<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.549> then<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.760> can

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
which is really cool and then you can

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.140 
which is really cool and then you can
add<00:01:15.200> you<00:01:16.200> know<00:01:16.290> out<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.590> diffuser<00:01:17.040> out<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.880> grid

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
add you know out of diffuser out of grid

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.670 
add you know out of diffuser out of grid
there's<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> lot<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:19.020> know<00:01:19.080> options<00:01:19.350> to

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
there's a lot of you know options to

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.200 
there's a lot of you know options to
work<00:01:19.710> with<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.250> one<00:01:20.490> was<00:01:20.700> actually<00:01:21.030> more

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
work with it so one was actually more

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.179 
work with it so one was actually more
zoomed<00:01:21.509> than<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.869> other<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.860> created

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
zoomed than the other so that created

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.580 
zoomed than the other so that created
like<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> stronger<00:01:23.970> plate<00:01:24.780> out<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:24.990> one<00:01:25.290> para

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
like a stronger plate out of one para

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.740 
like a stronger plate out of one para
and<00:01:25.950> then<00:01:26.070> out<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.460> other<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.759> zoomed<00:01:27.600> it

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
and then out of the other I zoomed it

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.090 
and then out of the other I zoomed it
out<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.900> little<00:01:28.110> bit<00:01:28.229> more<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:28.770> created<00:01:29.070> a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
out a little bit more just created a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.980 
out a little bit more just created a
little<00:01:29.189> more<00:01:29.400> softer<00:01:29.820> even<00:01:29.970> light<00:01:30.270> alright<00:01:30.900> on

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
little more softer even light alright on

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.450 
little more softer even light alright on
the<00:01:31.110> last<00:01:31.290> set<00:01:31.530> up<00:01:31.619> we<00:01:31.770> moved<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.130> strobes

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
the last set up we moved the strobes

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.980 
the last set up we moved the strobes
back<00:01:32.700> over<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> other<00:01:33.270> side<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.780> ramp

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
back over to the other side of the ramp

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.510 
back over to the other side of the ramp
and<00:01:34.170> had<00:01:34.590> them<00:01:34.710> set<00:01:34.920> up<00:01:35.070> kind<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.340> how<00:01:35.460> we

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
and had them set up kind of how we

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.630 
and had them set up kind of how we
started<00:01:35.970> with<00:01:36.229> one<00:01:37.229> one<00:01:37.920> head<00:01:38.130> over<00:01:38.369> here

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
started with one one head over here

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.370 
started with one one head over here
behind<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.090> ramp<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.509> one<00:01:39.630> head<00:01:39.810> over<00:01:40.049> here

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
behind the ramp and one head over here

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.679 
behind the ramp and one head over here
on<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.890> side<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.310> ramp<00:01:41.490> cross<00:01:42.299> lighting

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
on the side of the ramp cross lighting

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.170 
on the side of the ramp cross lighting
each<00:01:42.840> other<00:01:43.020> creates<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.470> really<00:01:43.710> strong

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
each other creates a really strong

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.539 
each other creates a really strong
dynamic<00:01:45.180> lighting<00:01:45.750> by<00:01:46.200> changing<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.040> power

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
dynamic lighting by changing the power

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.789 
dynamic lighting by changing the power
output<00:01:47.820> on<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.299> on<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.720> strobes<00:01:49.049> one's<00:01:49.439> more

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
output on the on the strobes one's more

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.499 
output on the on the strobes one's more
powerful<00:01:50.250> than<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.490> other<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:51.180> get<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.329> really

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
powerful than the other we get a really

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.749 
powerful than the other we get a really
strong<00:01:51.630> highlight<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.979> really<00:01:53.250> nice<00:01:53.430> fill

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
strong highlight and a really nice fill

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.020 
strong highlight and a really nice fill
but<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.479> also<00:01:54.630> get<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.899> really<00:01:55.229> nice<00:01:55.560> sense<00:01:55.799> of

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
but you also get a really nice sense of

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.399 
but you also get a really nice sense of
shadow<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.270> definition<00:01:57.810> without<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.259> being

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
shadow and definition without it being

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.520 
shadow and definition without it being
too<00:01:58.500> strong<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.399> dark<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.909> moody

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
too strong and dark and moody

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.500 
too strong and dark and moody
it<00:02:00.920> creates<00:02:01.220> a<00:02:01.280> really<00:02:01.549> nice<00:02:01.700> really<00:02:02.299> nice

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
it creates a really nice really nice

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.060 
it creates a really nice really nice
look<00:02:02.750> which<00:02:02.930> works<00:02:03.170> great<00:02:03.470> for<00:02:03.500> action<00:02:03.950> sports

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
look which works great for action sports

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.640 
look which works great for action sports
at<00:02:04.820> the<00:02:04.909> same<00:02:05.119> time<00:02:05.390> you<00:02:05.960> know<00:02:06.080> I<00:02:06.110> did<00:02:06.409> want<00:02:06.590> to

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
at the same time you know I did want to

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
at the same time you know I did want to
see<00:02:06.830> a<00:02:06.860> little<00:02:06.979> bit<00:02:07.130> of<00:02:07.190> sense<00:02:07.460> of<00:02:07.580> the

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
see a little bit of sense of the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.160 
see a little bit of sense of the
overhead<00:02:08.119> lighting<00:02:08.390> here<00:02:08.690> so<00:02:08.929> I<00:02:08.959> was

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
overhead lighting here so I was

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.660 
overhead lighting here so I was
balancing<00:02:09.410> it<00:02:09.770> out<00:02:09.860> with<00:02:10.039> those<00:02:10.220> so<00:02:10.490> that<00:02:10.520> we

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
balancing it out with those so that we

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.580 
balancing it out with those so that we
weren't<00:02:11.000> overpowering<00:02:11.930> those<00:02:12.110> too<00:02:12.380> much

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
weren't overpowering those too much

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.660 
weren't overpowering those too much
because<00:02:12.830> otherwise<00:02:12.950> they'd<00:02:13.370> just<00:02:13.520> be<00:02:13.640> a

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
because otherwise they'd just be a

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.550 
because otherwise they'd just be a
little<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:14.120> little<00:02:14.569> white<00:02:14.720> spot<00:02:15.050> you<00:02:15.290> really

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
little a little white spot you really

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.960 
little a little white spot you really
wouldn't<00:02:15.950> really<00:02:16.100> know<00:02:16.250> what<00:02:16.400> they<00:02:16.520> are<00:02:16.550> so

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
wouldn't really know what they are so

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.880 
wouldn't really know what they are so
just<00:02:17.450> balancing<00:02:17.870> out<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.170> whole<00:02:18.319> scene<00:02:18.590> was

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
just balancing out the whole scene was

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.540 
just balancing out the whole scene was
was<00:02:19.790> really<00:02:20.030> what<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:20.180> was<00:02:20.360> after
