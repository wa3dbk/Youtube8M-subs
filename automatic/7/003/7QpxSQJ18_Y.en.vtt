00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:04.720 
hello guys welcome to my third tutorial

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.720 
hello guys welcome to my third tutorial
this<00:00:05.720> time<00:00:06.080> I<00:00:06.319> will<00:00:06.470> show<00:00:06.649> you<00:00:06.710> how<00:00:07.009> to<00:00:07.069> draw<00:00:07.430> a

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:07.730 
this time I will show you how to draw a

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.100 
this time I will show you how to draw a
head<00:00:08.149> and<00:00:08.480> the<00:00:08.660> face<00:00:08.900> so<00:00:09.710> let's<00:00:10.040> begin<00:00:11.110> start

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
head and the face so let's begin start

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.620 
head and the face so let's begin start
with<00:00:12.350> sketching<00:00:12.890> a<00:00:13.010> circle<00:00:13.550> and<00:00:13.760> don't<00:00:14.330> worry

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
with sketching a circle and don't worry

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.829 
with sketching a circle and don't worry
it<00:00:14.900> doesn't<00:00:14.930> have<00:00:15.530> to<00:00:15.740> be<00:00:15.890> perfect<00:00:19.839> when

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:20.839 
it doesn't have to be perfect when

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:23.079 
it doesn't have to be perfect when
you're<00:00:21.109> done<00:00:21.349> draw<00:00:22.009> a<00:00:22.039> cross<00:00:22.400> in<00:00:22.699> the<00:00:22.820> middle

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:23.089 
you're done draw a cross in the middle

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.569 
you're done draw a cross in the middle
of<00:00:23.240> the<00:00:23.419> circle<00:00:23.720> I<00:00:24.259> recommend<00:00:25.189> to<00:00:25.369> use<00:00:25.550> a

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:25.579 
of the circle I recommend to use a

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.730 
of the circle I recommend to use a
triangle<00:00:26.419> because<00:00:26.810> this<00:00:27.109> way<00:00:27.320> it<00:00:27.349> will<00:00:27.679> be

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
triangle because this way it will be

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.790 
triangle because this way it will be
easier<00:00:28.310> for<00:00:28.369> you<00:00:31.029> this<00:00:32.029> line<00:00:32.360> decides<00:00:32.900> how<00:00:33.530> big

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
easier for you this line decides how big

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:42.700 
easier for you this line decides how big
the<00:00:34.010> eyes<00:00:34.190> will<00:00:34.640> be<00:00:40.060> these<00:00:41.060> two<00:00:41.480> lines<00:00:41.750> helps

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
the eyes will be these two lines helps

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.610 
the eyes will be these two lines helps
you<00:00:42.920> to<00:00:43.130> place<00:00:43.430> the<00:00:43.760> chin<00:00:44.090> be<00:00:44.780> sure<00:00:45.080> that<00:00:45.440> they

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
you to place the chin be sure that they

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:56.440 
you to place the chin be sure that they
meet<00:00:45.860> each<00:00:46.040> other<00:00:53.860> now<00:00:54.860> draw<00:00:55.310> the<00:00:55.370> chin<00:00:55.880> the

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
meet each other now draw the chin the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.360 
meet each other now draw the chin the
fleshy<00:00:56.720> you<00:00:57.050> make<00:00:57.260> it<00:00:57.470> to<00:00:57.680> mow<00:00:57.860> it<00:00:57.920> will<00:00:58.190> look

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
fleshy you make it to mow it will look

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.720 
fleshy you make it to mow it will look
like<00:00:58.400> it<00:00:58.760> should<00:00:58.790> be<00:00:59.590> the<00:01:00.590> space<00:01:00.920> between<00:01:01.460> them

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
like it should be the space between them

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.399 
like it should be the space between them
should<00:01:02.000> be<00:01:02.060> quite<00:01:02.660> similar<00:01:04.659> then<00:01:05.659> just

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
should be quite similar then just

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:16.450 
should be quite similar then just
connect<00:01:06.859> the<00:01:07.009> lines<00:01:07.249> like<00:01:07.700> it's<00:01:07.939> shown

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.670 

the<00:01:17.460> shape<00:01:17.730> of<00:01:17.940> the<00:01:18.120> head<00:01:18.300> is<00:01:18.510> finished<00:01:19.020> let's

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
the shape of the head is finished let's

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.660 
the shape of the head is finished let's
continue<00:01:20.130> with<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.760> face<00:01:25.190> start<00:01:26.190> with<00:01:26.460> the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
continue with the face start with the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.890 
continue with the face start with the
baselines<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.720> eyes<00:01:27.870> the<00:01:32.330> space<00:01:33.330> between

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
baselines of the eyes the space between

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.020 
baselines of the eyes the space between
the<00:01:34.080> eyes<00:01:34.110> should<00:01:34.979> be<00:01:35.160> big<00:01:35.370> enough<00:01:35.400> for<00:01:35.760> a

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
the eyes should be big enough for a

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:48.289 
the eyes should be big enough for a
third<00:01:36.360> eye

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.929 

when<00:01:48.930> you're<00:01:49.140> done<00:01:49.380> just<00:01:50.039> continue<00:01:50.670> finishing

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
when you're done just continue finishing

00:01:50.939 --> 00:02:53.620 
when you're done just continue finishing
the<00:01:51.479> eyes

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.750 

between<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.840> eyebrow<00:02:55.320> and<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.740> I<00:02:55.770> should<00:02:56.190> be

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
between the eyebrow and the I should be

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:04.610 
between the eyebrow and the I should be
space<00:02:57.030> for<00:02:57.060> health<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:57.900> I<00:03:02.840> place<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.110> nose<00:03:04.290> on

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
space for health and I place the nose on

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.560 
space for health and I place the nose on
the<00:03:04.740> vertical<00:03:05.130> line<00:03:05.490> in<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.940> center<00:03:06.360> between

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
the vertical line in the center between

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.790 
the vertical line in the center between
the<00:03:06.930> horizon<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.590> line<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.490> circle<00:03:08.910> line

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
the horizon to line and the circle line

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.620 
the horizon to line and the circle line
the<00:03:10.800> mouth<00:03:11.040> should<00:03:11.400> be<00:03:11.430> on<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.970> line<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.450> the

the mouth should be on the line of the

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.100 
the mouth should be on the line of the
circle<00:03:13.190> then<00:03:14.190> erase<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.970> helping<00:03:15.360> lines<00:03:15.660> and

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
circle then erase the helping lines and

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.710
