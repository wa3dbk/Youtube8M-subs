00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
just be weird right but uh we'll see how

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.290 
just be weird right but uh we'll see how
it<00:04:40.290> goes<00:04:40.440> right<00:04:40.860> so<00:04:41.190> um<00:04:41.400> but<00:04:41.850> anyways<00:04:42.150> as<00:04:42.270> you

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300

can<00:04:42.480> see<00:04:42.600> right<00:04:42.630> here<00:04:43.050> I<00:04:43.260> mean<00:04:43.830> like<00:04:44.040> this

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
can see right here I mean like this

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.190 
can see right here I mean like this
thing<00:04:44.550> is<00:04:44.700> so<00:04:45.030> smooth<00:04:45.450> when<00:04:45.840> it<00:04:45.930> comes<00:04:46.080> to

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
thing is so smooth when it comes to

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.640 
thing is so smooth when it comes to
drifting<00:04:46.560> just<00:04:47.210> absolutely<00:04:48.210> amazing<00:04:48.650> very

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
drifting just absolutely amazing very

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.100 
drifting just absolutely amazing very
very<00:04:49.890> good<00:04:50.520> transition<00:04:51.300> surprisingly<00:04:51.870> to

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
very good transition surprisingly to

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.020 
very good transition surprisingly to
write<00:04:52.350> the<00:04:53.220> only<00:04:53.400> thing<00:04:53.550> you<00:04:53.670> have<00:04:53.820> to<00:04:53.850> watch

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
write the only thing you have to watch

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.570 
write the only thing you have to watch
out<00:04:54.270> for<00:04:54.300> is<00:04:54.690> that<00:04:54.840> it's<00:04:55.050> a<00:04:55.170> pretty<00:04:55.650> heavy<00:04:56.130> car

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
out for is that it's a pretty heavy car

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.360 
out for is that it's a pretty heavy car
weighing<00:04:57.240> at<00:04:57.390> 4,000<00:04:57.960> pounds<00:04:58.320> so<00:04:58.530> it<00:04:58.860> tends<00:04:59.220> to

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
weighing at 4,000 pounds so it tends to

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.910 
weighing at 4,000 pounds so it tends to
slide<00:04:59.880> sometimes<00:05:00.450> off<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:00.870> track<00:05:01.140> you'll<00:05:01.710> see

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
slide sometimes off the track you'll see

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.880 
slide sometimes off the track you'll see
later<00:05:02.430> a<00:05:02.850> few<00:05:03.240> seconds<00:05:03.600> here<00:05:03.720> I<00:05:04.020> actually<00:05:04.560> do

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
later a few seconds here I actually do

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.100 
later a few seconds here I actually do
that<00:05:05.070> so<00:05:05.970> you're<00:05:06.090> just<00:05:06.150> kind<00:05:06.360> of<00:05:06.420> got<00:05:06.780> to<00:05:06.930> make

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
that so you're just kind of got to make

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.570 
that so you're just kind of got to make
sure<00:05:07.140> you<00:05:07.410> slow<00:05:07.650> down<00:05:07.830> a<00:05:07.890> little<00:05:08.100> bit<00:05:08.310> and<00:05:08.460> just

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
sure you slow down a little bit and just

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.490 
sure you slow down a little bit and just
be<00:05:08.760> precautious<00:05:09.210> because<00:05:09.810> it<00:05:09.930> will<00:05:10.140> slide<00:05:10.470> off

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
be precautious because it will slide off

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.410 
be precautious because it will slide off
the<00:05:10.710> track<00:05:11.070> but<00:05:11.490> that's<00:05:11.640> like<00:05:11.790> a<00:05:11.820> lot<00:05:12.030> of<00:05:12.180> big

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
the track but that's like a lot of big

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.510 
the track but that's like a lot of big
heavy<00:05:12.690> vehicles<00:05:13.200> in<00:05:13.320> this<00:05:13.440> game<00:05:13.650> that's<00:05:14.400> what

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
heavy vehicles in this game that's what

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.750 
heavy vehicles in this game that's what
tends<00:05:14.820> to<00:05:14.910> happen<00:05:15.170> like<00:05:16.170> right<00:05:16.200> here<00:05:16.730> but<00:05:17.730> I

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
tends to happen like right here but I

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.820 
tends to happen like right here but I
mean<00:05:17.970> other<00:05:18.210> than<00:05:18.300> that<00:05:18.570> this<00:05:18.840> thing<00:05:19.110> is<00:05:19.140> very

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
mean other than that this thing is very

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.550 
mean other than that this thing is very
very<00:05:20.040> good<00:05:20.160> for<00:05:20.430> drifting<00:05:20.760> and<00:05:21.540> I<00:05:21.690> did<00:05:21.930> try<00:05:22.260> and

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
very good for drifting and I did try and

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.230 
very good for drifting and I did try and
max<00:05:22.800> with<00:05:22.980> the<00:05:23.070> horsepower<00:05:23.460> and<00:05:23.700> see<00:05:23.910> how<00:05:24.060> it

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
max with the horsepower and see how it

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.540 
max with the horsepower and see how it
drifts<00:05:24.600> and<00:05:24.720> it<00:05:25.290> tended<00:05:25.740> to<00:05:25.890> slide<00:05:26.250> off<00:05:26.280> the

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
drifts and it tended to slide off the

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.930 
drifts and it tended to slide off the
track<00:05:26.970> more<00:05:27.420> than<00:05:28.020> it<00:05:28.170> is<00:05:28.290> now<00:05:28.530> so<00:05:29.130> it's<00:05:29.280> 76

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
track more than it is now so it's 76

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.630 
track more than it is now so it's 76
horsepower<00:05:30.420> it's<00:05:31.230> perfect<00:05:31.530> I'm<00:05:32.040> not<00:05:32.220> I'm<00:05:32.400> only

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
horsepower it's perfect I'm not I'm only

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.550 
horsepower it's perfect I'm not I'm only
sliding<00:05:33.120> off<00:05:33.210> maybe<00:05:33.600> a<00:05:33.750> little<00:05:33.960> bit<00:05:34.170> usually

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
sliding off maybe a little bit usually

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.160 
sliding off maybe a little bit usually
it's<00:05:34.680> my<00:05:34.800> fault<00:05:35.070> but<00:05:35.790> when<00:05:36.000> I<00:05:36.030> maxed<00:05:36.480> it<00:05:36.570> out<00:05:36.720> to

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.170 
it's my fault but when I maxed it out to

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.490 
it's my fault but when I maxed it out to
the<00:05:37.260> max<00:05:37.470> horsepower<00:05:37.950> over<00:05:38.100> 900<00:05:38.820> I<00:05:38.970> just<00:05:39.600> I<00:05:39.840> was

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
the max horsepower over 900 I just I was

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.800 
the max horsepower over 900 I just I was
sliding<00:05:40.830> all<00:05:41.070> over<00:05:41.160> the<00:05:41.340> place<00:05:41.370> so<00:05:42.120> don't<00:05:42.600> do

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
sliding all over the place so don't do

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.170 
sliding all over the place so don't do
that<00:05:43.020> unless<00:05:43.290> if<00:05:43.919> you<00:05:44.040> want<00:05:44.220> to<00:05:44.340> just<00:05:44.520> you<00:05:45.090> know

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
that unless if you want to just you know

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.970 
that unless if you want to just you know
be<00:05:45.330> like<00:05:45.360> tom<00:05:45.750> cat<00:05:46.080> and<00:05:46.290> just<00:05:46.410> Mac<00:05:46.620> so<00:05:46.830> your

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
be like tom cat and just Mac so your

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.370 
be like tom cat and just Mac so your
horsepower<00:05:47.340> for<00:05:47.640> fun<00:05:47.820> by<00:05:48.510> all<00:05:48.660> means<00:05:48.900> but<00:05:49.260> if

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
horsepower for fun by all means but if

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.440 
horsepower for fun by all means but if
you<00:05:49.470> actually<00:05:49.620> want<00:05:49.980> to<00:05:50.100> you<00:05:50.880> know<00:05:50.970> like<00:05:51.240> go

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
you actually want to you know like go

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.270 
you actually want to you know like go
online<00:05:51.660> with<00:05:51.990> this<00:05:52.169> thing<00:05:52.380> and<00:05:52.410> rip<00:05:52.770> people

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
online with this thing and rip people

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.010 
online with this thing and rip people
apart<00:05:53.450> you're<00:05:54.450> going<00:05:54.570> to<00:05:54.630> want<00:05:54.780> to<00:05:54.870> at<00:05:54.960> least

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
apart you're going to want to at least

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.960 
apart you're going to want to at least
lower<00:05:55.410> your<00:05:55.620> horsepower<00:05:55.950> a<00:05:56.100> little<00:05:56.400> bit<00:05:56.550> just

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
lower your horsepower a little bit just

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.790 
lower your horsepower a little bit just
so<00:05:57.030> you<00:05:57.150> don't<00:05:57.240> slide<00:05:57.750> off<00:05:57.930> the<00:05:58.080> track<00:05:58.320> as<00:05:58.590> much

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
so you don't slide off the track as much

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.190 
so you don't slide off the track as much
