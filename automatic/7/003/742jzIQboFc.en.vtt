00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.880
 batista70phone friends this morning 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.910
 I was in samsung and I tried like 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.119
 you see in the picture the samsung that adr 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.779
 what was on the tfr is practically one 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:28.539
 sort of viewer for augmented reality 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.730
 or another virtual as well as 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.220
 you prefer to call it how it works 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.800
 practically in this mask not 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.440
 we see the complete package there is the 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.239
 standard package the viewer 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.360
 discriminated against in this trunk 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.820
 this viewer you see is with the 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.129
 pack let's say premium 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.150
 we mean there is also the 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:55.750
 gamepad we come immediately and costs 199 per 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.659
 the package with the 249 viewer only 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.820
 nice pack with iran for the game 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.220
 think of me because you can also wanting 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.580
 play then i will explain how you now 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.579
 I show a moment how the 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.509
 what above is practically at the moment 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:15.549
 only compatible with notes 4 and currently 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.340
 at least this model is compatible with 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.770
 four because it fits perfectly 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.280
 the 4 is framed above there are 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.409
 of programs to download with various 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.659
 video and anything else you can download 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.299
 the three of us also wear the 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.299
 reviewer is practically the 4th screen 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:39.289
 it is projected on the viewer to yield fruit 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:41.299
 from you have a 360 degree view in 3d 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:45.140
 this is the ballet where it is inserted 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.149
 that this as you see samsung dvr 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.899
 then how was I telling myself the 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:53.840
 operation is quite simple as well 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.729
 let's say technically I don't know how 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.579
 however, the screen practically works 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.859
 note 4 is practically screened vi 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.610
 find yourself completely immersed in one 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:06.590
 360 degree virtual reality 2 raise the 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.110
 head see what happens above 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.500
 you lower your head and there are several 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.780
 movies there are concerts there are games 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.459
 so you absolutely need to play 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.610
 the gamepad 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.620
 and how worn the viewer than one would 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.640
 he asks but how do I command him 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.849
 behind more simple 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.280
 there is a pointer when you move 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.170
 with the eyes with the head you can 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.230
 move the pointer over what I am 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.849
 interested here on the side you find one 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.250
 a kind of touchpad like that 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.500
 it's on the notebooks once you have it 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.530
 selected and double taped e 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.540
 go to select the content 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.760
 when you're done, you don't need it anymore 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.610
 a little bit above that serves as a 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.819
 send back back like the 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.430
 back button of android what is above 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.980
 you have a wheel that serves as a like 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.470
 zoom to enlarge or not I have to say that 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.200
 generally all the appliances that 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.489
 they project in 3d or with machines 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.900
 I don't know if you have ever heard of them 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.370
 black machines tossing you up 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.569
 xvi seems to be really in 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.450
 an environment are roller coasters 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.579
 anything else to maida 9 major problems 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.140
 so much so that it happened to pass out 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.200
 normal on the site my daughter are 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.079
 machine at the time she was 8 years 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.220
 well i fainted like one 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.629
 double harvest after two hours they are 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.670
 back to the hotel 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:31.459
 here is the same effect they do me a little 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.780
 3D TVs I feel alienated here 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:37.609
 instead of absolute zero 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.139
 as I said also there for test phase 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.840
 at some point you are in one 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:43.489
 practically natural situation there 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.940
 it seems to be from an environment 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:50.000
 real for which even the look does not have it 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.819
 view does not suffer for example I have 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.750
 tried various things for example then one 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.819
 species of seabed certain species 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.590
 it was a seabed but this was it 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.590
 let's make it more like this 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.180
 cartoon and lower head not 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.919
 I'm on the right instead of passing me 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.900
 above that they passed by if I did 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:11.000
 I turned to see what was behind me 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.549
 then passed the team and I have to say that 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.310
 i love very very suggestive real event 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:19.720
 the break the situation first from 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.799
 take with the hand or concert 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.479
 turning my head I saw that of 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.419
 alongside mac was so much so that channels 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.940
 applauded cheered and incited 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.150
 it really looked like one 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.620
 a real thing 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.350
 but so it is true that I have read some things 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.860
 on the internet about who wants to try a 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.770
 certain class 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.170
 but let's move on to say that it's better since 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.780
 alive that virtual however I told myself is 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.220
 a really real feeling then is a 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.300
 another beautiful video that has tried it 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.920
 it's a flight over Iceland 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.240
 we are in a helicopter with nando for 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.820
 air we see the helicopter blades 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.320
 looking down, we come to the side yes 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.480
 ago they are under the falls it looks like 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.600
 the water gets there on him 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.610
 what to say is not sincerely me 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.970
 I think one more thing pass me the term 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.260
 a little bit Italian one more thing 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.230
 toy more kind of thing 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.090
 3d television is the difference 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.980
 3d television that for its 13 we have 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.870
 in front we have glasses and see 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.260
 3d only what was the TV 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.810
 rightly and peripheral vision does not 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.120
 we see nothing in particular instead 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.550
 in this case we are completely immersed 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.530
 in this kind of virtual reality e 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.460
 whatever movement we make we are 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.330
 immersed 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.570
 then there is the possibility of using 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:37.510
 of headphones connected headphones that 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.520
 have on the left side with touching 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.510
 gets up lowers the volume three I would say 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:46.540
 even which are just fraud 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:50.140
 honestly I did n't think it was 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.360
 so special and so well done 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:55.450
 let's say that the only note is a little bit 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:58.090
 it is painful that in fact the resolution 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:00.780
 for example 4 is very high for once 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:03.730
 which is projected on this screen 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:06.760
 tends to lose some definition and 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:09.490
 let's say that especially in real videos 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.710
 a pixel bit can be seen to tend a bit 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.890
 to shell but however ok to say that it is a 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:17.860
 technology enough wishes for which 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:19.689
 it is liable to improvements then with 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:23.639
 batteries for crazy allowing 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:25.869
 in one year we will have 3k 4k and 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:26.319
 let's say for the application it will still be 

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:27.879
 best 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:31.299
 you will succeed in having an augmented reality 

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:33.399
 much more similar to reality and with 

00:06:31.299 --> 00:06:36.849
 let's say an optimal definition 

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:40.269
 however honestly I didn't think it was 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:42.759
 so it was so beautiful then they spoke 

00:06:40.269 --> 00:06:45.399
 love would like but yes why not at random 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:47.919
 spotlight on the couch I put it on a 

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:48.909
 nice video that now seabed 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:51.579
 something else 

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:53.169
 I look at it I relax more not 

00:06:51.579 --> 00:06:55.749
 I'm noticing, however, I have to say 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:58.029
 it could also be one thing 

00:06:55.749 --> 00:07:00.929
 quite interesting then in my opinion 

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:02.739
 also being a technology in its infancy 

00:07:00.929 --> 00:07:05.199
 199 euros 

00:07:02.739 --> 00:07:07.119
 those who are not little money, however, are not 

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:10.599
 not even that much is true that it only works 

00:07:07.119 --> 00:07:14.379
 with four for possibly not 4 can 

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:16.689
 also being an interesting thing are 

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:19.329
 net sending from the lawn 24 also 

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:24.069
 this becomes a bit expensive if not 

00:07:19.329 --> 00:07:26.559
 eating 4 and intrigued good spending 

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:28.389
 so seeing is not is not 

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:31.029
 very high ie we see when they come out 

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:34.089
 new products that prices have for which 

00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:37.209
 I have to say value for money 

00:07:34.089 --> 00:07:40.349
 I think it's good and also the fact that 

00:07:37.209 --> 00:07:42.729
 be a novelty does not make you tear 

00:07:40.349 --> 00:07:44.439
 anyway a curiosity then later I will do 

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:45.819
 the article that I will put all the photos 

00:07:44.439 --> 00:07:50.019
 so you can see it in a way 

00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:51.399
 detailed is important is not provided 

00:07:50.019 --> 00:07:53.469
 the marketing of the centers 

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:56.319
 commercial will be sold only on 

00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:59.289
 official samsung store 

00:07:56.319 --> 00:08:03.189
 at present the strategy is this and not 

00:07:59.289 --> 00:08:04.989
 there are currently di programs 

00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:06.579
 change it let's say I produced some 

00:08:04.989 --> 00:08:08.739
 niche if you are interested, take it 

00:08:06.579 --> 00:08:10.329
 from the official store with this 

00:08:08.739 --> 00:08:13.020
 concluded they are not total science 

00:08:10.329 --> 00:08:15.229

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.229
 Hello
