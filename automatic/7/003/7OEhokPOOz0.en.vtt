00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.170 
comfortable stance and we toss the ball
up<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:21.190> turn<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.370> wrist<00:02:22.580> like<00:02:22.790> this<00:02:22.820> we

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
up and turn the wrist like this we

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.670 
up and turn the wrist like this we
pretend<00:02:23.570> that<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.840> wind<00:02:24.110> is<00:02:24.230> blowing<00:02:24.350> this

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
pretend that the wind is blowing this

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.990 
pretend that the wind is blowing this
way<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.780> then<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.870> wind<00:02:27.050> changes<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:28.000> brings

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
way and then the wind changes and brings

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.880 
way and then the wind changes and brings
it<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.300> flag<00:02:29.690> this<00:02:29.930> way<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:30.680> looks<00:02:30.830> like

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
it to flag this way and it looks like

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:39.250 
it to flag this way and it looks like
this<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:35.750> so<00:02:36.110> when<00:02:36.920> we<00:02:37.040> serve<00:02:38.020> thinking<00:02:39.020> about

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
this and so when we serve thinking about

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.630 
this and so when we serve thinking about
keeping<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.680> shoulders<00:02:39.980> sideways<00:02:40.220> long

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
keeping the shoulders sideways long

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.900 
keeping the shoulders sideways long
enough<00:02:41.410> we<00:02:42.410> take<00:02:42.620> our<00:02:42.800> rack<00:02:42.980> back<00:02:43.310> I<00:02:43.550> like<00:02:43.760> to

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
enough we take our rack back I like to

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.400 
enough we take our rack back I like to
see<00:02:44.440> palm<00:02:45.440> down<00:02:45.800> like<00:02:46.100> this<00:02:46.840> avoid<00:02:47.840> opening

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
see palm down like this avoid opening

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.210 
see palm down like this avoid opening
the<00:02:48.560> wrist<00:02:48.970> keep<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.120> shoulders<00:02:50.480> sideways

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
the wrist keep the shoulders sideways

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.340 
the wrist keep the shoulders sideways
let<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.370> elbow<00:02:52.700> up<00:02:53.000> elbow<00:02:53.270> goes<00:02:53.960> up<00:02:54.170> the

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
let the elbow up elbow goes up the

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.860 
let the elbow up elbow goes up the
racket<00:02:54.530> goes<00:02:54.830> down<00:02:55.270> lead<00:02:56.270> for<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.480> edge<00:02:56.690> of

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
racket goes down lead for the edge of

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.680 
racket goes down lead for the edge of
the<00:02:56.930> racket<00:02:57.110> this<00:02:57.500> is<00:02:57.620> this<00:02:57.740> edge<00:02:57.920> right<00:02:58.160> here

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
the racket this is this edge right here

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.080 
the racket this is this edge right here
and<00:02:59.690> then<00:02:59.810> make<00:02:59.990> the<00:03:00.170> turn<00:03:00.610> soon<00:03:01.610> when<00:03:01.790> we<00:03:01.820> put

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
and then make the turn soon when we put

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.850 
and then make the turn soon when we put
it<00:03:02.180> all<00:03:02.240> together<00:03:02.890> and<00:03:04.810> then<00:03:05.810> after<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.680> hit

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
it all together and then after the hit

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.800 
it all together and then after the hit
the<00:03:07.160> follow-through<00:03:07.550> happens<00:03:08.240> yeah<00:03:08.630> I<00:03:08.660> think

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
the follow-through happens yeah I think

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.300 
the follow-through happens yeah I think
that's<00:03:09.170> a<00:03:09.290> great<00:03:09.440> point<00:03:09.710> you<00:03:09.860> brought<00:03:10.100> about

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
that's a great point you brought about

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.450 
that's a great point you brought about
the<00:03:10.490> shoulders<00:03:10.940> one<00:03:11.690> of<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.840> things<00:03:12.020> I<00:03:12.230> see<00:03:12.470> so

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
the shoulders one of the things I see so

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.330 
the shoulders one of the things I see so
much<00:03:13.700> in<00:03:14.030> club<00:03:14.240> tennis<00:03:14.660> is<00:03:14.870> on<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:15.800> serve<00:03:16.040> as

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
much in club tennis is on the serve as

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.010 
much in club tennis is on the serve as
the<00:03:16.490> shoulders<00:03:16.820> get<00:03:17.000> opened<00:03:17.360> up<00:03:17.510> way<00:03:17.959> too

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
the shoulders get opened up way too

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.040 
the shoulders get opened up way too
early<00:03:18.230> and<00:03:18.800> then<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:20.120> whole<00:03:20.239> flagpole<00:03:20.780> thing

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
early and then the whole flagpole thing

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.410 
early and then the whole flagpole thing
just<00:03:21.260> doesn't<00:03:21.470> work<00:03:21.800> right<00:03:22.190> so<00:03:22.520> you're<00:03:23.390> saying

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
just doesn't work right so you're saying

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.810 
just doesn't work right so you're saying
not<00:03:23.810> only<00:03:23.870> do<00:03:24.320> you<00:03:24.410> have<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.709> be<00:03:24.830> able<00:03:24.950> to<00:03:25.100> keep

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
not only do you have to be able to keep

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.170 
not only do you have to be able to keep
the<00:03:25.940> shoulders<00:03:26.360> closed<00:03:27.489> and<00:03:28.489> stay<00:03:28.760> sideways

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
the shoulders closed and stay sideways

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.780 
the shoulders closed and stay sideways
much<00:03:29.420> longer<00:03:29.930> but<00:03:30.500> you<00:03:30.650> get<00:03:30.770> a<00:03:30.800> weight<00:03:31.220> to

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
much longer but you get a weight to

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.720 
much longer but you get a weight to
really<00:03:31.820> let<00:03:32.330> that<00:03:32.540> wrist<00:03:33.040> rotate<00:03:34.040> let<00:03:34.610> the

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
really let that wrist rotate let the

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.420 
really let that wrist rotate let the
flag<00:03:34.970> for<00:03:35.150> the<00:03:35.209> forearm<00:03:35.750> rotate<00:03:36.250> until<00:03:37.250> the

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
flag for the forearm rotate until the

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.160 
flag for the forearm rotate until the
very<00:03:37.640> end<00:03:37.790> exactly<00:03:38.720> I<00:03:38.750> don't<00:03:38.989> know<00:03:39.050> whether

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170
