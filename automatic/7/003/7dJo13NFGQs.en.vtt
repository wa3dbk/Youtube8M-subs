00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
have your little plugs here are exposed

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.830 
have your little plugs here are exposed
your<00:01:59.219> microphone<00:01:59.820> right<00:02:00.060> there<00:02:00.299> has<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.540> nice

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
your microphone right there has a nice

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.980 
your microphone right there has a nice
cut<00:02:01.170> out<00:02:01.320> this<00:02:02.280> top<00:02:02.610> Mike<00:02:02.909> also<00:02:03.420> has<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> cutout

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
cut out this top Mike also has a cutout

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.440 
cut out this top Mike also has a cutout
and<00:02:04.409> they've<00:02:04.829> done<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.040> real<00:02:05.310> nice<00:02:05.549> job<00:02:05.579> here<00:02:06.240> on

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
and they've done a real nice job here on

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.570 
and they've done a real nice job here on
the<00:02:06.719> sleep/wake<00:02:07.350> button<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.099> volume<00:02:08.129> up

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
the sleep/wake button and the volume up

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.580 
the sleep/wake button and the volume up
and<00:02:08.729> down<00:02:08.789> giving<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.690> separate<00:02:10.200> cutouts

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
and down giving it to separate cutouts

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.960 
and down giving it to separate cutouts
it<00:02:11.129> gives<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:11.550> case<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.849> little<00:02:12.239> more<00:02:12.420> strain

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
it gives this case a little more strain

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.210 
it gives this case a little more strain
so<00:02:13.210> it's<00:02:13.390> not<00:02:13.540> real<00:02:13.810> loose<00:02:14.080> right<00:02:14.410> there<00:02:14.650> now

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
so it's not real loose right there now

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.680 
so it's not real loose right there now
all<00:02:15.430> in<00:02:15.610> all<00:02:15.730> for<00:02:15.760> twenty<00:02:16.240> dollars<00:02:16.570> I

definitely would recommend the

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.190 
definitely would recommend the
cruzerlite<00:02:18.460> case<00:02:19.000> I'm<00:02:19.300> going<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.900> go<00:02:20.050> ahead

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
cruzerlite case I'm going to go ahead

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.560

and zoom in here on these little android
guys<00:02:22.780> now<00:02:23.050> these<00:02:23.200> aren't<00:02:23.470> just<00:02:23.710> an<00:02:24.370> actual

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
guys now these aren't just an actual

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.150 
guys now these aren't just an actual
printed<00:02:25.240> screen<00:02:25.900> sheet<00:02:26.200> printed<00:02:26.620> or<00:02:26.770> anything

printed screen sheet printed or anything

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.490 
printed screen sheet printed or anything
they're<00:02:27.340> actually<00:02:27.760> cut<00:02:28.090> into<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.660> TPU<00:02:29.080> I

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
they're actually cut into the TPU I

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.080 
they're actually cut into the TPU I
don't<00:02:29.950> know<00:02:30.010> if<00:02:30.070> it<00:02:30.220> will<00:02:30.280> show<00:02:30.520> up<00:02:30.550> on<00:02:30.760> video

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
don't know if it will show up on video

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.330 
don't know if it will show up on video
but<00:02:31.780> there's<00:02:31.990> actually<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.440> physical<00:02:33.130> height

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
but there's actually a physical height

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.760 
but there's actually a physical height
difference<00:02:33.880> here<00:02:34.060> between<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:35.350> difference

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
difference here between the difference

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.460 
difference here between the difference
so<00:02:35.980> its<00:02:36.100> up<00:02:36.280> just<00:02:36.670> like<00:02:36.850> a<00:02:36.910> printed<00:02:37.510> on<00:02:37.690> stencil

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
so its up just like a printed on stencil

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.910 
so its up just like a printed on stencil
it's<00:02:38.620> actually<00:02:39.150> embossed<00:02:40.150> into<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:41.560> actual

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
it's actually embossed into the actual

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.830 
it's actually embossed into the actual
TPU<00:02:42.550> case<00:02:42.820> and<00:02:43.000> they've<00:02:43.090> done<00:02:43.240> a<00:02:43.300> very<00:02:43.570> nice

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840
