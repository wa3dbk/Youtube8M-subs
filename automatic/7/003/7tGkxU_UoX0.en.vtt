00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.330 
from your film there would be an issue
terms<00:01:52.930> of<00:01:53.110> wearable<00:01:53.500> tech<00:01:53.740> I<00:01:53.890> certainly<00:01:54.190> think

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
terms of wearable tech I certainly think

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.590 
terms of wearable tech I certainly think
it's<00:01:54.520> something<00:01:54.640> that<00:01:54.850> can<00:01:55.030> advance<00:01:55.360> in<00:01:55.510> the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
it's something that can advance in the

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.570 
it's something that can advance in the
future<00:01:56.020> however<00:01:56.710> I<00:01:56.770> just<00:01:56.830> don't<00:01:57.220> think<00:01:57.430> these

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
future however I just don't think these

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.070 
future however I just don't think these
gloves<00:01:57.909> are<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.150> right<00:01:58.299> way<00:01:58.479> to<00:01:58.540> go<00:01:58.690> with<00:01:58.990> it

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
gloves are the right way to go with it

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.289 
gloves are the right way to go with it
they<00:01:59.290> fill<00:01:59.890> a<00:01:59.920> hole<00:02:00.220> that's<00:02:00.430> not<00:02:00.700> really<00:02:01.120> there

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
they fill a hole that's not really there

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.460 
they fill a hole that's not really there
just<00:02:01.720> yet<00:02:01.810> but<00:02:02.380> in<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.560> future<00:02:02.770> certainly<00:02:03.390> on

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
just yet but in the future certainly on

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.359 
just yet but in the future certainly on
the<00:02:05.470> whole<00:02:05.620> the<00:02:05.650> hello<00:02:06.010> gloves<00:02:06.280> an

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
the whole the hello gloves an

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.920 
the whole the hello gloves an
interesting<00:02:06.850> piece<00:02:07.000> of<00:02:07.030> wearable<00:02:07.270> tech<00:02:07.630> but

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
interesting piece of wearable tech but

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:08.969 
interesting piece of wearable tech but
to<00:02:08.019> be<00:02:08.110> honest<00:02:08.349> we<00:02:08.409> don't<00:02:08.560> really<00:02:08.830> see<00:02:08.950> the

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
to be honest we don't really see the

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.610 
to be honest we don't really see the
point<00:02:09.099> of<00:02:09.369> it<00:02:09.899> it's<00:02:10.899> not<00:02:11.080> quite<00:02:11.349> good<00:02:11.560> enough

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
point of it it's not quite good enough

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.589 
point of it it's not quite good enough
to<00:02:11.890> replace<00:02:12.159> the<00:02:12.340> in-ear<00:02:12.760> receiver<00:02:13.209> and<00:02:13.569> the

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
to replace the in-ear receiver and the

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.240 
to replace the in-ear receiver and the
gloves<00:02:13.900> just<00:02:14.080> have<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.440> come<00:02:14.650> from<00:02:14.739> to<00:02:14.980> war<00:02:15.159> an

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
gloves just have to come from to war an

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.180 
gloves just have to come from to war an
easy<00:02:15.459> use<00:02:15.760> wearable<00:02:16.239> tech<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:17.590> idea<00:02:17.890> is<00:02:17.950> great

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
easy use wearable tech the idea is great

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.039 
easy use wearable tech the idea is great
we're<00:02:18.909> just<00:02:19.060> not<00:02:19.150> sure<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.420> market<00:02:19.780> is<00:02:19.870> there

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
we're just not sure the market is there

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:39.460 
we're just not sure the market is there
for<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.290> yet

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470
