00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.819
 hello friends today I'm going to 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.109
 teach how to download applications 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.220
 payment 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:15.750
 the operating system 5.0 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:18.060
 and I think also operational 5.6 6.0 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.500
 so the first thing we have to 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.150
 to do is to go to cydia 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.740
 I do this video because many 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.070
 users have told me that this light 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:30.470
 it stays a lot , it serves us and many 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.170
 things and this day I bring you 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.740
 an application in which it is better that 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.140
 is there 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.890
 again this is already in beta 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.410
 but what I've touched on is that this 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.829
 application if it's really worth it 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.749
 ok let's handle 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.749
 but do not charge if the sources 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:59.070
 edit add we are going to add the repo 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:59.070
 if we drive the dotcom iphone background 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.820
 9 point com diagonal or that you 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.490
 they install I already have it installed 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.560
 proud to add source and leaves 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.270
 the whole process when it is not 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.550
 installed we will go to the replacement of 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.320
 art 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.340
 and also hides population called 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:26.340
 vision would be the key to 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:28.990
 ok there is 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.640
 this application list that I have it 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.429
 modified but you will install it 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.030
 you no longer see that the term of processes go 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:36.030
 to go home 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:45.940
 ok and let's look for the protection 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.940
 that would be in stretches 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.119
 and well I already have here past two 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:54.360
 downloads and told them how is the process 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.360
 here 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.090
 to see any 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.450
 I do not know 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.459
 It is an application of a lamp 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.459
 it looks like 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.870
 here we are going to write that the application 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.560
 example is 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.239
 we entered the application and really 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.159
 well we have here but screen and 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.159
 the whole wave we are going to download 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.189
 while we are going to downloads 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.569
 ok there says thank you to download 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.450
 the mind is already downloading as they can 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.760
 watch 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.970
 this application is very very simple and 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.800
 easy to use since you only have to 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.890
 download and it's very simple very simple 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.760
 it's easier than the other application and I 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.490
 I think it will make them much easier 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.790
 to download many people from here 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:49.240
 today we hope here to be here here 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.240
 I will be 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.710
 another thing that I wanted to comment very 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.390
 important I wanted to apologize already 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.740
 that table by the symbol varies time of 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:04.940
 channel but not because for me not for me 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.630
 but because of problems I had 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.630
 okay 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.799
 and that's why he can hardly be very active 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.259
 of the channel but already 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.300
 I am already receiving video if possible 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:25.930
 a daily video 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.930
 okay 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.820
 24 percent 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.850
 and with this progression obviously you 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.480
 If you want, you can delete stadiums already 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.960
 So, no, it 's better than this 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.960
 them this application 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.940
 as you can see my connection is guiding 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.370
 but if you are obviously good already a 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.759
 time to download it will be installed to 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.830
 that has come here adjustments are 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:04.400
 articulate will install automatically says 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.690
 they do not activate it and with this it would be everything 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:11.129
 obviously here is reading me a lot 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:14.120
 3g connection but you really want them 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:16.040
 will download the climb and ready 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.770
 and you will be able to use your 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.419
 application ok well then all friends 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.400
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.400
 if you liked give me a like and it's me
