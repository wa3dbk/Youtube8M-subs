00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.500 

this<00:00:45.590> is<00:00:45.739> obviously<00:00:46.280> based<00:00:46.609> on<00:00:46.879> the<00:00:47.000> animated

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
this is obviously based on the animated

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.750 
this is obviously based on the animated
movie<00:00:47.539> rise<00:00:48.289> of<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:48.680> Guardians<00:00:49.160> that's<00:00:49.640> a

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
movie rise of the Guardians that's a

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.729 
movie rise of the Guardians that's a
movie<00:00:50.059> I<00:00:50.090> have<00:00:50.360> not<00:00:50.570> seen<00:00:50.899> nor<00:00:51.170> do<00:00:51.320> I<00:00:51.410> plan<00:00:51.710> to

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
movie I have not seen nor do I plan to

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.069 
movie I have not seen nor do I plan to
but<00:00:52.339> I'm<00:00:52.460> assuming<00:00:52.670> the<00:00:52.969> basic<00:00:53.360> idea<00:00:53.809> is<00:00:54.050> that

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
but I'm assuming the basic idea is that

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.290 
but I'm assuming the basic idea is that
all<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:54.920> holiday<00:00:55.309> heroes<00:00:55.730> have<00:00:55.969> to<00:00:56.000> join

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
all the holiday heroes have to join

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.270 
all the holiday heroes have to join
together<00:00:56.539> to<00:00:56.899> fight<00:00:57.170> evil<00:00:57.680> you<00:00:58.039> know<00:00:58.129> be

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
together to fight evil you know be

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.100 
together to fight evil you know be
because<00:00:58.730> Santa<00:00:59.059> is<00:00:59.149> in<00:00:59.180> such<00:00:59.510> great<00:00:59.719> shape

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
because Santa is in such great shape

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.280 
because Santa is in such great shape
what<00:01:00.949> with<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:01.219> milk<00:01:01.640> and<00:01:01.879> cookies<00:01:02.299> must<00:01:03.140> have

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
what with the milk and cookies must have

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.810 
what with the milk and cookies must have
bought<00:01:03.469> a<00:01:03.500> ThighMaster<00:01:04.239> from<00:01:05.239> suzanne<00:01:05.750> somers

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
bought a ThighMaster from suzanne somers

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.340 
bought a ThighMaster from suzanne somers
so<00:01:07.820> this<00:01:07.970> game<00:01:08.149> falls<00:01:08.479> into<00:01:08.690> that<00:01:08.869> obvious

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
so this game falls into that obvious

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.219

I<00:01:37.820> honestly<00:01:38.820> couldn't<00:01:39.600> believe<00:01:40.050> how

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
or something I seem like the only

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.650 
or something I seem like the only
explanation<00:01:47.760> for<00:01:47.790> me<00:01:48.090> having<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.390> same

different levels even that doesn't make

here in points that you can use to

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.280 
here in points that you can use to
upgrade<00:02:25.950> each<00:02:26.489> character<00:02:27.000> individually<00:02:27.870> but

upgrade each character individually but

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.740 
upgrade each character individually but

the changes don't even seem to matter of

the changes don't even seem to matter of
course<00:02:30.959> that<00:02:31.140> could<00:02:31.290> be<00:02:31.320> because<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.739> was

course that could be because I was
