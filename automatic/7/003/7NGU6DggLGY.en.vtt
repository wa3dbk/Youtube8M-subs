00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
for two to four inches it takes not very

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.830 
for two to four inches it takes not very
long<00:01:05.309> but<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:06.060> start<00:01:06.330> getting<00:01:06.510> much<00:01:06.630> more

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
I just got this blade this year and on

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:57.350 
I just got this blade this year and on
the<00:01:56.790> front

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
the front

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.780 
the front
those<00:01:58.259> two<00:01:58.439> wings<00:01:58.740> they<00:02:00.619> go<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:01.920> out<00:02:01.979> but

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
those two wings they go in and out but

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.060 
those two wings they go in and out but
then<00:02:02.939> they<00:02:03.090> also<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.689> also<00:02:03.840> scoops<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.979> it

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
then they also it also scoops so it

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.200 
then they also it also scoops so it
makes<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.369> lot<00:02:05.460> easier<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.790> like<00:02:05.909> if<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.060> get

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
makes it a lot easier to like if you get

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.419

a bunch of snow like this you can scoop
it<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:11.300> it'll<00:02:12.300> hold<00:02:12.450> more<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.959> he'll<00:02:13.319> get

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
it and it it'll hold more and he'll get

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.050 
it and it it'll hold more and he'll get
a<00:02:13.500> bunch<00:02:13.709> of<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:13.950> out<00:02:14.040> of<00:02:14.129> your<00:02:14.220> way<00:02:14.340> with<00:02:14.849> so
