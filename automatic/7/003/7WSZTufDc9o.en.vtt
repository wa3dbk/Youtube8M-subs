a chance to express myself a little bit

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.160 
a chance to express myself a little bit
more<00:01:55.829> on<00:01:55.979> field<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.869> obviously<00:01:57.869> that's<00:01:58.020> been

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
more on field and obviously that's been

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.779 
more on field and obviously that's been
recognized<00:01:58.679> by<00:01:58.859> Steve<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.280> his<00:01:59.369> staff<00:01:59.579> and
