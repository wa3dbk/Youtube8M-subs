00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
interior detail is good as well if we

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.619 
interior detail is good as well if we
focus<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.559> even<00:00:52.770> closer<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.969> tracks<00:00:54.360> and

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
focus in even closer on the tracks and

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.670 
focus in even closer on the tracks and
bearing<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:54.870> mind<00:00:54.899> we're<00:00:55.140> looking<00:00:55.320> at<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> very

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
bearing in mind we're looking at a very

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.950 
bearing in mind we're looking at a very
small<00:00:55.770> model<00:00:56.280> here<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.360> see<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> tracks

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
small model here you can see the tracks

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.389 
small model here you can see the tracks
the<00:00:58.170> rubber<00:00:58.350> tracks<00:00:58.620> are<00:00:58.800> looking<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.250> little

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
the rubber tracks are looking a little

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.209 
the rubber tracks are looking a little
bit<00:00:59.579> rough<00:00:59.640> in<00:01:00.149> real<00:01:00.570> close-up<00:01:01.070> so<00:01:02.070> they're

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
bit rough in real close-up so they're

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.270 
bit rough in real close-up so they're
not<00:01:02.309> top<00:01:02.550> quality<00:01:03.290> the<00:01:04.290> casting<00:01:04.710> details<00:01:04.890> on

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
not top quality the casting details on

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.060 
not top quality the casting details on
the<00:01:05.369> model<00:01:05.580> are<00:01:05.729> pretty<00:01:06.090> good<00:01:06.799> and<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
the model are pretty good and the

paintwork and the graphics are nice too

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.450 
paintwork and the graphics are nice too
because<00:01:10.290> if<00:01:10.409> we<00:01:10.560> really<00:01:11.189> looking<00:01:11.430> closely

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
because if we really looking closely

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.520 
because if we really looking closely
they're<00:01:12.330> good<00:01:12.479> quality<00:01:12.630> graphics<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> very

small model from the front there were

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.810 
small model from the front there were
some<00:01:16.020> contrasts<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.100> tracks<00:01:17.430> don't<00:01:17.610> look

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
some contrasts the tracks don't look

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.109 
some contrasts the tracks don't look
great<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.299> handrail<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.869> way<00:01:19.020> too<00:01:19.080> fat<00:01:19.820> but<00:01:20.820> if

this small scale from above the model
looks<00:01:26.189> quite<00:01:26.430> presentable<00:01:26.790> but<00:01:27.659> if<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.960> have

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
looks quite presentable but if you have

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.770 
looks quite presentable but if you have
a<00:01:28.650> closer<00:01:28.950> look<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.430> see<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.700> details<00:01:30.150> at

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.740 
my hands are obviously very big the
tracks<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.390> rubber<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:52.909> they<00:01:53.909> can<00:01:54.270> be<00:01:54.390> made<00:01:54.540> to

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
tracks of rubber and they can be made to

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.410 
tracks of rubber and they can be made to
move<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.320> kind<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:56.009> move<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.670> sprockets<00:01:57.240> and

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
move and kind of move the sprockets and

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.050 
move and kind of move the sprockets and
things<00:01:57.630> but<00:01:58.219> it's<00:01:59.219> not<00:01:59.340> really<00:01:59.579> very<00:01:59.610> smooth

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
things but it's not really very smooth

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.170 
things but it's not really very smooth
and<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:01.250> it's<00:02:02.250> not<00:02:02.369> really<00:02:02.549> enjoyable<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.090> do

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
and so it's not really enjoyable to do

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.889 
and so it's not really enjoyable to do
that<00:02:03.649> you<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.799> put<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.070> model<00:02:05.310> down<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.899> in

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
that you can put the model down and in

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.520 
that you can put the model down and in
terms<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.759> rotating<00:02:08.759> us<00:02:08.910> smooth<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
terms of it rotating us smooth and the

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.100 
terms of it rotating us smooth and the
boom<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.860> stick<00:02:10.920> movement<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:12.030> very<00:02:12.209> good

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
boom and stick movement is very good

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.800 
boom and stick movement is very good
and<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:13.890> can<00:02:14.010> see<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.370> can<00:02:14.520> pose<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.810> pretty

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
and you can see you can pose it pretty

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.320 
and you can see you can pose it pretty
much<00:02:15.960> any<00:02:16.290> way<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.530> like<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:17.100> it's<00:02:17.730> stiff

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
much any way you like and it's stiff

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.420 
much any way you like and it's stiff
enough<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.600> hold<00:02:18.810> any<00:02:19.620> pose<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:19.920> want<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.250> set

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
enough to hold any pose you want to set

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.580 
enough to hold any pose you want to set
and<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:21.420> can<00:02:21.630> stretch<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:22.140> right<00:02:22.410> out

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
and you can stretch it right out

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.470 
and you can stretch it right out
although<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.190> models<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.490> bit<00:02:23.610> unstable<00:02:23.910> when

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
although the models a bit unstable when

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.950 
although the models a bit unstable when
it's<00:02:24.600> fully<00:02:24.780> stretched<00:02:25.050> out<00:02:25.230> at<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.500> length

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
it's fully stretched out at that length

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.540 
it's fully stretched out at that length
you<00:02:27.960> can<00:02:28.110> also<00:02:28.230> see<00:02:28.530> here<00:02:28.770> that<00:02:28.800> starting<00:02:29.430> to

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
you can also see here that starting to

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.580 
you can also see here that starting to
lift<00:02:29.700> off<00:02:29.880> its<00:02:30.060> rear<00:02:30.270> track<00:02:30.540> as<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:30.900> loads<00:02:31.260> this

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
lift off its rear track as it loads this

highly detailed but it's relatively
