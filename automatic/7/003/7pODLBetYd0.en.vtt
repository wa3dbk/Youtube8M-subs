00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.599 

this<00:00:50.629> is<00:00:50.809> a<00:00:50.840> nicely<00:00:51.440> balanced<00:00:51.920> guitar<00:00:52.280> sound

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
this is a nicely balanced guitar sound

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.509 
this is a nicely balanced guitar sound
with<00:00:52.879> not<00:00:53.149> too<00:00:53.510> much<00:00:53.629> bass<00:00:53.930> this<00:00:54.860> is<00:00:55.100> a<00:00:55.129> fairly

with not too much bass this is a fairly

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:57.369 
with not too much bass this is a fairly

typical mic position for studio
recording<00:00:57.579> now<00:00:58.579> we<00:00:58.640> turn<00:00:58.909> the<00:00:59.059> microphone

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
recording now we turn the microphone

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.350 
recording now we turn the microphone
about<00:00:59.780> 45<00:01:00.320> degrees<00:01:00.649> off-axis<00:01:01.089> so<00:01:02.089> that<00:01:02.239> it's

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
about 45 degrees off-axis so that it's

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.479 
about 45 degrees off-axis so that it's
pointing<00:01:02.629> directly<00:01:02.750> at<00:01:03.110> the<00:01:03.260> sound<00:01:03.500> hole<00:01:03.710> it's

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
pointing directly at the sound hole it's

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.830 
pointing directly at the sound hole it's
still<00:01:04.820> eight<00:01:05.000> inches<00:01:05.330> in<00:01:05.390> front<00:01:05.630> of<00:01:05.750> the

still eight inches in front of the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.660 
still eight inches in front of the
strings<00:01:06.170> at<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.380> twelfth<00:01:06.740> fret<00:01:06.890> but<00:01:07.520> it's

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
strings at the twelfth fret but it's

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.160 
strings at the twelfth fret but it's
looking<00:01:08.060> at<00:01:08.210> a<00:01:08.240> different<00:01:08.659> point<00:01:08.840> on<00:01:09.049> the

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
looking at a different point on the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:35.280 
looking at a different point on the
guitar

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.350 

this<00:01:36.010> is<00:01:36.160> similar<00:01:36.400> in<00:01:36.670> sound<00:01:36.910> to<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.120> first

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
this is similar in sound to the first

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.060 
this is similar in sound to the first
position<00:01:37.840> but<00:01:37.870> produces<00:01:38.470> a<00:01:38.500> little<00:01:38.890> more

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
position but produces a little more

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.040 
position but produces a little more
finger<00:01:39.430> noise<00:01:39.610> when<00:01:39.880> picking<00:01:40.270> and<00:01:40.450> a<00:01:40.600> slightly

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
finger noise when picking and a slightly

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.290 
finger noise when picking and a slightly
fuller<00:01:41.320> sound<00:01:41.680> now<00:01:42.370> we<00:01:42.430> move<00:01:42.730> the<00:01:42.880> mic<00:01:43.060> so<00:01:43.270> that

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
fuller sound now we move the mic so that

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.330 
fuller sound now we move the mic so that
it's<00:01:43.540> directly<00:01:43.990> in<00:01:44.170> front<00:01:44.470> of<00:01:44.650> the<00:01:44.890> sound<00:01:45.160> hole

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
it's directly in front of the sound hole

00:01:45.340 --> 00:02:12.090 
it's directly in front of the sound hole
in<00:01:45.580> exactly<00:01:46.360> ten<00:01:46.720> inches<00:01:47.080> from<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.500> strings

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.980 

this<00:02:13.100> position<00:02:13.610> reproduces<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.360> lowest

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
this position reproduces the lowest

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.600 
this position reproduces the lowest
frequencies<00:02:15.560> on<00:02:15.710> the<00:02:15.830> guitar<00:02:16.130> because<00:02:16.370> it's

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
frequencies on the guitar because it's

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.250 
frequencies on the guitar because it's
looking<00:02:16.940> right<00:02:17.120> into<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.480> sound<00:02:17.780> hole<00:02:17.960> and

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
looking right into the sound hole and

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.080 
looking right into the sound hole and
you<00:02:18.680> might<00:02:18.890> want<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:19.280> engage<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:19.940> low

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
you might want to engage the low

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.660 
you might want to engage the low
roll-off<00:02:20.510> filter<00:02:20.870> on<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.110> mic<00:02:21.320> or<00:02:21.770> use<00:02:22.040> EQ<00:02:22.490> on

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
roll-off filter on the mic or use EQ on

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.580 
roll-off filter on the mic or use EQ on
the<00:02:22.790> channel<00:02:23.180> now<00:02:23.660> let's<00:02:23.900> turn<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.200> mic<00:02:24.350> about

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
the channel now let's turn the mic about

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.530 
the channel now let's turn the mic about
45<00:02:25.040> degrees<00:02:25.430> so<00:02:25.730> that<00:02:25.880> it's<00:02:26.030> looking<00:02:26.330> at<00:02:26.450> the

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
45 degrees so that it's looking at the

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.510 
45 degrees so that it's looking at the
12th<00:02:26.900> fret<00:02:27.080> and<00:02:27.440> see<00:02:27.890> what<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.130> sounds<00:02:28.490> like

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
12th fret and see what it sounds like

the guitar the mic is now exactly four

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:33.089 
the guitar the mic is now exactly four
inches<00:03:09.680> in<00:03:09.950> front<00:03:10.220> of<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.400> 12th<00:03:10.760> fret

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.069 

this<00:03:34.099> position<00:03:34.640> minimises<00:03:35.299> the<00:03:35.329> room<00:03:35.659> sounds

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
this position minimises the room sounds

this position minimises the room sounds
quite<00:03:36.319> a<00:03:36.349> bit<00:03:36.620> and<00:03:36.769> reproduces<00:03:37.549> a<00:03:37.579> rich
