00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.090 
capabilities as an arms warrior anyway
so<00:01:28.520> but<00:01:29.520> basically<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:31.049> helps<00:01:31.590> solve<00:01:31.920> a

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
so but basically I that helps solve a

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.260 
so but basically I that helps solve a
couple<00:01:32.340> problems<00:01:32.490> with<00:01:32.700> arms<00:01:32.880> worries<00:01:33.150> are

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
couple problems with arms worries are

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.510 
couple problems with arms worries are
our<00:01:34.140> inability<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.890> be<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> defensive<00:01:35.310> stance

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
our inability to be a defensive stance

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.580 
our inability to be a defensive stance
which<00:01:35.759> leads<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.210> defensive<00:01:37.130> weakness<00:01:38.130> and

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
which leads to a defensive weakness and

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.380 
which leads to a defensive weakness and
it<00:01:40.590> also<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.979> problem<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.400> having<00:01:41.520> very<00:01:42.060> few

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
it also is a problem of having very few

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.179 
it also is a problem of having very few
abilities<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.899> use<00:01:43.020> outside<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.740> mortal

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
abilities to use outside of mortal

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.940 
abilities to use outside of mortal
strike<00:01:44.340> Colossus<00:01:44.790> mash<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.299> that's<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.470> now

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
strike Colossus mash and that's it now

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.100 
strike Colossus mash and that's it now
you<00:01:47.009> have<00:01:47.310> access<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.790> revenge<00:01:48.270> now<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:48.930> have

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
you have access to revenge now you have

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.490 
you have access to revenge now you have
access<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.549> devastate<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:51.259> both<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.409> those

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
access to devastate and both of those

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.800 
access to devastate and both of those
are<00:01:52.829> free<00:01:53.490> abilities<00:01:53.939> essentially<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.630> only

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
are free abilities essentially the only

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.459 
are free abilities essentially the only
thing<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:56.460> revenge<00:01:56.820> does

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
thing is that on that revenge does

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:59.660 
thing is that on that revenge does
generate<00:01:58.469> rage<00:01:58.680> has<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.890> nine<00:01:59.130> second<00:01:59.490> coat<00:01:59.640> on

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
generate rage has a nine second coat on

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.270 
generate rage has a nine second coat on
it<00:01:59.939> though<00:02:00.090> however<00:02:00.659> your<00:02:01.409> revenge<00:02:01.920> can<00:02:02.250> be

devastate and it can be reset by dodging
or<00:02:06.930> parrying<00:02:07.350> which<00:02:07.950> means<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:09.000> know

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
seeing right now and it does address a

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.959 
seeing right now and it does address a
lot<00:02:29.750> of<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:29.900> problems<00:02:30.109> that<00:02:30.290> warriors<00:02:30.650> faced

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
defensive stance and not having really

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.780

very<00:02:36.379> many<00:02:36.560> abilities<00:02:36.799> to<00:02:37.129> use<00:02:37.280> outside<00:02:37.459> up

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
very many abilities to use outside up

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.339 
very many abilities to use outside up
like<00:02:37.819> Colossus<00:02:38.389> master<00:02:38.719> mortal<00:02:38.959> strike<00:02:39.109> and

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
like Colossus master mortal strike and

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.709 
like Colossus master mortal strike and
then<00:02:39.409> execute<00:02:39.889> so<00:02:40.129> some<00:02:40.939> pretty<00:02:41.150> heads<00:02:41.480> up

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:41.719 
then execute so some pretty heads up

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:43.179 
then execute so some pretty heads up
changes<00:02:42.109> by<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.260> developers<00:02:42.739> and<00:02:42.920> I'm<00:02:42.980> pretty

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:43.189 
changes by the developers and I'm pretty

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:44.920 
changes by the developers and I'm pretty
interested<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.639> keep<00:02:43.790> playing<00:02:44.030> this<00:02:44.209> once<00:02:44.780> the

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
interested to keep playing this once the

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.960 
interested to keep playing this once the
server's<00:02:45.260> restart<00:02:45.859> and<00:02:45.919> come<00:02:46.069> back<00:02:46.159> up<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.549> see

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
server's restart and come back up to see

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.369 
server's restart and come back up to see
exactly<00:02:47.120> how<00:02:47.510> it's<00:02:47.629> going<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:47.780> affect<00:02:47.870> the

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
exactly how it's going to affect the

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.140 
exactly how it's going to affect the
warrior<00:02:48.709> rotation<00:02:49.250> but<00:02:49.400> from<00:02:49.909> what<00:02:50.000> I've<00:02:50.120> seen

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
warrior rotation but from what I've seen

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.659 
warrior rotation but from what I've seen
so<00:02:50.329> far<00:02:50.540> some<00:02:51.290> really<00:02:51.650> really<00:02:51.889> cool<00:02:52.159> stuff<00:02:52.280> and

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:52.669 
so far some really really cool stuff and

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:53.860 
so far some really really cool stuff and
i<00:02:52.730> think<00:02:52.970> i'm<00:02:53.120> probably<00:02:53.389> moving<00:02:53.599> the<00:02:53.780> right

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
i think i'm probably moving the right

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.110 
i think i'm probably moving the right
direction<00:02:53.930> oh<00:02:54.409> and<00:02:55.129> also<00:02:55.549> this<00:02:55.939> is<00:02:56.000> already

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
direction oh and also this is already

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.780 
direction oh and also this is already
the<00:02:56.209> case<00:02:56.419> but<00:02:56.720> rallying<00:02:57.379> cry<00:02:57.560> sol<00:02:58.459> reflect

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
the case but rallying cry sol reflect

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.789 
the case but rallying cry sol reflect
and<00:02:58.969> intervene<00:02:59.540> or<00:02:59.719> safeguard<00:03:00.349> no<00:03:00.500> longer

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
and intervene or safeguard no longer

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.289 
and intervene or safeguard no longer
require<00:03:01.099> you<00:03:01.219> to<00:03:01.280> be<00:03:01.310> in<00:03:01.459> defensive<00:03:01.819> stance<00:03:02.030> so

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
require you to be in defensive stance so

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.199 
require you to be in defensive stance so
more<00:03:03.109> cool<00:03:03.349> stuff<00:03:03.530> I<00:03:03.889> think<00:03:04.189> that<00:03:04.489> blizzards

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
more cool stuff I think that blizzards

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.059 
more cool stuff I think that blizzards
made<00:03:05.359> some<00:03:05.480> heads<00:03:05.659> up<00:03:05.750> choices<00:03:06.169> in<00:03:06.319> a<00:03:06.439> like<00:03:07.010> I

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
made some heads up choices in a like I

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.800 
made some heads up choices in a like I
