yeah<00:03:22.140> I<00:03:22.590> don't<00:03:23.010> think<00:03:23.190> we'd<00:03:23.459> get<00:03:23.610> another<00:03:23.790> one

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180

yeah I don't think we'd get another one
until<00:03:24.540> part<00:03:24.930> 10<00:03:25.879> so<00:03:26.879> we'll<00:03:27.090> actually<00:03:27.299> are<00:03:27.569> so

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
until part 10 so we'll actually are so

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.140 
until part 10 so we'll actually are so
hard<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.019> talk<00:03:28.260> about<00:03:28.319> that<00:03:28.950> particular<00:03:29.430> level

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
hard to talk about that particular level

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.250 
hard to talk about that particular level
so<00:03:30.329> I<00:03:30.390> don't<00:03:30.569> think<00:03:30.750> you're<00:03:30.840> gonna<00:03:30.930> have<00:03:31.079> much

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
it well maybe if we're lucky they'll

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.640 
it well maybe if we're lucky they'll
just<00:03:38.430> like<00:03:38.700> slap<00:03:39.209> in<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.540> random<00:03:39.989> level<00:03:40.409> they
