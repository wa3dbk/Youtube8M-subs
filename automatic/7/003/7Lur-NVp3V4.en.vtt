quick video tutorial regarding a
question<00:00:12.900> on<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.080> forum<00:00:13.379> so<00:00:14.130> here's<00:00:14.639> your

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
question on the forum so here's your

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.630 
question on the forum so here's your
machine<00:00:15.809> file<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.260> you<00:00:16.380> gave<00:00:16.560> me<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:16.950> as<00:00:17.490> I

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
machine file that you gave me and as I

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.850 
machine file that you gave me and as I
can<00:00:17.700> see<00:00:17.849> the<00:00:18.630> models<00:00:18.990> are<00:00:19.230> pretty<00:00:19.410> big<00:00:19.710> and

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860 
can see the models are pretty big and

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.040 
can see the models are pretty big and
they're<00:00:20.310> also<00:00:20.460> way<00:00:21.090> too<00:00:21.150> high<00:00:21.420> above<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.900> quit

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
they're also way too high above the quit

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.760 
they're also way too high above the quit
plane<00:00:22.290> and<00:00:23.750> what<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.899> need<00:00:25.079> to<00:00:25.200> do<00:00:25.320> first<00:00:25.529> of

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
plane and what you need to do first of

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.760 
plane and what you need to do first of
all<00:00:25.919> is<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.989> you<00:00:27.989> need<00:00:28.169> to<00:00:28.259> scale<00:00:28.500> them<00:00:28.739> down

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
all is that you need to scale them down

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.790 
all is that you need to scale them down
and<00:00:29.329> you<00:00:30.329> also<00:00:30.540> need<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.960> place<00:00:31.169> him<00:00:31.380> closer<00:00:31.710> to

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
and you also need to place him closer to

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.130 
and you also need to place him closer to
the<00:00:31.919> grid<00:00:32.220> so<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.759> they're<00:00:33.210> also<00:00:33.600> closer<00:00:34.020> to

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
the grid so that they're also closer to

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.069 
the grid so that they're also closer to
the<00:00:34.350> ground<00:00:34.590> plane<00:00:35.360> the<00:00:36.360> view<00:00:36.600> ground<00:00:36.840> plane

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
the ground plane the view ground plane

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.380 
the ground plane the view ground plane
when<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.320> export<00:00:37.679> them<00:00:37.890> okay<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.640> I

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
when you export them okay and I

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.479 
when you export them okay and I
understand<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.019> you're<00:00:40.289> trying<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.340> be

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
understand that you're trying to be

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.069 
understand that you're trying to be
physically<00:00:41.850> accurate<00:00:42.059> but<00:00:42.690> if<00:00:42.809> you're<00:00:42.929> trying

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
physically accurate but if you're trying

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.079 
physically accurate but if you're trying
to<00:00:43.199> integrate<00:00:43.500> both<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.949> software's<00:00:44.460> it's

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:45.089 
to integrate both the software's it's

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:46.340 
to integrate both the software's it's
definitely<00:00:45.629> not<00:00:45.780> possible

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
definitely not possible

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.880 
definitely not possible
okay<00:00:46.879> so<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.239> have<00:00:48.510> actually<00:00:48.899> done<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.260> so

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
okay so I have actually done that so

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.739 
okay so I have actually done that so
I've<00:00:50.219> just<00:00:50.249> selected<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.999> few<00:00:51.269> objects<00:00:51.600> for

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:51.749 
I've just selected a few objects for

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:54.650 
I've just selected a few objects for
machine<00:00:52.019> and<00:00:52.370> scale<00:00:53.370> them<00:00:53.579> down<00:00:53.609> and<00:00:54.059> place

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
machine and scale them down and place

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.869 
machine and scale them down and place
them<00:00:54.899> closer<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.469> grid<00:00:55.679> and<00:00:55.890> now<00:00:56.699> we're

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
them closer to the grid and now we're

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.689 
them closer to the grid and now we're
ready<00:00:56.999> to<00:00:57.120> export<00:00:57.510> them<00:00:57.719> into<00:00:57.749> view<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.829> as<00:00:59.579> I

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
ready to export them into view and as I

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.009 
ready to export them into view and as I
can<00:00:59.850> understand<00:01:00.239> from<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.510> question<00:01:00.839> in<00:01:00.929> the

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
can understand from the question in the

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.040 
can understand from the question in the
form<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:02.249> just<00:01:02.280> need<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.329> use<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.839> view

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
form you just need to use the view

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.320 
form you just need to use the view
ecosystem<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.980> you<00:01:05.010> will<00:01:05.820> do<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.120> lighting

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
ecosystem and you will do the lighting

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.580 
ecosystem and you will do the lighting
and<00:01:06.950> animation<00:01:07.950> from<00:01:08.130> my<00:01:08.250> itself<00:01:09.049> okay<00:01:10.049> so

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
and animation from my itself okay so

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.109 
and animation from my itself okay so
first<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.920> all<00:01:11.070> let<00:01:11.220> me<00:01:11.250> go<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.579> the<00:01:11.729> outliner

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
first of all let me go to the outliner

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.780 
first of all let me go to the outliner
and<00:01:12.299> select<00:01:13.170> all<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.380> objects<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.670> need

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
and select all the objects that we need

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.609 
and select all the objects that we need
to<00:01:14.880> explode<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.390> we've<00:01:15.840> grouped<00:01:16.110> them<00:01:16.350> and

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
to explode and we've grouped them and

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.160 
to explode and we've grouped them and
why<00:01:17.340> we<00:01:17.490> are<00:01:17.520> grouping<00:01:17.939> them<00:01:18.149> is<00:01:18.329> that<00:01:18.659> we<00:01:19.020> need

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
why we are grouping them is that we need

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.859 
why we are grouping them is that we need
to<00:01:19.350> pivot<00:01:19.549> off<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.790> group<00:01:20.939> at<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.450> center<00:01:21.780> of

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
to pivot off the group at the center of

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.789 
to pivot off the group at the center of
the<00:01:21.960> world<00:01:22.170> okay<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:24.439> while<00:01:25.439> we<00:01:25.590> are<00:01:25.649> doing

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
the world okay and while we are doing

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.340 
the world okay and while we are doing
this<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.340> will<00:01:26.460> get<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.820> know<00:01:26.869> when<00:01:27.869> we<00:01:28.020> import

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
this you will get to know when we import

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.069 
this you will get to know when we import
inside<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:29.009> okay<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.840> exchange

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.030 
the actual Maya scene file we need to
fall<00:04:17.430> so<00:04:17.609> fall

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
fall so fall

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.140 
fall so fall
take<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:18.970> trees<00:04:19.240> or<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:19.870> ecosystem<00:04:20.140> and<00:04:21.150> move

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
take the trees or the ecosystem and move

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.200 
take the trees or the ecosystem and move
them<00:04:22.390> onto<00:04:22.630> a<00:04:22.990> separate<00:04:23.410> layer<00:04:23.680> so<00:04:24.610> we<00:04:25.030> can

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
them onto a separate layer so we can

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.750 
them onto a separate layer so we can
just<00:04:25.450> go<00:04:25.570> to<00:04:25.600> edit<00:04:25.980> select<00:04:26.980> ecosystem

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
just go to edit select ecosystem

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.760 
just go to edit select ecosystem
instances<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:28.540> select<00:04:29.350> all<00:04:29.530> of<00:04:29.560> the

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
instances and select all of the

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.270 
instances and select all of the
instances<00:04:30.040> all<00:04:30.460> all<00:04:30.820> of<00:04:30.940> the<00:04:31.060> trees<00:04:31.300> and<00:04:32.290> we

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
instances all all of the trees and we

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.340 
instances all all of the trees and we
will<00:04:33.430> go<00:04:33.550> to<00:04:33.610> move<00:04:33.850> instances<00:04:34.510> to<00:04:34.720> and<00:04:35.080> select

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
will go to move instances to and select

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.890 
will go to move instances to and select
the<00:04:35.560> global<00:04:35.890> ecosystem<00:04:36.690> which<00:04:37.690> you<00:04:37.810> will

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
the global ecosystem which you will

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.240 
the global ecosystem which you will
allow<00:04:38.050> just<00:04:39.840> take<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:40.990> trees<00:04:41.230> and<00:04:41.500> put<00:04:42.070> them

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
allow just take the trees and put them

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.160 
allow just take the trees and put them
onto<00:04:42.550> a<00:04:42.730> separate<00:04:43.030> layer<00:04:43.270> so<00:04:43.690> that<00:04:43.840> when<00:04:44.080> we

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
onto a separate layer so that when we

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.560 
onto a separate layer so that when we
delete<00:04:44.410> the<00:04:44.590> stadium<00:04:44.980> our<00:04:45.340> trees<00:04:46.030> don't<00:04:46.330> get

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
delete the stadium our trees don't get

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.770 
delete the stadium our trees don't get
deleted<00:04:46.990> so<00:04:47.860> now<00:04:48.730> you're<00:04:48.940> ready<00:04:49.150> to<00:04:49.360> just<00:04:49.540> save

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
deleted so now you're ready to just save

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.680 
deleted so now you're ready to just save
the<00:04:49.930> scene<00:04:50.140> and<00:04:50.170> go<00:04:51.070> to<00:04:51.130> save<00:04:51.430> as<00:04:51.640> and<00:04:51.880> just

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
the scene and go to save as and just

00:04:52.690 --> 00:05:00.030 
the scene and go to save as and just
called<00:04:53.580> ecosystem<00:04:58.530> so<00:04:59.530> here's<00:04:59.740> the<00:04:59.920> original

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
called ecosystem so here's the original

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.220 
called ecosystem so here's the original
Maya<00:05:00.460> scene<00:05:00.760> file<00:05:01.030> that<00:05:01.540> we<00:05:01.630> need<00:05:01.750> to<00:05:01.900> add<00:05:02.050> the

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
Maya scene file that we need to add the

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.890 
Maya scene file that we need to add the
ecosystem<00:05:02.800> to<00:05:03.000> so<00:05:04.000> what<00:05:04.120> we<00:05:04.240> can<00:05:04.390> do<00:05:04.540> now<00:05:04.720> is

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
ecosystem to so what we can do now is

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.290 
ecosystem to so what we can do now is
that<00:05:05.230> you<00:05:05.530> go<00:05:05.740> to<00:05:05.800> the<00:05:05.980> view<00:05:06.160> file<00:05:06.400> menu<00:05:06.790> and

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.840 
mental ray and if I now render the scene
you<00:05:53.980> will<00:05:54.100> see<00:05:54.340> that<00:05:54.660> views<00:05:56.520> lighting<00:05:57.520> system

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
you will see that views lighting system

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.000 
you will see that views lighting system
will<00:05:58.000> no<00:05:58.180> longer<00:05:58.390> be<00:05:58.570> used<00:05:58.810> and<00:05:59.080> now<00:05:59.650> we<00:05:59.710> will

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
will no longer be used and now we will

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.310 
will no longer be used and now we will
be<00:06:00.160> using<00:06:00.370> the<00:06:01.330> physical<00:06:01.660> Sun<00:06:01.810> and<00:06:01.840> sky<00:06:01.990> for

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
be using the physical Sun and sky for

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.650 
be using the physical Sun and sky for
mental<00:06:02.620> rate<00:06:02.800> that<00:06:03.010> we<00:06:03.130> just<00:06:03.280> created<00:06:03.580> and<00:06:03.760> I

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.660 
mental rate that we just created and I

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.090 
mental rate that we just created and I
guess<00:06:04.900> this<00:06:05.050> is<00:06:05.230> the<00:06:05.320> end<00:06:05.380> of<00:06:05.590> our<00:06:05.770> tutorial

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
guess this is the end of our tutorial

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.840 
guess this is the end of our tutorial
and<00:06:06.840> hope<00:06:07.840> it<00:06:08.020> has<00:06:08.170> helped<00:06:08.710> you<00:06:08.770> solving<00:06:09.760> the

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
and hope it has helped you solving the

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.410 
and hope it has helped you solving the
problem<00:06:10.240> so<00:06:10.990> goodbye
