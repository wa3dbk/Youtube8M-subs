possibly the cheapest best film SLR
you'll<00:00:24.420> find<00:00:24.750> on<00:00:24.960> eBay<00:00:24.990> however<00:00:26.869> don't<00:00:27.869> get

you'll find on eBay however don't get

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.070 
you'll find on eBay however don't get
this<00:00:28.380> if<00:00:28.830> you're<00:00:29.820> super<00:00:30.029> serious<00:00:30.449> about

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
this if you're super serious about

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.100 
this if you're super serious about
learning<00:00:31.260> everything<00:00:31.800> about<00:00:32.099> photography

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
learning everything about photography

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.759 
learning everything about photography
why<00:00:34.110> do<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.260> say<00:00:34.530> that

00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:34.769 
why do I say that

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:37.580 
why do I say that
well<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.460> e/m<00:00:35.670> doesn't<00:00:36.360> have<00:00:36.510> full<00:00:36.840> manual

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
well the e/m doesn't have full manual

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.389 
well the e/m doesn't have full manual
features<00:00:38.399> as<00:00:38.880> manual<00:00:39.809> focusing<00:00:40.350> features<00:00:40.829> but

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
features as manual focusing features but

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.100 
features as manual focusing features but
this<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.790> basically<00:00:42.270> aperture<00:00:42.870> priority

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
this is basically aperture priority

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.590 
this is basically aperture priority
another<00:00:43.890> video<00:00:44.219> will<00:00:44.550> explain<00:00:44.879> what<00:00:44.940> aperture

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
another video will explain what aperture

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.290 
another video will explain what aperture
priorities<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.920> can't<00:00:47.160> change<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:48.090> by

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
priorities you can't change it by

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.090 
priorities you can't change it by
shutter<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:49.079> can't<00:00:49.320> adjust<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.860> manual

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
shutter you can't adjust the manual

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.760 
shutter you can't adjust the manual
exposure<00:00:50.700> attributes<00:00:51.660> like<00:00:51.930> shutter<00:00:52.410> and

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
exposure attributes like shutter and

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.740 
exposure attributes like shutter and
aperture<00:00:53.030> independently<00:00:54.030> there's<00:00:54.600> some

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
aperture independently there's some

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.479 
aperture independently there's some
tricks<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.110> can<00:00:55.200> do<00:00:55.500> which<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.039> can<00:00:56.190> get<00:00:56.309> into

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
tricks you can do which we can get into

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.369 
tricks you can do which we can get into
of<00:00:56.969> course<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.329> can<00:00:57.480> change<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.870> ISO<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
of course you can change the ISO on the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.420 
of course you can change the ISO on the
top<00:00:59.600> that's<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.750> first<00:01:01.020> step<00:01:01.320> give<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.280> good

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
top that's the first step give it a good

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.180 
top that's the first step give it a good
look<00:01:02.760> over<00:01:03.210> make<00:01:03.629> sure<00:01:03.660> everything<00:01:04.140> seems<00:01:04.440> the

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
look over make sure everything seems the

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.240 
look over make sure everything seems the
sound<00:01:06.710> check<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.890> lens

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
sound check the lens

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.670 
sound check the lens
check<00:01:09.000> your<00:01:09.119> structurally<00:01:09.750> it's<00:01:09.900> okay<00:01:10.290> the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
check your structurally it's okay the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.030 
check your structurally it's okay the
winder<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.430> working<00:01:12.320> make<00:01:13.320> sure<00:01:13.500> everything

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
winder is working make sure everything

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:25.760 
winder is working make sure everything
is<00:01:14.070> has<00:01:14.930> seed<00:01:20.720> yeah<00:01:23.210> up<00:01:24.210> open<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> back<00:01:24.930> take<00:01:25.740> a

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
is has seed yeah up open the back take a

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.030 
is has seed yeah up open the back take a
look<00:01:25.890> inside<00:01:27.200> this<00:01:28.200> actually<00:01:28.619> looks<00:01:28.799> like<00:01:29.009> a

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
look inside this actually looks like a

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.219 
look inside this actually looks like a
nice<00:01:29.310> clean<00:01:30.080> example<00:01:31.880> of<00:01:32.880> an<00:01:33.030> icon<00:01:33.329> am<00:01:33.750> they

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
nice clean example of an icon am they

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.440 
nice clean example of an icon am they
actually<00:01:34.650> designed<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.250> apparently<00:01:35.850> for

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
actually designed this apparently for

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.120 
actually designed this apparently for
female<00:01:36.840> photographers<00:01:37.500> they<00:01:37.680> wanted<00:01:37.979> to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
female photographers they wanted to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.380 
female photographers they wanted to
boost<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.909> market

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
boost the market

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.789 
boost the market
the<00:01:39.720> only<00:01:39.810> thing<00:01:40.020> they'd<00:01:40.170> get<00:01:40.290> away<00:01:40.409> with<00:01:40.680> are

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
the only thing they'd get away with are

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.700 
the only thing they'd get away with are
now<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.070> be<00:01:41.310> honest<00:01:41.549> now<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.030> fact<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.450> this

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
now to be honest now the fact is this

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.319 
now to be honest now the fact is this
does<00:01:43.710> run<00:01:43.979> basically<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.700> aperture<00:01:45.090> priority

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
does run basically in aperture priority

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.350 
does run basically in aperture priority
mode<00:01:45.600> as<00:01:46.049> well<00:01:46.229> as<00:01:46.290> ball<00:01:46.979> now<00:01:47.729> setting<00:01:48.210> for

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
mode as well as ball now setting for

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.780 
mode as well as ball now setting for
using<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.720> flash<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.439> lot<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.340> aperture

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
using the flash to a lot of aperture

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.700 
using the flash to a lot of aperture
priority<00:01:51.299> mode<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.840> lens<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.140> came<00:01:52.320> with<00:01:52.590> it

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710
