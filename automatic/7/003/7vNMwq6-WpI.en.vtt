that<00:00:28.760> now<00:00:29.760> obviously<00:00:30.359> as<00:00:30.510> I'm<00:00:30.660> recording<00:00:30.810> with

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
that now obviously as I'm recording with

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.650 
that now obviously as I'm recording with
fraps<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.650> FPS<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.099> reduced<00:00:32.520> about<00:00:32.910> like<00:00:33.300> 20

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
fraps the FPS is reduced about like 20

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.639 
fraps the FPS is reduced about like 20
times<00:00:33.840> 20<00:00:34.410> or<00:00:34.800> 10<00:00:35.040> percent<00:00:35.160> somewhere<00:00:35.910> there

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
times 20 or 10 percent somewhere there

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.900 
times 20 or 10 percent somewhere there
I'll<00:00:37.649> tell<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.219> from<00:00:38.700> my<00:00:38.790> experience

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
I'll tell you that from my experience

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.000 
I'll tell you that from my experience
playing<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.570> game<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:39.780> far<00:00:40.230> with<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.829> beta

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
playing the game so far with the beta

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.860 
playing the game so far with the beta
drivers<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.969> FES<00:00:42.300> should<00:00:42.510> be<00:00:42.629> about<00:00:44.570> 40<00:00:45.570> when

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
drivers the FES should be about 40 when

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.110 
drivers the FES should be about 40 when
you're<00:00:45.989> going<00:00:46.170> really<00:00:46.379> quickly<00:00:46.710> outside<00:00:47.430> at

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
you're going really quickly outside at

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.100 
you're going really quickly outside at
the<00:00:48.239> Manning<00:00:48.539> area<00:00:49.969> 50<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.149> 60<00:00:51.660> when<00:00:51.960> your

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
the Manning area 50 to 60 when your

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.810 
the Manning area 50 to 60 when your
wants<00:00:52.789> that's<00:00:53.789> about<00:00:54.090> right<00:00:55.489> now<00:00:56.489> I'm<00:00:56.610> showing

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
wants that's about right now I'm showing

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.160 
wants that's about right now I'm showing
you<00:00:57.000> something<00:00:57.210> intense<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:57.960> damage

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
you something intense of this damage

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.640 
you something intense of this damage
driving<00:00:58.890> these<00:00:58.949> cars<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.520> quickly<00:01:03.650> yeah

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
driving these cars but quickly yeah

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.219 
driving these cars but quickly yeah
actually<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:05.040> should<00:01:05.220> prove<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:06.080> should<00:01:07.080> show

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
actually I should prove I should show

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.969 
actually I should prove I should show
you<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.439> settings<00:01:07.680> right<00:01:07.979> now<00:01:08.189> see<00:01:09.979> graphics

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
you the settings right now see graphics

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.940 
you the settings right now see graphics
1080p<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.729> course<00:01:12.060> MSA<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.350> off<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.770> don't

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
1080p of course MSA is off I don't

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.219 
1080p of course MSA is off I don't
really<00:01:14.130> need<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> game<00:01:14.820> looks<00:01:14.850> amazing

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
really need that the game looks amazing

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.020 
really need that the game looks amazing
don't<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.619> don't<00:01:16.799> need<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.159> honestly<00:01:17.970> I

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
don't it you don't need it honestly I

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.880 
don't it you don't need it honestly I
don't<00:01:18.150> see<00:01:18.600> why<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.900> would<00:01:19.200> turn<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:19.680> just

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
don't see why you would turn it on just

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.980 
don't see why you would turn it on just
reduce<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> frames<00:01:21.060> by<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> lot<00:01:21.540> advanced

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
reduce to the frames by a lot advanced

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.660 
reduce to the frames by a lot advanced
graphics<00:01:22.380> are<00:01:22.530> off<00:01:22.680> because<00:01:22.920> as<00:01:23.369> soon<00:01:23.490> as<00:01:23.610> I

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
graphics are off because as soon as I

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.640 
graphics are off because as soon as I
turn<00:01:23.850> them<00:01:23.970> off<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.330> VRAM<00:01:24.810> usage<00:01:24.840> goes<00:01:25.380> above

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
turn them off the VRAM usage goes above

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.260 
turn them off the VRAM usage goes above
three<00:01:25.920> gigs<00:01:26.159> which<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.580> basically<00:01:27.090> gonna

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
three gigs which is basically gonna

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.810 
three gigs which is basically gonna
introduce<00:01:27.720> stuttering<00:01:28.280> and<00:01:29.280> obviously<00:01:29.759> I

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
introduce stuttering and obviously I

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.950 
introduce stuttering and obviously I
don't<00:01:29.880> want<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.360> wanna<00:01:30.570> play<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> game

don't want that I wanna play the game

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.080 
don't want that I wanna play the game
smoothly<00:01:31.290> 60fps<00:01:32.009> something<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:35.090> as

far as graphics go here
like<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.250> said<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.850> just<00:01:39.270> amazing

at played of all time this this

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.670 
at played of all time this this
seriously<00:01:44.729> reminds<00:01:45.000> me<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.180> Crysis<00:01:45.570> 1<00:01:45.720> how

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
seriously reminds me of Crysis 1 how

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.810 
seriously reminds me of Crysis 1 how
revolutionary<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:48.060> was<00:01:48.860> this<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.640> is

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
revolutionary that was this is this is

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.319 
revolutionary that was this is this is
just<00:01:50.909> epic

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
just epic

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.370 
just epic
the<00:01:52.200> draw<00:01:52.409> distance<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:52.920> insane

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
the draw distance is insane

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.560 
the draw distance is insane
I<00:01:54.969> really<00:01:55.969> can't<00:01:56.180> believe<00:01:56.270> I'm<00:01:56.450> actually

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
I really can't believe I'm actually

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.660 
I really can't believe I'm actually
saying<00:01:56.750> this<00:01:57.049> I<00:01:57.229> try<00:01:57.890> playing<00:01:58.130> this<00:01:58.250> on<00:01:58.399> ps3

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
saying this I try playing this on ps3

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.660 
saying this I try playing this on ps3
and<00:01:59.180> that<00:02:00.140> was<00:02:00.350> that<00:02:01.039> wasn't<00:02:01.250> that<00:02:01.460> good

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
and that was that wasn't that good

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.880 
and that was that wasn't that good
honestly<00:02:02.119> here<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:02.720> graphics<00:02:03.079> were<00:02:03.229> awful<00:02:03.770> I

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
honestly here the graphics were awful I

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.200
