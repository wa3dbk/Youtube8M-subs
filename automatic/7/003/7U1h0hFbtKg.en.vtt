00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.690 
acceleration and the 95 sprint speed is
quite<00:01:12.659> amazing<00:01:12.869> he's<00:01:13.409> pretty<00:01:13.770> fast<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
quite amazing he's pretty fast on the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.170 
quite amazing he's pretty fast on the
ball<00:01:14.880> but<00:01:15.380> i<00:01:16.790> found<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.060> be<00:01:18.090> quite

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
ball but i found it to be quite

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.090 
ball but i found it to be quite
inconsistent<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.320> didn't<00:01:19.590> find<00:01:19.830> him<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.070> be

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
inconsistent I didn't find him to be

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.280 
inconsistent I didn't find him to be
consistently<00:01:20.820> fast<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.450> perhaps<00:01:21.930> it's

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
consistently fast and perhaps it's

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.420 
consistently fast and perhaps it's
because<00:01:22.380> maybe<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.830> should<00:01:22.950> put<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> fitness

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
because maybe you should put a fitness

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.080 
because maybe you should put a fitness
card<00:01:23.670> at<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.439> beginning<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.500> each<00:01:25.740> game<00:01:26.070> or<00:01:26.580> I

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
card at the beginning of each game or I

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.580 
card at the beginning of each game or I
don't<00:01:27.540> know<00:01:27.659> what<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.930> was<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.110> just<00:01:28.350> didn't

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
don't know what it was I just didn't

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.319 
don't know what it was I just didn't
find<00:01:28.770> him<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.950> be<00:01:28.979> consistently<00:01:29.640> fast<00:01:29.880> however

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
find him to be consistently fast however

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.840 
find him to be consistently fast however
he<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.509> really<00:01:30.869> fast<00:01:31.220> um<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.280> think<00:01:32.430> his

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
he is really fast um I think his

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.460 
he is really fast um I think his
strength<00:01:33.270> brings<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.840> down<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.990> little<00:01:34.229> bit<00:01:34.380> he

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
strength brings it down a little bit he

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.730 
strength brings it down a little bit he
only<00:01:34.590> has<00:01:34.770> 71<00:01:35.159> strength<00:01:35.900> but<00:01:36.900> he<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.259> 6<00:01:37.560> foot

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
only has 71 strength but he is 6 foot

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.859 
only has 71 strength but he is 6 foot
tall<00:01:37.950> which<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.090> definitely<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.570> bonus<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:41.869> 75

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
tall which is definitely a bonus and 75

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.780

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
stats he definitely seemed like he had

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.270

more<00:01:48.270> than<00:01:48.299> 75<00:01:48.869> jumping<00:01:49.290> he<00:01:49.740> won<00:01:49.890> quite<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.130> bit

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
more than 75 jumping he won quite a bit

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.469 
more than 75 jumping he won quite a bit
of<00:01:50.369> headers<00:01:50.579> especially<00:01:51.030> with<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.149> 81

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.020 
of headers especially with that 81
positioning<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.920> thought<00:01:53.549> his<00:01:53.670> heading<00:01:53.909> was

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
positioning I thought his heading was

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.770 
positioning I thought his heading was
quite<00:01:54.360> decent<00:01:54.750> for<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.899> striker<00:01:55.790> of<00:01:56.790> his<00:01:57.090> you

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
quite decent for a striker of his you

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.080 
quite decent for a striker of his you
know<00:01:57.920> player<00:01:58.920> type<00:01:59.219> so<00:01:59.790> he's<00:01:59.969> definitely

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
know player type so he's definitely

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.999 
know player type so he's definitely
gonna<00:02:00.390> win<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.689> some<00:02:00.840> headers<00:02:01.140> he's<00:02:01.649> not<00:02:01.829> the

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
gonna win you some headers he's not the

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.319 
gonna win you some headers he's not the
type<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.189> player<00:02:02.460> that's<00:02:02.700> just<00:02:02.880> gonna<00:02:03.000> win<00:02:03.240> you

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
type of player that's just gonna win you

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.760 
type of player that's just gonna win you
all<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.719> headers<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.020> if<00:02:04.320> you'd<00:02:04.439> like<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.590> play

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
all the headers so if you'd like to play

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
all the headers so if you'd like to play
like<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.250> would<00:02:05.399> definitely<00:02:05.490> recommend

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
like that I would definitely recommend

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.910 
like that I would definitely recommend
Mandzukic<00:02:06.600> but<00:02:07.200> if<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.380> like<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.619> play<00:02:07.740> with<00:02:07.860> a

Mandzukic but if you like to play with a

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.919 
Mandzukic but if you like to play with a
lot<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.160> pace<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.580> decent<00:02:09.119> finishing<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.599> would

lot of pace and decent finishing I would
really<00:02:10.229> highly<00:02:10.410> recommend<00:02:11.330> Obama<00:02:12.330> yang<00:02:12.569> now

let's<00:02:13.209> look<00:02:13.360> at<00:02:13.510> some<00:02:14.080> of<00:02:14.140> his<00:02:14.410> skill<00:02:14.860> stats

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
let's look at some of his skill stats

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.420 
let's look at some of his skill stats
which<00:02:15.580> is<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:16.660> know<00:02:16.690> besides<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.709> amazing

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
which is you know besides the amazing

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.270 
which is you know besides the amazing
physical<00:02:18.640> stats<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:20.440> reality<00:02:20.860> really<00:02:21.010> comes

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
physical stats the reality really comes

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.580 
physical stats the reality really comes
down<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.489> how<00:02:21.730> wildly<00:02:22.090> performs<00:02:22.629> in<00:02:22.930> terms<00:02:23.290> of

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
down to how wildly performs in terms of

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.960 
down to how wildly performs in terms of
these<00:02:23.950> skill<00:02:24.400> stats<00:02:24.640> now<00:02:26.640> some<00:02:27.640> people<00:02:27.790> might

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
these skill stats now some people might

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.479 
these skill stats now some people might
disagree<00:02:28.660> with<00:02:29.170> me<00:02:29.319> on<00:02:29.349> this<00:02:29.620> but<00:02:29.980> I<00:02:30.190> thought

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
disagree with me on this but I thought

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.420 
disagree with me on this but I thought
that<00:02:30.700> his<00:02:31.209> finishing<00:02:31.690> was<00:02:32.140> not<00:02:32.379> amazing<00:02:33.220> I

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
that his finishing was not amazing I

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.820 
that his finishing was not amazing I
thought<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:33.849> to<00:02:34.330> be<00:02:34.360> quite<00:02:34.840> inconsistent<00:02:35.470> at

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
thought it to be quite inconsistent at

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.369 
thought it to be quite inconsistent at
times<00:02:36.150> there<00:02:37.150> are<00:02:37.209> times<00:02:37.540> or<00:02:37.690> no<00:02:37.840> score<00:02:38.110> goals

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
times there are times or no score goals

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.259 
times there are times or no score goals
like<00:02:38.590> that<00:02:38.799> and<00:02:39.190> there<00:02:39.370> are<00:02:39.519> times<00:02:39.790> well<00:02:40.060> he'll

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
like that and there are times well he'll

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.949 
like that and there are times well he'll
shoot<00:02:40.569> right<00:02:40.810> at<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.049> goalie<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:42.239> I<00:02:43.239> don't

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
shoot right at the goalie and I don't

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.390 
shoot right at the goalie and I don't
really<00:02:44.080> know<00:02:44.230> what<00:02:44.349> to<00:02:44.440> say<00:02:44.470> i<00:02:44.680> didn't<00:02:45.370> think

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
really know what to say i didn't think

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.460 
really know what to say i didn't think
that<00:02:45.790> his<00:02:45.910> finishing<00:02:46.239> was<00:02:46.480> just<00:02:46.660> amazing<00:02:47.260> I

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
that his finishing was just amazing I

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.910 
that his finishing was just amazing I
thought<00:02:48.220> it<00:02:48.310> was<00:02:48.400> mediocre<00:02:49.590> for<00:02:50.590> someone

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
thought it was mediocre for someone

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.630 
thought it was mediocre for someone
you're<00:02:51.190> gonna<00:02:51.280> spend<00:02:51.519> 70<00:02:52.030> 17k<00:02:52.870> on<00:02:52.900> I<00:02:53.459> mean<00:02:54.459> I

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
you're gonna spend 70 17k on I mean I

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.550 
you're gonna spend 70 17k on I mean I
thought<00:02:54.849> it<00:02:54.940> could<00:02:55.090> be<00:02:55.120> better<00:02:55.360> but<00:02:55.560> they're

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
thought it could be better but they're

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.930 
thought it could be better but they're
obviously<00:02:56.950> some<00:02:57.190> times<00:02:57.400> where<00:02:57.700> it<00:02:57.790> was

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
obviously some times where it was

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.449 
obviously some times where it was
probably<00:02:58.239> me<00:02:58.450> who<00:02:58.629> messed<00:02:58.930> up<00:02:59.310> more<00:03:00.310> than

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
probably me who messed up more than

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.250 
probably me who messed up more than
anything<00:03:00.670> but<00:03:01.230> he<00:03:02.230> is<00:03:02.319> a<00:03:02.379> decent<00:03:02.650> finisher<00:03:03.340> and

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
anything but he is a decent finisher and

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.530 
anything but he is a decent finisher and
for<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.530> player<00:03:06.250> of<00:03:06.519> his<00:03:06.549> caliber<00:03:06.730> I<00:03:07.269> thought

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
for a player of his caliber I thought

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.680 
for a player of his caliber I thought
that<00:03:07.690> 77<00:03:08.200> ball<00:03:08.560> controls<00:03:08.980> a<00:03:09.099> little<00:03:09.340> low<00:03:09.690> he's

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
that 77 ball controls a little low he's

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.140 
that 77 ball controls a little low he's
not<00:03:10.930> gonna<00:03:11.110> take<00:03:11.200> any<00:03:11.500> long<00:03:11.739> shots<00:03:11.769> and<00:03:12.430> his

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
not gonna take any long shots and his

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.309 
not gonna take any long shots and his
finesse<00:03:13.510> shots<00:03:13.750> or<00:03:14.640> okay<00:03:15.640> I<00:03:15.879> guess<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:17.019> mean

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
finesse shots or okay I guess I mean

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.050 
finesse shots or okay I guess I mean
definitely<00:03:17.680> your<00:03:18.190> average<00:03:18.639> finesse<00:03:19.030> shot

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
definitely your average finesse shot

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.720 
definitely your average finesse shot
taker<00:03:19.920> definitely<00:03:20.920> not<00:03:21.069> a<00:03:21.100> long<00:03:21.310> shot<00:03:21.459> taker

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
taker definitely not a long shot taker

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.780 
taker definitely not a long shot taker
like<00:03:21.850> a<00:03:21.880> previously<00:03:22.299> mentioned<00:03:22.480> but<00:03:23.790> he

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
like a previously mentioned but he

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.670 
like a previously mentioned but he
really<00:03:24.970> is<00:03:25.209> your<00:03:25.450> your<00:03:25.900> finisher<00:03:26.380> that's

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
really is your your finisher that's

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.140 
really is your your finisher that's
really<00:03:27.280> what<00:03:27.400> you're<00:03:27.519> going<00:03:27.639> to<00:03:27.700> be<00:03:27.790> using<00:03:27.880> it

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
really what you're going to be using it

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.210 
really what you're going to be using it
for<00:03:28.359> it's<00:03:28.540> gonna<00:03:28.660> be<00:03:28.840> 12<00:03:29.049> passes<00:03:29.680> with<00:03:29.889> Obama

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
for it's gonna be 12 passes with Obama

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.039

yang<00:03:32.290> you're<00:03:32.950> not<00:03:33.069> really<00:03:33.190> gonna<00:03:33.400> dribble

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
yang you're not really gonna dribble

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.479 
yang you're not really gonna dribble
with<00:03:34.329> them<00:03:34.510> very<00:03:34.690> much<00:03:34.780> he<00:03:35.349> gets<00:03:35.620> dispossessed

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
with them very much he gets dispossessed

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.479 
with them very much he gets dispossessed
very<00:03:36.970> easily<00:03:37.269> if<00:03:37.720> you<00:03:38.470> try<00:03:38.709> and<00:03:38.769> dribble

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
very easily if you try and dribble

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.330 
very easily if you try and dribble
through<00:03:39.579> players<00:03:39.880> so<00:03:40.680> it's<00:03:41.680> a<00:03:41.889> it's<00:03:42.099> a<00:03:42.160> play

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
adapt to the pace and the quick

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.470 
adapt to the pace and the quick
finishing<00:03:46.989> that<00:03:47.079> he<00:03:47.230> has<00:03:47.440> and<00:03:48.299> for<00:03:49.299> some

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
finishing that he has and for some

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.089 
finishing that he has and for some
players<00:03:49.750> they<00:03:50.049> really<00:03:50.349> like<00:03:50.500> his<00:03:50.680> play<00:03:50.859> style

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
players they really like his play style

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.330 
players they really like his play style
and<00:03:51.310> I<00:03:51.370> could<00:03:51.549> really<00:03:51.579> see<00:03:52.000> that<00:03:52.290> because

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
and I could really see that because

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.920 
and I could really see that because
towards<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.459> end<00:03:54.639> I<00:03:55.030> started<00:03:55.630> scoring<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:55.900> lot

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
towards the end I started scoring a lot

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.720 
towards the end I started scoring a lot
more<00:03:56.260> with<00:03:56.440> him<00:03:56.530> just<00:03:56.680> because<00:03:56.829> I<00:03:57.010> learned<00:03:57.519> to

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
more with him just because I learned to

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.170 
more with him just because I learned to
adapt<00:03:58.000> to<00:03:58.180> his<00:03:58.299> style<00:03:58.569> of<00:03:58.660> play<00:03:59.130> um<00:04:00.130> 75<00:04:00.940> short

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
adapt to his style of play um 75 short

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.150 
adapt to his style of play um 75 short
passing<00:04:01.540> of<00:04:01.660> course<00:04:01.840> is<00:04:02.019> a<00:04:02.049> great<00:04:02.349> bonus<00:04:02.560> for

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
passing of course is a great bonus for

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.789 
passing of course is a great bonus for
Obama<00:04:03.519> yang<00:04:03.760> he<00:04:04.540> definitely<00:04:04.989> is<00:04:05.380> really<00:04:05.680> good

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
Obama yang he definitely is really good

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.390 
Obama yang he definitely is really good
at<00:04:05.889> those<00:04:06.010> 12<00:04:06.400> passing<00:04:06.880> and<00:04:07.769> I<00:04:08.769> could<00:04:08.980> see<00:04:09.190> that

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
at those 12 passing and I could see that

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.120 
at those 12 passing and I could see that
his<00:04:10.000> inform<00:04:10.569> is<00:04:10.690> probably<00:04:10.989> really<00:04:11.470> good<00:04:11.859> if

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
his inform is probably really good if

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.620 
his inform is probably really good if
you<00:04:12.370> want<00:04:12.519> to<00:04:12.579> play<00:04:12.700> him<00:04:12.819> as<00:04:12.880> a<00:04:12.910> right<00:04:13.209> mid<00:04:13.450> he's

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
you want to play him as a right mid he's

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.589 
you want to play him as a right mid he's
probably<00:04:13.810> great<00:04:14.169> as<00:04:14.380> a<00:04:14.410> right<00:04:14.650> mid<00:04:14.859> and

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
probably great as a right mid and

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.680 
probably great as a right mid and
overall<00:04:16.599> I<00:04:16.870> thought<00:04:17.109> that<00:04:17.349> for<00:04:18.280> 17<00:04:18.700> k<00:04:18.940> what

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
overall I thought that for 17 k what

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.360 
overall I thought that for 17 k what
could<00:04:19.840> possibly<00:04:20.200> go<00:04:20.289> wrong<00:04:20.440> he's<00:04:21.039> gonna<00:04:21.190> go
