00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
used to be a lot years ago but nowadays

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.019 
used to be a lot years ago but nowadays
especially<00:00:21.930> with<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:23.220> new<00:00:23.369> expansion<00:00:23.760> out

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
especially with the new expansion out

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.029 
especially with the new expansion out
gold<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.750> just<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.080> easy<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.380> get<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.769> most

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
people have over 50,000 gold and I think

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.460 
people have over 50,000 gold and I think
they<00:00:30.150> do<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.869> will<00:00:30.990> transfer

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
they do this so that you will transfer

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.720 
they do this so that you will transfer
multiple<00:00:31.890> characters<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.430> that's<00:00:32.550> more

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
multiple characters and that's more

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.060 
multiple characters and that's more
money<00:00:32.880> for<00:00:33.090> them<00:00:33.380> but<00:00:34.380> there<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.680> much

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
money for them but there is a much

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.920 
money for them but there is a much
easier<00:00:35.250> way<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.910> transfer<00:00:36.480> gold<00:00:36.719> between

you're on you may lose some money you
may<00:01:52.950> gain<00:01:53.130> some<00:01:53.190> money<00:01:53.580> but<00:01:54.180> it's<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
may gain some money but it's the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.180 
may gain some money but it's the
cheapest<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.350> fastest<00:01:55.740> way<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.070> you're

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
cheapest and fastest way that you're

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.859 
cheapest and fastest way that you're
going<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.340> transfer<00:01:56.820> large<00:01:57.060> amounts<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.750> gold

going to transfer large amounts of gold

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.130 
going to transfer large amounts of gold
now<00:01:58.820> you<00:01:59.820> can<00:02:00.000> do<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.330> with<00:02:00.540> any<00:02:00.720> level<00:02:01.050> of

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
now you can do this with any level of

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.820 
now you can do this with any level of
battle<00:02:01.500> pets

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
battle pets

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.469 
battle pets
I<00:02:01.890> do<00:02:01.950> recommend<00:02:02.399> at<00:02:02.790> least<00:02:03.000> having<00:02:03.210> one

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
I do recommend at least having one

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.719 
I do recommend at least having one
battle<00:02:03.780> pet<00:02:03.960> up<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.590> twenty-five<00:02:05.040> because

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
battle pet up to twenty-five because

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.790 
battle pet up to twenty-five because
that<00:02:05.850> will<00:02:06.000> allow<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.390> purchase<00:02:06.810> level<00:02:07.440> 25

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
that will allow you to purchase level 25

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.440 
that will allow you to purchase level 25
battle<00:02:08.190> pets<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.610> learn<00:02:08.729> them<00:02:08.970> which

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
battle pets and learn them which

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.229 
battle pets and learn them which
typically<00:02:09.899> carry<00:02:10.170> more<00:02:10.739> monetary<00:02:11.190> value<00:02:11.640> than

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
on the server you're on that way you

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.490 
on the server you're on that way you
know<00:02:30.120> you're<00:02:30.300> not<00:02:30.450> losing<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:31.020> ton<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.290> money

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
know you're not losing a ton of money

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.199 
know you're not losing a ton of money
because<00:02:31.739> some<00:02:31.920> things<00:02:31.950> do<00:02:32.310> sell<00:02:32.580> for<00:02:32.820> more<00:02:32.970> and

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
because some things do sell for more and

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.810 
because some things do sell for more and
sell<00:02:33.420> for<00:02:33.600> less<00:02:33.860> now<00:02:34.860> what<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.160> means<00:02:35.310> said

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
sell for less now what that means said

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.050 
sell for less now what that means said
this<00:02:36.299> is<00:02:36.480> also<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.900> good<00:02:37.140> way<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.489> make<00:02:38.489> gold<00:02:38.790> if

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
this is also a good way to make gold if

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.470 
this is also a good way to make gold if
you<00:02:39.690> want<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:40.310> even<00:02:41.310> go<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.580> route<00:02:41.790> if<00:02:42.090> you're

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
you want to even go that route if you're

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.949 
you want to even go that route if you're
on<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.630> very<00:02:42.959> high<00:02:43.260> pop<00:02:43.530> server<00:02:44.299> you<00:02:45.299> can<00:02:45.540> get

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
on a very high pop server you can get

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.400 
on a very high pop server you can get
pets<00:02:46.200> typically<00:02:46.739> cheaper<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:48.840> can<00:02:49.260> learn

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
pets typically cheaper and you can learn

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.810 
pets typically cheaper and you can learn
them<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:49.739> try<00:02:49.890> selling<00:02:50.190> them<00:02:50.430> on<00:02:50.610> another

more<00:02:54.750> on<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.290> then<00:02:55.440> if<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:55.709> get<00:02:55.890> lucky<00:02:56.130> you

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
more on and then if you get lucky you

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.490 
more on and then if you get lucky you
may<00:02:56.760> see<00:02:56.820> a<00:02:57.090> high-end<00:02:57.780> pet<00:02:58.019> on<00:02:58.230> there<00:02:58.410> the

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
may see a high-end pet on there the

may see a high-end pet on there the
high-end<00:02:58.860> pets<00:02:59.070> typically<00:02:59.640> go<00:02:59.880> for<00:02:59.910> about<00:03:00.269> the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
high-end pets typically go for about the

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.600 
high-end pets typically go for about the
same<00:03:00.480> on<00:03:00.810> all<00:03:00.989> servers<00:03:01.290> I've<00:03:01.530> noticed<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.250> buy

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
same on all servers I've noticed and buy

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
high-end I'm talking about the super

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.140 
high-end I'm talking about the super
rare<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.830> ones<00:03:05.010> from<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.310> trading<00:03:05.700> card<00:03:05.910> game

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
rare the ones from the trading card game

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.330 
rare the ones from the trading card game
and<00:03:06.510> so<00:03:07.140> on<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.410> so<00:03:07.530> forth<00:03:07.799> the<00:03:07.920> stuff<00:03:08.130> that's

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
and so on and so forth the stuff that's

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.800 
and so on and so forth the stuff that's
just<00:03:08.370> not<00:03:08.670> readily<00:03:08.970> available<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.570> everyone

just not readily available to everyone

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.210 
just not readily available to everyone
so<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:10.950> can<00:03:11.340> use<00:03:11.489> this<00:03:11.670> in<00:03:11.880> multiple<00:03:12.269> ways<00:03:13.220> the

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
so you can use this in multiple ways the

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.620 
so you can use this in multiple ways the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
best way I have found to do it though

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.880 
best way I have found to do it though
it's<00:03:15.780> just<00:03:15.959> a<00:03:16.019> chance<00:03:16.260> for<00:03:16.380> gold<00:03:16.709> between

it's just a chance for gold between
