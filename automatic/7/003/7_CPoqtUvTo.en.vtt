hello<00:00:22.949> people<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.579> the<00:00:25.189> interval<00:00:26.189> here<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.520> just

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:27.419 
hello people of the interval here I just

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.800 
hello people of the interval here I just
thought<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.630> would<00:00:27.750> do<00:00:28.020> a<00:00:28.550> quick<00:00:29.570> sort<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.689> how

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
thought I would do a quick sort of how

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.700 
thought I would do a quick sort of how
to<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:31.050> guess<00:00:31.439> on<00:00:31.680> Ritz<00:00:32.160> getting<00:00:33.000> them<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.239> look

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
to I guess on Ritz getting them to look

three-dimensional<00:00:34.710> I'm<00:00:35.400> just<00:00:35.730> using<00:00:35.909> some

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
three-dimensional I'm just using some

run-of-the-mill circle type stencil here
this<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.940> from<00:00:42.269> airsick<00:00:43.079> stencils<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.829> believe

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
this is from airsick stencils I believe

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.240 
this is from airsick stencils I believe
this<00:00:44.280> one<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:45.150> the<00:00:45.870> tape<00:00:46.079> here<00:00:46.409> is<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:47.159> to

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
this one and the tape here is just to

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.939 
this one and the tape here is just to
give<00:00:47.370> me<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.519> straight<00:00:47.820> line<00:00:48.059> reference<00:00:48.949> the

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
give me a straight line reference the

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.229 
give me a straight line reference the
key<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.250> making<00:00:50.430> these<00:00:50.610> things<00:00:50.939> look

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
key to making these things look

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.660 
key to making these things look
three-dimensional<00:00:53.150> is<00:00:54.559> to<00:00:55.559> use<00:00:56.250> your<00:00:56.430> dark

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
three-dimensional is to use your dark

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.749 
three-dimensional is to use your dark
color<00:00:57.769> on<00:00:58.769> the<00:00:59.040> bottom<00:01:00.860> in<00:01:01.860> the<00:01:02.040> shadow<00:01:02.369> and

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:02.759 
color on the bottom in the shadow and

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:05.840 
color on the bottom in the shadow and
leave<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.780> top<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.350> circle<00:01:04.700> very<00:01:05.700> weak

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
leave the top of the circle very weak

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.300 
leave the top of the circle very weak
open<00:01:06.320> because<00:01:07.320> we're<00:01:07.560> going<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.710> go<00:01:07.830> back<00:01:08.040> in

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
open because we're going to go back in

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.950 
open because we're going to go back in
and<00:01:08.430> add<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.580> shadow<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.390> other<00:01:09.509> side<00:01:09.810> of

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
and add a shadow on the other side of

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.850 
and add a shadow on the other side of
that<00:01:14.750> so<00:01:15.750> I'll<00:01:15.840> just<00:01:16.049> throw<00:01:16.140> down<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.530> couple

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
that so I'll just throw down a couple

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.200 
that so I'll just throw down a couple
picks<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.460> here<00:01:22.370> you<00:01:23.370> can<00:01:23.520> see<00:01:23.700> I've<00:01:23.850> left<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
picks in here you can see I've left the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.740 
picks in here you can see I've left the
top<00:01:24.420> fairly<00:01:25.140> open<00:01:25.440> it's<00:01:25.620> not<00:01:25.710> fully<00:01:26.750> closed

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
top fairly open it's not fully closed

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:38.200 
top fairly open it's not fully closed
off<00:01:28.050> with<00:01:28.320> paint

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.760 

simple<00:01:39.210> as<00:01:39.300> that

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
simple as that

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.670 
simple as that
we<00:01:40.770> take<00:01:41.900> we've<00:01:42.900> use<00:01:43.080> this<00:01:43.290> part<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.620> the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
we take we've use this part of the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.410 
we take we've use this part of the
stencil<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.130> spray<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.520> well<00:01:45.150> now<00:01:45.270> we're

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
stencil to spray that well now we're

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.970 
stencil to spray that well now we're
going<00:01:45.510> to<00:01:45.570> use<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:45.930> part<00:01:46.230> up<00:01:46.380> here<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.710> block

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
going to use this part up here to block

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.760 
going to use this part up here to block
off<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:49.170> rivet<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.680> we've<00:01:49.830> just<00:01:50.070> sprayed

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
off the rivet that we've just sprayed

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.020 
off the rivet that we've just sprayed
and<00:01:52.770> we're<00:01:52.950> going<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.130> give<00:01:53.340> us<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.670> little<00:01:53.850> bit

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
and we're going to give us a little bit

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:02.870 
and we're going to give us a little bit
of<00:01:54.150> a<00:01:54.210> shadow<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.930> top

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.069 

you<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:03.780> see<00:02:03.960> how<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.250> closes<00:02:05.250> off<00:02:05.399> the

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
you can see how that closes off the

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.859 
you can see how that closes off the
actual<00:02:07.079> rivet<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:08.160> gives<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.670> sort<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.450> 3d

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
actual rivet and gives you sort of a 3d

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.350 
actual rivet and gives you sort of a 3d
effect<00:02:09.989> as<00:02:10.410> if<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.950> metal<00:02:11.670> where<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.060> rivet

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
effect as if the a metal where the rivet

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.740 
effect as if the a metal where the rivet
is<00:02:12.510> has<00:02:12.720> been<00:02:12.870> punched<00:02:13.290> in<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:14.450> it's<00:02:15.450> clearly

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
is has been punched in and it's clearly

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.330 
is has been punched in and it's clearly
smash<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:17.660> just<00:02:18.660> cut<00:02:18.840> out<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.260> top<00:02:19.680> half<00:02:20.099> of

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
smash it just cut out the top half of

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.940 
smash it just cut out the top half of
the<00:02:20.489> rivet<00:02:20.819> really<00:02:21.269> all<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.540> want<00:02:21.599> to<00:02:21.860> put<00:02:22.860> the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
the rivet really all you want to put the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.360 
the rivet really all you want to put the
shadow<00:02:23.220> on<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:28.620> want<00:02:28.769> to<00:02:28.800> be<00:02:28.860> careful<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.340> make

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
shadow on you want to be careful to make

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:38.559 
shadow on you want to be careful to make
sure<00:02:29.519> it's<00:02:29.790> lined<00:02:30.060> up<00:02:30.300> all<00:02:36.349> right<00:02:37.349> so<00:02:37.380> let's

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
sure it's lined up all right so let's

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:45.050 
sure it's lined up all right so let's
step<00:02:39.569> one<00:02:39.870> we<00:02:40.110> switch<00:02:40.410> over<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.739> white<00:02:44.000> or<00:02:45.000> I

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
step one we switch over to white or I

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.600 
step one we switch over to white or I
mean<00:02:45.780> whatever<00:02:45.930> colors<00:02:46.349> are<00:02:46.500> using<00:02:46.860> but<00:02:47.130> in

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
mean whatever colors are using but in

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.160 
mean whatever colors are using but in
this<00:02:47.700> case<00:02:47.940> we're<00:02:48.150> just<00:02:48.480> using<00:02:48.660> black<00:02:48.989> and

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
this case we're just using black and

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.410 
this case we're just using black and
white<00:02:50.030> reduced<00:02:51.140> nicely<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.530> give<00:02:52.680> us<00:02:52.799> a<00:02:53.420> nice

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
white reduced nicely to give us a nice

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.539 
white reduced nicely to give us a nice
soft<00:02:54.780> spray<00:02:55.260> pattern<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:55.920> with<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.310> white

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
soft spray pattern and with the white

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.100 
soft spray pattern and with the white
we're<00:02:56.819> just<00:02:57.030> going<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.180> come<00:02:57.390> on<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.630> bottom

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
we're just going to come on the bottom

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.140 
we're just going to come on the bottom
of<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.380> of<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.620> now<00:02:58.829> because<00:02:59.220> this<00:02:59.370> is<00:02:59.579> if<00:03:00.000> the

of it of it now because this is if the

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.410 
of it of it now because this is if the
metal<00:03:00.329> is<00:03:00.420> punched<00:03:00.810> in<00:03:02.000> this<00:03:03.000> is<00:03:03.180> where<00:03:03.329> the

metal is punched in this is where the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.819 
metal is punched in this is where the
highlights<00:03:03.780> gonna<00:03:04.019> fall<00:03:04.290> with<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.590> lights
