several<00:00:29.400> months<00:00:29.760> after<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.359> think<00:00:31.170> he<00:00:31.289> meant

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
several months after I think he meant

several months after I think he meant
several<00:00:32.009> months<00:00:32.279> after<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.790> don't<00:00:33.030> think<00:00:33.180> Chris

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
several months after I don't think Chris

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.180 
several months after I don't think Chris
Jericho's<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.870> return<00:00:34.170> until<00:00:35.040> maybe

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
Jericho's in a return until maybe

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.459 
Jericho's in a return until maybe
november<00:00:35.670> december<00:00:35.940> he<00:00:36.840> probably<00:00:37.110> don't<00:00:37.350> want

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
november december he probably don't want

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.920 
november december he probably don't want
to<00:00:37.530> be<00:00:37.620> there<00:00:37.770> for<00:00:37.940> Wrestlemania<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.750> think

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
to be there for Wrestlemania so I think

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.959 
to be there for Wrestlemania so I think
he<00:00:40.110> will<00:00:40.260> return<00:00:40.500> before<00:00:40.620> WrestleMania<00:00:41.550> so

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
he will return before WrestleMania so

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.090 
he will return before WrestleMania so
that<00:00:42.540> they<00:00:42.629> can<00:00:42.750> push<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> storyline<00:00:43.590> with<00:00:43.890> him

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
that they can push a storyline with him

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.510 
that they can push a storyline with him
who<00:00:44.760> will<00:00:44.910> be<00:00:45.120> against<00:00:45.629> who<00:00:45.840> knows<00:00:46.520> maybe

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
who will be against who knows maybe

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.970 
who will be against who knows maybe
