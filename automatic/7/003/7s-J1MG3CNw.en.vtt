00:00:06.862 --> 00:00:11.662
 Development begins after fertilization and generation of the zygote. 

00:00:12.483 --> 00:00:18.857
 One can see a kind of membrane moving away, it is the fertilization wrap, 

00:00:19.587 --> 00:00:26.099
 a layer of glycoproteins formed after fertilization, whose function is to prevent polyspermia. 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.192
 In our species, this wrap consists largely of the zona pellucida. 

00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:43.602
 The zygote will now divide by mitosis, giving rise to two cells of the same size and generating the embryo. 

00:00:44.332 --> 00:00:51.602
 This initial stage of development is the segmentation or cleavage (name given to these cell divisions). 

00:00:52.602 --> 00:00:58.173
 Note that the generated cells are the same size and are still undifferentiated, 

00:00:58.753 --> 00:01:01.453
 are called blastomers. 

00:01:02.243 --> 00:01:09.386
 Continuing the segmentation stage, the embryo becomes a massive "ball", the morula. 

00:01:11.026 --> 00:01:16.227
 Then this morula develops into a blastula, 

00:01:17.108 --> 00:01:23.850
 A sphere of cells with the interior filled with liquid, the blastoblast. 

00:01:38.053 --> 00:01:41.554
 The next stage of development is gastrulation. 

00:01:42.924 --> 00:01:47.035
 The blastula will develop into a gastrula. 

00:01:47.985 --> 00:01:54.807
 In this stage cell differentiation occurs, and two of the three embryonic tissues are formed, 

00:01:55.777 --> 00:01:59.947
 the ectoderm and the endoderm. 

00:02:00.737 --> 00:02:09.359
 Notice that the blast disappears and a new cavity arises, the archer, 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.241
 the archer communicates with the external environment through the blastpore. 

00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:20.182
 We can say that the archer represents the beginning of the formation of the digestive apparatus. 

00:02:24.454 --> 00:02:29.155
 Then begins the last stage of embryonic development, organogenesis. 

00:02:30.185 --> 00:02:37.438
 The gastrula will develop into a neurax. The third embryonic tissue, the mesoderm, will be formed. 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:43.659
 At this stage, the formation of organs such as the dorsal nerve tube, 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:50.480
 of ectodermal origin, which originates the nervous system of the animal.
