00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.950

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.950

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.630
 art and gifts 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:30.470
 wait we have the whole day ahead 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:32.870
 besides, you have not even dressed mom and 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.520
 I'm going to get dressed, I think you're already 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:40.220
 mayorcito to dress today alone and so 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.680
 it's easy, you just have to pick up clothes 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.810
 inside some shirt socks and ones 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.300
 pants 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.940
 hey jude decided to take his shirt 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.500
 monkey but he also liked the red that 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.500
 his grandmother had given him 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.070
 that I was going too 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.610
 choosing his clothes that he forgot 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.240
 full of dressing is ready 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.240
 to go out and play 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.920
 my dress 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.560
 and I see it we're going to see two shirts 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.299
 good idea but you will not have a little 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.180
 of cold playing in the garden in pants 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:37.170
 short maybe I'm wrong we're going to 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.170
 go out to check it 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.229
 creek 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.840
 I can put another thing clear that 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.840
 you may have gone through here a tornado 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.920
 because you do not wear long pants and 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.000
 a sweater and then it will be hotter 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.000
 I'll be back in a few minutes worth 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 and 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.110
 how are you going where is fallen 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:22.740
 good job but it seems to me that you have 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:26.580
 put the pants inside out okay 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.220
 let's pick up all this clothes worth 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.000
 later it was time for it to fall 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.820
 Dress again with more elegant clothes 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.070
 what do you think this is very vodka I hear 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.820
 the suggestion of his father but he wanted 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.820
 choose your model 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.070
 I want to wear this as you want 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.489
 or footman but how handsome are you 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.650
 Little bird told me that you have dressed 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.230
 you alone caillou saw how they were going 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.379
 Smart your dad and your grandpa with costumes 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.350
 of party and suddenly he did not like 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:06.470
 how he had dressed 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.940
 I can change my clothes again clear 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.830
 that's the best part of being enough 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.830
 older to dress you alone 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.460
 Grandma, can you please put your 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.460
 tie 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.650
 my dad taught me how to do a lot of 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.230
 fun things 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.459
 we love to skate although at the beginning 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.459
 it's not very easy 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:43.380
 then sometimes daddy of nonsense but 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:47.160
 he always knows how to take good care of us 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.820
 When I grow up I want to be like 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.820
 my father
