00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:20.689
 welcome to this little tracking 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.699
 introduction tutorial you certainly have 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.730
 already my free tutorial about 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.800
 Tracking seen that robot tutorial 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.970
 where the robot lands in front of the factory 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.369
 i often have country help de 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.920
 it has been published a while ago 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.140
 now and if you have not seen that 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.140
 have that on it on this dvd on it 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.790
 under 3d tracking robot tutorial 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.200
 can you find it 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.570
 you should definitely do that 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.730
 First , there will be the 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.370
 All the whole handling shown by 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.170
 trecker that is basic handling there 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.750
 I explain the individual wattens exactly 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.880
 how to adjust the camera how to do that 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.920
 Everything finds out and so should you 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.630
 looked at you and here in 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.670
 this tutorial I show now only the 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.860
 differ so what since the am 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.030
 program has not changed 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.270
 a lot of it changed a few 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.400
 improvements to the trek to come 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.790
 So let's go in first 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.160
 Of course we need our music 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.970
 we invite you to our 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.820
 footage I have here so a Tiefgarage 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.500
 there is also the next one 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.720
 tutorial what you should look at is 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.390
 the underground garage tutorial will be there 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.620
 here a scene created from it so 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.409
 if you enter here as usual 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.760
 trek sets is all quite normal 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.140
 except that you now have the 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.340
 search area no longer sees the must 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.280
 you turn here first 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.760
 So that's the tracking area after that 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.770
 searched and in this search box here 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.430
 tried this picture section too 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.580
 Find 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.440
 for the next frame the tracking 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.240
 Settings can be set here 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.650
 this will only affect you 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.880
 new trek so if i am now 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.229
 I'll make another one here 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.710
 slightly adjusted then, the new the 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.080
 properties for existing ones 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.180
 tracker there are the features here 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.379
 a tracking settings are actually 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.629
 the same as here, so good 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:14.420
 has come is definitely the pri 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.490
 pass and normal life first times the pri 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.250
 pass button here 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.350
 So there is a crass calculations 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.330
 made and with this button you can 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.020
 actually, all stretch so because of the 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.080
 Tractor totally planned footage bad 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.240
 lit footage with a lot of new stuff in it 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.920
 if blender hops out you can 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.060
 Of course, always manually reload 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.750
 or you can synonymous with prix 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.940
 Passing this is slower than that 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.400
 normal trek because he was still 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.980
 But calculations have to do so 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.690
 you can meet very well so you 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.610
 could just ten points here now 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.040
 put all on prix pass and then 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.540
 just track and nine of them would 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.950
 probably completely through the scene 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.660
 through stairs well normal what is that 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.910
 normal ice is so he is not 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.380
 Differences in the light does so if 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.300
 she would change the light here now 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.870
 or a shadow would go over here 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.910
 over the wall then there would get out 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.310
 because because the brightness is changing 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.850
 if you want to suppress that 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.110
 is that name and what I do too 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.030
 still found out what was very good 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.750
 if you have problems when baking 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.160
 is on this previews stranger to go because 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.780
 So he just takes a key 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.040
 frame and always looks for it as he takes 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.020
 a copy of this picture here 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.650
 so to speak and then tries over the 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.580
 whole movie just this picture always 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.950
 to find again 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.510
 and that can sometimes give problems 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.130
 or even if the 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.200
 footage again very bad or yourself 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.100
 the perspective can change that 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.080
 give problems 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.090
 and now I have good experiences 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.310
 Made when you match on previews 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.620
 frame is held keyframe then takes 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.530
 he always uses the previous frame as 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.270
 reference and then looks for it there then 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.420
 The tracking becomes more stable 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.160
 good with this with this attitude 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.960
 what else has happened 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.420
 you can now use ford edge settings 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.440
 set the kaller space start frame 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.050
 and offset if you want 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.720
 Of course you can generate proxy 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.330
 Let's take a look over here 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.570
 tracking settings quite normal in the 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.190
 end effect here 's just now affine 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.930
 and perspective that is for planners 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.670
 tracking but I still could handle it 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.260
 no good results 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.730
 So I'll probably be missing 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.650
 add a tutorial if 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.050
 this feature a bit better 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.790
 was expanded or a little better 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.460
 I will work again 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.400
 publish tutorial freely where it us 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.290
 planner tracking is something else 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.910
 is the tripod motion 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.830
 There is also an extra tutorial 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:54.440
 about where to go with this tripod solver 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.600
 the camera motions runs so dissolves 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.400
 exactly what drives him simply means that the 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.050
 camera stands still and only turns 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.960
 that's why they have that extra 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.900
 button tripod motion built in and then 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.750
 just the rotation is calculated 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.690
 and nothing else has changed 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.790
 So mainly these things here 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.460
 match keyframe previews foreign is still 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.870
 very good but as you said that you learn 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.500
 also everything in the tutorials now 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.830
 yet to come 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.050
 tracking is used more often and we 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.520
 will be very scary and if 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.110
 if you do not have the tracker yet 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.800
 know then look at this first 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.240
 robot tracking tutorial on if you have the 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.280
 have already seen this tutorial 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.680
 already seen here then would have been 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.500
 the next tracking tutorial actually 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.860
 The basement garage itself then the chamberlain 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.860
 tracking 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.760
 Ok, so have fun bye
