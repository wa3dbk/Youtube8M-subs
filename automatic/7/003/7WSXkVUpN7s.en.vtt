show you all another video of them

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.569

because<00:00:42.050> the<00:00:43.050> last<00:00:43.320> video<00:00:43.680> did<00:00:44.010> not<00:00:44.160> work<00:00:44.340> out

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
because the last video did not work out

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.750 
because the last video did not work out
that<00:00:44.789> well<00:00:46.489> it<00:00:47.489> was<00:00:47.640> kind<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.910> laggy<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:49.760> they

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
that well it was kind of laggy so they

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.279 
that well it was kind of laggy so they
had<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.270> deal<00:00:51.449> with<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.050> don't<00:00:52.110> think

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
had that to deal with and I don't think

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.389 
had that to deal with and I don't think
they're<00:00:52.590> gonna<00:00:52.710> focus<00:00:53.129> very<00:00:53.910> well<00:00:54.239> but<00:00:55.399> you
