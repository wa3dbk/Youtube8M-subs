00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
to look at this is the drone controller

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.599 
to look at this is the drone controller
from<00:00:15.420> evolution<00:00:16.320> controllers<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.430> was

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
from evolution controllers it was

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.420 
from evolution controllers it was
originally<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.150> Kickstarter<00:00:18.840> project<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.770> it

originally a Kickstarter project and it

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.490 
originally a Kickstarter project and it
now<00:00:20.640> exists<00:00:21.270> in<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.539> real<00:00:21.750> world<00:00:21.990> as<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.350> can

right<00:00:35.460> here<00:00:35.730> also<00:00:36.450> inside<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.930> box<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.440> a

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
right here also inside the box is a

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.549 
right here also inside the box is a
little<00:00:38.370> bit<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.940> paperwork<00:00:39.360> or<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.809> card<00:00:40.290> I

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.560 
little bit of paperwork or a card I
don't<00:00:40.739> know<00:00:40.800> what<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.460> want<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.700> call<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.059> but

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
don't know what you want to call it but

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.240 
don't know what you want to call it but
it<00:00:42.809> gives<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.260> directions<00:00:43.829> on<00:00:44.040> how<00:00:44.070> to

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
it gives you the directions on how to

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.630 
it gives you the directions on how to
operate<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.390> controller<00:00:45.870> power<00:00:46.289> on<00:00:46.590> pair<00:00:47.309> and

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
operate the controller power on pair and

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.850 
operate the controller power on pair and
power<00:00:47.820> off<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.270> uses<00:00:48.600> bluetooth<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.739> it's

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
power off it uses bluetooth so it's

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.189 
power off it uses bluetooth so it's
actually<00:00:50.190> pretty<00:00:50.520> simple<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.090> pair<00:00:51.629> with<00:00:51.809> your

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
actually pretty simple to pair with your

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.529 
actually pretty simple to pair with your
device<00:00:52.649> then<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.550> back<00:00:53.699> here<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.449> little

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
device then the back here just a little

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.400 
device then the back here just a little
safety<00:00:54.899> notice<00:00:55.440> they've<00:00:56.039> also<00:00:56.250> included<00:00:56.699> a

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
safety notice they've also included a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.650 
safety notice they've also included a
microfiber<00:00:58.410> bag<00:00:59.010> here<00:00:59.579> which<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.359> kind<00:01:00.600> of

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
microfiber bag here which is kind of

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.040 
microfiber bag here which is kind of
nice

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
nice

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.910 
nice
since<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.739> controller<00:01:02.129> itself<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.789> pretty

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
since the controller itself is pretty

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.910 
since the controller itself is pretty
fingerprint<00:01:04.920> prone<00:01:05.820> also<00:01:06.689> inside<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.530> box<00:01:07.710> we

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
fingerprint prone also inside the box we

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.230 
fingerprint prone also inside the box we
have<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.400> standard<00:01:09.200> micro<00:01:10.200> USB<00:01:10.670> cable<00:01:11.670> that's

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
have a standard micro USB cable that's

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.810 
have a standard micro USB cable that's
because<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.990> drone<00:01:13.350> controller<00:01:13.799> uses<00:01:14.369> micro

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
because the drone controller uses micro

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.149 
because the drone controller uses micro
USB<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.570> charge<00:01:15.600> which<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.259> nice<00:01:16.470> nothing

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
USB to charge which is nice nothing

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.399 
USB to charge which is nice nothing

proprietary if you lose that cable you

kind<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.329> an<00:01:48.479> unusual<00:01:48.600> location<00:01:49.290> but<00:01:50.070> fairly

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
kind of an unusual location but fairly

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.940 
kind of an unusual location but fairly
easy<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.420> reach<00:01:51.630> obviously<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.560> controller

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
easy to reach obviously the controller

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.800 
easy to reach obviously the controller
is<00:01:53.159> meant<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.520> be<00:01:53.640> portable<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.390> smaller

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
is meant to be portable so it's smaller

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.889 
is meant to be portable so it's smaller
than<00:01:55.380> what<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.829> would<00:01:55.950> get<00:01:56.189> out<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.820> an<00:01:57.360> Xbox

you<00:02:21.740> can<00:02:21.890> see<00:02:22.100> we've<00:02:22.310> got<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.819> drone<00:02:23.330> I've<00:02:24.170> got

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
you can see we've got the drone I've got

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.290 
you can see we've got the drone I've got
to<00:02:24.500> connect<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:24.920> already<00:02:25.280> or<00:02:25.819> you<00:02:25.970> can<00:02:26.120> see

to connect it already or you can see

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.180 
to connect it already or you can see
there<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:26.600> says<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:26.990> it's<00:02:27.110> connected<00:02:27.620> so<00:02:27.890> for

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
there it says that it's connected so for

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.949 
there it says that it's connected so for
compatibility<00:02:28.730> reasons<00:02:28.970> there's<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.720> few

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
compatibility reasons there's a few

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.750 
compatibility reasons there's a few
different<00:02:30.230> modes<00:02:30.350> to<00:02:30.680> choose<00:02:30.709> from<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.610> can

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
different modes to choose from you can

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.240 
different modes to choose from you can
also<00:02:31.819> use<00:02:32.239> this<00:02:32.420> controller<00:02:32.900> with<00:02:33.140> your<00:02:33.319> PC<00:02:33.830> so

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
also use this controller with your PC so

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.800 
also use this controller with your PC so
there's<00:02:34.430> a<00:02:34.520> mode<00:02:34.730> for<00:02:34.760> that<00:02:34.970> as<00:02:35.300> well

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
there's a mode for that as well

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.050 
there's a mode for that as well
operation<00:02:36.560> is<00:02:36.680> basically<00:02:37.190> what<00:02:37.790> you'd<00:02:37.940> expect

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
operation is basically what you'd expect

just<00:02:38.660> like<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:38.900> games<00:02:39.590> console<00:02:40.190> you're<00:02:40.370> going

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
just like a games console you're going

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.280 
just like a games console you're going
to<00:02:40.670> use<00:02:40.850> your<00:02:41.060> controller<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.720> interface<00:02:42.230> with

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
to use your controller to interface with

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.620 
to use your controller to interface with
your<00:02:42.650> player<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.360> depending<00:02:44.360> on<00:02:44.450> how<00:02:44.569> good

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
your player and depending on how good

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
you are how much practice you've had

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.050 
you are how much practice you've had
you'll<00:02:47.390> have<00:02:47.540> varying<00:02:48.080> results<00:02:48.580> but<00:02:49.580> it's

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
you'll have varying results but it's

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.630 
you'll have varying results but it's
nice<00:02:50.300> for<00:02:50.330> racing<00:02:50.989> games<00:02:51.190> because<00:02:52.190> usually

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
nice for racing games because usually

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.470 
nice for racing games because usually
you<00:02:53.239> kind<00:02:53.420> of<00:02:53.480> have<00:02:53.600> to<00:02:53.630> tap<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:55.180> joystick<00:02:56.180> or

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
you kind of have to tap the joystick or

ones<00:03:02.600> that<00:03:02.870> you<00:03:02.989> might<00:03:03.140> get<00:03:03.410> out<00:03:03.620> of<00:03:03.800> a

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
ones that you might get out of a

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.870 
ones that you might get out of a
gyroscope<00:03:05.720> accelerometer<00:03:06.040> based<00:03:07.040> game<00:03:07.459> or

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
gyroscope accelerometer based game or

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.110 
gyroscope accelerometer based game or
even<00:03:08.360> an<00:03:08.600> on-screen<00:03:09.140> d-pad<00:03:09.790> that's<00:03:10.790> a<00:03:10.880> little

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
even an on-screen d-pad that's a little

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.180 
even an on-screen d-pad that's a little
tougher<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.630> deal<00:03:11.870> with<00:03:12.080> I<00:03:12.350> suppose<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:13.160> other

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
tougher to deal with I suppose the other

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.040 
tougher to deal with I suppose the other
benefit<00:03:13.790> here<00:03:13.970> is<00:03:14.000> that<00:03:14.150> you<00:03:14.330> can<00:03:14.540> place<00:03:14.810> the

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
benefit here is that you can place the

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.130 
benefit here is that you can place the
tablet<00:03:15.290> down<00:03:15.800> in<00:03:16.190> one<00:03:16.700> static<00:03:17.180> position<00:03:17.720> or<00:03:17.989> if

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
tablet down in one static position or if

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.470 
tablet down in one static position or if
you<00:03:18.230> have<00:03:18.350> a<00:03:18.380> case<00:03:18.709> or<00:03:18.980> a<00:03:19.070> dock<00:03:19.519> that<00:03:20.150> puts<00:03:20.420> a

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
you have a case or a dock that puts a

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.750 
you have a case or a dock that puts a
good<00:03:20.630> angle<00:03:20.900> on<00:03:21.320> it<00:03:21.350> then<00:03:22.130> you<00:03:22.280> can<00:03:22.459> just<00:03:22.489> sort

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
good angle on it then you can just sort

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.000 
good angle on it then you can just sort
of<00:03:22.880> stick<00:03:23.060> it<00:03:23.090> in<00:03:23.299> one<00:03:23.329> place<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:24.110> then<00:03:24.410> use

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
of stick it in one place and then use

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.430 
of stick it in one place and then use
the<00:03:25.190> controller<00:03:25.640> to<00:03:25.970> interact<00:03:26.390> with<00:03:26.690> your

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
depressing of course there are competing

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.210

games are starting to offer a Bluetooth
controller<00:03:37.700> based<00:03:38.120> interface<00:03:38.870> so<00:03:39.500> you<00:03:39.530> don't

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
controller based interface so you don't

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.160 
controller based interface so you don't
have<00:03:40.010> to<00:03:40.190> use<00:03:40.310> that<00:03:40.489> touchscreen<00:03:40.760> so<00:03:41.450> if<00:03:41.720> you

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
have to use that touchscreen so if you

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.289 
have to use that touchscreen so if you
don't<00:03:42.440> have<00:03:42.590> a<00:03:42.650> games<00:03:42.920> console<00:03:43.489> or<00:03:43.820> you<00:03:44.090> want

way to achieve that because you get a

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.449

a phone obviously so I don't know it's a

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.580 
a phone obviously so I don't know it's a
