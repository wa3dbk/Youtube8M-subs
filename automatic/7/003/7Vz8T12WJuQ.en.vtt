00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
use that we're going to let this reduce

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.899 
use that we're going to let this reduce
so<00:02:13.590> we're<00:02:13.739> going<00:02:13.829> to<00:02:13.920> heat<00:02:14.129> this<00:02:14.159> and<00:02:14.639> let<00:02:14.760> this

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
so we're going to heat this and let this

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.470 
so we're going to heat this and let this
reduce

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
reduce

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.339 
reduce
by<00:02:16.840> about<00:02:17.170> half<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:18.180> while<00:02:19.180> this<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.629> reducing

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
by about half and while this is reducing

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.559 
by about half and while this is reducing
and<00:02:20.769> our<00:02:20.980> scallops<00:02:21.670> are<00:02:22.000> going<00:02:22.239> we're<00:02:22.420> boiling
