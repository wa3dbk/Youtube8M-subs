00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 instead of ground we had already 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.279
 shown the restyling that peugeot 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.170
 had given the 3008 and this time 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.250
 We bring our test track to 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.250
 new 5008 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.740
 the new 5008 undergoes small changes with 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.750
 with respect to the conventional version that 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.670
 we know that it was released in 2010 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.619
 the main ones are a new grill 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.600
 frontal also the incorporation of 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.310
 new led lights of the brand and in this 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.510
 case of fog lights that arise 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.510
 now in the form of c 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.710
 The new 5008 also has a 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.320
 new hood and cooling sockets 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.479
 much larger the optics can be 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.550
 of xenon and directional and technology 

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:49.550
 'led' also reaches the intermittent 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.720
 we are facing a family car is a 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.000
 seven seats and the good thing about this new 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.610
 restyling is that the third row of 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.199
 seats does not mean an extra cost now 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.619
 but the price of the car is already going 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.619
 included 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.420
 previously this version incorporates 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.820
 Well, the same equipment that we can 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.500
 find in 1 5008 normal and the only thing 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.660
 what changes is that in the access range 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.610
 the electric windows are electric 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.410
 they were manual and now there's the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.960
 possibility of incorporating a camera 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.420
 to see the back and also 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.130
 has a radar system that 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.250
 detects any obstacle we have 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.250
 in front of 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.939
 the motorization that we test today for 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.079
 you are the 1600 hdi of 115 horses and 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.530
 let's see how it behaves in 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.530
 highway 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.310
 despite its large size this power 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.980
 of motor is enough to move to this 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.870
 great family the 5008 responds very well 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.090
 to everything that is asked so much in 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.189
 motorway and highway as on highway or 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.810
 in the city he has aplomb in the direction 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.980
 is stable and the configuration of 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.109
 suspensions do it tremendously 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.079
 comfortable on long trips 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:36.890
 visibility is unbeatable thanks to the 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.890
 large windshield 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.750
 the 5008 a great purchase option for 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.300
 a great family that also has a 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.750
 reduced consumption 47 liters to 100 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.750
 kilometer
