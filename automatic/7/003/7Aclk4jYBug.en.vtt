00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.560 
basically his lowest bin is in and
around<00:01:42.979> 4,500<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.579> what<00:01:44.880> we'll<00:01:45.060> do<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.240> we'll

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
around 4,500 so what we'll do is we'll

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.520 
around 4,500 so what we'll do is we'll
search<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.899> maximum<00:01:46.860> price<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.390> 3000<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:49.229> add

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
search the maximum price of 3000 so add

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.550 
search the maximum price of 3000 so add
that<00:01:49.560> leaves<00:01:50.070> roughly<00:01:50.430> 1200<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.509> 1300<00:01:51.930> profit

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
that leaves roughly 1200 to 1300 profit

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.440 
that leaves roughly 1200 to 1300 profit
if<00:01:52.710> we<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:52.950> get<00:01:53.040> them<00:01:53.220> at<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.460> price<00:01:53.700> now<00:01:54.390> you

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
if we can get them at this price now you

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.910 
if we can get them at this price now you
can<00:01:54.689> also<00:01:54.869> alter<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.799> maximum<00:01:56.490> price<00:01:56.969> and

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
can also alter the maximum price and

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.810 
can also alter the maximum price and
depending<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.100> Prophet<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.520> wish<00:01:59.670> to

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
depending on the Prophet you wish to

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.700 
depending on the Prophet you wish to
make<00:01:59.939> really<00:02:00.329> but<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.750> won't<00:02:00.990> win<00:02:01.140> as<00:02:01.259> many<00:02:01.439> if

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
make really but you won't win as many if

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.030 
make really but you won't win as many if
you<00:02:01.829> do<00:02:01.979> lower<00:02:02.189> too<00:02:02.490> much<00:02:02.869> now<00:02:03.869> at<00:02:04.170> next<00:02:04.770> thing

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
you do lower too much now at next thing

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.359 
you do lower too much now at next thing

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
know it'll go for quite a considerable

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.649 
know it'll go for quite a considerable
amount<00:02:31.829> more<00:02:32.209> now<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.269> next<00:02:33.450> one<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:33.930> 35<00:02:34.889> to

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:35.659 
amount more now the next one is 35 to

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.379 
amount more now the next one is 35 to
3,000<00:02:36.659> now<00:02:37.170> make<00:02:37.439> bit<00:02:37.739> now<00:02:38.430> after<00:02:38.969> that<00:02:39.150> it

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:39.389 
3,000 now make bit now after that it

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:41.000 
3,000 now make bit now after that it
says<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.750> next<00:02:39.900> one<00:02:40.079> is<00:02:40.169> five<00:02:40.409> hours<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:40.859> 21

says the next one is five hours and 21

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.739 
says the next one is five hours and 21
minutes<00:02:41.370> now<00:02:41.790> that's<00:02:42.090> not<00:02:42.359> always<00:02:42.510> correct

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:42.749 
minutes now that's not always correct

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:45.289 
minutes now that's not always correct
you<00:02:43.049> can<00:02:43.200> search<00:02:43.499> individual<00:02:44.249> formations<00:02:45.090> and

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
you can search individual formations and

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.509 
you can search individual formations and
that<00:02:46.049> will<00:02:46.230> give<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.530> more<00:02:46.769> search<00:02:47.069> results

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
that will give you more search results

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.330 
that will give you more search results
now<00:02:48.209> all<00:02:48.599> we<00:02:48.780> need<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.959> do<00:02:49.169> is<00:02:49.349> we<00:02:49.530> need<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.919> wait

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
now all we need to do is we need to wait

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.050 
now all we need to do is we need to wait
an<00:02:50.579> hour<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:52.099> basically<00:02:53.099> see<00:02:53.459> how<00:02:53.669> many<00:02:53.909> of

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
an hour and basically see how many of

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.179 
an hour and basically see how many of
them<00:02:54.239> we<00:02:54.629> win<00:02:54.840> now<00:02:55.319> you<00:02:55.379> don't<00:02:55.650> have<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:55.889> just

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
them we win now you don't have to just

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.280 
them we win now you don't have to just
bid<00:02:56.370> 3,000<00:02:57.030> them<00:02:57.120> alternatively<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:57.900> can<00:02:58.109> add

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
bid 3,000 them alternatively you can add

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.929 
bid 3,000 them alternatively you can add
them<00:02:58.439> to<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.620> watch<00:02:58.919> list<00:02:59.219> and<00:02:59.459> select<00:02:59.579> them

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
them to a watch list and select them

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.899 
them to a watch list and select them
with<00:03:00.090> 15<00:03:00.540> seconds<00:03:01.049> remaining<00:03:01.340> so<00:03:02.340> you'll

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
with 15 seconds remaining so you'll

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.640 
with 15 seconds remaining so you'll
probably<00:03:03.060> only<00:03:03.359> win<00:03:03.599> ten<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:03.989> twenty<00:03:04.290> percent

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
probably only win ten to twenty percent

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.530 
probably only win ten to twenty percent
of<00:03:04.889> the<00:03:05.010> auctions<00:03:05.519> per<00:03:05.760> player<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.359> more

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
of the auctions per player so the more

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.390 
of the auctions per player so the more
players<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:06.989> use<00:03:07.260> this<00:03:07.530> technique<00:03:07.949> for<00:03:08.189> the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
players you use this technique for the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.459 
players you use this technique for the
more<00:03:08.549> profit<00:03:08.969> you<00:03:09.090> will<00:03:09.209> make<00:03:09.449> now<00:03:10.049> remember

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:10.469 
more profit you will make now remember

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.020 
more profit you will make now remember
to<00:03:10.500> have<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.709> limit<00:03:11.069> on<00:03:11.189> how<00:03:11.250> much<00:03:11.549> you<00:03:11.730> pay<00:03:12.000> for

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
to have a limit on how much you pay for

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.030 
to have a limit on how much you pay for
a<00:03:12.269> player<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.540> ensure<00:03:12.989> you<00:03:13.019> make<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.319> profit<00:03:13.590> so

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
a player to ensure you make a profit so

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.470 
a player to ensure you make a profit so
basically<00:03:14.430> don't<00:03:14.730> get<00:03:14.909> involved<00:03:15.090> in<00:03:15.359> any

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
basically don't get involved in any

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.379 
basically don't get involved in any
bidding<00:03:15.840> wars<00:03:16.340> okay<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:17.790> we'll<00:03:17.939> just<00:03:18.090> wait<00:03:18.239> the

companies<00:03:39.419> which<00:03:39.629> I'm<00:03:39.750> quite<00:03:39.989> surprised

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
companies which I'm quite surprised

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.890 
companies which I'm quite surprised
about<00:03:40.919> since<00:03:41.579> I<00:03:41.699> only<00:03:41.849> bet<00:03:42.060> it<00:03:42.150> on<00:03:42.209> to<00:03:42.329> pay<00:03:42.479> 20

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
about since I only bet it on to pay 20

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.719 
about since I only bet it on to pay 20
so<00:03:43.109> that's<00:03:43.349> about<00:03:43.470> thirty<00:03:44.189> to<00:03:44.430> thirty-five

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:44.729 
so that's about thirty to thirty-five

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:47.990 
so that's about thirty to thirty-five
percent<00:03:45.199> so<00:03:46.199> that's<00:03:46.530> pretty<00:03:46.739> good<00:03:46.949> for<00:03:47.009> a<00:03:47.459> one

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
percent so that's pretty good for a one

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.289 
percent so that's pretty good for a one
hour<00:03:48.120> of<00:03:48.359> bidding<00:03:48.689> so<00:03:49.229> here<00:03:49.650> we've<00:03:49.949> won<00:03:50.340> Evans
