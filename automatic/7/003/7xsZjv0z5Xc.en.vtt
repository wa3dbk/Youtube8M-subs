00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:20.929
 the projects of sewage treatment plants 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.919
 that will allow control 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.919
 If we win a better quality dear 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.179
 many arequipeÃ±os 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.360
 years have been presented in these crops the farc 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.570
 options 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.570
 like the pampa the star the marlins 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.910
 the ladder 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:43.920
 but insufficient 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.330
 a new proposal 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.380
 On the one hand, the sewage treatment plant project 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.060
 the greens the leaders 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.290
 continuation 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.820
 min. green pampas that is at the height of kilometer 10 of the variant of 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.080
 uchumayo percent consider merkel 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.040
 the previous location perez pampa star has social problems and it 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.320
 has gotten politics 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.540
 why this professional group has chosen 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.110
 this new site which is quite broad doubts before large where the 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.720
 Residual water treatment plant 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.210
 it is expected that the benefit that from here could be 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.850
 for its part the association of one million euros which pollute the environment 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.659
 ambient 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.679
 you could make a hydroelectric take advantage of all the hydraulic jump of 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:39.030
 about 400 meters from this plant to the bottom of the river could be 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.400
 do 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.770
 the industrialization of 2008 ornaments and figures that would continue to decrease 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.060
 what for each family monthly for water treatment and in this 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.870
 case for him 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.249
 drinking water in this case for the treatment that is going to be done 

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:57.719
 to wastewater and we would not expect giving value to these waters 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:58.540
 residual 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.850
 to make a convenient aftertaste emit the environment and decontaminate 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.500
 our environment is very polluted when it comes to green pampas 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.689
 start at the museum of mÃ¡laga alarte left 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:14.919
 to get more or less to the height of the bridge of time 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.949
 in front of a rise until yesterday was chosen fence 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:24.019
 chile about 200 meters to be the entrance of this tunnel is going to be able 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.099
 place the waters of the entire population of arequipa art including the beast 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:29.769
 go 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.029
 the sand would be for the pro 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:36.169
 the much larger wastewater from this tunnel 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:43.019
 p will have a pipeline of about 2 2 6 kilometers iniesta will expand to 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.199
 Shoemaker 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:46.889
 the only one gratitude said 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.969
 to be treated by some of this compensation 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:54.479
 and other methods to be able to mende 

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:56.459
 let's say it 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.059
 improvement of wastewater from arequipa 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:00.129
 and its cost 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:05.299
 since it works it would represent more or less 1 171 million in its four 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.959
 stages in the first stage would be roughly 147 million 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.989
 being not much more expensive than the other alternatives that have problems of 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.259
 all kinds 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:19.079
 is going to benefit the population of Arequipa and leaves 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.079
 to use the sun's energy 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:27.539
 given practically that we have 90% in Arequipa 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:31.890
 that harms the health of the skin but for this case it is very convenient 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.669
 whereas in 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:37.719
 the result we would use energy made from petroleum 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.810
 i would represent greater spending the useful life in the eighth 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.959
 would be very small of twelve years at least yes we would have to solve it 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.589
 by reinforcement replenish the entire plant 

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:52.389
 instead here is the one of about 50 years or more
