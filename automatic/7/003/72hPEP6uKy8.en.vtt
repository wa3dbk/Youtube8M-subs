 Distilled as it comes out of the agave 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.660

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.150
 tequila and we have there for 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.540
 example in the tito an area where 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.880
 many materials produce many things 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.360

 is something very rich in the process and the 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.840
 happening there if I have to accept my 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.580
 ignorance I had never heard of the root and 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.340
 no it is not between 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:08.000
 like mezcal was a little lighter

 local and we use it in the 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.860
 restaurant we have a little bit of the 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.450
 philosophy of the daughter I like the 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.330
 philosophy of our restaurant is 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.970
 use the local livelihood to develop 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.850
 small local producers and 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.010
 use products nationally but 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:52.850
 produced by Mexicans as cheeses 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:57.050
 tequilas the rootlet and this also 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:05:00.409
 we are using a little bit now 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.729

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:04.550

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:16.030
 client you know that this is fine 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.030

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.930
 I'm going to throw in the products 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.240
 transgenic that finally come to 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.860
 help us a little bit about everything that they are 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.800
 La Pobla world population ever going 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.750
 increasing but clear yes if 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.139
 we can support the industry 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.790
 Mexican to the whole agriculture to all 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:36.280
 the cattle ranch to all our kids 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.500
 Mexicans who are engaged in the land 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.720
 is that is amazing today we are going to 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.350
 add him with hats and as he finishes 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.210
 to do everything you get everything and there you 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.419

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.800
 ready 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.350

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.790
 little by little a but that is not 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.050
 tequila because it says if they want truth 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.650

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.650
 this minor 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:23.289
 the court we return do not take off 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.569
