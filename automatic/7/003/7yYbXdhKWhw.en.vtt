00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
natural kind of weight to it even though

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.550

it<00:01:56.880> was<00:01:57.000> straight<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.659> had<00:01:57.869> like<00:01:58.079> kind<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.439> like

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
it was straight it had like kind of like

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.679 
it was straight it had like kind of like
a<00:01:58.710> bent<00:01:59.009> wave<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.640> so<00:01:59.909> I<00:01:59.939> really<00:02:00.420> really

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
a bent wave to it so I really really

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.109 
a bent wave to it so I really really
love<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:00.930> about<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.710> hair<00:02:01.920> because<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.939> gets

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
love that about the hair because it gets

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.819 
love that about the hair because it gets
long<00:02:03.329> straight<00:02:03.659> but<00:02:03.930> it'll<00:02:04.259> hold<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.560> curl

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
long straight but it'll hold the curl

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.310 
long straight but it'll hold the curl
because<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.250> has<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.430> natural<00:02:05.729> wave<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.719> so

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
because it has a natural wave to it so

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.290 
because it has a natural wave to it so

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
is so not cute um and that's just like

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.310 
first time I did my hair I left it on
for<00:05:31.849> maybe<00:05:31.969> 30<00:05:32.360> minutes<00:05:32.750> and<00:05:32.960> I<00:05:33.020> got<00:05:33.169> that

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
for maybe 30 minutes and I got that

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.260 
for maybe 30 minutes and I got that
brass<00:05:33.650> in<00:05:33.919> color<00:05:34.159> which<00:05:34.400> I<00:05:34.520> didn't<00:05:34.760> like<00:05:34.969> and

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
brass in color which I didn't like and

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.029 
brass in color which I didn't like and
then<00:05:35.690> the<00:05:35.779> second<00:05:36.139> time<00:05:36.229> I<00:05:36.349> did<00:05:36.560> it<00:05:36.589> since<00:05:36.860> my

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
then the second time I did it since my

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:40.500 
then the second time I did it since my
hair<00:05:37.219> was<00:05:37.339> already<00:05:37.820> like<00:05:38.029> in<00:05:38.240> the<00:05:38.750> hair<00:05:39.159> um

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
hair was already like in the hair um

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.300 
hair was already like in the hair um
lighten<00:05:41.510> weight<00:05:41.930> quicker<00:05:42.229> and<00:05:42.589> it<00:05:42.800> only<00:05:42.949> took

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
lighten weight quicker and it only took

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.610 
lighten weight quicker and it only took
maybe<00:05:43.550> 10<00:05:44.060> 15<00:05:44.240> minutes<00:05:44.810> for<00:05:44.960> the<00:05:45.050> hair<00:05:45.229> to<00:05:45.260> turn

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
maybe 10 15 minutes for the hair to turn

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.519 
maybe 10 15 minutes for the hair to turn
to<00:05:46.339> this<00:05:46.490> color<00:05:46.820> so<00:05:47.419> the<00:05:47.839> second<00:05:48.139> time<00:05:48.260> you<00:05:48.380> do

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:48.529
