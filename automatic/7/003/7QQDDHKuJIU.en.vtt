tennis elbow those are the two main ones
we<00:00:18.750> see<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:18.990> two<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.470> most<00:00:19.650> debilitating

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
we see in two of the most debilitating

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.310 
we see in two of the most debilitating
and<00:00:22.340> when<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.609> cumulative<00:00:24.570> trauma<00:00:24.869> disorder<00:00:25.500> is

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
and when a cumulative trauma disorder is

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.910 
and when a cumulative trauma disorder is

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
acute and it is symptomatic my answer is

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.280 
acute and it is symptomatic my answer is
always<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.430> same<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:33.090> have<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:35.930> visit<00:00:36.930> a

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
determine exactly the cause of it

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.450 
determine exactly the cause of it
because<00:00:42.270> most<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.719> times<00:00:42.960> after<00:00:43.530> there's

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
because most of the times after there's

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.670 
because most of the times after there's
been<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> lot<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.940> scarring<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.629> lot<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.899> injury

been a lot of scarring a lot of injury
and<00:00:46.770> repair<00:00:48.620> processes<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.480> what<00:00:51.480> has<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.780> be

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
and repair processes and what has to be

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.720 
and repair processes and what has to be
done<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.379> skilled<00:00:52.949> practitioner<00:00:53.550> has

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.740 
done is that a skilled practitioner has

can easily remember the steps been our
main<00:02:42.470> step<00:02:42.890> for<00:02:43.370> carpal<00:02:43.760> tunnel<00:02:44.090> is<00:02:44.239> that<00:02:44.870> we

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
main step for carpal tunnel is that we

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.140 
main step for carpal tunnel is that we
strengthen<00:02:45.400> rebuilds<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.760> muscles<00:02:47.060> of

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
open hat that keeps the carpal tunnel

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.210 
open hat that keeps the carpal tunnel
nice<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.239> supported<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:50.780> keeps<00:02:50.959> me<00:02:51.220> maximum

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
nice and supported it keeps me maximum

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.789

blood<00:02:52.370> flow<00:02:52.700> established<00:02:53.329> and<00:02:53.620> that's<00:02:54.620> how

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
blood flow established and that's how

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.110 
blood flow established and that's how
you<00:02:54.860> will<00:02:55.040> correct<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.459> problem<00:02:55.790> so<00:02:55.910> very

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
you will correct the problem so very
