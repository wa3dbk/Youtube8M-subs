how<00:01:41.370> about<00:01:41.550> this<00:01:41.700> electrical<00:01:42.300> line<00:01:42.540> well<00:01:43.260> this

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
how about this electrical line well this

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.310 
how about this electrical line well this
one<00:01:43.680> will<00:01:44.190> require<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.730> few<00:01:45.360> more<00:01:45.600> steps<00:01:45.930> just

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
one will require a few more steps just

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.420 
one will require a few more steps just
to<00:01:46.530> be<00:01:46.730> delicate<00:01:47.730> with<00:01:47.760> and<00:01:48.480> I'm<00:01:48.600> going<00:01:48.810> to

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
size and I'm going to go right to the

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.920 
size and I'm going to go right to the
end<00:01:56.070> actually<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.390> know<00:01:57.510> what<00:01:57.630> I'm<00:01:57.690> going<00:01:57.840> to

and draw and then we say where it's on a

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.590 
and draw and then we say where it's on a
sample<00:02:20.370> I'm<00:02:20.550> going<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.790> have<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.030> sample<00:02:21.480> over

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
sample I'm going to have it sample over

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.710 
sample I'm going to have it sample over
here<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:23.730> then<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.060> want<00:02:24.209> to<00:02:24.270> come<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.600> the

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.600 
other end and I'm going to have it
sample<00:02:31.110> out<00:02:33.500> pick<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.680> area<00:02:35.070> where<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.310> wanted

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
sample out pick the area where I wanted

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.260 
sample out pick the area where I wanted
to<00:02:35.670> sample

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.990 

and<00:02:41.750> there<00:02:41.990> we<00:02:42.170> are<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.710> then<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.580> rest<00:02:43.820> is

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
and there we are and then the rest is

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.360 
and there we are and then the rest is
just<00:02:44.060> as<00:02:44.420> easy<00:02:44.630> as<00:02:44.840> pie<00:02:45.140> is<00:02:45.200> I<00:02:45.650> can<00:02:45.830> just<00:02:45.860> simply

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
just as easy as pie is I can just simply

00:02:46.370 --> 00:03:00.770 
just as easy as pie is I can just simply
come<00:02:46.610> down<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:47.240> do<00:02:48.200> large<00:02:48.860> brushstrokes

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.990 

as<00:03:01.410> long<00:03:01.620> as<00:03:01.650> I<00:03:01.890> like<00:03:02.130> where<00:03:02.400> it's<00:03:02.550> replacing

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
as long as I like where it's replacing

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.490 
as long as I like where it's replacing
the<00:03:03.330> sky<00:03:03.600> from<00:03:03.990> I<00:03:04.520> picked<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.670> areas<00:03:06.500> adjust

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
the sky from I picked the areas adjust

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.640 
the sky from I picked the areas adjust
and<00:03:08.270> there<00:03:09.270> we<00:03:09.420> are<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.900> have<00:03:10.170> removed<00:03:10.470> the

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
and there we are I have removed the

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.470 
and there we are I have removed the
powerlines<00:03:11.280> removed<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:12.000> poles<00:03:12.240> and

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
powerlines removed the poles and

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.290 
powerlines removed the poles and
improved<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.350> picture<00:03:13.680> quite<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.010> bit<00:03:14.280> now<00:03:15.120> of

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
improved the picture quite a bit now of

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.400 
improved the picture quite a bit now of
course<00:03:15.510> you're<00:03:15.660> gonna<00:03:15.780> have<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.050> be<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.200> little

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
course you're gonna have to be a little

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.680 
course you're gonna have to be a little
more<00:03:16.560> careful<00:03:16.830> than<00:03:17.190> I<00:03:17.280> was<00:03:17.550> today

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
more careful than I was today

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.840 
more careful than I was today
I<00:03:18.720> was<00:03:19.560> just<00:03:19.770> quickly<00:03:20.220> showing<00:03:20.489> you<00:03:20.700> the

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
I was just quickly showing you the

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.570 
I was just quickly showing you the
technique<00:03:21.440> but<00:03:22.440> that's<00:03:22.620> all<00:03:22.860> there<00:03:23.040> is<00:03:23.069> to<00:03:23.400> it

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
technique but that's all there is to it

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.360 
technique but that's all there is to it
to<00:03:23.610> removing<00:03:24.239> objects<00:03:24.709> you<00:03:25.709> can<00:03:25.860> literally

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
to removing objects you can literally

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.750 
to removing objects you can literally
come<00:03:26.580> in<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:26.970> remove<00:03:27.120> anything<00:03:28.310> as<00:03:29.310> long<00:03:29.580> as

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
come in and remove anything as long as

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.970 
come in and remove anything as long as
you<00:03:29.880> have<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:30.120> reasonable<00:03:30.450> area<00:03:31.110> to<00:03:31.500> sample

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
you have a reasonable area to sample

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.210 
you have a reasonable area to sample
from<00:03:32.600> okay<00:03:33.600> so<00:03:34.170> I<00:03:34.200> hope<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:34.590> liked<00:03:34.769> this<00:03:34.980> quick
