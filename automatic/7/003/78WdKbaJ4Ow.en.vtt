00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.100 
wondering who that is passing through so
yeah<00:02:12.920> basically<00:02:13.250> it's<00:02:13.760> pretty<00:02:13.910> easy<00:02:14.210> so<00:02:15.020> we

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
yeah basically it's pretty easy so we

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.510 
yeah basically it's pretty easy so we
just<00:02:15.260> do<00:02:15.410> this<00:02:15.530> for<00:02:15.710> a<00:02:15.770> little<00:02:15.920> while<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:16.370> then

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
just do this for a little while and then

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.890 
just do this for a little while and then
yeah<00:02:17.890> basically<00:02:18.890> just<00:02:19.360> go<00:02:20.360> down<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:20.720> then<00:02:20.810> you

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
yeah basically just go down and then you

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.930 
yeah basically just go down and then you
curl<00:02:21.170> in<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:21.410> middle<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:21.920> then<00:02:22.160> keep<00:02:22.730> curling

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
curl in the middle and then keep curling

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:23.590 
curl in the middle and then keep curling
like<00:02:23.210> that

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
like that

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.420 
like that
sometimes<00:02:24.140> it's<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.830> straightening<00:02:25.310> iron

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
sometimes it's the straightening iron

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.330 
sometimes it's the straightening iron
even<00:02:25.760> gets<00:02:26.120> hot<00:02:26.270> enough<00:02:26.530> on<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.709> outside<00:02:28.220> you

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
even gets hot enough on the outside you

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.800
