00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:35.880
 speak bacteria today let's talk about 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:38.010
 chic chick flicks 3 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.550
 the trick with sticks is a very trick 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.410
 Thomas Ian used by the drummer that 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.280
 in my opinion is the best drummer of the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.110
 universe 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.039
 in Brazil two bacteria that use 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.379
 much of this technique is for eduardo se eo eo 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.930
 jackson lima son the proposal this 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.570
 Technique I learned by seeing jackson lima 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.100
 son playing I saw a lesson from him a lot 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.080
 old year of 2012 is fighting 2011 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.360
 out there and I learned this levada 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.659
 using the headlines 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.390
 I do not remember if it is exactly like this but in 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.299
 time he used the splash when he 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.130
 I played drums of playing the clash in this 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.590
 I thought I thought too much 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.509
 Then I could never do what I 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.540
 I was trying to make a soil so nice to 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.110
 I did not develop my baton. 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.270
 to carry out this procedure the first 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.110
 thing you need to learn to 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.869
 performing this technique is the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.680
 Drumstick if you do not know how to manage the drumstick 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.390
 with my fingers in my opinion first 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.250
 thing you have to learn to do 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.960
 act the architect built 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.130
 There are people who turn around I do not 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.430
 I generated it 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.180
 I only managed to turn back what is the 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:58.350
 trick holds the drumstick the indicator that 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:02.549
 the thumb in this form places the second 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.130
 finger underneath then the third and then 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:09.360
 the indicator again and safe drumstick 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.519
 this way, Eduard Torci taught a 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.510
 video a way that keeps spinning spinning 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:17.910
 the drumstick only without stopping gave him and 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.870
 I think he's going to be little god then. 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.239
 return 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.730
 I never stopped to practice because I 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.890
 I identified myself more with this one. 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.970
 inside even I think use it 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.390
 for improvisation 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.390
 this grandma 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.880
 thus 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.100
 to train the levada itself 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.710
 first you have to learn how to take 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.740
 levada will be the following in the first 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.520
 time we will perform 45 full 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.520
 thus 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:35.970
 then more serious until just 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:57.990
 stables time 2 3 e 4 range only be 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:04:02.220
 like normal floods and from there you go 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:04.670
 to fit the trick, the xix getting 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.670
 form 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:48.140
 it's an exercise you can train 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.790
 to master this swing of the drumstick is until 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.100
 theme for another video is a 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:05:02.030
 helicopter also taught by gerson 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:05:12.130
 son file is this you go spinning 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:17.960
 the stick in this way the first position 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:29.810
 2nd 3rd is going to stay here and it 's all his. 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:31.760
 it will spin again around this 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.510
 way and from there you will 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.510
 other two new 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:50.990
 this way but in the lead of the districts 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:56.840
 what are you saying today we are not 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:06:04.270
 running on the floor here yes it is 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:07.570
 sixteenth mouche that is so then 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.220
 in the other new ones you will 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:51.820
 turning abac 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:54.010
 that way the guys if you want part 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.260
 everything in this video in a pdf explaining 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:58.510
 detail how to execute technique 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:01.150
