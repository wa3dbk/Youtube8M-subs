double<00:02:57.900> switch<00:02:58.080> here<00:02:58.350> I<00:02:58.560> go<00:02:58.710> ahead<00:02:58.770> to

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
double switch here I go ahead to

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.160 
double switch here I go ahead to
Tyranitar<00:02:59.550> he<00:02:59.730> goes<00:02:59.880> out<00:03:00.060> into<00:03:00.300> what<00:03:00.990> does<00:03:01.050> he

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
Tyranitar he goes out into what does he

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.680 
Tyranitar he goes out into what does he
go<00:03:01.260> Metagross<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.130> that's<00:03:02.250> terrible<00:03:02.760> matchup

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
go Metagross and that's terrible matchup

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.780 
go Metagross and that's terrible matchup
for<00:03:03.840> me<00:03:03.990> I<00:03:04.170> know<00:03:04.710> he<00:03:04.920> has<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.160> switch<00:03:05.370> so<00:03:05.520> I<00:03:05.580> just

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
for me I know he has to switch so I just

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.670 
for me I know he has to switch so I just
decide<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.060> build<00:03:06.150> an<00:03:06.300> earthquake<00:03:06.720> because<00:03:07.350> it

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
decide to build an earthquake because it

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.320 
decide to build an earthquake because it
hits<00:03:08.100> pretty<00:03:08.340> much<00:03:08.490> everything<00:03:08.850> I've<00:03:08.940> seen<00:03:09.090> so

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
hits pretty much everything I've seen so

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.010 
hits pretty much everything I've seen so
far<00:03:09.360> from<00:03:09.540> his<00:03:09.840> team<00:03:10.040> he<00:03:11.040> goes<00:03:11.340> in<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:11.580> scissor

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
far from his team he goes in the scissor

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.510 
far from his team he goes in the scissor
the<00:03:13.020> scissor<00:03:13.230> takes<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.650> earthquake<00:03:14.040> rather

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
the scissor takes the earthquake rather

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.400 
the scissor takes the earthquake rather
nicely<00:03:14.880> I'm<00:03:15.510> not<00:03:15.720> entirely<00:03:15.960> sure<00:03:16.110> if<00:03:16.290> it's

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
nicely I'm not entirely sure if it's

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.260 
nicely I'm not entirely sure if it's
like<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:16.680> 2<00:03:16.860> hit<00:03:17.010> ko<00:03:17.190> on<00:03:17.490> it<00:03:17.610> he<00:03:17.880> just<00:03:17.940> go<00:03:18.090> for<00:03:18.210> the

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
like a 2 hit ko on it he just go for the

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.380 
like a 2 hit ko on it he just go for the
bullet<00:03:18.540> punch<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:19.500> KO<00:03:19.710> my<00:03:19.890> Metagross<00:03:20.250> yeah<00:03:21.240> he

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
bullet punch to KO my Metagross yeah he

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.880 
bullet punch to KO my Metagross yeah he
was<00:03:21.480> pretty<00:03:21.600> weak<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.110> I<00:03:22.200> am<00:03:22.230> running<00:03:22.710> a

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
was pretty weak and I am running a

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.770 
was pretty weak and I am running a
choice<00:03:23.130> band<00:03:23.400> scissor<00:03:24.000> so<00:03:24.240> that<00:03:24.450> was<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.570> pretty

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
choice band scissor so that was a pretty

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.630 
choice band scissor so that was a pretty
nice<00:03:24.930> play<00:03:25.170> for<00:03:25.230> me<00:03:25.500> he<00:03:25.950> goes<00:03:26.100> on<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.370> his<00:03:26.490> own

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
nice play for me he goes on to his own

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.220 
nice play for me he goes on to his own
scissor<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.150> I<00:03:27.210> know<00:03:27.270> he's<00:03:27.510> gonna<00:03:27.630> probably

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
scissor and I know he's gonna probably

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.650 
scissor and I know he's gonna probably
like<00:03:28.880> superpower<00:03:29.880> me<00:03:30.060> I<00:03:30.090> don't<00:03:30.330> have<00:03:30.420> anything

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
attack and minus one defense it becomes

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.940 
attack and minus one defense it becomes
perfect<00:03:41.010> setup<00:03:41.190> fodder<00:03:41.460> for<00:03:41.580> my<00:03:41.970> Metagross<00:03:42.950> so

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
perfect setup fodder for my Metagross so

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.830 
perfect setup fodder for my Metagross so
the<00:03:44.040> scissor<00:03:44.280> goes<00:03:44.550> down<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.150> it<00:03:45.480> goes<00:03:45.660> out

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
the scissor goes down and it goes out

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.110 
the scissor goes down and it goes out
into<00:03:45.960> the<00:03:46.050> Jilla<00:03:46.470> growth<00:03:46.740> and<00:03:47.040> like<00:03:47.790> I<00:03:47.940> don't

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
into the Jilla growth and like I don't

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.550 
into the Jilla growth and like I don't
really<00:03:48.300> have<00:03:48.480> anything<00:03:48.690> I<00:03:48.870> wanted<00:03:49.080> to<00:03:49.140> do<00:03:49.290> so<00:03:49.500> I

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
them back in and with my agility I can

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.730 
them back in and with my agility I can
out<00:03:57.360> speed<00:03:57.600> his<00:03:57.720> whole<00:03:57.930> team<00:03:58.230> which<00:03:58.500> is<00:03:58.620> an

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
out speed his whole team which is an

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.410 
out speed his whole team which is an
epic<00:03:59.100> for<00:03:59.280> me<00:03:59.370> so<00:03:59.550> if<00:03:59.670> I<00:03:59.730> can<00:03:59.910> just<00:04:00.060> get<00:04:00.180> some

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
epic for me so if I can just get some

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.930 
epic for me so if I can just get some
decent<00:04:00.600> hits<00:04:00.960> I<00:04:01.110> think<00:04:01.410> I<00:04:01.500> can<00:04:01.710> sweep<00:04:02.010> so<00:04:02.640> I<00:04:02.670> go

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
decent hits I think I can sweep so I go

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.130 
decent hits I think I can sweep so I go
for<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.180> meteor<00:04:03.420> master<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:03.810> as<00:04:03.900> off

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
for the meteor master and as off

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.260 
for the meteor master and as off
obviously<00:04:04.380> as<00:04:04.800> a<00:04:04.830> KO<00:04:05.100> because<00:04:05.580> as<00:04:05.730> elf<00:04:05.940> is<00:04:06.060> like

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
obviously as a KO because as elf is like

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.680 
obviously as a KO because as elf is like
so<00:04:06.540> pathetically<00:04:07.350> weak<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:08.010> um<00:04:08.820> that<00:04:09.480> is

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
so pathetically weak and um that is

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.180 
so pathetically weak and um that is
really<00:04:09.960> awesome<00:04:10.110> for<00:04:10.410> me<00:04:10.530> he<00:04:10.710> brings<00:04:10.920> out<00:04:11.070> his

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
really awesome for me he brings out his

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.070 
really awesome for me he brings out his
scissor<00:04:11.610> now<00:04:11.820> and<00:04:12.150> I<00:04:12.360> don't<00:04:12.420> think<00:04:12.720> I'll<00:04:12.960> be

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
scissor now and I don't think I'll be

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.140 
scissor now and I don't think I'll be
able<00:04:13.110> to<00:04:13.260> care<00:04:13.500> with<00:04:13.650> earthquake<00:04:14.070> he<00:04:14.970> goes

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
able to care with earthquake he goes

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.190 
able to care with earthquake he goes
through<00:04:15.300> the<00:04:15.390> earthquake

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
through the earthquake

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.229 
through the earthquake

should<00:05:55.470> go<00:05:55.650> both<00:05:55.889> because<00:05:56.639> scissors

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
should go both because scissors

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.029 
should go both because scissors
