00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
now when I got this um I was kind of

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.350 
now when I got this um I was kind of
surprised<00:05:02.480> because<00:05:02.900> at<00:05:03.410> targai<00:05:03.980> tarjay<00:05:04.610> they

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
surprised because at targai tarjay they

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.680 
surprised because at targai tarjay they
had<00:05:05.770> the<00:05:06.770> same<00:05:07.130> packing<00:05:08.060> and<00:05:08.240> I<00:05:08.300> think<00:05:08.570> it

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
had the same packing and I think it

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:09.940 
had the same packing and I think it
might<00:05:08.810> be<00:05:08.870> like<00:05:09.140> you<00:05:09.350> know<00:05:09.380> they<00:05:09.590> might<00:05:09.710> get<00:05:09.860> up

might be like you know they might get up

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.740 
might be like you know they might get up
