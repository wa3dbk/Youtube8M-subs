ocx overclocked the heck out of this
thing<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.559> they<00:00:13.650> put<00:00:13.830> an<00:00:13.920> awesome<00:00:14.610> cooling

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.939 
card is up to 18 degrees Celsius cooler
cooler<00:00:23.090> that<00:00:24.090> much<00:00:24.359> cooler<00:00:24.869> than<00:00:25.680> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
cooler that much cooler than the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.960

standard<00:00:26.910> 9600<00:00:27.900> GT<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:29.580> means<00:00:29.760> there's

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
standard 9600 GT and that means there's

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.400 
standard 9600 GT and that means there's
even<00:00:30.240> more<00:00:30.269> overhead<00:00:30.779> now<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.230> one's

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
even more overhead now this one's

even more overhead now this one's

already clocked at 725 versus 650 on the
stock<00:00:34.950> clock<00:00:35.280> you've<00:00:35.760> got<00:00:35.910> 64<00:00:36.420> stream

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
stock clock you've got 64 stream

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.840 
stock clock you've got 64 stream
processors<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.469> those<00:00:37.649> are<00:00:37.829> clocked<00:00:38.040> at<00:00:38.160> 1850

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.500

versus<00:00:39.270> 1625<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> stock<00:00:40.770> clock<00:00:41.510> version

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
versus 1625 on the stock clock version

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.569 
versus 1625 on the stock clock version
and<00:00:42.629> also<00:00:42.780> we<00:00:42.930> have<00:00:43.020> 512<00:00:43.500> megabytes<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.980> gddr3

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
and also we have 512 megabytes of gddr3

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.529 
and also we have 512 megabytes of gddr3
and<00:00:45.450> that's<00:00:45.600> clocked<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:45.989> 1950<00:00:46.680> versus<00:00:47.579> 1800

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
and that's clocked in 1950 versus 1800

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.170 
and that's clocked in 1950 versus 1800
so<00:00:48.629> 150<00:00:49.110> mega<00:00:49.260> hurtle<00:00:49.559> o'clock<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.789> memory

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
so 150 mega hurtle o'clock on the memory

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.740 
so 150 mega hurtle o'clock on the memory
as<00:00:51.300> well

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
as well

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.139 
as well
and<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.230> still<00:00:52.469> stays<00:00:52.800> cool<00:00:53.100> looks<00:00:53.760> awesome

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
and it still stays cool looks awesome

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.200 
and it still stays cool looks awesome
that<00:00:55.219> I've<00:00:56.219> wear<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:56.699> if<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.000> was<00:00:57.090> an

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
that I've wear this if it was an

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.860 
that I've wear this if it was an
accessory<00:00:57.829> it's<00:00:59.000> not<00:01:00.000> really<00:01:00.239> an<00:01:00.420> accessory

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
accessory it's not really an accessory

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.869 
accessory it's not really an accessory
you<00:01:00.989> can<00:01:01.050> wear<00:01:01.350> but<00:01:01.980> it's<00:01:02.100> an<00:01:02.190> accessory<00:01:02.640> that

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
you can wear but it's an accessory that

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.590 
you can wear but it's an accessory that
can<00:01:03.149> make<00:01:04.140> your<00:01:04.260> computer<00:01:04.680> awesome<00:01:05.610> or<00:01:05.820> also

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
can make your computer awesome or also

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.330 
can make your computer awesome or also
it<00:01:06.900> runs<00:01:07.080> an<00:01:07.200> SLI<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:07.650> if<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.920> want<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.130> pick<00:01:08.189> up

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
it runs an SLI so if you want to pick up

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.670 
it runs an SLI so if you want to pick up
two<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.549> these<00:01:08.700> you'd<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.600> two<00:01:10.140> awesome

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
two of these you'd have two awesome

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.350 
two of these you'd have two awesome
cards<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.100> run<00:01:11.280> nice<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.760> cool<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.180> your

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
cards that run nice and cool in your

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.600 
cards that run nice and cool in your
system<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.049> can<00:01:13.080> run<00:01:13.260> them<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.799> tandem

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
system so you can run them in tandem

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.700 
system so you can run them in tandem
