in eternal formats that could be a

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.029 
in eternal formats that could be a
difference<00:00:51.390> maker<00:00:51.480> in<00:00:51.899> any<00:00:52.469> case<00:00:52.680> we<00:00:52.890> get<00:00:53.010> a

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
difference maker in any case we get a

is<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.500> solution<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.310> problem

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
is the solution to that problem

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.399 
is the solution to that problem

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.670 
God I ro s got a victory and I also look
at<00:04:51.610> a<00:04:51.640> crowing<00:04:51.940> crusader<00:04:52.540> and<00:04:52.840> this<00:04:53.410> card

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
at a crowing crusader and this card

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.460 
at a crowing crusader and this card
alone<00:04:54.100> can<00:04:54.370> be<00:04:54.490> just<00:04:54.730> an<00:04:54.850> insane<00:04:55.540> finisher<00:04:56.260> in

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
alone can be just an insane finisher in

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.280 
alone can be just an insane finisher in
a<00:04:56.560> Boros<00:04:56.920> deck<00:04:57.190> on<00:04:57.400> turn<00:04:57.940> 5<00:04:58.210> launched<00:04:58.960> a<00:04:59.050> fleet

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
a Boros deck on turn 5 launched a fleet

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.290 
a Boros deck on turn 5 launched a fleet
on<00:04:59.530> a<00:04:59.590> Crone<00:04:59.920> Crusader<00:05:00.430> get<00:05:00.730> a<00:05:00.760> dude<00:05:01.000> get

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
on a Crone Crusader get a dude get

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.770 
on a Crone Crusader get a dude get
another<00:05:01.570> dude<00:05:01.810> swing<00:05:02.530> in<00:05:02.710> with<00:05:02.830> everybody<00:05:03.130> and

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
another dude swing in with everybody and

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.180 
another dude swing in with everybody and
given<00:05:04.780> that<00:05:04.900> they<00:05:05.110> can't<00:05:05.380> be<00:05:05.530> blocked<00:05:05.770> except

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
given that they can't be blocked except

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.010 
given that they can't be blocked except
by<00:05:06.280> two<00:05:06.340> or<00:05:06.580> more<00:05:06.700> creatures<00:05:06.940> means<00:05:07.480> good<00:05:07.780> game

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
by two or more creatures means good game

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.900 
by two or more creatures means good game
so<00:05:08.500> I<00:05:08.530> think<00:05:08.650> the<00:05:08.890> strive<00:05:09.160> mechanic<00:05:09.610> is<00:05:09.730> just

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
so I think the strive mechanic is just

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.200 
so I think the strive mechanic is just
going<00:05:10.030> to<00:05:10.120> be<00:05:10.240> the<00:05:10.390> ultimate<00:05:10.510> heroic<00:05:11.350> enabler

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
going to be the ultimate heroic enabler

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.490 
going to be the ultimate heroic enabler
especially<00:05:13.210> in<00:05:13.300> a<00:05:13.390> Boros<00:05:13.720> deck<00:05:13.960> that<00:05:14.200> wants<00:05:14.410> to

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
especially in a Boros deck that wants to

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.990 
especially in a Boros deck that wants to
make<00:05:14.650> tons<00:05:14.950> of<00:05:15.130> creatures<00:05:15.550> turn<00:05:15.880> them

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
make tons of creatures turn them

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.540 
make tons of creatures turn them
sideways<00:05:16.180> and<00:05:16.720> make<00:05:17.380> sure<00:05:17.560> that<00:05:17.800> they<00:05:17.950> don't

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
sideways and make sure that they don't

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.140 
sideways and make sure that they don't
die<00:05:18.960> overall<00:05:19.960> love<00:05:20.230> the<00:05:20.440> card<00:05:20.680> a<00:05:20.860> lot<00:05:21.130> okay<00:05:22.000> the

five I think that it's going to be a

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:09.719 
five I think that it's going to be a
little<00:07:07.509> bit<00:07:07.660> too<00:07:07.990> slow<00:07:08.289> to<00:07:08.350> see<00:07:08.740> to<00:07:09.400> see<00:07:09.430> it<00:07:09.639> in
