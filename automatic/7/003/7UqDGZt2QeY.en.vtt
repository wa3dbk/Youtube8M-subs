00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.450
 even if you absolutely need a new TV before Christmas 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.569
 In the current December, 24 lcd devices are under scrutiny in the test 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:17.529
 A specialized laboratory rated trained subjects twelve devices with 80 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:18.550
 centimeters 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.359
 7 with 94 centimeters and five devices with 102 to 107 centimeters diagonal 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.669
 the test result in total 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:30.569
 almost half of the audited TVs do not have eleven devices have good 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:31.440
 isolated 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.570
 and only one was sufficient the others wandered in midfield 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.330
 satisfactory no doubt the flat screen televisions have their 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.070
 Teething problems overcome 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.929
 high-resolution television picture 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:45.820
 the so-called HDTV most devices are good because there is other signals 

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:49.009
 the different only the test winner convinced consistently 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.340
 Phelps' 80 centimeter device had time over almost any image source 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.120
 equally good quality 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.020
 in the vast majority of televisions it tends to make the picture quality strong 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.450
 varies depending on which source you use 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.889
 the grocery bag 

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:06.520
 who wants to indulge in a new chic black should be exactly before 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.689
 consider which image sources he receives at home or see in the future 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:11.410
 would like to 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:17.480
 analog or digital in standard or high resolution, for example, have 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.890
 almost all the devices we tested have a built-in dvb-t tuner 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.890
 but only seven of them actually have a good picture about it 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.860
 be sure to try different image sources a chosen one 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.500
 Another tip is simply the favorite beer VD or blue-ray from to 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.050
 Take home with you and look at the store then you have a good comparison 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.280
 Vivaldis are the price differences in the televisions the range is 400 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.180
 well over 2000 euros but how much do you really have to spend 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.970
 The best devices in the test are relatively expensive devices from LÃ¶w and 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.840
 Philips so the thousand visitors far more than 2000 euros cost 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.320
 but what are synonymous three devices from Sony in the test also good overall 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.700
 have cut and the already between 500 and 800 euros cost the 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.249
 Tendency goes to the big flat one shows just bigger 

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:09.970
 important here Kleverland applies a different viewing distance as a rule of thumb 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:14.180
 Picture diagonal times 3 the high-resolution pictures were also available 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.550
 less and if I watch TV alone should also be on the 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.339
 Thinking angle 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:22.599
 traditionally the television sets weaker that you sideways 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:23.379
 looks 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.749
 then the contrast diminishes and the colors Flower become there he had in his 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:29.659
 very much done in technical development despite the last few years 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.309
 more often a larger round of television should definitely be on it 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:35.369
 Pay attention that a device is bought at a large viewing angle 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:38.150
 many only want the maximum image resolution 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.090
 the testers found eggs really is not really necessary full-hd 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.439
 Devices such as the Full HD logo wear indicate that a particularly high 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:48.110
 have physical resolution 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.830
 but this very high resolution actually only makes for very large 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.720
 Televisions from 9 screen diagonal of one meter or larger are 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.720
 with the smaller devices one recognizes the difference actually hardly 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:02:59.590
 by the way 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.090
 Do not forget to take a look at the pictures and the operation 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.919
 Handling of the devices 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.919
 also here before try out 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.389
 The aim was not to cause trouble 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:13.389
 then it works with the new TV for Christmas 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.329
 Customers have 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.189
 detailed information about the test is available in the december edition of fest 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:27.230
