strike<00:02:27.379> does<00:02:27.650> is<00:02:27.890> it<00:02:28.040> increases<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:29.180> duration

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
strike does is it increases the duration

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.570 
strike does is it increases the duration
at<00:02:29.870> which<00:02:30.019> the<00:02:30.200> diseases<00:02:30.590> are<00:02:30.739> on<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.160> target

so<00:02:32.239> whenever<00:02:32.840> your<00:02:33.110> diseases<00:02:33.410> get<00:02:33.680> low<00:02:34.040> I'd

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
so whenever your diseases get low I'd

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.580 
so whenever your diseases get low I'd
say<00:02:34.730> about<00:02:34.819> ten<00:02:35.360> seconds<00:02:35.810> till<00:02:35.989> they<00:02:36.140> drop<00:02:36.379> off

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
say about ten seconds till they drop off

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.229 
say about ten seconds till they drop off
I<00:02:36.830> would<00:02:36.980> use<00:02:37.129> festering<00:02:37.610> strike<00:02:37.879> to<00:02:38.030> build

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
I would use festering strike to build

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.580 
I would use festering strike to build
the<00:02:38.360> time<00:02:38.599> back<00:02:38.870> up<00:02:39.110> on<00:02:39.290> them

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
the time back up on them

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.500 
the time back up on them
so<00:02:39.980> that<00:02:40.160> your<00:02:40.310> outbreak<00:02:40.760> can<00:02:40.970> have<00:02:41.120> time<00:02:41.360> to

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
so that your outbreak can have time to

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.330 
so that your outbreak can have time to
get<00:02:41.629> off<00:02:41.780> its<00:02:41.989> cooldown<00:02:42.379> of<00:02:44.860> course<00:02:45.860> next<00:02:46.099> you
