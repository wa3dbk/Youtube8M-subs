00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
way you're gonna get a moab against faze

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.910 
way you're gonna get a moab against faze
unfortunately<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:47.130> uh<00:01:47.360> yeah<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.689> how<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.530> did

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
like a little bitch and I used the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.469 
like a little bitch and I used the
snipers<00:01:55.259> biggest<00:01:56.040> disadvantage<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.299> my

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
snipers biggest disadvantage to my

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.530 
snipers biggest disadvantage to my
advantage<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.920> snipers<00:01:59.729> right<00:02:00.000> they<00:02:00.270> they

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
advantage so snipers right they they

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.380 
advantage so snipers right they they
have<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.079> use<00:02:01.439> quick-draw<00:02:02.009> Pro<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.610> order<00:02:03.180> to

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
have to use quick-draw Pro in order to

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.480 
have to use quick-draw Pro in order to
be<00:02:03.540> able<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.320> know<00:02:04.439> zoom<00:02:04.770> in<00:02:04.950> fast<00:02:05.219> with

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
be able to you know zoom in fast with

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.709 
be able to you know zoom in fast with
their<00:02:05.640> scope<00:02:05.939> in<00:02:06.149> order<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.420> be<00:02:06.509> able<00:02:06.600> to

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
their scope in order to be able to

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:07.249 
their scope in order to be able to
quickscope

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
quickscope

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.650 
quickscope
so<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.459> knew<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:09.000> if<00:02:09.209> they're<00:02:09.420> using

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
so I knew that if they're using

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.990 
so I knew that if they're using
quick-draw<00:02:10.229> Pro<00:02:10.530> they<00:02:11.009> can't<00:02:11.400> be<00:02:11.670> using

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
quick-draw Pro they can't be using

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.339 
quick-draw Pro they can't be using
assassin<00:02:12.540> Pro<00:02:12.720> because<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:13.110> know<00:02:13.200> they're

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349

even really care believe it or not and

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.699 
even really care believe it or not and
face<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.550> face<00:03:29.820> heist<00:03:30.330> was<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.840> I<00:03:31.140> think<00:03:31.440> I

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
face to face heist was the I think I

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.410 
face to face heist was the I think I
think<00:03:31.860> he<00:03:31.950> probably<00:03:32.130> was<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.790> party<00:03:33.120> member

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
think he probably was the party member

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.390 
think he probably was the party member
or<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:34.110> party<00:03:34.380> leader<00:03:34.590> excuse<00:03:35.070> me

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
or the party leader excuse me

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.760 
or the party leader excuse me
and<00:03:35.520> so<00:03:36.510> I'm<00:03:36.780> actually<00:03:36.959> surprised<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.620> he
