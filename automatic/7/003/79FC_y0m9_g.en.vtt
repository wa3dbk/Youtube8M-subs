 you flicker and today it is the second 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.960
 part of the construction of a beautiful castle seems to be 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.630
 guys do you think that shit and built 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.050

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:38.219
 such as you say shit do 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.770
 drop dead lock to start so i don't 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.270
 I know what to call this effect, that is, he 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.250
 will look very beautiful 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.469
 we take simple stone steps and 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.390
 we draw around the castle, that is 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.609
 look guys i'm not going to do anything right now 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.219
 I will make a simple obdochku not done 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.899
 prettier roof just add on 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.629
 a little dungeon castle will 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.129
 look already about you he will love 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.129
 but what am I speeding up the video 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.260
 so look already more or less 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.450
 it looks but it is only the beginning further 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.770
 take the steps and circle the top of this 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.770
 upturned steps 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.670
 Well, guys, those who thought that 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.560
 looks like a shit look like he 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.500
 Now looks much more beautiful than 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.070
 earlier, that is, he already acquires, as it were, 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.380
 at least some such rules can be said 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.020
 the castle and then let's do it right away 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.120
 such an entrance is decorative of course like me 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.790
 I love of course the most beautiful photos either 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.250
 such an input or we will do it like this 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.140
 here guys i don't know how you want that 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.850
 eat as you like either at all 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.369
 can it be done so here it is 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.280
 immediately wide to the husband and for the castle 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:51.690
 the most suitable is wide and what what 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.759
 we need to do more so let's do it right away 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.430
 We do here and so we see the way 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.880
 more guys I'll tell you a secret those 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.360
 who watches my videos straight to the end 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.520
 then we'll make a trap here at the end 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.390
 here and look here is nothing four 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.850
 block these blocks will disappear and man 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.560
 was fly down and break okay 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.360
 it will be in the latest styles 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.880
 the last but one part somewhere is going to be in 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.710
 the last part because the most 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.100
 last it needs to be built at home then 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.750
 already do the mechanism they are the other way around 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.170
 what we need to do next with this 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.720
 a piece 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.550
 so let's think about how it will be 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.050
 look beautiful if we do here 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.959
 so so so so here you immediately put 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.670
 This is what you look like. 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.760
 cool she will look so well 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.880
 seems to be looking juicy here if we 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.330
 I just have these blocks there so beautiful 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.940
 here and here is the block and here is the block 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.390
 so they connected so we will do 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.690
 So 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:59.260
 Well, let's make the castle more or less 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.910
 looks further let's take these things here I 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.550
 I do not know whether I will succeed or not 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.420
 I'm thinking about it for now 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:12.370
 builds so so so these things if we 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.770
 do so here one two three and well in 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.390
 yes, let us have this 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.100
 beautiful entrance here are two holes 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.440
 cool for some reason I do not really 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.410
 like if okay okay all right 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.420
 more here the entrance is not done what you need 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.360
 do next so i have my back haru 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.030
 words okay we take the stone wall here 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.600
 we make such a work on top of stone 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.600
 stairs a 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:42.189
 Well, ready so only here as it is not very 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.689
 Well, you can put a step here to 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:46.030
 its like this is about this 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:48.579
 it looked okay what we need to do 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.920
 then take the semi-blocks of the half block 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.510
 mil so we circle everything around here this 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.310
 attention pieces guys are not like this 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.750
 do and here we are breaking them 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.360
 were not connect 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.900
 our corners are not connected in the corners 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.900
 half blocks 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.800
 ready now let's see how he 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.900
 It looks like that he looks yet 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.500
 from the side but this is only the beginning of the series 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.080
 seemingly like 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.180
 prettier than just such a box 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.299
 even out of the box guys if you do 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.739
 house box and decorate it thats horseradish 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.410
 here to say that this box will be 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.350
 beautiful box it really matters 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.680
 what do we need to do next first I 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:31.730
 I think this series for each finish 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:34.070
 because in this series we are just 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.400
 decorated made like a lock box 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.530
 and the locks of the cows and the castle boxes have done 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.630
 lock beautiful box well that is in 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.580
