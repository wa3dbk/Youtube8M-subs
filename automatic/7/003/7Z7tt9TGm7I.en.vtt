00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 the general council of haut-rhin wanted 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.120
 save money well it's missed 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.830
 according to the workers who denounce the 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.500
 contrary a budgetary slippage 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.150
 initially the decision to reorganize the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.219
 winter viability ie the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.900
 clearing of roads one-third of which 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.359
 provided by external companies 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.100
 the contracts were reallocated but 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.470
 finally it would be worse than before 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.930
 and more expensive according to the union the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.680
 general advice on its side relativized 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.269
 geraldine gruyere with nadine glee 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.340
 farmers in summer swimmers in winter 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.540
 josef schmidt is one of those 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.399
 private providers who work 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.730
 for years for the Department of 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.920
 high rhine 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.360
 this winter the deal has changed for the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.579
 most local providers 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.290
 josef schmidt has well preserved two 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.930
 snow clearing circuits but not all 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.370
 these equipment rental services 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.579
 what annoys me is that I lost 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.739
 the charger market was going on 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.539
 well for many years and who 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.010
 was given in August by a call 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.989
 offers a new tender that 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.020
 I did not know anything else 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.489
 company that is significantly more expensive 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.229
 the department of Haut Rhin has rented well 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.270
 for this winter dozens of chargers 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.680
 for salt rentals three times 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.659
 more expensive than last year according to the 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.830
 labor force union denouncing a 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.600
 inconsiderate expenditure 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.580
 at a time when everyone is called to do 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.930
 savings we simply made 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.220
 additions that led us to 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.640
 staggering numbers 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.200
 that is to say 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.229
 so basically last year we spent 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.060
 151000 euros for the rental of load 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.670
 sends a fortnight to the 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.770
 private companies and this year 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.390
 the call for tenders results in a 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.729
 expenditure of 200 sion of 3000 euros 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.560
 this additional cost of rental is assumed by the 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.360
 department one hundred thousand euros for a 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.369
 device that would be technically more 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.439
 efficient but the overall budget of the 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.600
 snow removal it should not increase 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.700
 now she after security to have 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.289
 24-hour material 7 days out of 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.270
 7 which was not the case previously 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.429
 hence the fact of having markets 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.750
 new we also have two circuits that 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.000
 are now done by our staff 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.280
 and then by the company that balances 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.429
 in savings of additional expenses 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.630
 more important benefits 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:04.549
 clear the departmental roads from 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.349
 High-rhin bend according to the years 3 to 6 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.030
 millions of euros depending on the weather 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:11.170
 it is only at the end of winter that 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.170
 can actually do the accounts
