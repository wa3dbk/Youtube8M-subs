00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.880
 oh yes yes welcome in the minute 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.590
 special minecraft here at the troll or on 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.120
 teaches you to find someone with the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.009
 red stone in less than a minute 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.010
 today we are going to make a machine to 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.910
 absolutely delicious noise 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.800
 so for building it you 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.869
 will simply have nef powder of 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.570
 redstone two torches two remaining of 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.029
 repeaters five blocks ground intel the aco 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.510
 baston 2d spencer is a pretty sum of 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.070
 arrows 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.779
 so you want to start right now 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.250
 by making impeller that is to say a 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.440
 heart by placing two repeaters into 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.180
 initial position like these both 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.670
 at a tick delay to make a blister 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.200
 of two titles like these one goes all 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.820
 immediately begin our monastery at 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.620
 surplus we will use later 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.120
 to leave our heart 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.910
 now we are just going to 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.010
 to make a small staircase break the block 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.590
 underneath as these placed them 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.449
 like that schiff click place our two of 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.059
 spencer facing towards the beautiful 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.190
 documentary about the repeater justice y 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.500
 replace another like that gold 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.600
 now fill them joy like those 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.150
 here we go after breaking the block 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.520
 like these and then eventually placed 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.799
 from the aed stand on our two spencer 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.770
 like that and now magic we're going all 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.869
 just shot well so 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.400
 currently we do not sleep anymore spencer 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.070
 who will shoot extremely fast 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.530
 the arrows to send this wall trap a 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.570
 auditory trap so quickly installed 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.430
 and there you can notice that it 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.439
 continues and yet there is nothing 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.860
 in the spencer and that even if we 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.860
 the breezes it will continue excellent and 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.509
 now if we go over 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.340
 and yes we do not even get the arrows 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.000
 so can now when that's all 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.860
 it 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.570
 your justice trap is there you have 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.090
 now a noisemaker who is 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.470
 absolutely 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.100
 very very very annoying what it does 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.260
 is it with each click 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.090
 it makes me an update compared 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.910
 to the repeaters and so it moves the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:01.830
 arrows you can see that if I get 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:03.660
 discover that it continues even if 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.760
 the animation is not long and that's it 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.810
 it goes on and on and the only one 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.940
 way to break it 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.679
 it's breaking the repeaters and north 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.450
 you have your arrows falling back by 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.200
 earth and that's you now use 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.150
 your system 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.890
 for those who would not ask them 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.660
 arrows will never dispose because they 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.610
 are constantly updated 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.750
 so it's a trap that will work at 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.980
 infinity 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.070
 it's always the end of this episode 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.810
 of the minute minecraft episode 2 where we 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.310
 we devote our minutes to 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.780
 learning the troll 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.130
 with the stop distinguishes so really 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.930
 something very interesting for 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.370
 anyone who wants to practice their 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.480
 friends in their servers so I hope 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.080
 see that a lot in the servers 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.580
 French 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.470
 the prince very inexpensive in resources 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.489
 really interesting because the noise 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.040
 is very strange 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.989
 annoying metange at the same time it attracts 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.700
 curiosity and you see that it takes 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.980
 really no place so it can be 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.810
 hidden everywhere for all those who have 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.310
 not seen the last episode of the minute 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.750
 minecraft went to see him he's very 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.880
 interesting it's like in super 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.799
 position objects in a frame 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.150
 so without using interesting and for 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.980
 all those who want to have more 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.750
 information about a farm that can 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.880
 to give food to the infinite 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.959
 way seems symptomatic and well then 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.250

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.299
 and for those who want to have the 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.860
 construction and who want 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.940
 news moment well I had 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.950
 some problems at the level of 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.690
 multiplayer there is something to fix 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.610
