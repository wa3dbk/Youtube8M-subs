here<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.960> actually<00:00:22.109> has<00:00:22.439> embossing<00:00:23.310> see<00:00:24.150> if

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
here that actually has embossing see if

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.990 
here that actually has embossing see if
you<00:00:24.300> can<00:00:24.480> see<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.960> draw<00:00:25.199> embossing<00:00:25.730> back<00:00:26.730> here

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
an inch wide it's just beautiful and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.779 
an inch wide it's just beautiful and
it's<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.840> perfect<00:00:58.199> size<00:00:58.350> for<00:00:58.379> cards<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.309> it

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
it's a perfect size for cards and it

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.009 
it's a perfect size for cards and it
would<00:00:59.879> also<00:01:00.000> work<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.500> layouts<00:01:01.500> as<00:01:01.739> well<00:01:03.019> so

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
would also work on layouts as well so

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.980 
would also work on layouts as well so
that's<00:01:04.619> how<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.010> card<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.880> put<00:01:06.479> together<00:01:06.630> but

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
that's how the card is put together but

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.990 
that's how the card is put together but
I<00:01:07.020> wanted<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.380> share<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.850> technique<00:01:08.850> with

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
I wanted to share this technique with

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.830 
I wanted to share this technique with
you<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.270> used<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.080> top<00:01:10.409> these<00:01:11.280> are<00:01:11.840> two

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
you that I used on the top these are two

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.399 
you that I used on the top these are two
separate<00:01:13.439> memory<00:01:14.340> box<00:01:15.110> stamps<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.229> let<00:01:16.320> me

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
separate memory box stamps and let me

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.870 
separate memory box stamps and let me
show<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.619> what<00:01:16.830> those<00:01:16.979> stamps<00:01:17.189> look<00:01:17.490> look

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
show you what those stamps look look

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.810 
show you what those stamps look look
like<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.360> here's<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.049> first<00:01:19.350> one<00:01:19.790> which<00:01:20.790> is

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
like so here's the first one which is

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.590 
like so here's the first one which is
this<00:01:21.360> red<00:01:21.780> flower<00:01:22.140> stem<00:01:23.009> right<00:01:23.250> here<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.820> then

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
this red flower stem right here and then

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.740 
this red flower stem right here and then
the<00:01:24.780> background<00:01:25.380> stamp<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.750> script

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
the background stamp is this script

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.950 
the background stamp is this script
stamp<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.259> says<00:01:28.320> journey<00:01:29.509> now<00:01:30.509> one<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.810> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
stamp that says journey now one of the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.020 
stamp that says journey now one of the
new<00:01:31.259> things<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.619> memory<00:01:32.070> box<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.460> doing<00:01:32.820> is

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
new things that memory box is doing is

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.149 
new things that memory box is doing is
there<00:01:33.299> they<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:33.930> dyes<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.290> are<00:01:34.650> out<00:01:34.860> and

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
there they have dyes that are out and

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.359 
there they have dyes that are out and
this<00:01:35.250> particular<00:01:35.430> die<00:01:36.530> coordinates<00:01:37.530> with

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
this particular die coordinates with

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.219 
this particular die coordinates with
this<00:01:38.610> stamp<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:40.610> so<00:01:41.610> what<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.820> did<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.930> that

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
this stamp and so what I did so that

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.889 
this stamp and so what I did so that
what<00:01:43.920> they're<00:01:44.070> intended<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.939> how<00:01:45.689> they're

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
what they're intended to how they're

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.880 
what they're intended to how they're
intended<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.380> be<00:01:46.530> used<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:47.159> like<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:48.079> so<00:01:49.079> you

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
intended to be used is like this so you

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.590 
intended to be used is like this so you
basically<00:01:50.100> cut<00:01:50.729> out<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.970> piece<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.390> then<00:01:51.509> you

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
basically cut out the piece and then you

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.120 
basically cut out the piece and then you
stamp<00:01:51.899> on<00:01:52.049> top<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.439> then<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.619> use<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.920> as<00:01:53.009> an

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
stamp on top and then you use it as an

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.190 
stamp on top and then you use it as an
embellishment<00:01:53.520> on<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.939> card<00:01:54.240> or<00:01:54.509> layout<00:01:54.780> would

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
embellishment on a card or layout would

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.389 
embellishment on a card or layout would
have<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:56.479> but<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.509> thought<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.310> what<00:01:59.310> would

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
have you but I thought that what would

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.030 
have you but I thought that what would
be<00:01:59.490> fun<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.700> do<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.299> use<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.840> cut<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:01.829> out

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
be fun to do is to use this cut this out

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.760 
be fun to do is to use this cut this out
with<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> thin<00:02:02.670> piece<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.909> copy<00:02:03.869> paper<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.560> use

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
with a thin piece of copy paper and use

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.119 
with a thin piece of copy paper and use
it<00:02:04.950> as<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.100> mask<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:06.000> then<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:07.560> know<00:02:07.649> stamp<00:02:07.950> my

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
it as a mask and then you know stamp my

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.180 
it as a mask and then you know stamp my
background<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.970> then<00:02:09.270> stamp<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.470> actual

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
background and then stamp the actual

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.820 
background and then stamp the actual
image<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:12.360> that's<00:02:12.750> how<00:02:12.959> I<00:02:12.989> decided<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.620> use

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
image so that's how I decided to use

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.830 
image so that's how I decided to use
in<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.370> love<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.700> results<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.450> really<00:02:15.690> like

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
in it I love the results I really like

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.160 
in it I love the results I really like
the<00:02:15.990> way<00:02:16.020> that<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.440> came<00:02:16.800> out<00:02:17.010> so<00:02:18.140> before<00:02:19.140> I

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
the way that it came out so before I

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.840 
the way that it came out so before I
show<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.590> how<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.190> do<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.400> let<00:02:20.580> me<00:02:20.610> just

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
show you how to do it let me just

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.420 
show you how to do it let me just
mention<00:02:21.120> one<00:02:21.330> other<00:02:21.510> thing<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.260> did<00:02:22.950> end<00:02:23.250> up

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
mention one other thing I did end up

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.350 
mention one other thing I did end up
taking<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.300> red<00:02:25.170> rubber<00:02:25.380> off<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.820> this

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
taking the red rubber off of the this

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.180 
taking the red rubber off of the this
wood<00:02:27.630> block<00:02:27.960> because<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.500> wanted<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.890> be<00:02:29.100> able

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
wood block because I wanted to be able

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.870 
wood block because I wanted to be able
to<00:02:29.400> position<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:30.830> within<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.220> script

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
to position it within the the script

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.670 
to position it within the the script
here<00:02:33.240> so<00:02:34.760> it<00:02:35.760> came<00:02:36.030> off<00:02:36.240> very<00:02:36.420> easily<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.440> it

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
here so it came off very easily and it

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.400 
here so it came off very easily and it
has<00:02:37.890> like<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.220> low<00:02:38.550> feels<00:02:39.000> like<00:02:39.210> a<00:02:39.390> low<00:02:39.690> tack<00:02:40.050> and

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
has like a low feels like a low tack and

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.810 
has like a low feels like a low tack and
so<00:02:40.560> I've<00:02:40.740> been<00:02:40.890> able<00:02:41.010> just<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.340> put<00:02:41.520> it<00:02:41.610> on<00:02:41.700> my

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
so I've been able just to put it on my

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.720 
so I've been able just to put it on my
cling<00:02:42.120> mount<00:02:42.360> or<00:02:42.690> on<00:02:43.230> my<00:02:43.410> acrylic<00:02:44.040> blocks<00:02:44.310> and

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
cling mount or on my acrylic blocks and

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.960 
cling mount or on my acrylic blocks and
it's<00:02:44.910> working<00:02:45.210> perfectly<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.760> that's<00:02:47.760> what<00:02:47.940> I

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
it's working perfectly so that's what I

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.630 
it's working perfectly so that's what I
did<00:02:48.090> with<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:49.070> so<00:02:50.070> let<00:02:50.220> me<00:02:50.250> just<00:02:50.460> show<00:02:50.610> you

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
did with that so let me just show you

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.070 
did with that so let me just show you
real<00:02:50.790> quick<00:02:51.180> how<00:02:51.950> this<00:02:52.950> works<00:02:53.390> so<00:02:54.390> as<00:02:54.810> I

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
real quick how this works so as I

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.170 
real quick how this works so as I
mentioned<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.709> did<00:02:56.160> cut<00:02:56.550> out<00:02:57.290> that<00:02:58.400> died<00:02:59.400> with<00:02:59.910> a

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
mentioned I did cut out that died with a

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.560 
mentioned I did cut out that died with a
piece<00:03:00.420> of<00:03:01.220> thin<00:03:02.220> copier<00:03:02.670> paper<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.240> then<00:03:03.510> i

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
piece of thin copier paper and then i

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.550 
piece of thin copier paper and then i
used<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.890> zig<00:03:05.220> chu<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.760> glue<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:07.200> way<00:03:07.350> this

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
used the zig chu a glue the way this

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.699 
used the zig chu a glue the way this
works<00:03:07.770> is<00:03:08.070> once<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.610> apply<00:03:08.820> it<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:09.150> your<00:03:09.240> paper

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
works is once you apply it to your paper

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.770 
works is once you apply it to your paper
it<00:03:10.709> will<00:03:10.890> be<00:03:11.010> a<00:03:11.040> permanent<00:03:11.400> as<00:03:11.730> heat<00:03:12.060> adhesive

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
it will be a permanent as heat adhesive

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.080 
it will be a permanent as heat adhesive
as<00:03:13.050> long<00:03:13.320> as<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:13.680> stays<00:03:13.830> blue<00:03:14.310> but<00:03:14.640> once<00:03:14.850> it

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
as long as it stays blue but once it

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.270 
as long as it stays blue but once it
dries<00:03:15.810> clear<00:03:16.560> it's<00:03:16.940> a<00:03:18.140> removable<00:03:19.280> adhesive

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
dries clear it's a removable adhesive

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.009 
dries clear it's a removable adhesive
meaning<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:21.209> i<00:03:21.269> can<00:03:21.510> put<00:03:21.690> something<00:03:21.989> down

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
meaning that i can put something down

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.780 
meaning that i can put something down
take<00:03:22.560> it<00:03:22.650> off<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:22.800> move<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.250> around<00:03:23.340> and

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
take it off and move it around and

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.290 
take it off and move it around and
that's<00:03:24.480> that's<00:03:24.780> what<00:03:25.230> works<00:03:25.410> great<00:03:25.830> for

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
that's that's what works great for

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.930 
that's that's what works great for
masking<00:03:27.300> so<00:03:28.170> what<00:03:29.010> you<00:03:29.130> do<00:03:29.280> is<00:03:29.310> just<00:03:29.640> put<00:03:29.850> your

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
masking so what you do is just put your

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.979 
masking so what you do is just put your
mask<00:03:30.180> down<00:03:30.570> wherever<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.680> like<00:03:31.920> on<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.430> paper

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
mask down wherever you like on the paper

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.900 
mask down wherever you like on the paper
so<00:03:33.989> this<00:03:34.200> is<00:03:34.230> down<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:35.010> it's<00:03:35.160> got<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.519> sticky

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
so this is down and it's got the sticky

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.699 
so this is down and it's got the sticky
on<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.420> I<00:03:36.480> just<00:03:36.660> got<00:03:36.810> some<00:03:36.989> red<00:03:37.200> ink<00:03:37.470> but

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
on it and I just got some red ink but

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.490 
on it and I just got some red ink but
we'll<00:03:37.890> pretend<00:03:38.430> that<00:03:38.519> didn't<00:03:38.850> happen<00:03:39.500> my

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
we'll pretend that didn't happen my

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.120 
we'll pretend that didn't happen my
hands<00:03:40.860> are<00:03:40.980> still<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.190> little<00:03:41.400> inky<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:41.820> guess<00:03:42.090> so

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
hands are still a little inky I guess so

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.759 
hands are still a little inky I guess so
ok<00:03:44.130> so<00:03:44.190> that's<00:03:44.880> down<00:03:45.440> actually<00:03:46.440> let<00:03:46.620> me<00:03:46.650> just

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
ok so that's down actually let me just

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.780 
ok so that's down actually let me just
remove<00:03:47.370> that<00:03:47.400> real<00:03:48.030> quick<00:03:49.430> so<00:03:50.430> that<00:03:50.610> we<00:03:50.730> don't

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
remove that real quick so that we don't

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.550 
remove that real quick so that we don't
have<00:03:50.940> to<00:03:51.120> deal<00:03:51.300> with<00:03:51.450> that<00:03:51.510> red<00:03:51.989> ink<00:03:52.230> on<00:03:52.410> that

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
have to deal with that red ink on that

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.050 
have to deal with that red ink on that
paper<00:03:52.800> will<00:03:53.070> just<00:03:53.280> use<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.640> side<00:03:53.880> of<00:03:53.910> the

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
paper will just use the side of the

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.290 
paper will just use the side of the
paper<00:03:55.340> so<00:03:56.340> I'm<00:03:56.580> going<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:56.760> put<00:03:57.030> this<00:03:57.060> down<00:03:57.420> and

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
paper so I'm going to put this down and

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.800 
paper so I'm going to put this down and
then<00:04:00.300> I'm<00:04:00.540> going<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:00.870> ink<00:04:01.110> up<00:04:01.760> off<00:04:02.760> camera<00:04:03.330> I'm

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
then I'm going to ink up off camera I'm

with my black ink so now what this mask
will<00:04:10.739> do<00:04:11.010> is<00:04:11.459> it's<00:04:11.970> going<00:04:12.239> to<00:04:13.130> cover<00:04:14.130> this

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
will do is it's going to cover this

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.520 
will do is it's going to cover this
space<00:04:16.769> where<00:04:17.010> I'll<00:04:17.130> be<00:04:17.160> stamping<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.120> flower

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
space where I'll be stamping the flower

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.880 
space where I'll be stamping the flower
later<00:04:22.490> so<00:04:23.490> I'm<00:04:24.479> just<00:04:24.720> kind<00:04:25.260> of<00:04:25.380> peeking<00:04:25.650> over

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
later so I'm just kind of peeking over

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.260 
later so I'm just kind of peeking over
to<00:04:26.130> see<00:04:26.310> if<00:04:26.400> I<00:04:26.490> have<00:04:26.700> it

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
to see if I have it

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.360 
to see if I have it
in<00:04:27.389> about<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.110> right<00:04:28.289> position<00:04:28.860> that<00:04:29.009> I<00:04:29.039> want

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
in about the right position that I want

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.719 
in about the right position that I want
it<00:04:29.550> simple<00:04:30.360> like<00:04:30.449> all<00:04:30.660> the<00:04:30.780> flowers<00:04:32.270> covered

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
it simple like all the flowers covered

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.800 
it simple like all the flowers covered
okay<00:04:35.729> putting<00:04:36.629> it<00:04:36.780> down<00:04:38.210> keeping<00:04:39.210> it<00:04:39.449> nice

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
okay putting it down keeping it nice

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.879 
okay putting it down keeping it nice
even<00:04:40.409> pressure<00:04:44.360> so<00:04:45.360> that's<00:04:45.750> a<00:04:45.900> nice<00:04:46.050> stamp<00:04:46.470> so

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
even pressure so that's a nice stamp so

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.460 
even pressure so that's a nice stamp so
now<00:04:47.069> I'm<00:04:47.400> going<00:04:47.639> to<00:04:47.849> remove<00:04:48.330> the<00:04:48.599> mask<00:04:48.930> and

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
now I'm going to remove the mask and

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.040 
now I'm going to remove the mask and
that<00:04:50.280> will<00:04:50.460> leave<00:04:50.610> an<00:04:50.729> empty<00:04:50.909> space<00:04:51.389> for<00:04:51.690> us<00:04:51.840> to

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
that will leave an empty space for us to

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.879 
that will leave an empty space for us to
put<00:04:53.300> the<00:04:54.300> floral<00:04:54.750> stamp<00:04:55.080> in<00:04:55.409> a<00:04:55.530> different

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
put the floral stamp in a different

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.939 
put the floral stamp in a different
color<00:04:58.099> so<00:04:59.099> hopefully<00:04:59.550> you<00:04:59.639> can<00:04:59.819> see<00:05:00.120> that

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:00.949 
color so hopefully you can see that

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:03.890 
color so hopefully you can see that
empty<00:05:01.949> space<00:05:02.220> that's<00:05:02.490> left<00:05:02.819> now<00:05:03.060> this<00:05:03.509> one's<00:05:03.780> a

going<00:05:27.690> to<00:05:27.780> reposition<00:05:28.229> this<00:05:28.500> a<00:05:28.560> little<00:05:28.770> bit

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
going to reposition this a little bit

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:34.939 
going to reposition this a little bit
here<00:05:29.219> so<00:05:29.250> I<00:05:29.430> can<00:05:29.580> see<00:05:33.440> it's<00:05:34.440> really<00:05:34.740> good<00:05:34.919> to

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
here so I can see it's really good to

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:38.300 
here so I can see it's really good to
get<00:05:35.219> kind<00:05:35.580> of<00:05:36.440> putting<00:05:37.440> your<00:05:37.650> head<00:05:37.860> kind<00:05:38.250> of

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
get kind of putting your head kind of

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.999 
get kind of putting your head kind of
right<00:05:38.580> on<00:05:38.849> top<00:05:39.740> to<00:05:40.740> see<00:05:42.529> where<00:05:43.529> that<00:05:43.710> empty

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:44.009 
right on top to see where that empty

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.360 
right on top to see where that empty
space<00:05:44.279> is<00:05:44.610> and<00:05:45.529> that's<00:05:46.529> what<00:05:46.740> I'm<00:05:46.830> doing<00:05:46.860> right

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
space is and that's what I'm doing right

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.480 
space is and that's what I'm doing right
now

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.390 

and<00:05:52.610> if<00:05:53.569> all<00:05:53.780> goes<00:05:53.810> well<00:05:54.080> that<00:05:54.860> empty<00:05:55.190> space

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
and if all goes well that empty space

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.589 
and if all goes well that empty space
will<00:05:55.580> be<00:05:55.610> filled<00:05:55.849> in<00:05:56.030> and<00:05:56.590> all<00:05:57.590> went<00:05:57.830> well<00:05:57.979> so

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:58.599 
will be filled in and all went well so

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:02.650 
will be filled in and all went well so
that's<00:05:59.599> the<00:05:59.960> general<00:06:00.319> idea<00:06:01.060> really<00:06:02.060> fun<00:06:02.360> so<00:06:02.630> a

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
that's the general idea really fun so a

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.400 
that's the general idea really fun so a
lot<00:06:02.990> of<00:06:03.020> companies<00:06:03.560> are<00:06:03.949> now<00:06:04.190> making<00:06:04.610> these

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410 
lot of companies are now making these

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.870 
lot of companies are now making these
stamps<00:06:06.410> that<00:06:06.440> coordinate<00:06:07.069> with<00:06:07.220> dies<00:06:07.400> or<00:06:07.729> dies

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
stamps that coordinate with dies or dies

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.900 
stamps that coordinate with dies or dies
i<00:06:07.910> coordinate<00:06:08.479> with<00:06:08.660> stamps<00:06:09.370> and<00:06:10.370> you<00:06:10.669> don't

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
i coordinate with stamps and you don't

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.100 
i coordinate with stamps and you don't
have<00:06:11.240> to<00:06:11.389> use<00:06:11.599> them<00:06:11.900> as<00:06:12.199> their<00:06:12.560> intended<00:06:14.110> like

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
this which is to have a die-cut with a

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.700 
this which is to have a die-cut with a
stamp<00:06:18.020> on<00:06:18.169> it<00:06:18.349> you<00:06:18.530> can<00:06:18.710> use<00:06:18.979> them<00:06:19.220> as<00:06:19.250> mass<00:06:19.759> and

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
stamp on it you can use them as mass and

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.950 
stamp on it you can use them as mass and
create<00:06:21.710> fun<00:06:22.039> two-toned<00:06:22.759> stamped<00:06:23.330> projects

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960
