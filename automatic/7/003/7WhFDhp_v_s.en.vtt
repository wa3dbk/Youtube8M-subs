00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.830
 also for muscle 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.470
 not this good raval for feyenoord 50 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.340
 difficult he did that technically perfectly 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.340
 so a good attempt 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.120
 good after all 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.120
 switch 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.660
 belle chess 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.730

 shoots done benefits 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.240
 after all, that is two getting well on 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.550
 heathrow 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.890
 write what feyenoord call 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.510
 meter outside the 60 too hard 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.110

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.110
 work consultation 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:29.610
 what is it about him 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.620
 there will resolve as the ordinary 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.450
 this requires a good distraction though 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:40.890
 for the moment not a good shot of sentences and 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:42.450
 flattened through a decorate 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.180
 29th minute 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:50.250
 we call the wrist broken 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.190
 rules there are no feyenoord 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.190
 lead and I like 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.240
 the corner of clasie is course action 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.530
 good but finchel has completely lost one 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.220
 because here 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.220
 the lower 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.440
 promiss 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.580
 looking up for young orange just as sure 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.970
 sangha together 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.970
 rosales 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.200
 well that's the theme of the 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.910
 come out of it as a certain by title 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.910
 first time the 20 and by book 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.890
 in the end it seems like this chance 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.180
 promiss 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.720
 back is arosa 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.340
 and then below 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.620
 and then the third 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.870
 that man becomes so many cameras 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.450
 in the end on what i just don't here and 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.140
 have serious hitting right posts 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.140
 maybe touch now 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.780
 well done for Castaignos rosales 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.040
 sit here before dawn mulder hits 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.879
 the ball on the post 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.879
 Hadith always overview 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.950
 just seriously slide the man then quietly 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.950
 within 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.939
 the free that should have been a bit spicier 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.200
 performance 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:36.520
 well he does a lot 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:40.090
 I had no kind 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.090
 to shop 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.530
 There's that ball coming through well for one 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.730
 then that is run off the ball and sets 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.730
 liesveld that is a penalty 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.690
 starting shot for twente 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.050
 and a red card for jordy vanelen 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.170
 things share here 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.850
 yes no eye for the ball so feyenoord 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.630
 with a man less 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:15.209
 and if the static remains calm over the 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:19.340
 two nights sometimes 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.340
 carice stay calm fuente lite 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.729
 rotators 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:39.020
 then the training for the free who has 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.910
 already yellow 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.910
 so are met by nine men 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:51.449
 nine men against eleven and another tackle 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.330
 from the free who just like in the gentleman himself 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.160
 nevertheless suggests that there is something too much 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.520
 instructions have been given 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.150
 two defenders less this week 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.150
 and a backlog 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:18.770
 another penalty yes the frieze 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.620
 also all of simplicity and this time the 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.479
 it is what it means to me very much 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.120
 math ice 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.340
 salon of heads to the purple of whom 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.500
 different to tadic 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.840
 math ice creams hanging in p 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.900
 first then very quiet again 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.729
 this for certainty as hard 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.220
 wilder chooses the right angle but have it there 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:43.130
 you don't care if you are as attacked as 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.590
 then such a paris sweet 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.900
 2 goals and an assist, that's how you make one 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.460
 return 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.620
 and what a fantastic audience it is 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.630
 also that it is in the shape of a lion 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:57.530
 can all yield this up to 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:59.690
 bad circumstances 318 twice 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.760
 less in the field that it is all possible 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.040
 to kill 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.510
 say that they were 12 to 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.660
 the 10 and half of them 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.660
 to be 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.130
 castaignos 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.680
 gets to castaignos back and he scores 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.680
 also 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.759
 of course that will not fail to happen 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.949
 make the winter weather with twice as much 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:25.199
 and he does not say that decorates him 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:27.620
 combination with who other than then such 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:27.620
 tadic 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.400
 lite off man 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:40.260
 well stop doing it anyway 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.490
 shameful defeat for feyenoord 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.670
 because there are defeat and there are 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.080
 defeats but this one 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.880
 of course big party for twente 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.080
 this one with four a feyenoord with 2 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:53.610
 times less goes off in the own tub and 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.560
 the public should be thankful for that 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.960
 it that has the legion to link TV 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.030
 think that Feyenoord concerns 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:04.670
 only positive 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.670
 loses punished here by 20 with 4d
