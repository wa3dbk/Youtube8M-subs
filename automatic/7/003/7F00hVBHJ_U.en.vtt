long journey can be combined that

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.949 
long journey can be combined that
there's<00:02:45.760> some<00:02:45.910> of<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.060> physical<00:02:46.420> aspects<00:02:46.870> of

there<00:04:40.880> and<00:04:41.390> of<00:04:41.510> course<00:04:41.660> we<00:04:41.840> try<00:04:42.200> and<00:04:42.320> take<00:04:42.410> care

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650

up<00:05:13.220> at<00:05:13.340> rover<00:05:13.610> with<00:05:13.730> the<00:05:13.820> Land<00:05:14.000> Rover<00:05:14.120> guys<00:05:14.420> too

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
up at rover with the Land Rover guys too

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.720 
up at rover with the Land Rover guys too
and<00:05:14.720> and<00:05:15.080> all<00:05:15.590> we're<00:05:15.770> always<00:05:15.890> in<00:05:16.100> contact<00:05:16.490> but

and and all we're always in contact but

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.280 
and and all we're always in contact but
not<00:05:16.910> the<00:05:17.090> kind<00:05:17.330> where<00:05:17.570> we<00:05:17.690> want<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:17.990> mix<00:05:18.170> and

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
not the kind where we want the mix and

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.320 
not the kind where we want the mix and
become<00:05:18.560> one<00:05:18.740> thing<00:05:18.980> it's<00:05:19.550> much<00:05:19.760> more<00:05:20.000> the<00:05:20.180> kind

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
become one thing it's much more the kind

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.150 
become one thing it's much more the kind
let's<00:05:20.540> be<00:05:20.660> careful<00:05:20.990> that<00:05:21.110> we<00:05:21.200> carve<00:05:21.440> out<00:05:21.590> the

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
let's be careful that we carve out the

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.980 
let's be careful that we carve out the
different<00:05:22.460> territories<00:05:22.640> so<00:05:23.480> for<00:05:23.690> instance

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
different territories so for instance

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.050 
different territories so for instance
the<00:05:24.169> sense<00:05:24.440> of<00:05:24.620> overly<00:05:25.130> rugged<00:05:25.520> is<00:05:25.669> overly

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
the sense of overly rugged is overly

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.000 
the sense of overly rugged is overly
truck<00:05:26.300> eNOS<00:05:26.630> that<00:05:27.140> of<00:05:27.320> course<00:05:27.500> we<00:05:27.680> leave<00:05:27.830> to

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
truck eNOS that of course we leave to

the<00:05:28.130> Land<00:05:28.430> Rover<00:05:28.610> guys<00:05:28.970> a<00:05:29.210> certain<00:05:29.840> sense<00:05:30.080> of

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
the Land Rover guys a certain sense of

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.400 
the Land Rover guys a certain sense of
on-road<00:05:30.830> just<00:05:31.669> super<00:05:32.330> capability<00:05:32.990> this<00:05:33.169> car

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
on-road just super capability this car

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:34.540 
on-road just super capability this car
was<00:05:33.560> developed<00:05:33.680> on<00:05:33.980> the<00:05:34.130> Nurburgring

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
was developed on the Nurburgring

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.860 
was developed on the Nurburgring
racetrack<00:05:35.030> and<00:05:35.210> everybody<00:05:35.540> knows<00:05:35.690> that's

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
racetrack and everybody knows that's

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.409 
racetrack and everybody knows that's
you're<00:05:36.050> gonna<00:05:36.140> do<00:05:36.290> racing<00:05:36.680> to<00:05:36.770> do<00:05:36.890> it<00:05:36.980> there

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
you're gonna do racing to do it there

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:40.810 
you're gonna do racing to do it there
that's<00:05:38.419> more<00:05:38.630> of<00:05:38.780> the<00:05:38.900> BMW<00:05:39.620> approach<00:05:39.919> so<00:05:40.520> the

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
that's more of the BMW approach so the

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.520 
that's more of the BMW approach so the
design<00:05:41.090> departments<00:05:41.660> talk<00:05:41.900> of<00:05:42.169> course<00:05:42.410> to

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
design departments talk of course to

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.960 
design departments talk of course to
make<00:05:42.650> sure<00:05:42.770> we<00:05:42.860> don't<00:05:43.040> wind<00:05:43.610> up<00:05:43.730> in<00:05:43.880> each

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
make sure we don't wind up in each

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.210 
make sure we don't wind up in each
other's<00:05:44.210> soup<00:05:44.410> so<00:05:45.410> this<00:05:45.530> is<00:05:45.650> a<00:05:45.680> car<00:05:45.919> that<00:05:45.950> we

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
other's soup so this is a car that we

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.010 
other's soup so this is a car that we
could<00:05:46.430> take<00:05:46.640> on<00:05:46.850> a<00:05:46.880> race<00:05:47.090> track<00:05:47.330> if<00:05:47.600> we<00:05:47.720> wanted

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
could take on a race track if we wanted

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.850 
could take on a race track if we wanted
to<00:05:48.080> do

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
to do
