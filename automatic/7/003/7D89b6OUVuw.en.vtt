the wheel

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.640 
the wheel
misses<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.440> when<00:02:46.650> I'm<00:02:46.739> turning<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:52.470> turn

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
we'll see what kind of mileage we get

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.340 
we'll see what kind of mileage we get
out<00:03:20.129> of<00:03:20.250> her
