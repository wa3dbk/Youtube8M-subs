00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.100
 the sperm quality of Finnish men 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.990
 the autopsy scan and what the most average citizen of the world looks like 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.990
 the sowing flat 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.069
 ned 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:19.480
 the hague quality of finnish men around 9 10 years is the last ten 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.369
 fell considerably 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.509
 up to 227 million whip tails to 165 million 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.319
 it is a decline of almost 30 percent 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:32.879
 at the same time, the researchers see a significant increase in testicular cancer 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.450
 they themselves do not come with an explanation, perhaps we do have one 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.690
 In the last ten years, research has often been done into the use for mobile 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.270
 phones and the fertility of a man 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.340
 some investigations were alarming, others left no clear result 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.190
 see 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.670
 How does the 2005 research suggest that the cell phone is in 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.120
 it was not advisable to keep the pocket 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.420
 because of the steel curves of heat there they did not come out 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.130
 in finland 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.340
 the farm not the nokia it is made 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.000
 when determining a cause of death my body usually has to be 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.310
 cut open 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.710
 and one sometimes for relatives and people who for religious reasons oppose 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.400
 traditional autopsy are to trouble 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.720
 English scientists are therefore coming a new way to it 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.880
 autopsy report to perform the autopsy scan 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.980
 in the study one could scan the CT in 80 percent of the cases 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.780
 find out the cause of death 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.320
 the method is also much faster but not cheaper 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.170
 you throw a statement like a girl you've probably heard before 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.580
 You can tell by throwing a banner on it is from a woman or a man 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.980
 who threw the ball 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.620
 Scottish researchers film the men and women who are basketball players to each other 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.390
 and they showed those videos and 93 students 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.290
 they asked the students to pay for the gender and destination of the throwers 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.340
 such as sad or cheerful and it turned out the test subjects were better at it 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.160
 Determine the mood of being and or that of the moon or a woman on 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.900
 what does the most average citizen of the world look like 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.399
 it is a hallucinating 28-year-old 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.939
 National Geographic collected the statistics and images of the 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:15.509
 world population 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:19.869
 the world has around 7 billion faces starting as you understand the most 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:23.179
 Chinese were then a comma 31 billion 

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:25.350
 but or not too much on the face 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.190
 and in twenty years the average world citizen will look like in india 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.139
 and this was his fear for today tomorrow and his work again 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:36.139
 country to country
