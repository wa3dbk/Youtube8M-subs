00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:08.780 

here<00:00:01.650> are<00:00:01.920> two<00:00:02.460> of<00:00:02.820> my<00:00:04.400> recent<00:00:06.230> designs<00:00:07.790> they

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
here are two of my recent designs they

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.320 
here are two of my recent designs they
are<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.450> twist<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:09.990> one<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.550> twist<00:00:11.550> or<00:00:11.730> two

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.160 

they're<00:00:15.330> designed<00:00:15.870> in<00:00:16.020> SolidWorks<00:00:16.619> and

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
they're designed in SolidWorks and

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.609 
they're designed in SolidWorks and
printed<00:00:19.170> using<00:00:19.560> my<00:00:19.859> University's<00:00:21.320> 3d<00:00:22.320> printer

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
printed using my University's 3d printer

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.720 
printed using my University's 3d printer
and<00:00:22.939> then<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.090> made<00:00:24.390> molds<00:00:24.660> using<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.230> Luthor<00:00:25.730> 25

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
and then I made molds using a Luthor 25

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.630 
and then I made molds using a Luthor 25
and<00:00:27.050> cast<00:00:28.050> them<00:00:28.289> using<00:00:28.650> smooth<00:00:28.949> cast<00:00:29.310> 300

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
and cast them using smooth cast 300

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:39.350 
and cast them using smooth cast 300
they're<00:00:32.640> both<00:00:33.320> based<00:00:34.320> around<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:35.100> 3<00:00:36.030> by<00:00:36.180> 3<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:38.360> the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
they're both based around a 3 by 3 I the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.010 
they're both based around a 3 by 3 I the
difference<00:00:39.809> between<00:00:40.170> them<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.860> in

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
difference between them is that in

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.479 
difference between them is that in
twister<00:00:43.020> one<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.710> three<00:00:43.950> by<00:00:44.070> three<00:00:44.340> is

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
twister one the three by three is

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.380 
twister one the three by three is
oriented<00:00:46.280> like<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:49.190> whereas<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.120> twist

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
oriented like this whereas in the twist

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.990 
oriented like this whereas in the twist
or<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.469> three<00:00:52.710> by<00:00:52.860> three<00:00:53.129> yet<00:00:53.820> can

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
or to the three by three yet can

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.910 
or to the three by three yet can
actually<00:00:54.420> see<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.660> shadow<00:00:55.050> through<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
actually see the shadow through the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.189 
actually see the shadow through the
white<00:00:56.100> sticker<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:57.420> three<00:00:57.629> by<00:00:57.780> three<00:00:57.989> is

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
white sticker the three by three is

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:07.070 
white sticker the three by three is
oriented<00:00:58.770> I<00:01:01.969> as<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.210> said<00:01:04.129> but<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.810> but<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> two

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
oriented I as I said but I but the two

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.550 
oriented I as I said but I but the two
puzzles<00:01:07.520> look<00:01:08.520> quite<00:01:08.939> different<00:01:09.409> when<00:01:10.409> you

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
puzzles look quite different when you

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.510 
puzzles look quite different when you
look<00:01:10.770> at<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:12.570> same<00:01:13.409> size<00:01:14.810> they<00:01:15.810> came<00:01:16.320> out<00:01:16.520> very

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
look at the same size they came out very

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.990 
look at the same size they came out very
well<00:01:19.310> probably<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.400> hardest<00:01:20.729> part<00:01:20.970> about

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
well probably the hardest part about

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.810 
well probably the hardest part about
making<00:01:21.270> these<00:01:21.540> was<00:01:21.810> cutting<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> stickers<00:01:23.130> to

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
making these was cutting the stickers to

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.490 
making these was cutting the stickers to
exactly<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.390> right<00:01:24.509> size<00:01:24.810> because<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
exactly the right size because of the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.940 
exactly the right size because of the
curved<00:01:25.680> surface<00:01:28.280> but<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.600> managed<00:01:30.710> at<00:01:31.710> they

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
curved surface but I managed at they

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.410 
curved surface but I managed at they
shape-shift<00:01:32.310> quite<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> bit<00:01:35.390> and

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
shape-shift quite a bit and

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.390 
shape-shift quite a bit and
I<00:01:39.090> already<00:01:40.090> is<00:01:40.689> rather<00:01:41.439> jumbled<00:01:41.979> but<00:01:42.189> it<00:01:42.310> gets

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
I already is rather jumbled but it gets

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.740 
I already is rather jumbled but it gets
even<00:01:42.640> even<00:01:43.299> more<00:01:44.580> tears<00:01:45.630> twister<00:01:46.740> one

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
even even more tears twister one

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:56.070 
even even more tears twister one
scrambled

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.380 

the<00:01:57.080> one<00:01:58.150> difference<00:01:59.890> twist<00:02:00.890> with<00:02:01.100> two<00:02:01.520> solves

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
the one difference twist with two solves

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.800 
the one difference twist with two solves
exactly<00:02:03.200> like<00:02:03.470> a<00:02:03.500> Fisher<00:02:04.040> cube<00:02:04.310> because<00:02:04.810> the

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
exactly like a Fisher cube because the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.140 
exactly like a Fisher cube because the
center's<00:02:06.410> have<00:02:06.800> not<00:02:07.190> have<00:02:08.860> only<00:02:10.150> 360-degree

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
center's have not have only 360-degree

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.270 
center's have not have only 360-degree
symmetry<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:13.280> twister<00:02:13.700> won<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:15.080> the

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
symmetry the twister won the the

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.230 
symmetry the twister won the the
center's<00:02:16.280> have<00:02:16.959> 180<00:02:17.959> degree<00:02:18.380> symmetry<00:02:19.100> so<00:02:19.550> you

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
center's have 180 degree symmetry so you

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.610 
center's have 180 degree symmetry so you
don't<00:02:20.990> have<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:22.390> there<00:02:23.390> are<00:02:23.480> certain<00:02:23.750> steps

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
don't have to there are certain steps

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.850 
don't have to there are certain steps
that<00:02:25.100> might<00:02:25.280> turn<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.270> center<00:02:26.750> by<00:02:26.959> 180<00:02:27.470> degrees

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
that might turn a center by 180 degrees

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.620 
that might turn a center by 180 degrees
that<00:02:28.070> you<00:02:28.100> don't<00:02:28.340> have<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:28.670> worry<00:02:28.880> hey<00:02:29.300> that

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
that you don't have to worry hey that

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.180 
that you don't have to worry hey that
might<00:02:29.900> turn<00:02:30.110> it<00:02:30.260> 90<00:02:30.560> degrees<00:02:30.590> that<00:02:30.980> you<00:02:31.010> don't

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
might turn it 90 degrees that you don't

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.880 
might turn it 90 degrees that you don't
have<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.720> sorry<00:02:32.720> 180<00:02:33.200> degrees<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:33.680> you<00:02:33.739> don't

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
have to sorry 180 degrees that you don't

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.060 
have to sorry 180 degrees that you don't
have<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.100> worry<00:02:34.280> about<00:02:34.370> with<00:02:35.120> this<00:02:35.300> cube<00:02:36.080> that

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
have to worry about with this cube that

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.580 
have to worry about with this cube that
you<00:02:37.489> do<00:02:37.760> have<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.150> worry<00:02:38.330> about<00:02:38.480> with<00:02:39.110> this<00:02:39.350> one

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
you do have to worry about with this one

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.530 
you do have to worry about with this one
because<00:02:40.130> if<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:40.520> turn<00:02:40.670> with<00:02:40.850> this<00:02:40.970> 180

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
because if you turn with this 180

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.470 
because if you turn with this 180
degrees<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.170> colors<00:02:42.580> reverse<00:02:43.580> so<00:02:45.730> those<00:02:46.730> that

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
degrees the colors reverse so those that

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.060 
degrees the colors reverse so those that
is<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:48.010> twister<00:02:49.010> one<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:49.850> twister<00:02:50.239> to

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
is the twister one and the twister to

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.640 
is the twister one and the twister to
thank<00:02:52.070> you<00:02:52.190> for<00:02:52.340> watching
