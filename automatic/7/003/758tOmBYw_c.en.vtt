good<00:01:40.120> too<00:01:40.480> but<00:01:40.750> I<00:01:40.990> think<00:01:41.320> this<00:01:41.410> is<00:01:41.530> a<00:01:41.590> pretty

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
good too but I think this is a pretty

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.340 
good too but I think this is a pretty
good<00:01:42.010> match<00:01:42.190> for<00:01:42.430> this<00:01:42.550> one<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:43.780> looks<00:01:44.050> better

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
good match for this one it looks better

better<00:01:44.950> as<00:01:45.130> a<00:01:45.160> relative<00:01:45.670> term<00:01:45.970> I<00:01:46.390> still<00:01:46.750> don't

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
better as a relative term I still don't

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.780 
better as a relative term I still don't
think<00:01:47.170> this<00:01:47.470> looks<00:01:47.740> very<00:01:47.890> nice<00:01:48.250> I<00:01:48.490> won't<00:01:48.700> be

this would actually be my favorite of
the<00:04:45.690> bunch<00:04:46.100> so<00:04:47.100> next<00:04:47.280> to<00:04:47.460> Eugenie<00:04:47.820> i've

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
the bunch so next to Eugenie i've

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.540 
the bunch so next to Eugenie i've
swatched<00:04:48.300> CIN<00:04:48.690> CIN<00:04:49.530> as<00:04:49.650> a<00:04:49.680> browner<00:04:50.010> undertow

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
swatched CIN CIN as a browner undertow

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.280 
swatched CIN CIN as a browner undertow
the<00:04:50.700> new<00:04:50.820> gene<00:04:51.060> which<00:04:51.330> has<00:04:51.360> distinct<00:04:52.080> blue

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
the new gene which has distinct blue

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.409 
the new gene which has distinct blue
undertone<00:04:52.800> and<00:04:53.310> although<00:04:53.490> both<00:04:53.729> are<00:04:53.790> maps<00:04:54.180> I'd

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
undertone and although both are maps I'd

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.480 
undertone and although both are maps I'd
said<00:04:54.690> it's<00:04:54.810> in<00:04:54.990> is<00:04:55.110> a<00:04:55.169> little<00:04:55.320> flatter<00:04:55.650> still

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
said it's in is a little flatter still

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.190 
said it's in is a little flatter still
similar<00:04:56.760> though<00:04:57.150> and<00:04:57.720> if<00:04:57.810> you<00:04:57.870> want<00:04:58.050> something

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
similar though and if you want something

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.930 
similar though and if you want something
looks<00:04:58.500> a<00:04:58.560> bit<00:04:58.590> more<00:04:58.830> like<00:04:58.890> rajini<00:04:59.370> try

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
looks a bit more like rajini try

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.520 
looks a bit more like rajini try
blending<00:05:00.150> sin<00:05:00.570> with<00:05:00.750> a<00:05:00.780> bit<00:05:00.960> of<00:05:00.990> vino<00:05:01.350> lip

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
blending sin with a bit of vino lip

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:41.960 

I<00:05:39.680> think<00:05:40.680> this<00:05:40.770> collection<00:05:40.950> is<00:05:41.310> great<00:05:41.610> but<00:05:41.910> I

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
I think this collection is great but I

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.610 
I think this collection is great but I
mean<00:05:42.060> I<00:05:42.210> do<00:05:42.300> think<00:05:42.419> that<00:05:42.780> if<00:05:42.900> you<00:05:43.080> weren't<00:05:43.530> able

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
mean I do think that if you weren't able

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.350 
mean I do think that if you weren't able
to<00:05:43.770> get<00:05:43.979> these<00:05:44.130> colors<00:05:44.520> you<00:05:45.030> know<00:05:45.120> there<00:05:45.270> are<00:05:45.330> a

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
to get these colors you know there are a

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.080 
to get these colors you know there are a
lot<00:05:45.510> of<00:05:45.540> colors<00:05:45.960> that<00:05:45.990> are<00:05:46.290> similar<00:05:47.000> but<00:05:48.000> you

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
lot of colors that are similar but you

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.159 
lot of colors that are similar but you
know<00:05:48.180> overall<00:05:48.540> they're<00:05:48.720> really<00:05:48.930> good

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 
know overall they're really good

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:50.510 
know overall they're really good
lipsticks<00:05:49.590> I<00:05:49.680> would<00:05:49.800> say<00:05:49.919> the<00:05:50.100> four<00:05:50.280> that<00:05:50.400> I

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
lipsticks I would say the four that I

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.250 
lipsticks I would say the four that I
that<00:05:50.820> I<00:05:50.880> picked<00:05:51.120> up<00:05:51.240> you<00:05:51.540> know<00:05:51.630> good<00:05:51.810> texture

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
that I picked up you know good texture

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.560 
that I picked up you know good texture
the<00:05:52.880> margarita<00:05:53.880> it<00:05:54.060> can<00:05:54.180> be<00:05:54.270> a<00:05:54.300> little<00:05:54.389> bit

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
the margarita it can be a little bit

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.030 
the margarita it can be a little bit
iffy<00:05:54.840> but<00:05:54.990> I<00:05:55.020> think<00:05:55.290> you<00:05:55.500> know<00:05:55.560> all<00:05:55.710> lighter

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
iffy but I think you know all lighter

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.770 
iffy but I think you know all lighter
shades<00:05:56.400> of<00:05:56.639> that<00:05:56.880> are<00:05:56.970> matte<00:05:57.120> tend<00:05:57.419> to<00:05:57.510> be<00:05:57.630> like

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
shades of that are matte tend to be like

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.810 
shades of that are matte tend to be like
that<00:05:57.960> so<00:05:58.169> yeah<00:05:58.830> otherwise<00:05:59.100> I<00:05:59.220> think<00:05:59.280> this<00:05:59.669> may

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
that so yeah otherwise I think this may

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.850 
that so yeah otherwise I think this may
be<00:05:59.850> my<00:06:00.030> favorite<00:06:00.240> one<00:06:00.510> -<00:06:00.750> I<00:06:00.780> do<00:06:00.960> like<00:06:01.229> the<00:06:01.440> vivid

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
be my favorite one - I do like the vivid

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.350 
be my favorite one - I do like the vivid
coolness<00:06:02.490> that<00:06:02.520> you<00:06:02.760> see<00:06:02.910> coming<00:06:03.120> through

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
coolness that you see coming through

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.029 
coolness that you see coming through
from<00:06:03.570> it<00:06:03.780> like<00:06:04.440> it<00:06:04.590> actually<00:06:04.770> doesn't

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 
from it like it actually doesn't

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:06.650 
from it like it actually doesn't
necessarily<00:06:05.460> put<00:06:05.610> it<00:06:05.699> into<00:06:05.880> fall<00:06:06.120> category

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
necessarily put it into fall category

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.629 
necessarily put it into fall category
yeah<00:06:06.960> I<00:06:07.020> think<00:06:07.080> you<00:06:07.410> know<00:06:07.470> yeah<00:06:07.620> I<00:06:07.919> feel<00:06:08.490> yeah<00:06:08.610> I

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 
yeah I think you know yeah I feel yeah I

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.610 
yeah I think you know yeah I feel yeah I
probably<00:06:09.000> I<00:06:09.330> could<00:06:09.389> wear<00:06:09.600> this<00:06:09.750> on<00:06:10.110> like<00:06:10.350> a<00:06:10.410> hot

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.020 
probably I could wear this on like a hot
summer<00:06:10.919> night<00:06:11.070> in<00:06:11.100> August<00:06:11.310> or<00:06:11.669> anything<00:06:11.820> like

that yeah I could wear this for
year-round<00:06:14.490> I<00:06:14.789> think<00:06:15.030> yeah<00:06:15.389> yeah<00:06:16.229> so<00:06:16.500> overall

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740

I<00:06:16.830> really<00:06:17.039> enjoyed<00:06:17.430> this<00:06:17.550> collection<00:06:17.880> and

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
I really enjoyed this collection and

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.430 
I really enjoyed this collection and
like<00:06:18.360> my<00:06:18.510> sister<00:06:18.810> said<00:06:18.990> it's<00:06:19.139> well<00:06:19.289> that's

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
like my sister said it's well that's

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.770 
like my sister said it's well that's
super<00:06:19.800> quickly<00:06:20.039> which<00:06:20.970> is<00:06:21.090> unfortunate<00:06:21.630> but

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
super quickly which is unfortunate but

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:22.969 
super quickly which is unfortunate but
as<00:06:21.930> we've<00:06:22.139> mentioned<00:06:22.289> there<00:06:22.650> are<00:06:22.680> lots<00:06:22.860> of

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979 
as we've mentioned there are lots of

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:24.469 
as we've mentioned there are lots of
other<00:06:23.160> alternatives<00:06:23.820> that<00:06:23.970> are<00:06:24.060> very<00:06:24.240> similar

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
other alternatives that are very similar

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:25.969 
other alternatives that are very similar
if<00:06:24.750> you<00:06:24.870> weren't<00:06:25.080> able<00:06:25.169> to<00:06:25.320> grab<00:06:25.560> it<00:06:25.590> I<00:06:25.800> mean

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
if you weren't able to grab it I mean

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:27.500 
if you weren't able to grab it I mean
the<00:06:26.310> packaging<00:06:26.760> is<00:06:26.849> great<00:06:27.060> I<00:06:27.090> think<00:06:27.389> that's

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
the packaging is great I think that's

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.050 
the packaging is great I think that's
probably<00:06:27.720> why<00:06:28.020> it<00:06:28.080> sold<00:06:28.380> out<00:06:28.440> so<00:06:28.680> quickly<00:06:29.060> but

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
probably why it sold out so quickly but

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.279 
probably why it sold out so quickly but
yeah<00:06:30.210> I'm<00:06:30.270> not<00:06:30.450> too<00:06:30.570> worried<00:06:30.720> you<00:06:30.930> didn't<00:06:31.169> get

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:31.289 
yeah I'm not too worried you didn't get

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:32.779 
yeah I'm not too worried you didn't get
it<00:06:31.410> there<00:06:31.530> were<00:06:31.590> lots<00:06:31.770> of<00:06:31.860> alternatives<00:06:32.460> and

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:32.789 
it there were lots of alternatives and

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:36.560
