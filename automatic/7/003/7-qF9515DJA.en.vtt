00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.860 
do on the first time I saw that these
could<00:02:17.860> actually<00:02:18.100> open<00:02:18.400> was<00:02:19.060> actually<00:02:19.600> fill<00:02:19.780> it

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
could actually open was actually fill it

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.660 
could actually open was actually fill it
up<00:02:19.959> with<00:02:20.020> coke<00:02:20.410> but<00:02:20.709> I'm<00:02:20.890> not<00:02:21.280> going<00:02:21.490> to<00:02:21.550> do

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
up with coke but I'm not going to do

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.550 
up with coke but I'm not going to do
that<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:22.090> just<00:02:22.330> destroyed<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.810> product<00:02:23.350> and

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
that so just destroyed the product and

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.860 
that so just destroyed the product and
it<00:02:24.430> would<00:02:24.580> just<00:02:24.610> be<00:02:24.880> disgusting<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.600> clean

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
it would just be disgusting to clean

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.660 
it would just be disgusting to clean
because<00:02:26.140> they're<00:02:26.530> this<00:02:26.800> top<00:02:27.040> does<00:02:27.280> not<00:02:27.459> come

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
because they're this top does not come

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.870 
because they're this top does not come
off<00:02:27.700> so<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:29.050> even<00:02:29.709> if<00:02:29.950> I<00:02:30.040> want<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.430> take<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.640> off

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
off so and even if I want to take it off

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.930 
off so and even if I want to take it off
I'd<00:02:31.120> have<00:02:31.360> to<00:02:31.540> like<00:02:32.100> there's<00:02:33.100> not<00:02:33.250> even<00:02:33.280> screws

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
I'd have to like there's not even screws

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.910 
I'd have to like there's not even screws
it<00:02:34.209> looks<00:02:34.390> like<00:02:34.570> oh<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.870> right<00:02:35.020> there<00:02:35.170> well<00:02:35.680> it

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
it looks like oh the right there well it

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.020 
it looks like oh the right there well it
wouldn't<00:02:36.100> even<00:02:36.190> work<00:02:36.310> because<00:02:36.490> that<00:02:36.730> would

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
wouldn't even work because that would

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.460 
wouldn't even work because that would
take<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.330> trucks<00:02:37.570> off<00:02:37.810> so<00:02:38.050> the<00:02:38.140> same<00:02:38.350> is

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
take the trucks off so the same is

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.210 
take the trucks off so the same is
basically<00:02:38.920> just<00:02:38.950> molded<00:02:39.640> so<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.950> would<00:02:42.069> be<00:02:42.190> a

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
basically just molded so it would be a

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.979 
basically just molded so it would be a
pain<00:02:42.489> in<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.580> butt<00:02:42.760> so<00:02:43.150> don't<00:02:43.660> fill<00:02:43.840> it<00:02:43.930> up

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
pain in the butt so don't fill it up

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.710 
pain in the butt so don't fill it up
with<00:02:44.050> coke<00:02:44.350> if<00:02:44.530> you're<00:02:44.680> thinking<00:02:44.830> about<00:02:45.720> very

recommend buying a few of these if you
can<00:03:11.860> afford<00:03:11.950> it<00:03:12.310> i<00:03:12.519> think<00:03:12.850> that<00:03:13.150> since<00:03:13.780> well

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
can afford it i think that since well

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.530 
can afford it i think that since well
since<00:03:14.350> i'm<00:03:14.800> not<00:03:15.040> being<00:03:15.760> paid<00:03:16.030> a<00:03:16.090> ton<00:03:16.329> of<00:03:16.390> money

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
since i'm not being paid a ton of money

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.870 
since i'm not being paid a ton of money
recently<00:03:16.870> I<00:03:17.320> couldn't<00:03:18.100> really<00:03:18.250> afford<00:03:18.370> more

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
recently I couldn't really afford more

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.490
