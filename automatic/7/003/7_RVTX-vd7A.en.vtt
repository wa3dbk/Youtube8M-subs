00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.170
 cast to vertex for garden widget 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.610
 of the team manager has said 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.549
 to start I want to thank you for 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.289
 he reiter for his efforts in fanatic 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.619
 has been a crucial part of our 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:26.539
 back from season 2 and it may be 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.090
 very proud of what he has achieved and 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:32.440
 let's say grace meanwhile in the 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.209
 King tells you that he is very surprised with 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.240
 what has happened and is trying 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:39.159
 find words to describe it 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.829
 what is going through his mind but 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.479
 can barely say that his decision and that 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:45.549
 they must abide by the consequences 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.869
 but let's go right now the only thing he 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.149
 want right now is to find another 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.000
 kind of says it's free that if some 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.920
 team wants to sign him or if he has attack and 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.990
 I was expecting then to play again in some 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.420
 team soon and gives you the best 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.409
 luck to nature 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.810
 then we have in the statement of his 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.979
 team of his teammate sayana team and 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:12.340
 del jungle says that the reason behind 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.700
 a state is mostly its inactivity 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.800
 just thing in rne that says he was told 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.989
 when you try many times you will practice 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.989
 more like everything and the whole team was 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:26.739
 practicing butt in a while it happened 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.810
 of him and he is ignored so this was 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.489
 the last resource that they could apply and 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.170
 the truth is that they know you that 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.720
 I did not have many new feelings either 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.340
 by each other 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.200
