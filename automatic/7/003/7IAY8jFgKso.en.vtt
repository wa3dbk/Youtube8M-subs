producing these swimming movements and

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.820 
producing these swimming movements and
the<00:00:21.580> students<00:00:22.580> task<00:00:22.880> is<00:00:23.330> to<00:00:24.230> try<00:00:24.560> to<00:00:24.590> figure

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
the students task is to try to figure

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.529 
the students task is to try to figure
out<00:00:24.980> which<00:00:25.580> assume<00:00:25.910> these<00:00:26.000> neurons<00:00:26.330> are

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
out which assume these neurons are

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.960 
out which assume these neurons are
involved<00:00:26.840> in<00:00:26.900> swimming<00:00:27.170> and<00:00:27.529> then<00:00:28.460> to<00:00:28.730> figure

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
involved in swimming and then to figure

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.490 
involved in swimming and then to figure
out<00:00:29.090> how<00:00:29.240> those<00:00:29.359> neurons<00:00:29.630> are<00:00:30.109> interconnected

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
out how those neurons are interconnected

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.229 
out how those neurons are interconnected
and<00:00:30.949> how<00:00:31.099> they<00:00:31.250> produce<00:00:31.400> assuming<00:00:31.880> movements

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
and how they produce assuming movements

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.950 
and how they produce assuming movements
in<00:00:32.780> doing<00:00:33.170> this<00:00:33.379> they<00:00:33.980> are<00:00:34.960> essentially

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
in doing this they are essentially

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.020 
in doing this they are essentially
repeating<00:00:36.800> in<00:00:36.950> a<00:00:37.040> period<00:00:37.340> of<00:00:37.489> about<00:00:37.610> three

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
repeating in a period of about three

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.630 
repeating in a period of about three
weeks<00:00:38.570> of<00:00:38.690> lab<00:00:38.899> sessions<00:00:39.410> work<00:00:40.070> that<00:00:40.399> took

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
weeks of lab sessions work that took

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.119 
weeks of lab sessions work that took
about<00:00:40.850> 50<00:00:41.690> years<00:00:41.930> for<00:00:42.140> real<00:00:42.260> scientists<00:00:42.829> to<00:00:42.980> do

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
about 50 years for real scientists to do

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.130 
about 50 years for real scientists to do
but<00:00:43.579> because<00:00:43.820> they<00:00:44.660> had<00:00:44.840> none<00:00:44.989> of<00:00:45.079> the

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
but because they had none of the

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.630 
but because they had none of the
technical<00:00:45.440> problems<00:00:45.890> with<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:46.070> experiments

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
technical problems with the experiments

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.010 
technical problems with the experiments
and<00:00:46.850> none<00:00:46.969> of<00:00:47.000> the<00:00:47.149> technical<00:00:47.390> problems<00:00:47.840> of

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
and none of the technical problems of

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.630 
and none of the technical problems of
maintaining<00:00:48.500> animals<00:00:48.980> and<00:00:49.280> so<00:00:49.370> on<00:00:49.489> and<00:00:49.579> so

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
maintaining animals and so on and so

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.510 
maintaining animals and so on and so
forth<00:00:49.780> they<00:00:50.780> can<00:00:51.289> do<00:00:51.410> it<00:00:51.530> much<00:00:51.860> more<00:00:52.070> rapidly

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
forth they can do it much more rapidly

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.740 
forth they can do it much more rapidly
but<00:00:52.730> they<00:00:52.879> have<00:00:53.030> to<00:00:53.149> go<00:00:53.270> through<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.600> same

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
but they have to go through the same

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.150 
but they have to go through the same
thinking<00:00:54.170> processes<00:00:54.620> that<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.039> real

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
thinking processes that the real

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.330 
thinking processes that the real
scientists<00:00:55.640> did<00:00:55.820> there<00:00:56.629> are<00:00:56.750> in<00:00:56.780> fact<00:00:57.340> 26

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
scientists did there are in fact 26

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.819 
scientists did there are in fact 26
neurons<00:00:58.699> and<00:00:58.879> swim<00:00:59.030> me<00:00:59.260> eight<00:01:00.260> of<00:01:00.620> them<00:01:00.800> I

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
neurons and swim me eight of them I

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.150 
neurons and swim me eight of them I
believe<00:01:01.219> are<00:01:01.520> devoted<00:01:01.969> to<00:01:02.500> swimming<00:01:03.500> and<00:01:03.649> then

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
believe are devoted to swimming and then

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.529 
believe are devoted to swimming and then
there<00:01:04.309> are<00:01:04.339> a<00:01:04.399> bunch<00:01:04.610> of<00:01:04.699> dummy<00:01:04.940> neurons<00:01:05.360> that

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:05.539 
there are a bunch of dummy neurons that

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:07.450 
there are a bunch of dummy neurons that
just<00:01:05.780> kind<00:01:06.020> of<00:01:06.080> do<00:01:06.229> funny<00:01:06.500> things<00:01:06.590> that<00:01:07.190> have

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
just kind of do funny things that have

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.770 
just kind of do funny things that have
nothing<00:01:07.549> to<00:01:07.729> a<00:01:07.760> swimming<00:01:08.180> and<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:08.450> first

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
nothing to a swimming and the first

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.690 
nothing to a swimming and the first
thing<00:01:08.900> they<00:01:08.990> have<00:01:09.140> to<00:01:09.290> do<00:01:09.439> is<00:01:09.680> to<00:01:10.340> figure<00:01:10.580> out

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
thing they have to do is to figure out

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.859 
thing they have to do is to figure out
which<00:01:10.820> ones<00:01:11.030> are<00:01:11.150> the<00:01:11.210> dummies<00:01:11.540> and<00:01:11.750> which

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
which ones are the dummies and which

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.240 
which ones are the dummies and which
ones<00:01:12.049> are<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.229> real<00:01:12.380> ones<00:01:12.560> and<00:01:12.830> they<00:01:12.890> do<00:01:12.950> this

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
ones are the real ones and they do this

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.190 
ones are the real ones and they do this
basically<00:01:13.760> by<00:01:14.450> looking<00:01:14.780> to<00:01:14.810> see<00:01:15.049> which

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
basically by looking to see which

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.260 
basically by looking to see which
neurons<00:01:15.470> do<00:01:16.010> something<00:01:16.490> more<00:01:16.729> or<00:01:16.880> less<00:01:17.060> in

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
neurons do something more or less in

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.920 
neurons do something more or less in
sync<00:01:17.630> with<00:01:18.320> swimmies<00:01:18.970> movements<00:01:19.970> we<00:01:20.689> tell

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
sync with swimmies movements we tell

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.140 
sync with swimmies movements we tell
them<00:01:21.140> which<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.439> motor<00:01:21.590> neurons<00:01:21.920> are<00:01:22.130> so<00:01:22.909> that

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
them which the motor neurons are so that

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.300 
them which the motor neurons are so that
that<00:01:23.960> gives<00:01:24.110> them<00:01:24.320> a<00:01:24.380> start<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:25.070> then<00:01:25.220> they

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
that gives them a start and then they

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.140 
that gives them a start and then they
look<00:01:25.430> for<00:01:25.580> other<00:01:25.700> things<00:01:25.939> that<00:01:26.060> are

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
look for other things that are

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.310 
look for other things that are
correlated<00:01:26.600> with<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.720> activities<00:01:27.170> of<00:01:27.200> the

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
motor neurons if they were looking at

animals look the collector electrical
activity<00:01:35.000> of<00:01:35.030> them<00:01:35.180> looks<00:01:35.360> pretty<00:01:35.509> much<00:01:35.570> the

activity of them looks pretty much the

away<00:01:45.619> doing<00:01:46.610> so<00:01:46.790> they<00:01:47.030> feel<00:01:47.299> like<00:01:47.329> they've

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
away doing so they feel like they've

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.980 
away doing so they feel like they've
been<00:01:48.110> doing<00:01:48.320> a<00:01:48.380> real<00:01:48.500> experiment<00:01:49.030> most<00:01:50.030> lab

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
been doing a real experiment most lab

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.859 
been doing a real experiment most lab
exercises<00:01:51.649> are<00:01:52.220> pretty<00:01:52.520> cut-and-dried<00:01:53.360> and

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
exercises are pretty cut-and-dried and

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.510 
exercises are pretty cut-and-dried and
we<00:01:54.110> wanted<00:01:54.470> something<00:01:54.860> where<00:01:54.979> they<00:01:55.100> really

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
we wanted something where they really

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.880 
we wanted something where they really
have<00:01:55.670> to<00:01:55.790> solve<00:01:56.030> a<00:01:56.390> reasonably<00:01:57.140> hard<00:01:57.380> problem

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
have to solve a reasonably hard problem

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.950 
have to solve a reasonably hard problem
these<00:01:58.490> students<00:01:58.880> have<00:01:58.909> all<00:01:59.149> read<00:01:59.780> about

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
these students have all read about

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.200 
these students have all read about
rhythmic<00:02:00.710> motion<00:02:00.890> like<00:02:01.460> walking<00:02:01.969> swimming

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
rhythmic motion like walking swimming

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.420 
rhythmic motion like walking swimming
flying<00:02:02.600> in<00:02:02.840> their<00:02:03.500> various<00:02:03.799> neuroscience

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
flying in their various neuroscience

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.980 
flying in their various neuroscience
courses<00:02:04.850> and<00:02:05.090> so<00:02:05.210> they've<00:02:05.360> had<00:02:05.540> a<00:02:05.570> little<00:02:05.840> bit

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
courses and so they've had a little bit

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.990 
courses and so they've had a little bit
of<00:02:06.079> background<00:02:06.259> and<00:02:06.799> so<00:02:07.430> that<00:02:07.610> seemed<00:02:07.850> like<00:02:07.969> a

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
of background and so that seemed like a

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.319 
of background and so that seemed like a
good<00:02:08.179> problem<00:02:08.479> and<00:02:08.929> also<00:02:09.229> people<00:02:10.329> have

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:11.329 
good problem and also people have

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.449 
good problem and also people have
thought<00:02:11.780> about<00:02:12.080> how<00:02:12.680> those<00:02:12.950> movements<00:02:13.250> are

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
thought about how those movements are

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.460 
thought about how those movements are
produced<00:02:13.790> at<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.120> detailed<00:02:14.690> neural<00:02:15.050> level<00:02:15.349> a

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
produced at a detailed neural level a

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.990 
produced at a detailed neural level a
lot<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:15.890> worked<00:02:16.069> it<00:02:16.220> out<00:02:16.340> and

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
lot and worked it out and

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.670 
lot and worked it out and
so<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:17.270> was<00:02:17.390> a<00:02:17.420> good<00:02:17.600> we<00:02:18.080> knew<00:02:18.350> what<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.560> real

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
so it was a good we knew what the real

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.860 
so it was a good we knew what the real
answers<00:02:19.070> were<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:20.270> so<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:20.540> seemed<00:02:20.720> like<00:02:20.840> a

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
answers were and so it seemed like a

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.260 
answers were and so it seemed like a
good<00:02:21.080> problem<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:21.500> do<00:02:21.770> this<00:02:21.920> with<00:02:22.100> any<00:02:22.730> kind<00:02:23.120> of

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
good problem to do this with any kind of

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.290 
good problem to do this with any kind of
behavior<00:02:23.810> or<00:02:24.350> neural<00:02:24.650> activity<00:02:25.130> where<00:02:26.060> neuro

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
behavior or neural activity where neuro

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.630 
behavior or neural activity where neuro
scientists<00:02:26.870> have<00:02:27.050> an<00:02:27.200> idea<00:02:27.650> about<00:02:28.010> how<00:02:28.460> it

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
scientists have an idea about how it

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.920 
scientists have an idea about how it
might<00:02:28.850> be<00:02:29.090> done<00:02:29.300> whether<00:02:29.540> they're<00:02:29.750> right<00:02:29.870> or

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
might be done whether they're right or

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.440 
might be done whether they're right or
not<00:02:30.320> doesn't<00:02:30.560> really<00:02:30.650> matter<00:02:31.150> one<00:02:32.150> can

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
not doesn't really matter one can

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.140 
not doesn't really matter one can
program<00:02:32.810> computer<00:02:33.320> to<00:02:33.470> do<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:33.770> and<00:02:33.980> one<00:02:34.970> can

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
program computer to do it and one can

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.240 
program computer to do it and one can
there<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.540> then<00:02:35.900> create<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.290> virtual<00:02:36.800> animal

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
there and then create a virtual animal

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.949 
there and then create a virtual animal
that<00:02:37.370> does<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:37.730> that<00:02:37.910> way<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.420> one<00:02:38.660> can<00:02:38.810> then

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
that does it that way and one can then

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.660 
that does it that way and one can then
set<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.350> students<00:02:39.740> to<00:02:39.860> trying<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.430> figure<00:02:40.640> out

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
set the students to trying to figure out

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.490 
set the students to trying to figure out
how<00:02:40.880> that<00:02:40.910> animal<00:02:41.420> does<00:02:41.600> it<00:02:41.750> of<00:02:41.870> course<00:02:42.020> and<00:02:42.260> we

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
how that animal does it of course and we

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.140 
how that animal does it of course and we
know<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.740> answer<00:02:43.010> because<00:02:43.190> we<00:02:43.370> generated<00:02:44.090> it

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
know the answer because we generated it

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
know the answer because we generated it
so<00:02:44.270> there's<00:02:44.450> a<00:02:44.510> right<00:02:44.690> answer<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.050> a<00:02:45.140> wrong

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
so there's a right answer and a wrong

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.250 
so there's a right answer and a wrong
answer<00:02:45.500> but<00:02:45.980> they<00:02:46.070> can<00:02:46.220> also<00:02:46.310> do<00:02:46.730> is<00:02:47.020> they<00:02:48.020> can

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
answer but they can also do is they can

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260 
answer but they can also do is they can
compare<00:02:48.620> that<00:02:49.100> animal<00:02:49.640> that's<00:02:50.060> in<00:02:50.180> the

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
compare that animal that's in the

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.810 
compare that animal that's in the
computer<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:51.410> virtual<00:02:51.739> animal<00:02:52.070> with<00:02:52.459> what

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
computer the virtual animal with what

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.130 
computer the virtual animal with what
real<00:02:53.000> animals<00:02:53.360> do<00:02:53.480> so<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:53.750> can<00:02:53.989> for<00:02:54.110> example

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
real animals do so you can for example

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.110 
real animals do so you can for example
set<00:02:54.830> them<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.040> reading<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.489> literature<00:02:55.610> on

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
set them to reading the literature on

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.170 
set them to reading the literature on
how<00:02:56.390> real<00:02:56.959> animals<00:02:57.380> do<00:02:57.830> this<00:02:58.010> task<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.550> ask

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
how real animals do this task and ask

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.900 
how real animals do this task and ask
them<00:02:59.510> does<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.530> one<00:03:00.709> of<00:03:00.800> the<00:03:00.860> computer<00:03:01.220> is<00:03:01.430> it

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
them does the one of the computer is it

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.970 
them does the one of the computer is it
the<00:03:02.630> same<00:03:02.840> or<00:03:03.110> is<00:03:03.200> it<00:03:03.290> a<00:03:03.320> mutant<00:03:03.650> does<00:03:03.770> it<00:03:03.890> do

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
the same or is it a mutant does it do

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.350 
the same or is it a mutant does it do
things<00:03:04.160> in<00:03:04.610> a<00:03:04.700> different<00:03:04.790> way<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.209> that's

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
things in a different way and that's

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.729 
things in a different way and that's
another<00:03:05.540> that's<00:03:05.840> all<00:03:06.020> kinds<00:03:06.260> of<00:03:06.290> exercises

that<00:03:07.010> one<00:03:07.220> can<00:03:07.430> develop<00:03:08.120> using<00:03:08.420> these<00:03:08.480> virtual

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
that one can develop using these virtual

in three weeks it of course helps
swimming<00:03:16.760> only<00:03:17.000> has<00:03:17.120> 26<00:03:17.600> neurons<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.170> so<00:03:18.380> on

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
swimming only has 26 neurons and so on
