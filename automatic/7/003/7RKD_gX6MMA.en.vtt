have it on sex s22 of 15 matches so I

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.770 
have it on sex s22 of 15 matches so I
will<00:01:14.010> put<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.430> little<00:01:14.640> bit<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.000> coffee<00:01:15.240> inside

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
will put a little bit of coffee inside

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.550 
will put a little bit of coffee inside
so<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.799> have<00:01:17.250> no<00:01:17.430> cameraman<00:01:20.900> this<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.080> yoni<00:01:22.409> a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
so I have no cameraman this is yoni a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.310 
so I have no cameraman this is yoni a
coffee<00:01:22.860> from<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:25.549> like<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.729> very<00:01:26.759> much<00:01:27.000> but<00:01:27.450> it

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
coffee from I like it very much but it

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.120 
coffee from I like it very much but it
depends<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:28.890> air<00:01:29.070> pressure<00:01:30.710> quality<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.950> your

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
depends on air pressure quality of your

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:48.150 
depends on air pressure quality of your
water<00:01:32.369> which<00:01:33.360> coffee

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.790 

it's<00:01:49.160> very<00:01:49.370> important<00:01:49.880> that<00:01:50.180> you<00:01:50.480> grind<00:01:50.840> every

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
it's very important that you grind every

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.440 
it's very important that you grind every
coffee<00:01:52.520> fresh<00:01:53.770> so<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:55.310> first<00:01:55.580> thing<00:01:55.820> I<00:01:55.970> do<00:01:56.150> is

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
coffee fresh so the first thing I do is

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.980 
coffee fresh so the first thing I do is
I<00:01:56.750> will<00:01:57.080> heat<00:01:57.320> up<00:01:58.390> my<00:01:59.390> cup

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
I will heat up my cup

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.080 
I will heat up my cup
this<00:02:00.620> will<00:02:00.800> also<00:02:00.950> clean<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.550> machine<00:02:01.850> just

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
this will also clean the machine just

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:13.390 
this will also clean the machine just
this<00:02:02.660> is<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:02.960> lever<00:02:03.140> I<00:02:03.640> will<00:02:04.640> press<00:02:04.880> it<00:02:12.400> put

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
this is the lever I will press it put

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:22.030 
this is the lever I will press it put
this<00:02:13.550> away<00:02:17.050> empty<00:02:18.050> it<00:02:18.140> here<00:02:19.480> still<00:02:20.709> water<00:02:21.709> in

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
this away empty it here still water in

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:32.470 
this away empty it here still water in
and<00:02:27.610> now<00:02:28.610> we<00:02:28.670> will<00:02:29.320> fill<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:31.610> coffee<00:02:31.880> I<00:02:32.120> take

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
and now we will fill the coffee I take

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.100 
and now we will fill the coffee I take
two<00:02:32.780> flat<00:02:33.050> spoons<00:02:33.410> for<00:02:33.770> one<00:02:33.920> cut<00:02:37.600> don't<00:02:38.600> apply

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
two flat spoons for one cut don't apply

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:49.229 
two flat spoons for one cut don't apply
too<00:02:39.500> much<00:02:39.530> pressure<00:02:39.980> with<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.730> first<00:02:41.000> spoon

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:56.259 

so<00:02:52.060> see<00:02:53.590> we<00:02:54.590> have<00:02:54.739> about<00:02:54.950> this<00:02:55.250> way<00:02:55.489> I<00:02:55.670> never<00:02:56.060> do

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
so see we have about this way I never do

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.850 
so see we have about this way I never do
two<00:02:56.540> cuts<00:02:57.040> at<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.070> same<00:02:58.430> time<00:02:58.700> it<00:02:59.390> is

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
two cuts at the same time it is

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.259 
two cuts at the same time it is
theoretically<00:03:00.860> possible<00:03:01.040> but<00:03:01.489> it<00:03:01.940> doesn't

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
theoretically possible but it doesn't

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.690 
theoretically possible but it doesn't
taste<00:03:02.420> very<00:03:02.540> well<00:03:03.160> so<00:03:04.160> I<00:03:06.160> not<00:03:07.160> get<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.340> little

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
taste very well so I not get a little

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.100 
taste very well so I not get a little
bit<00:03:07.820> here<00:03:08.060> now<00:03:09.580> I<00:03:10.580> use<00:03:11.030> my<00:03:11.060> stomping<00:03:11.660> this<00:03:11.870> one

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
bit here now I use my stomping this one

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.070 
bit here now I use my stomping this one
is<00:03:12.430> custom-made<00:03:13.430> just<00:03:13.820> for<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:14.239> diameter<00:03:14.810> of

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
is custom-made just for the diameter of

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.930 
is custom-made just for the diameter of
this<00:03:15.860> thing<00:03:16.630> first<00:03:17.630> I<00:03:18.400> press<00:03:19.400> a<00:03:19.430> quite<00:03:19.700> like

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
this thing first I press a quite like

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.900 
this thing first I press a quite like
you<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:23.530> knock<00:03:24.530> a<00:03:24.560> little<00:03:24.890> bit<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.280> then<00:03:25.640> I

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
you and knock a little bit and then I

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.050 
you and knock a little bit and then I
use<00:03:26.900> about<00:03:27.049> 15<00:03:27.799> kilograms<00:03:28.400> of<00:03:28.610> pressure<00:03:28.910> I

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
use about 15 kilograms of pressure I

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:43.050 
use about 15 kilograms of pressure I
tested<00:03:29.540> it<00:03:29.630> on<00:03:29.930> a<00:03:30.410> scale<00:03:30.769> and<00:03:37.030> so<00:03:38.769> now<00:03:40.000> we<00:03:41.000> have

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
tested it on a scale and so now we have

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.830 
tested it on a scale and so now we have
nice<00:03:44.060> coffee<00:03:44.420> now

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
nice coffee now

00:03:45.840 --> 00:04:01.270 
nice coffee now
put<00:03:46.440> it<00:03:46.590> inside<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:52.130> I<00:03:53.900> use<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.140> lever<00:03:59.690> and

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
put it inside and I use the lever and

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.570 
put it inside and I use the lever and
after<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.370> hissing<00:04:02.670> stops<00:04:02.970> I<00:04:03.980> let<00:04:04.980> it<00:04:05.100> go<00:04:05.310> and

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
after the hissing stops I let it go and

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:28.010 
after the hissing stops I let it go and
the<00:04:05.880> coffee<00:04:06.090> flows<00:04:06.510> out

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:35.130 

so<00:04:29.520> now<00:04:31.830> we<00:04:32.830> have<00:04:32.950> a<00:04:32.980> nice<00:04:33.310> cup<00:04:34.240> of<00:04:34.270> coffee<00:04:34.600> to

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
so now we have a nice cup of coffee to
