00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 I will solve or is the preservation of the 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.770
 environment is related to the 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.320
 change of attitude of each person 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.320
 it really is an environment is an issue 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.910
 which requires a new citizen attitude towards 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.710
 certainty because it implies that 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.140
 call new governance governance 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.050
 innovative as it is you just so much more 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.539
 participatory democracy is direct democracy 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.449
 participation is empowerment is 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.680
 truth construct collective subjects 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.480
 deeply involve communities 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.399
 to build the feeling of 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.500
 belong because when you speak 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.230
 this workshop of the future 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.270
 Actually, what you're doing is doing 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.550
 with which each person passes a conduct 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.980
 more reactive to reach a position 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.280
 proactive is perfect and the person leaves the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.320
 claim that there is total inertia to 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.629
 the dream and the dream for what we go 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.789
 to do and there will fall the plug shakes the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.260
 things that only depend on the community 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.550
 others depends on the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.500
 prefecture of the state government of 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.170
 federal government of the binational 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.550
 other companies and other lines 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.739
 depends on changes including 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.979
 who knows in legislation 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.290
 but the meaning of this step is that 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.260
 when is it we are working out the plan 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.750
 work is evident. 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.360
 responsibility shared by another 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.340
 side that makes us who we are from there 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.430
 a time when all communities 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.320
 meet for a water pact is 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.990
 when in fact a history of 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.700
 all that has been discussed and the covenant is 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.340
 forbidden employee of the prefecture of 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.650
 participate in the ceremonies of the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.540
 rituals only with the local actors 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.090
 they wear the shirt with the microbasin 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.189
 in the chest has mystical mystical water 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.119
 from the fire the mystic of the mystic earth will donate 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.829
 the mystique of peace and is a great 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.899
 extraordinary fraternization I would say 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.710
 yes civic around what now we 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.049
 let's do it 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.750
 and then the actions begin, it is interesting that 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.280
 women in micro-settlements said in the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.200
 first microbasin looks here always has 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.450
 a custom has a good thing has to have 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.549
 cake party , there 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.270
 today we have everywhere two 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.610
 at least a micro-basin 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.819
 in the form of a cake because the last act 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.080
 the great moment of the wall of 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.550
 lamentations of hope 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.520
 me in front of the water park 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.860
 last until you share the cake and the actions 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.720
 begin collective and individual and there for 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.240
 example directly enters your 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.800
 putting what we have already achieved with 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.610
 for example in the recovery of 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.110
 microbasins 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.820
 we are with 510 kilometers of 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.750
 roads network almost as many roads 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:37.140
 are exclusive in Brazil according to 1080 km 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.810
 with small ciliary forest in small 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.600
 without a fight with a program without 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.800
 a claim without a lawsuit 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:50.310
 I'm talking about 1080 km of fence with 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.590
 and riparian forest and I say more in a 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.050
 region that 90% of properties have 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.820
 less than 50 hectares and has ten 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.920
 municipalities than the average of 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.750
 property is 15 hectares 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.940
 I had no quarrel with the little ones. 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.220
 producers is a new empire right 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.620
 it is the opposite in the first two 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.900
 microcatchments have returned 55 species 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.270
 flora and fauna , and today we have by 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.520
 example one with one of the 11 new 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.900
 small cooperatives that have emerged in 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.550
 a cooperative collection of producers 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.739
 honeymoon because he returned to bm where the 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.890
 forest was composed today we have 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.680
 14 products that are already produced 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.690
 from the honey of the bees including 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.420
 indigenous honey which is highly medicinal 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.480
 in a cooperative that has more than 200 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.459
 participants and retailing was once again a 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.320
 producer of honey but returned from the woods 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.900
 ciliary 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.940
 I just told myself that there is cultivation 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.980
 style of organic food farming 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.040
 which is now part of school meals 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.570
 in the region we go with 56% of the lunch 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.459
 school is in municipal schools and are 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.890
 107 thousand children living in school 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.390
 every day is fantastic with what 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.030
 happens in Brazil it points the potential 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.310
 that we have are more than 44 million 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.019
 children with school meals every day and 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.940
 and is now maintained with the 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.650
 president dilma and most others 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.660
 innovations that happen to have the 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.340
 direct purchase and being the organic product 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.810
 for the school lunch of origin of the 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.420
 family farming can still pay 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.739
 more than the average price of the square then 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.440
 I would rather put it on the school lunch 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.330
 is an extraordinary act in that it 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.750
 respect to care for the planet is a 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.520
 product 100 is contamination according to 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.949
 invest in health 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.750
 3rd moves the local economy the fourth 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:34.740
 facilitates and strengthens agriculture 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:38.310
 family run and 5th you have your good thing 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.050

 we are 19 opening the products 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.930
 organic 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.280
 we are experiencing a 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.940
 rich experience of eight small 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:51.180
 cooperatives of organic producers and 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.430
 23 producer associations in the project 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:05:01.349
 it's an awesome force, and we 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:05:03.900
 in this field of organic life 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:06.389
 right doctor a question that I do 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.880
 Mr. Itaipu is binational and the show is 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.770
 speaking of an experience so far of the 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.090
 of the cultivating good water that happens here 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.650
 in Brazil, right? 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.509
 but when planning was approved 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.699
 strategy was attended by the 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:20.280
 right margin of itaipu is one only 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:22.110
 relate to and the program so the 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.280
 program is actually called cultivating 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.500

 actions that are already happening in 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:34.680
 right side the paraguay and the thing 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.659
 the richest man who gave in last year 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.300
 for this year is that another area of ​​the 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:40.789
 in the Amazon region where it has

 a Brazilian and Argentine hydropower plant 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:48.029
 already in strong implantation occurred 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.310
 to impose it is to cultivate it in Guarani 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:52.319
