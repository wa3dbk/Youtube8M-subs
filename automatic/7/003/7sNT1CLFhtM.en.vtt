there's<00:00:29.269> actually<00:00:30.269> there's<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.539> quote<00:00:30.840> by

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
there's actually there's a quote by

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:36.979 
there's actually there's a quote by
Tarkovsky<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:33.140> you<00:00:34.140> probably<00:00:34.410> know<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:35.989> I

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
Tarkovsky that you probably know it I I

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.290 
Tarkovsky that you probably know it I I
kind<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.469> do<00:00:37.620> know<00:00:37.800> i<00:00:38.040> read<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.760> i<00:00:38.940> couldn't

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
kind of do know i read that i couldn't

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.150 
kind of do know i read that i couldn't
repeat<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.780> okay<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.340> deal<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.610> that

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
repeat it okay and so the deal is that

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.400 
repeat it okay and so the deal is that
art<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.489> representation<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.510> life<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:47.360> so

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
art is a representation of life and so

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.069 
art is a representation of life and so
different<00:00:49.410> than<00:00:49.530> life<00:00:49.710> life<00:00:50.070> contains<00:00:50.520> death

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
different than life life contains death

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.770 
different than life life contains death
but<00:00:52.079> art<00:00:52.379> doesn't<00:00:52.800> because<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.489> not<00:00:53.780> life

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
but art doesn't because it's not life

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.319 
but art doesn't because it's not life
it's<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.199> representation<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:56.039> life<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:57.059> if<00:00:57.210> it

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
it's a representation of life so if it

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.150 
it's a representation of life so if it
doesn't<00:00:57.719> contain<00:00:58.050> death<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.649> denial<00:00:58.980> of

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
doesn't contain death it's a denial of

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.790 
doesn't contain death it's a denial of
death<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.640> that's<00:00:59.760> why<00:01:00.030> if<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:01.050> say<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.469> it's

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
death and that's why if we say it's it's

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.470 
death and that's why if we say it's it's
an<00:01:01.980> affirmation<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.670> life<00:01:02.730> no<00:01:03.120> matter<00:01:03.300> how

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
an affirmation of life no matter how

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.670 
an affirmation of life no matter how
tragic<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.199> character<00:01:04.680> may<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:06.680> intar

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
tragic the character may be so intar

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.980 
tragic the character may be so intar
Cosby's<00:01:08.130> quote<00:01:08.460> basically<00:01:09.030> he<00:01:09.150> says<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.900> they

other<00:02:21.100> place<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:21.760> think<00:02:22.000> that<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.930> is

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
other place and I think that that is

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.370 
other place and I think that that is
something<00:02:25.060> that<00:02:25.209> I<00:02:25.300> might<00:02:25.510> not<00:02:25.690> know<00:02:26.230> the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
something that I might not know the

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.770 
something that I might not know the
answer<00:02:26.800> to<00:02:26.980> but<00:02:27.250> this<00:02:27.370> film<00:02:27.730> is<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:27.970> mass<00:02:28.270> media
