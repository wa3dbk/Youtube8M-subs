00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:07.340 

so<00:00:03.149> to<00:00:03.929> convert<00:00:04.170> a<00:00:05.210> hexadecimal<00:00:06.210> number<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:07.319> a

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
so to convert a hexadecimal number to a

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.410 
so to convert a hexadecimal number to a
binary<00:00:09.019> you<00:00:10.019> have<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.469> take<00:00:11.040> each<00:00:11.370> one<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:12.210> the

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
binary you have to take each one of the

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.570 
binary you have to take each one of the
hexadecimal<00:00:13.340> numbers<00:00:14.960> in<00:00:16.010> this<00:00:17.010> case<00:00:17.279> let's

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
hexadecimal numbers in this case let's

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.220 
hexadecimal numbers in this case let's
say<00:00:17.670> we<00:00:17.820> have<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:17.970> number<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.600> 2<00:00:18.660> e<00:00:19.170> 3<00:00:19.260> F<00:00:21.199> so<00:00:22.199> for

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
say we have a number a 2 e 3 F so for

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.080 
say we have a number a 2 e 3 F so for
each<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:22.980> those<00:00:23.279> numbers

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
each of those numbers

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.040 
each of those numbers
you're<00:00:24.390> gonna<00:00:24.630> write<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.289> number<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.920> binary

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
you're gonna write that number in binary

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.620 
you're gonna write that number in binary
using<00:00:28.050> 4<00:00:28.590> bits<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.730> reason<00:00:30.090> for<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.300> is

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
using 4 bits and the reason for that is

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.620 
using 4 bits and the reason for that is
that<00:00:31.099> the<00:00:32.099> reason<00:00:32.369> for<00:00:32.489> why<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.790> use<00:00:33.120> 4<00:00:33.390> bits

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
that the reason for why you use 4 bits

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.360 
that the reason for why you use 4 bits
and<00:00:33.899> not<00:00:34.050> 5<00:00:34.380> or<00:00:34.410> less<00:00:35.450> more<00:00:36.450> or<00:00:36.630> less<00:00:37.370> is

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
and not 5 or less more or less is

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.180 
and not 5 or less more or less is
because<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.090> binary<00:00:39.540> system<00:00:39.809> goes<00:00:40.350> from<00:00:40.649> 0<00:00:41.040> to

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
because the binary system goes from 0 to

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.270 
because the binary system goes from 0 to
F<00:00:44.190> which<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.210> decimal<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.750> from<00:00:45.989> 0<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.440> 15<00:00:47.039> and

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
F which in decimal is from 0 to 15 and

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.939 
F which in decimal is from 0 to 15 and
to<00:00:47.789> do<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.360> binary<00:00:50.539> to<00:00:51.539> represent<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.440> 15

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
to do that in binary to represent a 15

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:02.689 
to do that in binary to represent a 15
in<00:00:53.160> binary<00:00:56.719> that<00:00:57.719> would<00:00:57.960> be<00:00:59.870> four<00:01:00.870> ones<00:01:01.640> so<00:01:02.640> to

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
in binary that would be four ones so to

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.509 
in binary that would be four ones so to
cover<00:01:03.449> all<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.229> numbers<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.220> hexadecimal

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
cover all the numbers in hexadecimal

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.490 
cover all the numbers in hexadecimal
using<00:01:06.299> binary<00:01:06.540> we<00:01:07.049> need<00:01:07.200> 4<00:01:07.530> bits<00:01:09.229> so<00:01:10.229> that's

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
using binary we need 4 bits so that's

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.770 
using binary we need 4 bits so that's
why<00:01:10.680> each<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.070> these<00:01:13.100> hexadecimal<00:01:14.100> numbers

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
why each of these hexadecimal numbers

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.310 
why each of these hexadecimal numbers
needs<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:16.110> be<00:01:16.290> represented<00:01:16.740> using<00:01:17.250> 4<00:01:17.850> bits<00:01:18.320> so

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
needs to be represented using 4 bits so

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.560 
needs to be represented using 4 bits so
let's<00:01:19.740> start<00:01:20.009> off<00:01:20.130> with<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.640> F<00:01:21.570> letter<00:01:23.030> F<00:01:24.030> is

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
let's start off with the F letter F is

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:37.100 
let's start off with the F letter F is
15<00:01:27.080> 15<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.560> binary<00:01:29.119> is<00:01:30.350> 1<00:01:31.350> 1<00:01:31.740> 1<00:01:32.310> 1<00:01:35.659> now<00:01:36.659> let's<00:01:36.930> do

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
15 15 in binary is 1 1 1 1 now let's do

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:46.069 
15 15 in binary is 1 1 1 1 now let's do
3<00:01:39.259> 3<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.409> binary<00:01:41.780> it<00:01:42.950> is<00:01:43.950> 1<00:01:44.310> 1<00:01:44.570> but<00:01:45.570> we<00:01:45.659> need<00:01:45.810> 4

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
3 3 in binary it is 1 1 but we need 4

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:52.840 
3 3 in binary it is 1 1 but we need 4
bits<00:01:48.829> so<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.159> our<00:01:50.340> number<00:01:50.729> 3<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.119> binary<00:01:51.360> e

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
bits so this is our number 3 in binary e

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:04.779 
bits so this is our number 3 in binary e
is<00:01:53.850> 14<00:01:55.969> 14<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.390> binary<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:58.590> 0<00:01:59.149> 1<00:02:00.149> 1<00:02:00.180> 1

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:26.089 

-<00:02:05.789> binary<00:02:06.890> is<00:02:07.890> 0-1<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:20.630> is<00:02:21.630> 10<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:24.680> 10<00:02:25.680> in<00:02:25.890> binary

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
- binary is 0-1 a is 10 and 10 in binary

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:35.540 
- binary is 0-1 a is 10 and 10 in binary
is<00:02:27.319> so<00:02:28.319> we<00:02:28.650> have<00:02:28.680> this<00:02:29.069> for<00:02:29.340> F<00:02:34.130> we<00:02:35.130> have<00:02:35.310> this

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
is so we have this for F we have this

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:51.890 
is so we have this for F we have this
for<00:02:35.880> 3<00:02:39.980> this<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.220> e2<00:02:48.380> and<00:02:49.380> a
