deep inside the skull it's planted in
and<00:00:39.090> held<00:00:39.360> fast<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.469> it's<00:00:40.710> able<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.579> take

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
and held fast so that it's able to take

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.459 
and held fast so that it's able to take
the<00:00:42.030> enormous<00:00:42.450> torque<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:43.260> will<00:00:43.379> be

the enormous torque that will be

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.220 
the enormous torque that will be
produced<00:00:44.010> by<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.610> animal<00:00:45.149> biting<00:00:45.809> down<00:00:45.960> and

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
produced by the animal biting down and

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.350 
produced by the animal biting down and
then<00:00:46.320> pulling<00:00:46.680> back<00:00:46.860> if<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.670> had<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.820> smaller

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
then pulling back if it had a smaller

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.389 
then pulling back if it had a smaller
structure<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.350> these<00:00:49.649> teeth<00:00:49.950> would<00:00:50.160> end<00:00:50.309> up

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
structure to it these teeth would end up

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.369 
structure to it these teeth would end up
breaking<00:00:50.610> off<00:00:51.000> but<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.660> what<00:00:51.899> holds<00:00:52.140> it

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
breaking off but this is what holds it

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.080 
breaking off but this is what holds it
into<00:00:52.530> place<00:00:54.440> out<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.739> wild<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.520> bonding
