00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.930 

here<00:00:49.190> we<00:00:49.280> start<00:00:49.490> with<00:00:49.520> a<00:00:49.670> minor

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
here we start with a minor

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.790 
here we start with a minor
we're<00:00:52.629> really<00:00:52.780> pinching<00:00:53.230> the<00:00:53.320> a<00:00:53.350> and<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:53.769> B

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
we're really pinching the a and the B

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.299 
we're really pinching the a and the B
string<00:00:54.340> to<00:00:54.370> start<00:00:54.760> with<00:00:55.829> then<00:00:56.829> I<00:00:56.949> pluck<00:00:57.190> the

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
string to start with then I pluck the

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:58.770 
string to start with then I pluck the
strings<00:00:57.640> the<00:00:57.969> other<00:00:58.089> strings<00:00:58.449> in<00:00:58.629> different

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
strings the other strings in different

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.910 
strings the other strings in different
ways<00:00:59.109> but<00:00:59.410> I<00:00:59.469> start<00:00:59.920> that<00:01:00.070> a<00:01:00.250> minor<00:01:01.860> then<00:01:02.860> I

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
ways but I start that a minor then I

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.649 
ways but I start that a minor then I
climb<00:01:03.280> up<00:01:03.309> to<00:01:03.670> a<00:01:03.699> C<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:05.170> can<00:01:05.320> climb<00:01:05.560> up<00:01:05.619> open<00:01:06.659> to

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
climb up to a C you can climb up open to

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.010 
climb up to a C you can climb up open to
second<00:01:08.170> third<00:01:08.920> or<00:01:09.729> just<00:01:10.360> from<00:01:10.540> second<00:01:10.990> to

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
second third or just from second to

you can add a pinky on the the first
string<00:01:23.840> third<00:01:24.109> fret<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:24.950> we<00:01:25.130> have

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.270

gee<00:01:53.479> is<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.689> twice<00:01:55.020> in<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.380> verse<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.920> then

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
gee is that twice in the verse and then

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.190 
gee is that twice in the verse and then
the<00:01:56.310> last<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:56.820> it's<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.150> quick<00:01:57.450> change<00:01:57.720> from<00:01:58.020> a

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
the last one it's a quick change from a

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.420 
the last one it's a quick change from a
minor<00:01:58.549> to<00:01:59.549> C<00:02:00.049> G

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
minor to C G

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.949 
minor to C G
hang<00:02:03.060> onto<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.450> G

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:10.570 

think<00:02:08.959> another<00:02:09.170> verse<00:02:09.470> happens<00:02:09.979> and<00:02:10.310> then<00:02:10.429> we

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
think another verse happens and then we

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.059 
think another verse happens and then we
go<00:02:10.789> I<00:02:11.150> guess<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.599> bridge<00:02:11.989> here<00:02:12.769> we<00:02:12.890> have<00:02:13.040> a

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069

go I guess to the bridge here we have a
G

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.650

is lonely and two and three and four is
together<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:29.990> just<00:02:30.990> hang<00:02:31.200> on<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.440> G<00:02:31.620> chord

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
together and just hang on to the G chord

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.080 
together and just hang on to the G chord
there<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.370> could<00:02:32.520> pick<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:32.820> in<00:02:32.910> different

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
there and you could pick it in different

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.780 
there and you could pick it in different
ways<00:02:33.450> what<00:02:34.170> I<00:02:34.200> do<00:02:34.350> is<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.710> pinch<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.250> E<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.430> the

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
ways what I do is I pinch the E and the

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.930 
ways what I do is I pinch the E and the
B<00:02:35.820> string<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:37.620> hammer<00:02:37.920> on<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.340> first<00:02:38.610> fret

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
B string and I hammer on the first fret

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.280 
B string and I hammer on the first fret
of<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:40.200> second<00:02:40.650> string<00:02:44.960> and<00:02:45.960> that's<00:02:46.050> how<00:02:46.230> I

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
of the second string and that's how I

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
of the second string and that's how I
would<00:02:46.380> pick<00:02:46.770> that<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.970> bridge<00:02:48.709> and<00:02:49.709> then<00:02:50.010> we

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
would pick that that bridge and then we

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.670 
would pick that that bridge and then we
we<00:02:50.880> finish<00:02:51.270> off<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.720> bridge<00:02:52.020> or<00:02:52.320> maybe<00:02:52.530> it's

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
we finish off that bridge or maybe it's

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.380 
we finish off that bridge or maybe it's
the<00:02:52.770> chorus<00:02:53.100> I<00:02:53.220> guess<00:02:53.430> by<00:02:53.990> going<00:02:54.990> for<00:02:55.110> an<00:02:55.200> F<00:02:56.390> you

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
the chorus I guess by going for an F you

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.420 
the chorus I guess by going for an F you
don't<00:02:57.570> need<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.720> pinky<00:02:58.020> there<00:02:59.390> see

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
don't need the pinky there see

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.500 
don't need the pinky there see
