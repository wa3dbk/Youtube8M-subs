00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
something that I don't like but at the

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.839 
something that I don't like but at the
same<00:02:18.750> time<00:02:19.019> it's<00:02:19.379> at<00:02:19.680> our<00:02:19.709> KD<00:02:20.129> style<00:02:20.549> of<00:02:20.670> game

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
same time it's at our KD style of game

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.130 
same time it's at our KD style of game
so<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.120> get<00:02:21.299> to<00:02:21.360> choose<00:02:21.390> between<00:02:21.540> throwing<00:02:21.989> in

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
so you get to choose between throwing in

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.280 
so you get to choose between throwing in
the<00:02:22.230> 1st<00:02:22.470> 2nd<00:02:22.920> 3rd<00:02:23.040> or<00:02:23.700> home<00:02:24.269> when<00:02:25.049> there's<00:02:25.230> a

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
the 1st 2nd 3rd or home when there's a

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.410 
the 1st 2nd 3rd or home when there's a
lazy<00:02:25.590> flyball<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.519> outfielder<00:02:27.000> basically

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
lazy flyball to the outfielder basically

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.820 
lazy flyball to the outfielder basically
when<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.569> movie<00:02:27.870> guy<00:02:28.019> in<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.260> position<00:02:28.650> now<00:02:28.769> the

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
when a movie guy in the position now the

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.640 
when a movie guy in the position now the
little<00:02:29.519> circle<00:02:30.060> will<00:02:30.239> start<00:02:30.870> off<00:02:30.989> really<00:02:31.409> big

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
little circle will start off really big

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.559 
little circle will start off really big
and<00:02:31.890> then<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.489> will<00:02:32.610> get<00:02:32.760> smaller<00:02:33.030> now<00:02:33.540> I

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
and then it will get smaller now I

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.390 
and then it will get smaller now I
actually<00:02:33.959> had<00:02:34.319> a<00:02:34.349> couple<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.829> problems<00:02:35.069> with

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
actually had a couple of problems with

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.850 
actually had a couple of problems with
this<00:02:35.549> system<00:02:35.909> it<00:02:36.480> seemed<00:02:36.900> like<00:02:37.079> on<00:02:37.260> occasion

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
this system it seemed like on occasion

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.140 
this system it seemed like on occasion
seemed<00:02:38.099> like<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.340> would<00:02:38.459> get<00:02:38.579> in<00:02:38.670> position<00:02:39.030> but

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
seemed like I would get in position but

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.780 
seemed like I would get in position but
the<00:02:39.269> ball<00:02:39.569> would<00:02:39.780> go<00:02:40.019> way<00:02:40.650> over<00:02:41.159> my<00:02:41.340> head<00:02:41.610> and

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
the ball would go way over my head and

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.390 
the ball would go way over my head and
what<00:02:42.480> should<00:02:43.049> have<00:02:43.170> been<00:02:43.200> an<00:02:43.530> easy<00:02:43.680> fly<00:02:44.069> ball

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
what should have been an easy fly ball

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.539 
what should have been an easy fly ball
for<00:02:45.060> an<00:02:45.180> out<00:02:45.299> turned<00:02:45.660> into<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.989> double<00:02:46.829> or<00:02:47.010> it

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
for an out turned into a double or it

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.970 
for an out turned into a double or it
was<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.760> very<00:02:48.480> fast<00:02:49.019> line<00:02:49.530> drive<00:02:49.799> to<00:02:49.829> the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
was a very fast line drive to the

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
have been able to go down and get it but

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.849 
have been able to go down and get it but

there's<00:03:13.709> no<00:03:13.859> leadoff<00:03:14.220> system<00:03:14.609> in<00:03:14.700> this<00:03:14.849> you

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
there's no leadoff system in this you

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.030 
there's no leadoff system in this you
can<00:03:15.209> pick<00:03:15.540> off<00:03:15.720> if<00:03:15.959> you're<00:03:16.079> the<00:03:16.170> pitcher<00:03:16.500> but

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
can pick off if you're the pitcher but

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.099 
can pick off if you're the pitcher but
again<00:03:17.340> it's<00:03:17.730> pretty<00:03:18.030> pretty<00:03:18.299> easy<00:03:18.569> now<00:03:18.870> let's

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
again it's pretty pretty easy now let's

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:20.420 
again it's pretty pretty easy now let's
talk<00:03:19.230> about<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.590> homerun<00:03:20.010> balls

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
talk about the homerun balls

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.460 
talk about the homerun balls
now<00:03:20.730> these<00:03:20.849> homerun<00:03:21.239> balls<00:03:21.450> I<00:03:21.630> actually<00:03:21.810> like

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
now these homerun balls I actually like

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.860 
now these homerun balls I actually like
the<00:03:23.010> homerun<00:03:23.430> animation<00:03:24.150> after<00:03:24.299> everything

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
the homerun animation after everything

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.360 
the homerun animation after everything
now<00:03:25.019> you'd<00:03:25.200> think<00:03:25.230> that<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:25.769> will<00:03:25.889> get<00:03:26.010> stale

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
now you'd think that it will get stale

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.640 
now you'd think that it will get stale
after<00:03:26.849> a<00:03:26.880> while<00:03:27.060> it<00:03:27.329> may<00:03:27.930> still<00:03:28.260> get<00:03:28.410> stale

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
after a while it may still get stale

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.229 
after a while it may still get stale
I've<00:03:28.859> only<00:03:29.040> played<00:03:29.280> this<00:03:29.459> game<00:03:29.669> since<00:03:29.910> it<00:03:30.060> came

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
I've only played this game since it came

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.319

I've<00:03:33.690> played<00:03:33.930> this<00:03:34.049> game<00:03:34.549> a<00:03:35.599> lot<00:03:36.599> compact

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
I've played this game a lot compact

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.589 
I've played this game a lot compact
laughs<00:03:37.950> played<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.280> lot<00:03:38.519> and<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:39.209> homerun

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
laughs played a lot and the homerun

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.869 
laughs played a lot and the homerun
animations<00:03:40.260> have<00:03:40.470> not<00:03:40.709> gotten<00:03:40.980> stale<00:03:41.280> one

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
animations have not gotten stale one

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.670 
animations have not gotten stale one
thing<00:03:42.060> I<00:03:42.120> like<00:03:42.329> is<00:03:42.510> when<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.989> hit<00:03:43.199> a<00:03:43.260> ball<00:03:43.500> you

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
thing I like is when you hit a ball you

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.170 
thing I like is when you hit a ball you
don't<00:03:43.919> know<00:03:44.280> if<00:03:44.459> it's<00:03:44.609> gonna<00:03:44.730> be<00:03:44.910> a<00:03:44.940> home<00:03:45.150> run

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
don't know if it's gonna be a home run

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.689 
don't know if it's gonna be a home run
it<00:03:45.510> could<00:03:45.660> this<00:03:45.750> be<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.930> deep<00:03:46.260> fly<00:03:46.530> ball<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:47.069> the

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:47.699 
it could this be a deep fly ball to the

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:49.909 
it could this be a deep fly ball to the
outfielder<00:03:48.239> and<00:03:48.389> it's<00:03:48.540> off<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.840> fence<00:03:49.079> or<00:03:49.470> it

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
outfielder and it's off the fence or it

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:51.710 
outfielder and it's off the fence or it
could<00:03:50.069> just<00:03:50.099> keep<00:03:50.400> going<00:03:50.879> and<00:03:51.060> going<00:03:51.569> and

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
could just keep going and going and

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.720 
could just keep going and going and
going<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:52.290> absolutely<00:03:52.620> love<00:03:52.980> that<00:03:53.129> aspect<00:03:53.430> of
