00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.090
 Just one month after Connecticut shot Newtown n_r_a_ 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.180
 Which has been blamed 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.489
 Released movies and video games shooting game of AB 

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:15.619
 With the goals target some people describing as coffins 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.470
 Other people describing these are not goals by the way they are on 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.789
 On the screen people here describe other goals as uh ... 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.310
 Raw representation of the human body with red 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.009
 Bull eye-hearted where it will be 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.190
 This is the height of hypocrisy in this and this is even more so because it is rich 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.740
 And n_r_a_ did well, in addition to blaming the violent films of gun violence 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.560
 Instead of reaching the gods 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.430
 Uh ... After they did the Hollywood guns holds glorification 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.530
 Firearms in films 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.660
 Then after she said that video games are the problem 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.130
 They do this uh ... for AP video games with the aim is to shoot people 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.570
 99 cents Ladies and Gentlemen You can upgrade your two gun on the return 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.540
 And join it and Koo 11 sniper rifle for ninety cents nine Louis and others 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.740
 Call to everyone but no choice and guess I am this is 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.450
 The freedom of choice is that n_r_a_ 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.620
 What you said before uh ... Jim Burke says n_r_a_ trade for automakers 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.860
 And it's their jobs 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.570
 Make people look all the other way 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.250
 In themselves I think there are two levels here 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.770
 One single there is some this this level of sensitivity here where n_r_a_ this is on 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.600
 They go out and claim they feel bad about what happened in 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.480
 Newtown but at the same time release this 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.210
 Then another layer is that hypocrisy is just because it conflicts with 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.710
 What they say if movies and video games are causing the problem is that 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.130
 Now we have n_r_a_ on the registry as part of the shutdown problem 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.310
 Game shooting as well as guns glorify in this Hollywood Guns Show 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.920
 This is on any we can so alleviate anyway I'm missing anything either 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.100
 Nothing else to explore 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.320
 Uh ... and date something time part you want to weigh in this analysis on 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.250
 Yes I do not know I mean my opinion of this whole situation with n_r_a_ 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.430
 What we say in our councils is that 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.780
 This is they do not even represent not represent 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.139
 From its members I mean the representative of the gun lobby 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:13.919
 Where 74 percent of the money comes from 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:17.669
 And mom ... to keep doing these delicate things in 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:19.340
 Most times are not sensitive 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.780
 It is kind of proof that 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.189
 Did not matter 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:25.729
 What happens in the gap continues to say the same thing 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.949
 The other thing is that Lewis also when thinking 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:32.049
 People also say n_r_a_ look must do something right because they are 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.349
 Like members gained a quarter million since the firing of Connecticut Newtown 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.589
 I do not think this is because there is any Bolivia to that group based on any issue 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:45.609
 Is going to get to know that members of the issue and out there now are there 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.589
 More than a quarter of a million people will before words 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:52.340
 A non-member view of n_r_a_ 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.330
 And now they are quite completely non-members of the rate and n_r_a_ and again because it is 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.660
 The group does not issue there only 250,000 oh ... these two 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.450
 A hundred thousand people who decided to become members do not think we can 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.300
 And actually refers to the fact that they have been gaining the cause of group members when 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.119
 The issue is in the news as evidence of anything 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:12.910
 It is right to say that 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.480
 They must be on the right side of the case the right side of the case 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.379
 They get all these numbers 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:23.749
 It does not even mean just that uh ... maybe they have a clever way with words wah ... I am 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:27.309
 I do not think they are ads recruiting negative people whose cause is in 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:31.249
 The news says when people tell you but all I care about is what topic 

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:34.880
 Organization casual and it n_r_a_ if you mainly 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.330
 Uh ... if you are in favor of people with guns and so on and so on 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.980
 And what you would think he saw you in n_r_a_ with her but looking to send 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:41.999
 Different messages 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:44.659
 On the 19th night in Oh when you go to n_r_a_ site that never has her 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:45.959
 It was you 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.419
 It's probably all stuff 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.310
 People who love the second amendment are people who believe that Americans 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.189
 Special guns and people who do not own our guns and want to hear up automatically 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:58.219
 Uh ... 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:01.499
 The arrest resonates with them pressure but you know it too 

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:05.409
 A different message from the sentences a lot of media no doubt about it 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:05.659
 distance
