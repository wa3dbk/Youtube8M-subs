torch<00:03:12.530> again<00:03:12.830> and<00:03:13.070> basically<00:03:13.760> from<00:03:13.970> right

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
torch again and basically from right

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.570 
torch again and basically from right
here<00:03:14.390> so<00:03:15.670> with<00:03:16.670> this<00:03:17.050> this<00:03:18.100> this<00:03:19.100> first<00:03:19.340> one

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
here so with this this this first one

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.260 
here so with this this this first one
counts<00:03:20.030> as<00:03:21.280> this<00:03:22.280> first<00:03:22.520> repeater<00:03:22.940> on<00:03:23.000> four

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
counts as this first repeater on four

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.020 
counts as this first repeater on four
take<00:03:23.420> delight<00:03:23.690> Kenta<00:03:24.140> is<00:03:24.200> to<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:25.280> cost<00:03:25.550> of<00:03:25.760> two

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
take delight Kenta is to the cost of two

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.440 
take delight Kenta is to the cost of two
like<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.750> put<00:03:26.959> in<00:03:27.110> so<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:28.610> cost<00:03:28.880> of<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.150> item

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
like the put in so the cost of the item

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.210 
like the put in so the cost of the item
you<00:03:29.600> want<00:03:29.750> to<00:03:29.930> shoot<00:03:30.140> out<00:03:30.350> basically

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
you want to shoot out basically

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.140 
you want to shoot out basically
so<00:03:31.930> for<00:03:32.930> ticks<00:03:33.200> that's<00:03:33.739> two<00:03:34.160> on<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.790> first<00:03:34.910> one

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
so for ticks that's two on the first one

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.940 
so for ticks that's two on the first one
so<00:03:35.420> with<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:35.959> first<00:03:36.110> Peter<00:03:36.470> if<00:03:36.620> it's<00:03:36.739> on<00:03:36.830> two

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
so with the first Peter if it's on two

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.270 
so with the first Peter if it's on two
ticks<00:03:37.220> that's<00:03:37.459> worth<00:03:37.670> one<00:03:37.970> uh<00:03:39.040> four<00:03:40.040> takes

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
ticks that's worth one uh four takes

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.920 
ticks that's worth one uh four takes
that's<00:03:40.580> worth<00:03:40.790> to<00:03:41.090> add<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:42.290> to<00:03:43.160> add<00:03:43.310> another<00:03:44.770> a

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
that's worth to add and to add another a

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.440 
that's worth to add and to add another a
plus<00:03:47.930> one<00:03:48.260> amount<00:03:48.560> cost<00:03:48.950> just<00:03:49.910> add<00:03:50.060> another

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
plus one amount cost just add another

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.080 
plus one amount cost just add another
four<00:03:50.720> tick<00:03:50.870> delay<00:03:50.989> repeater<00:03:51.470> and<00:03:52.090> just

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
four tick delay repeater and just

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.240 
four tick delay repeater and just
connect<00:03:53.450> it<00:03:53.570> to<00:03:53.750> this<00:03:53.900> torch<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:54.680> make<00:03:55.100> sure

wanted the cost of the item to be five I

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.340 
wanted the cost of the item to be five I
had<00:05:48.240> to<00:05:48.450> do<00:05:48.630> is<00:05:49.070> basically<00:05:50.070> put<00:05:50.370> all<00:05:51.169> just<00:05:52.169> put

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
had to do is basically put all just put

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.920 
had to do is basically put all just put
fourteen<00:05:52.740> there<00:05:52.919> and<00:05:53.190> just<00:05:54.120> one<00:05:54.419> run<00:05:54.600> flush<00:05:54.810> in

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
fourteen there and just one run flush in

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.680 
fourteen there and just one run flush in
each<00:05:55.050> one<00:05:55.230> so<00:05:55.740> basically<00:05:56.030> this<00:05:57.030> has<00:05:57.300> to<00:05:57.510> add<00:05:57.540> up

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
each one so basically this has to add up

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.040 
each one so basically this has to add up
to<00:05:58.520> this<00:05:59.520> has<00:05:59.760> added<00:05:59.970> up<00:06:00.180> to<00:06:00.360> 19<00:06:00.690> right<00:06:00.810> here

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
to this has added up to 19 right here

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.250 
to this has added up to 19 right here
and<00:06:01.260> these<00:06:01.880> just<00:06:02.880> stay<00:06:03.300> like<00:06:03.450> that<00:06:03.660> so<00:06:04.050> that's

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
and these just stay like that so that's

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.620 
and these just stay like that so that's
four<00:06:04.710> plus<00:06:05.010> nineteen<00:06:06.080> that<00:06:07.080> equals<00:06:07.860> 23<00:06:08.550> so<00:06:08.850> 23

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
four plus nineteen that equals 23 so 23

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.420 
four plus nineteen that equals 23 so 23
items<00:06:09.780> gives<00:06:10.320> a<00:06:10.500> redstone<00:06:12.980> length<00:06:13.980> of<00:06:14.190> two

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
items gives a redstone length of two

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.240 
items gives a redstone length of two
from<00:06:14.940> a<00:06:14.970> comparator<00:06:15.510> from<00:06:15.780> hop<00:06:16.050> so<00:06:16.620> if<00:06:16.919> I<00:06:17.040> put

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
from a comparator from hop so if I put

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.950 
from a comparator from hop so if I put
that<00:06:17.280> it'll<00:06:18.000> be<00:06:18.150> original

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
that it'll be original

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.980 
that it'll be original
-<00:06:19.289> and<00:06:19.590> as<00:06:19.919> you<00:06:20.069> see<00:06:20.280> those<00:06:20.750> torches<00:06:21.750> just

- and as you see those torches just

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.249 
- and as you see those torches just
flickered<00:06:22.319> along<00:06:22.770> with<00:06:22.949> that<00:06:23.100> red<00:06:23.310> zone<00:06:23.340> so

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:24.259
