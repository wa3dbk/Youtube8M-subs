my initial thought was oh I'll apply the
cultures<00:00:41.010> topically<00:00:41.550> maybe<00:00:41.760> that'll<00:00:42.030> help<00:00:42.149> to

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
cultures topically maybe that'll help to

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.020 
cultures topically maybe that'll help to
get<00:00:42.629> rid<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.899> some<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.170> itch

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.109 
unfortunately it did not work to

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:50.209 
unfortunately it did not work to
alleviate<00:00:46.319> those<00:00:46.710> specific<00:00:47.399> symptoms<00:00:48.859> so<00:00:49.859> got

alleviate those specific symptoms so got

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.979 
alleviate those specific symptoms so got
over<00:00:50.429> the<00:00:50.519> poison<00:00:50.850> oak<00:00:50.999> went<00:00:51.390> on<00:00:51.510> about<00:00:51.839> my

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.080 
because I hadn't been hiking recently so
I<00:01:25.439> knew<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.740> wasn't<00:01:25.920> through<00:01:26.520> incidental

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
I knew it wasn't through incidental

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.249 
I knew it wasn't through incidental
contact<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.250> and<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.689> would<00:01:30.899> happen

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
contact and and this this would happen

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.920 
contact and and this this would happen
so<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.530> happened<00:01:32.000> of<00:01:33.000> course<00:01:33.060> I'm<00:01:33.359> I<00:01:33.630> wasn't

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930

and<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.829> would<00:01:37.950> go<00:01:38.100> away<00:01:38.189> then<00:01:39.119> I'm<00:01:39.240> coming

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
and it would go away then I'm coming

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.120 
and it would go away then I'm coming
back<00:01:39.539> and<00:01:39.840> I'm<00:01:39.930> making<00:01:40.229> more<00:01:40.350> kombucha<00:01:40.890> again

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
back and I'm making more kombucha again

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.419 
back and I'm making more kombucha again
and<00:01:41.399> it<00:01:41.820> would<00:01:41.880> reappear<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.920> this<00:01:43.920> happened

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
and it would reappear and this happened

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.700 
and it would reappear and this happened
over<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> period<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.750> couple<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.170> months<00:01:46.500> and

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
over a period of a couple of months and

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.819 
over a period of a couple of months and
then<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.609> stopped<00:01:47.909> doing<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.270> all<00:01:48.390> together

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
then it stopped doing it all together

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.889 
then it stopped doing it all together
and<00:01:49.829> what<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.759> realized<00:01:51.270> through<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.630> process

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
and what I realized through that process

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.050 
and what I realized through that process
was<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.619> kombucha<00:01:53.039> was<00:01:53.369> literally

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
was that the kombucha was literally

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.300 
was that the kombucha was literally
pulling<00:01:54.539> the<00:01:54.750> poison<00:01:55.140> oak<00:01:55.259> toxin<00:01:55.740> out<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.189> my

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
pulling the poison oak toxin out of my

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.440 
pulling the poison oak toxin out of my
body<00:01:56.549> through<00:01:57.479> my<00:01:57.810> skin<00:01:58.280> so<00:01:59.280> not<00:02:00.090> only<00:02:00.240> does

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
body through my skin so not only does

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.599 
body through my skin so not only does
kombucha<00:02:00.869> detoxify<00:02:01.530> us<00:02:01.649> from<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.920> inside<00:02:02.369> but

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
kombucha detoxify us from the inside but

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:04.429
