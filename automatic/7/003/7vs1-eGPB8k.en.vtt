00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
the new steady cam curve that I received

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.800 
the new steady cam curve that I received
as<00:00:12.620> you<00:00:13.620> can<00:00:13.770> see<00:00:14.010> I've<00:00:14.190> got<00:00:14.520> a<00:00:16.640> Hero<00:00:17.640> 3<00:00:18.029> plus<00:00:18.510> on

as you can see I've got a Hero 3 plus on
here<00:00:19.080> with<00:00:19.200> a<00:00:19.230> skeleton<00:00:20.120> case<00:00:21.440> along<00:00:22.440> with<00:00:22.650> the

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
here with a skeleton case along with the

here with a skeleton case along with the
LCD<00:00:23.820> BacPac<00:00:24.710> this<00:00:25.710> little<00:00:26.039> handle<00:00:26.550> locks<00:00:27.480> on

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
LCD BacPac this little handle locks on

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.319 
LCD BacPac this little handle locks on
to<00:00:28.020> the<00:00:28.670> sweet<00:00:29.670> base<00:00:30.289> this<00:00:31.289> little<00:00:32.329> switch

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
to the sweet base this little switch

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.150 
to the sweet base this little switch
releases<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.480> handle<00:00:36.930> that's<00:00:37.290> on<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.739> gimbal

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
releases the handle that's on the gimbal

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
releases the handle that's on the gimbal
and<00:00:38.720> it<00:00:39.720> doesn't<00:00:40.110> take<00:00:41.100> too<00:00:41.370> much<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.579> get<00:00:41.970> this

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
and it doesn't take too much to get this

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.000 
and it doesn't take too much to get this
balanced<00:00:44.090> you<00:00:45.090> just<00:00:45.329> move<00:00:45.540> the<00:00:46.010> camera

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
balanced you just move the camera

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.250 
balanced you just move the camera
forward<00:00:47.340> or<00:00:47.880> back<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.630> bit<00:00:49.250> to<00:00:50.420> balance<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.630> and

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.260 

it<00:00:55.260> takes<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.620> little<00:00:55.770> getting<00:00:55.890> used<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:56.610> as

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
it takes a little getting used to but as

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.249 
it takes a little getting used to but as
you<00:00:57.719> can<00:00:57.870> see<00:00:58.790> it's<00:00:59.790> pretty<00:01:00.090> steady<00:01:00.539> it

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:03.259 

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:05.959 

I'm<00:01:04.259> actually<00:01:04.559> not<00:01:04.949> holding<00:01:05.399> it<00:01:05.519> correctly

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:05.969 
I'm actually not holding it correctly

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:08.359

does pretty well as you can see bring it
oops<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.770> now<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:37.979> hit<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.250> with<00:01:38.369> my<00:01:38.400> finger<00:01:38.820> in

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
oops so now I hit it with my finger in

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.969 
oops so now I hit it with my finger in
it<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.330> it<00:01:39.659> turned<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:41.900> so<00:01:42.900> steady<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.500> back<00:01:43.710> up

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
it and it turned it so steady it back up

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.179 
it and it turned it so steady it back up
I'm<00:01:44.640> shooting<00:01:45.450> from<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.350> Steadicam<00:01:46.740> I'm

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
I'm shooting from the Steadicam I'm

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:57.020 
I'm shooting from the Steadicam I'm
using<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:48.650> super<00:01:49.650> view<00:01:51.140> 180<00:01:52.140> for<00:01:53.329> 1080p<00:01:56.030> whoa

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
using the super view 180 for 1080p whoa

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.300 
using the super view 180 for 1080p whoa
it's<00:01:57.720> kind<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.020> getting<00:01:58.259> away<00:01:58.350> from<00:01:58.500> me<00:01:58.890> so

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
it's kind of getting away from me so

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.310 
it's kind of getting away from me so
it's<00:01:59.490> turning

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
it's turning

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.139 
it's turning
so<00:02:01.320> I'll<00:02:01.439> just<00:02:01.680> flip<00:02:02.220> it<00:02:02.310> back<00:02:02.520> around<00:02:02.549> with<00:02:03.030> my

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
so I'll just flip it back around with my

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.630 
so I'll just flip it back around with my
fingers<00:02:06.140> so

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
fingers so

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.590 
fingers so
you<00:02:08.330> know<00:02:08.509> it's<00:02:08.810> a<00:02:08.869> little<00:02:09.050> finicky<00:02:09.500> I<00:02:10.480> think<00:02:11.480> a

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
you know it's a little finicky I think a

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
you know it's a little finicky I think a
bigger<00:02:12.069> unit<00:02:13.069> actually<00:02:13.550> would<00:02:14.060> balance<00:02:14.300> a<00:02:14.870> lot

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
bigger unit actually would balance a lot

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.449 
bigger unit actually would balance a lot
better<00:02:15.890> but<00:02:16.160> that<00:02:16.370> kind<00:02:16.940> of<00:02:17.680> is<00:02:18.680> beside<00:02:19.280> the

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
better but that kind of is beside the

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.750 
better but that kind of is beside the
point

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:33.760 

hey<00:02:22.760> blue<00:02:30.430> so<00:02:31.430> this<00:02:31.670> is<00:02:31.820> really<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.150> only<00:02:32.770> only

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
hey blue so this is really the only only

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.110 
hey blue so this is really the only only
this<00:02:33.980> shoot<00:02:36.340> it's<00:02:37.340> hard<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.730> keep<00:02:37.880> it<00:02:38.060> from

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
this shoot it's hard to keep it from

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.680 
this shoot it's hard to keep it from
swinging<00:02:38.540> from<00:02:38.840> side<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:39.140> side<00:02:40.330> this<00:02:41.330> is<00:02:41.390> only

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
swinging from side to side this is only

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.710 
swinging from side to side this is only
the<00:02:41.930> second<00:02:42.290> time<00:02:42.320> I've<00:02:43.180> played<00:02:44.180> around<00:02:44.420> with

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
the second time I've played around with

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:52.860 
the second time I've played around with
it<00:02:44.900> but<00:02:47.260> walking<00:02:48.260> in<00:02:48.530> a<00:02:48.620> pretty<00:02:48.830> good<00:02:49.010> clip

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:10.199
