00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
rainbow crane which is the same as the

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.190 
rainbow crane which is the same as the
struggle<00:00:48.950> of<00:00:49.010> machines<00:00:49.400> and<00:00:49.690> he<00:00:50.690> was<00:00:50.840> having

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
struggle of machines and he was having

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.290 
struggle of machines and he was having
trouble<00:00:51.230> of<00:00:51.800> winning<00:00:52.130> plush<00:00:52.489> from<00:00:52.790> a<00:00:52.970> nearly

trouble of winning plush from a nearly
empty<00:00:53.450> crane<00:00:54.370> from<00:00:55.370> his<00:00:55.580> previous<00:00:55.880> experience

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
empty crane from his previous experience

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.210 
empty crane from his previous experience
where<00:00:56.840> he<00:00:57.020> was<00:00:57.140> able<00:00:57.260> to<00:00:57.500> clean<00:00:57.739> out<00:00:57.949> the

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
where he was able to clean out the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.340 
where he was able to clean out the
entire<00:00:58.489> machine<00:00:58.760> it<00:00:59.570> seemed<00:00:59.930> like<00:01:00.019> it<00:01:00.260> would

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
entire machine it seemed like it would

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.520 
entire machine it seemed like it would
be<00:01:00.500> easy<00:01:00.739> but<00:01:01.629> that<00:01:02.629> wasn't<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:02.989> case<00:01:03.230> in<00:01:03.500> that

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
be easy but that wasn't the case in that

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.800 
be easy but that wasn't the case in that
particular<00:01:03.830> video<00:01:04.190> so<00:01:05.059> since<00:01:05.510> I<00:01:05.630> have<00:01:05.660> the

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
particular video so since I have the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.560 
particular video so since I have the
same<00:01:06.140> claw<00:01:06.470> in<00:01:06.710> my<00:01:07.010> greyhound<00:01:07.880> I<00:01:08.090> wanted<00:01:08.480> to

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
same claw in my greyhound I wanted to

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.960 
same claw in my greyhound I wanted to
explain<00:01:08.810> why<00:01:09.230> I<00:01:09.260> think<00:01:09.580> he<00:01:10.580> was<00:01:10.700> having

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
explain why I think he was having

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.120 
explain why I think he was having
trouble<00:01:11.000> in<00:01:11.510> that<00:01:11.570> particular<00:01:11.900> instance<00:01:12.560> I

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
trouble in that particular instance I

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.460 
trouble in that particular instance I
like<00:01:13.760> to<00:01:13.880> start<00:01:14.090> with<00:01:14.240> a<00:01:14.390> little<00:01:14.750> overview<00:01:15.110> of

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
like to start with a little overview of

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.260 
like to start with a little overview of
that<00:01:15.830> specific<00:01:16.220> clause<00:01:16.700> so<00:01:16.909> let's<00:01:17.060> take<00:01:17.180> a

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
that specific clause so let's take a

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.220 
that specific clause so let's take a
look<00:01:18.940> I'm<00:01:19.940> sure<00:01:20.210> you<00:01:20.420> already<00:01:20.570> know<00:01:20.900> that<00:01:21.080> it's

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
look I'm sure you already know that it's

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.720 
look I'm sure you already know that it's
important<00:01:21.620> to<00:01:21.650> get<00:01:21.800> a<00:01:21.860> good<00:01:22.040> clamp<00:01:22.370> around<00:01:22.520> the

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
important to get a good clamp around the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.940 
important to get a good clamp around the
prize<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:23.960> I<00:01:24.050> have<00:01:24.200> mentioned<00:01:24.380> that<00:01:24.650> several

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
prize and I have mentioned that several

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.890 
prize and I have mentioned that several
times<00:01:25.159> in<00:01:25.580> my<00:01:25.670> previous<00:01:26.000> videos<00:01:26.390> but<00:01:26.540> I<00:01:26.600> here<00:01:26.870> I

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
times in my previous videos but I here I

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.560 
times in my previous videos but I here I
want<00:01:27.140> to<00:01:27.170> explain<00:01:27.500> why<00:01:27.970> let<00:01:28.970> me<00:01:29.060> show<00:01:29.240> you<00:01:29.270> how

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
want to explain why let me show you how

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.210 
want to explain why let me show you how
the<00:01:29.630> claw<00:01:29.930> works<00:01:30.970> inside<00:01:31.970> of<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:32.300> cylinder

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
the claw works inside of the cylinder

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.170 
the claw works inside of the cylinder
there<00:01:34.220> is<00:01:34.460> a<00:01:35.320> coil<00:01:36.400> there<00:01:37.400> are<00:01:37.550> no<00:01:37.700> mechanical

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
there is a coil there are no mechanical

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.270 
there is a coil there are no mechanical
parts<00:01:38.540> the<00:01:38.900> coil<00:01:39.200> is<00:01:39.440> basically<00:01:41.620> it's<00:01:42.620> become

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
parts the coil is basically it's become

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.790 
parts the coil is basically it's become
when<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.610> power<00:01:43.850> is<00:01:44.000> sent<00:01:44.510> through<00:01:45.440> the<00:01:45.620> wire

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
when the power is sent through the wire

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.010 
when the power is sent through the wire
into<00:01:46.730> the<00:01:46.760> coil<00:01:47.150> it<00:01:47.720> becomes<00:01:48.080> a<00:01:48.230> magnet<00:01:48.620> and<00:01:50.020> it

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
into the coil it becomes a magnet and it

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.280 
into the coil it becomes a magnet and it
pulls<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:51.620> shaft<00:01:51.920> of<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.250> claw<00:01:52.580> in<00:01:52.990> that<00:01:53.990> is

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
pulls the shaft of the claw in that is

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.320 
pulls the shaft of the claw in that is
really<00:01:54.800> the<00:01:54.950> only<00:01:54.980> thing<00:01:55.670> that<00:01:55.880> makes<00:01:56.060> the

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
really the only thing that makes the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.380 
really the only thing that makes the
claw<00:01:56.540> close<00:01:59.080> since<00:02:00.080> it's<00:02:01.090> connected<00:02:02.090> with

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
claw close since it's connected with

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.500 
claw close since it's connected with
these<00:02:02.540> rods<00:02:02.860> when<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:03.950> shaft<00:02:04.190> goes<00:02:04.490> in<00:02:04.730> the

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
these rods when the shaft goes in the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.130 
these rods when the shaft goes in the
claw<00:02:05.750> closes<00:02:06.880> you<00:02:07.880> might<00:02:08.060> think<00:02:08.269> that<00:02:08.420> the

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
claw closes you might think that the

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.680 
claw closes you might think that the
strength<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.800> claw<00:02:10.039> may<00:02:10.340> be<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:11.360> same

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
strength of the claw may be the same

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.720 
strength of the claw may be the same
while<00:02:12.230> it's<00:02:12.440> closing<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:12.980> entire<00:02:13.250> time<00:02:13.550> but

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
while it's closing the entire time but

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.350 
while it's closing the entire time but
that's<00:02:13.940> not<00:02:14.090> true<00:02:15.069> when<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.519> claw<00:02:16.760> is<00:02:16.940> open

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
that's not true when the claw is open

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.080 
that's not true when the claw is open
and<00:02:17.540> it<00:02:18.200> starts<00:02:18.709> to<00:02:18.890> close<00:02:19.129> it's<00:02:19.519> at<00:02:19.940> its

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
and it starts to close it's at its

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.619 
and it starts to close it's at its
weakest<00:02:20.540> point<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:22.129> farther<00:02:22.340> up<00:02:22.670> it<00:02:23.330> goes

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
weakest point and the farther up it goes

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.820 
weakest point and the farther up it goes
in<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:25.069> more<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:26.230> surface<00:02:27.230> of<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.560> shaft

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
in the more of the surface of the shaft

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.030 
in the more of the surface of the shaft
there<00:02:28.489> is<00:02:28.730> inside<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:30.140> stronger<00:02:30.680> is<00:02:30.769> going<00:02:30.980> to

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
there is inside the stronger is going to

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.250 
there is inside the stronger is going to
hold<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.879> strongest<00:02:32.269> point<00:02:32.599> is<00:02:32.810> when

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
hold and the strongest point is when

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.949 
hold and the strongest point is when
it's<00:02:33.409> entirely<00:02:33.769> closed<00:02:34.189> so<00:02:35.030> basically<00:02:35.510> as<00:02:35.689> the

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
it's entirely closed so basically as the

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.259 
it's entirely closed so basically as the
claw<00:02:36.170> is<00:02:36.200> closing<00:02:36.920> its<00:02:37.099> strength<00:02:37.999> is

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
claw is closing its strength is

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:39.220 
claw is closing its strength is
gradually

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
gradually

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.080 
gradually
goes<00:02:39.379> from<00:02:39.680> from<00:02:40.340> zero<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:41.680> let's<00:02:42.680> say<00:02:42.920> 10<00:02:43.280> when

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
goes from from zero to let's say 10 when

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.600 
goes from from zero to let's say 10 when
it's<00:02:44.120> entirely<00:02:44.599> closed<00:02:44.989> and<00:02:45.260> that's<00:02:46.159> why<00:02:46.430> it's

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
it's entirely closed and that's why it's

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.449 
it's entirely closed and that's why it's
important<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.690> close<00:02:48.049> around<00:02:48.799> the<00:02:49.010> prize<00:02:49.250> as

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
important to close around the prize as

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.690 
important to close around the prize as
much<00:02:49.640> as<00:02:49.819> possible<00:02:50.260> because<00:02:51.260> if<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.190> claw<00:02:52.430> is

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
much as possible because if the claw is

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.780 
much as possible because if the claw is
the<00:02:53.030> more<00:02:53.810> of<00:02:53.930> that<00:02:54.049> shaft<00:02:54.379> is<00:02:54.650> in<00:02:54.860> before<00:02:55.700> it

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
the more of that shaft is in before it

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.970 
the more of that shaft is in before it
starts<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.180> go<00:02:56.299> up<00:02:56.330> the<00:02:57.049> stronger<00:02:57.440> is<00:02:57.680> going<00:02:57.920> to

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
starts to go up the stronger is going to

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.410 
starts to go up the stronger is going to
hold<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.310> prize<00:02:59.890> this<00:03:00.890> is<00:03:01.069> why<00:03:01.250> sometimes<00:03:01.790> if

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
hold the prize this is why sometimes if

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.410 
hold the prize this is why sometimes if
you<00:03:03.140> try<00:03:03.349> to<00:03:03.410> grab<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:03.890> prize<00:03:04.129> around<00:03:04.549> its

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
you try to grab the prize around its

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.770 
you try to grab the prize around its
head<00:03:05.690> it<00:03:05.950> slips<00:03:06.950> out<00:03:07.209> even<00:03:08.209> if<00:03:08.299> you<00:03:08.420> think<00:03:08.450> you

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
head it slips out even if you think you

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.449 
head it slips out even if you think you
have<00:03:08.810> a<00:03:08.959> good<00:03:09.170> grab<00:03:09.409> under<00:03:09.769> its<00:03:09.920> chin<00:03:10.220> or

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
have a good grab under its chin or

have a good grab under its chin or
whatever<00:03:10.760> if<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.629> claw<00:03:11.870> is<00:03:12.049> not<00:03:12.319> closed

whatever if the claw is not closed
entirely<00:03:13.280> it<00:03:13.489> will<00:03:13.640> slip<00:03:13.849> out<00:03:14.060> but<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:15.049> may

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
entirely it will slip out but you may

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.069 
entirely it will slip out but you may
have<00:03:15.440> won<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:15.829> same<00:03:16.069> prize<00:03:16.400> just<00:03:17.299> by<00:03:17.569> its<00:03:17.720> arm

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
whatever it may be it is much stronger

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.940 
whatever it may be it is much stronger

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.190 
entirely closed so if there is any part
of<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.549> shaft<00:03:40.819> that<00:03:41.060> is<00:03:41.120> still<00:03:41.480> outside<00:03:42.049> of

of the shaft that is still outside of
the<00:03:42.290> claw<00:03:42.669> then<00:03:43.669> it's<00:03:44.359> not<00:03:44.660> holding<00:03:45.139> it<00:03:45.440> as

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
the claw then it's not holding it as

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.420 
the claw then it's not holding it as
strong<00:03:46.280> as<00:03:46.700> strongly<00:03:47.060> as<00:03:47.209> it<00:03:47.419> possibly<00:03:47.810> can

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
strong as strongly as it possibly can

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.589 
strong as strongly as it possibly can
I'm<00:03:49.430> going<00:03:49.609> to<00:03:49.700> use<00:03:49.819> this<00:03:49.940> lovebird<00:03:50.359> as<00:03:50.510> an

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
I'm going to use this lovebird as an

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.539 
I'm going to use this lovebird as an
example<00:03:50.930> since<00:03:51.709> it's<00:03:51.919> one<00:03:52.099> of<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.310> lighter

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
example since it's one of the lighter

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.520 
example since it's one of the lighter
ones<00:03:52.849> in<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.299> series<00:03:53.660> and<00:03:53.959> usually<00:03:54.380> pretty

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
ones in the series and usually pretty

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.129 
ones in the series and usually pretty
easy<00:03:54.620> to<00:03:54.950> win<00:03:55.130> a<00:03:55.389> cloth<00:03:56.389> strength<00:03:56.720> is<00:03:56.900> about

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:57.139 
easy to win a cloth strength is about

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:59.349 
easy to win a cloth strength is about
average<00:03:57.319> and<00:03:57.799> placing<00:03:58.579> it<00:03:58.609> on<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:58.819> bare<00:03:59.030> floor

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
average and placing it on the bare floor

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:08.670 
average and placing it on the bare floor
let's<00:03:59.750> see<00:03:59.930> how<00:04:00.109> it<00:04:00.139> works

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.199 

moving<00:04:09.680> around<00:04:09.980> trying<00:04:10.250> different<00:04:10.610> positions

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
moving around trying different positions

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:18.659 
moving around trying different positions
and<00:04:12.940> it's<00:04:13.940> still<00:04:14.270> not<00:04:15.190> really<00:04:16.570> picking<00:04:17.570> it<00:04:17.660> up

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
and it's still not really picking it up

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:29.320 
and it's still not really picking it up
let's<00:04:19.669> try<00:04:19.910> a<00:04:19.940> couple<00:04:20.150> more<00:04:20.239> times<00:04:28.240> trying<00:04:29.240> to

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
let's try a couple more times trying to

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.560 
let's try a couple more times trying to
grab<00:04:29.960> it<00:04:29.990> around<00:04:30.320> the<00:04:30.470> middle<00:04:30.740> same<00:04:31.280> problem

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:47.290 

and<00:04:35.570> one<00:04:36.020> more<00:04:36.169> time<00:04:44.979> yep<00:04:45.979> it<00:04:46.460> keeps<00:04:46.850> slipping

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
and one more time yep it keeps slipping

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.730 
and one more time yep it keeps slipping
out

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.219 

what's<00:04:50.740> happening<00:04:51.099> here<00:04:51.250> is<00:04:51.310> that<00:04:51.960> the<00:04:52.960> claw

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
what's happening here is that the claw

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:55.619 
what's happening here is that the claw
is<00:04:53.409> forced<00:04:54.039> completely<00:04:54.879> open<00:04:55.300> when<00:04:55.509> it

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:55.629 
is forced completely open when it

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.350 
is forced completely open when it
reaches<00:04:55.990> the<00:04:56.110> floor<00:04:56.259> and<00:04:56.759> when<00:04:57.759> it<00:04:57.909> starts

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
reaches the floor and when it starts

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.510 
reaches the floor and when it starts
going<00:04:58.629> back<00:04:59.020> and<00:04:59.259> closing<00:04:59.830> at<00:04:59.949> the<00:05:00.069> same<00:05:00.280> time

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
going back and closing at the same time

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.610 
going back and closing at the same time
by<00:05:01.300> the<00:05:01.360> time<00:05:01.629> the<00:05:01.750> claw<00:05:01.960> reaches<00:05:02.349> about

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
by the time the claw reaches about

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.119 
by the time the claw reaches about
halfway<00:05:02.979> closed<00:05:03.669> point<00:05:04.030> it's<00:05:04.389> already<00:05:05.129> way

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:06.129 
halfway closed point it's already way

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:09.119 
halfway closed point it's already way
too<00:05:06.159> far<00:05:06.699> up<00:05:06.969> over<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:07.930> bird<00:05:08.169> so<00:05:08.919> there's

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:09.129 
too far up over the bird so there's

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:12.929 
too far up over the bird so there's
really<00:05:09.370> nothing<00:05:10.000> for<00:05:10.030> it<00:05:10.300> to<00:05:10.569> grab<00:05:11.849> now<00:05:12.849> i'm

00:05:12.929 --> 00:05:12.939 
really nothing for it to grab now i'm

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:14.909 
really nothing for it to grab now i'm
going<00:05:13.090> to<00:05:13.150> try<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.389> same<00:05:13.689> bird<00:05:13.990> with<00:05:14.560> the<00:05:14.590> same

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
going to try the same bird with the same

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.709 
going to try the same bird with the same
cloth<00:05:15.250> strength<00:05:15.580> on<00:05:15.789> top<00:05:16.000> of<00:05:16.180> other<00:05:16.330> prizes

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:16.719 
cloth strength on top of other prizes

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:20.010 
cloth strength on top of other prizes
like<00:05:16.960> it<00:05:17.259> normally<00:05:17.409> would<00:05:17.770> be<00:05:18.419> and<00:05:19.419> you<00:05:19.900> can

like it normally would be and you can

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.959 
like it normally would be and you can

see here that as long as the clock and
close<00:05:22.330> around<00:05:22.629> the<00:05:22.810> prize<00:05:23.110> it<00:05:23.889> will<00:05:24.219> it<00:05:24.400> is

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
close around the prize it will it is

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.909 
close around the prize it will it is
strong<00:05:24.789> enough<00:05:24.909> to<00:05:25.150> pick<00:05:25.300> it<00:05:25.449> up<00:05:25.569> of<00:05:26.080> course<00:05:26.379> in

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
strong enough to pick it up of course in

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.740 
strong enough to pick it up of course in
this<00:05:27.039> case<00:05:27.279> the<00:05:27.699> bird<00:05:27.879> does<00:05:28.120> fall<00:05:28.330> out<00:05:28.509> but

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
this case the bird does fall out but

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.040 
this case the bird does fall out but
that's<00:05:28.990> just<00:05:29.169> the<00:05:29.289> way<00:05:29.469> the<00:05:29.620> prize<00:05:29.860> is<00:05:30.069> shaped

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
that's just the way the prize is shaped

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.390 
that's just the way the prize is shaped
Matt<00:05:32.050> had<00:05:32.229> been<00:05:32.349> able<00:05:32.469> to<00:05:32.740> clean<00:05:32.979> out<00:05:33.159> an

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
Matt had been able to clean out an

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.939 
Matt had been able to clean out an
almost<00:05:33.729> empty<00:05:33.909> machine<00:05:34.360> previously<00:05:34.990> since

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:35.949 
almost empty machine previously since

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:37.890 
almost empty machine previously since
that<00:05:36.069> machine<00:05:36.340> was<00:05:36.550> the<00:05:36.939> call<00:05:37.210> was<00:05:37.419> shaped

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
that machine was the call was shaped

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.019 
that machine was the call was shaped
slightly<00:05:38.319> differently<00:05:38.770> he<00:05:39.490> may<00:05:39.639> have<00:05:39.789> been

00:05:40.019 --> 00:05:40.029 
slightly differently he may have been

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:41.689 
slightly differently he may have been
may<00:05:40.419> have<00:05:40.569> been<00:05:40.719> a<00:05:40.750> little<00:05:40.870> bit<00:05:41.050> stronger

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699 
may have been a little bit stronger

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:44.850 
may have been a little bit stronger
there's<00:05:42.699> usually<00:05:43.689> a<00:05:43.960> little<00:05:44.139> bit<00:05:44.319> more<00:05:44.529> space

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
there's usually a little bit more space

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.999 
there's usually a little bit more space
under<00:05:45.250> the<00:05:45.279> prize<00:05:45.900> it<00:05:46.900> doesn't<00:05:47.319> go<00:05:47.469> up<00:05:47.650> quite

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:48.009 
under the prize it doesn't go up quite

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:50.519 
under the prize it doesn't go up quite
as<00:05:48.159> fast<00:05:48.430> so<00:05:48.699> there<00:05:48.849> are<00:05:49.810> other<00:05:49.990> factors<00:05:50.259> that

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:50.529 
as fast so there are other factors that

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:54.209 
as fast so there are other factors that
can<00:05:50.919> contribute<00:05:50.949> but<00:05:51.639> in<00:05:52.029> case<00:05:52.569> of<00:05:52.599> this<00:05:53.219> the

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:54.219 
can contribute but in case of this the

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:56.930 
can contribute but in case of this the
rainbow<00:05:54.430> crane<00:05:54.909> and<00:05:55.300> this<00:05:55.509> sugarloaf<00:05:56.199> claw

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
rainbow crane and this sugarloaf claw

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.430 
rainbow crane and this sugarloaf claw
that<00:05:57.940> you<00:05:58.539> know<00:05:58.629> they<00:05:58.839> tend<00:05:59.080> to<00:05:59.169> be<00:05:59.319> a<00:05:59.349> little

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
that you know they tend to be a little

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.439 
that you know they tend to be a little
bit<00:05:59.560> weaker<00:06:00.009> and<00:06:00.219> they<00:06:00.550> do<00:06:00.610> need<00:06:01.000> the<00:06:01.180> space

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:01.449 
bit weaker and they do need the space

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:06.570 
bit weaker and they do need the space
under<00:06:01.870> the<00:06:01.900> prize<00:06:04.919> that's<00:06:05.919> it<00:06:06.039> for<00:06:06.219> now<00:06:06.310> I<00:06:06.339> hope

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
under the prize that's it for now I hope

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.369 
under the prize that's it for now I hope
