00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:12.410
 No I wonder if it really sounds or 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:14.120
 I feel even Mr. Minami something's word Kinami What is was not seen large ahkah 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.470
 Tiny it looks like 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.360
 Kedomo will become like a impressions Ppipaku' 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:27.320
 That's what it feels like 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:28.580
 That shooting itself goes that very crispy and I'm getting that fun coming 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:37.150
 Though 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:45.010
 If you look at the photos of those other people who are taking that scene, you become sad. 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:49.210
 Yes something in the photos are we looking at a figure that is doing to the great softening unity to fun 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.630
 It is a lonely feeling when so say it say 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:59.420
 that 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:01:01.970
 We have made in the made-to-order I Kamen has a new take the shape of my face 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.830
 It says that it changed specially because it became continuous 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:10.650
 That's right , is it that already there is an upset ? 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.590
 But it is what more and more Well look best, but the difference 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.100
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:22.509
 If you are a mania, you may understand, but after all this is a support proposal 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.200
 It must be fit for going over without having to drop the turtle once 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.009
 By saying 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:31.060
 i I've fallen, I wonder what to write 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:33.760
 We made a solid thing this time 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.090
 In terms of new enemies 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:42.020
 After all , rather than being finished in 2 hours by special 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:45.109
 It's important because there is relaxation and freedom 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:50.509
 I think the drama is still wide 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:52.550
 As we get deeper, we still only get the script for that film, so let's go ahead 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.420
 That's I mean it is going to have 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.689
 I have to look forward to 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.890
 After all this I like it until now 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:05.909
 Because it is different from the thing of one story completion that goes well for 2 hours 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.200
 Just like Mr. Kinan mentioned earlier, we have no idea what will happen in the future 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.850
 I'm doing in the situation 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.410
 So maybe it will die in the next round Oh yes such cast 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.800
 After all I can do it while I am excited 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:22.000
 Is it one feature of regular program ? 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:27.250
 That's why I said earlier, but after all that set up of the countermeasure headquarters is a great upgrade 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.240
 The Tsu other base is completely borrowed over other months by Hey really big running sound was 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:34.430
 It's a panacea, but it looks like it's really in the headquarters. 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:38.060
 The other new aircraft around I think Boo Boo art Do not wonderful 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:43.550
 + I've got a turn , I hope you can see some of them 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:49.010
 How much are you going to appear? Because we haven't heard a bit 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:56.150
 People who got the correct answer are more nervous than us and how are they 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:58.220
 So Well, but it is a sound that will Mukaeyo anymore anyway Ataka warm as we really 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.370
 It seems to be the first person 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.569
 It seems like you are really ordinary people and fans 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.189
 Who know that 1 What if 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:11.849
 For example, because there is no one who is the first place I am embarrassed that you are your own child 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:15.450
 There is also a possibility that you will end up with only one pump 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:19.889
 There is such but it is not know I Na what I described'm had and gone out children 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:23.560
 But it Is not it always will be rewarded by it And then I found you 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:27.360
 There is such anxiousness that is not so in children 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.360
 Something is going to be interesting 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:34.070
