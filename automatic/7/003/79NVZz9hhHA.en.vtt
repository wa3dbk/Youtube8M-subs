00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.660 
let's talk a little bit of some of the
fundamental<00:04:08.470> technology<00:04:09.400> because<00:04:09.550> I<00:04:09.580> know

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
fundamental technology because I know

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:10.500 
fundamental technology because I know
there's<00:04:09.850> something<00:04:10.000> people<00:04:10.210> going<00:04:10.390> to<00:04:10.450> be

and<00:04:38.470> we<00:04:38.680> go<00:04:38.830> chemically<00:04:39.310> hardened<00:04:39.640> glass

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
and we go chemically hardened glass

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.040 
and we go chemically hardened glass
chemically<00:04:40.180> hardened<00:04:40.450> glass<00:04:40.480> to<00:04:40.780> predict

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
that is when it's in tablet mode it

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.620 
that is when it's in tablet mode it
totally<00:04:43.090> makes<00:04:43.240> sense

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
totally makes sense

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.540 
totally makes sense
what<00:04:43.990> about<00:04:44.080> storage<00:04:44.530> what<00:04:45.040> kind<00:04:45.190> of<00:04:45.220> options

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
what about storage what kind of options

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.040 
what about storage what kind of options
we<00:04:45.730> have<00:04:45.850> available<00:04:46.000> on<00:04:46.270> storage<00:04:46.720> that's<00:04:46.930> a

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
we have available on storage that's a

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.600 
we have available on storage that's a
great<00:04:47.200> question<00:04:47.470> so<00:04:47.620> so<00:04:47.920> this<00:04:48.310> in<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:48.460> two

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
great question so so this in the two

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.120 
great question so so this in the two
modes<00:04:48.790> we<00:04:49.000> also<00:04:49.350> have<00:04:50.350> support<00:04:50.560> for<00:04:50.770> four

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
modes we also have support for four

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.250 
modes we also have support for four
windows<00:04:51.400> which<00:04:51.880> would<00:04:52.030> give<00:04:52.150> us<00:04:52.180> a<00:04:52.450> hard<00:04:53.080> drive

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
windows which would give us a hard drive

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.990 
windows which would give us a hard drive
storage<00:04:53.350> up<00:04:53.650> to<00:04:53.710> 500<00:04:54.130> gigabytes<00:04:54.460> on

solid-state storage up to 128 gigabytes

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.040 
solid-state storage up to 128 gigabytes
and<00:04:57.520> excellent<00:04:58.270> on<00:04:58.480> the<00:04:58.570> device<00:04:58.810> with<00:04:59.020> a

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
and excellent on the device with a

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.540 
and excellent on the device with a
chrome<00:04:59.350> operating<00:04:59.590> system<00:05:00.040> we<00:05:00.250> would<00:05:00.370> have<00:05:00.520> a

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
chrome operating system we would have a

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.740 
chrome operating system we would have a
16<00:05:01.150> gig<00:05:01.270> flash

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
16 gig flash

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.000 
16 gig flash
we've<00:05:01.930> got<00:05:02.050> standard<00:05:02.380> for<00:05:02.530> most<00:05:02.650> Chromebooks

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
we've got standard for most Chromebooks

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.400 
we've got standard for most Chromebooks
it<00:05:03.190> makes<00:05:03.520> sense<00:05:03.700> so<00:05:04.210> you<00:05:04.600> know<00:05:04.660> we<00:05:04.780> end<00:05:04.960> up<00:05:05.140> be

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
it makes sense so you know we end up be

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.860 
it makes sense so you know we end up be
having<00:05:05.830> four<00:05:06.640> different<00:05:07.180> offerings<00:05:07.540> here

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
having four different offerings here

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.310 
having four different offerings here
because<00:05:08.080> we've<00:05:08.200> got<00:05:08.760> clamshell<00:05:09.760> and<00:05:10.080> yoga<00:05:11.080> in

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
because we've got clamshell and yoga in

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.860 
because we've got clamshell and yoga in
both<00:05:11.680> Chrome<00:05:12.190> OS<00:05:12.580> offerings<00:05:13.240> and<00:05:13.420> Windows

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
both Chrome OS offerings and Windows

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.510 
both Chrome OS offerings and Windows
offer<00:05:14.080> that's<00:05:14.380> exactly<00:05:14.770> right<00:05:14.830> so<00:05:14.980> it's

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
offer that's exactly right so it's

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.950 
offer that's exactly right so it's
obviously<00:05:15.940> something<00:05:16.300> that<00:05:16.330> came<00:05:16.570> to<00:05:16.690> us<00:05:16.750> as<00:05:16.900> a

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
obviously something that came to us as a

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.540 
obviously something that came to us as a
customer<00:05:17.260> required<00:05:17.560> from<00:05:17.710> education<00:05:18.220> what's

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
customer required from education what's

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.030 
customer required from education what's
uh<00:05:18.640> what's<00:05:19.210> the<00:05:19.330> rationale<00:05:19.810> behind<00:05:19.930> that<00:05:20.200> yeah

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
uh what's the rationale behind that yeah

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.650 
uh what's the rationale behind that yeah
so<00:05:21.310> so<00:05:21.640> we<00:05:21.760> have<00:05:21.790> a<00:05:21.940> lot<00:05:22.120> of<00:05:22.150> customers<00:05:22.540> who
