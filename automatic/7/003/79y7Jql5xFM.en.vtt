00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.180
 armed with bows of arrows and 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.930
 thrusters such men 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.700
 prehistoric 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.590
 the group is looking for a place to 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.059
 to learn about hunting as it 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.059
 was practiced there fifteen thousand years 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.039
 an activity that requires addressed force 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.279
 physical well beyond what we 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.279
 could imagine 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:29.680
 we do not have the right to hunt here because 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.869
 we need a license but we will learn how to 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.920
 shoot 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.640
 is one of you already 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.680
 served as a bow 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.989
 yes but not like that yeah ok you 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.040
 see the pile there in the moss 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.739
 imagine that in the middle of the strain of 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.570
 the tree is the target 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.610
 we can say that it's a bear say 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.260
 rather than it is a rabbit has not 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.820
 we act like it's a rabbit 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.620
 when you shoot 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.210
 you have to find your anchor 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.570
 do you know from his fingers rising in 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.830
 currency 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.190
 is a loose open my great god 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.460
 the eye 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:12.100
 ok you want to try it hard I have 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:15.220
 not at all strong it was the arrow 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:20.659
 at the end you take your bow turn the 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:30.530
 here on this side it's very good in the 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:37.939
 I have to close an eye there excuse me 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:39.799
 finally been strong but not for the 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.950
 luck I saw the arrow who were doing 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.609
 that's because I did my little thing 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.990
 pie 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:46.990
 when you annoy me, you do not want to know 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:01.970
 but an animal passed just behind the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.970
 know well we see that too I missed 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.660
 I still had leaves 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.280
 the group will now learn 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.079
 thruster a funny gear 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.730
 prehistoric that works like a 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.950
 lever arm and that allows for 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.720
 to multiply its power but here too 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:39.200
 better to be in shape to 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:40.459
 properly serve these practices when 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.049
 you are when you are in a strong and united 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.590
 I try to aim between the two trees 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:52.810
 and on derivatives I think everything is going 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:52.810
 leave at the same time fucking is good 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.170
 dima the prehistoric man who should 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.819
 really wait for monts and alain pasquer 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.270
 fitness I'm leaving with everything 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.410
 we have to do 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.360
 it is likely that the condition 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.310
 physical that he needed to do 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.840
 the races to hunt for for 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.140
 run as he did to walk 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.290
 and then and withstand the temperatures 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.540
 sometimes extreme could give them a 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.370
 organism that was hyper hyper powerful 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.769
 on the cardiac and other we 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.690
 today the most common disease 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.489
 finally we are today in 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.260
 our world to the rich is the 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.540
 sedentary lifestyle which is a real 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.760
 disaster we know that the sedentary 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.110
 it plays on the muscles when bush passed 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.760
 musk one sits all day long 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.150
 muses retract they serve more to 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.340
 big thing 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.750
 the bone is the same of skeletons 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.489
 start to soften again 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.140
 we can make bone density 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.610
 and osteoporosis and then the fact of not 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.280
 not shoot with the muses on the dirty water 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.350
 weakens also we even said that it 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.019
 was driving diabetes because 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.549
 finally the insulin pancreas 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.920
 who does to bring sugar into 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.299
 the cells function and secrete from 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.709
 insulin but the cells they 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.489
 become resistant ended up 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.980
 have diabetes 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.310
 because we are sedentary and then there is 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.590
 also the brain the brain and who 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.329
 oxygen that needs oxygen and the 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.070
 problem is that sedentariness reduces 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.209
 the arrival of blood in the brain because 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.709
 that the heart does not work anymore 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.390
 enough because the arteries are 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.760
 fouled which makes that blood with 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.280
 less well to the brain etc. the centrality 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.229
 and well end up reading to me also the 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.120
 brain at the time he had no 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.410
 to be sedentary probably not 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.669
 they move and all the time he lived 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.289
 in nature he did indeed 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.450
 need to move to have some 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:30.870
 activities to find food and for 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.870
 live simply
