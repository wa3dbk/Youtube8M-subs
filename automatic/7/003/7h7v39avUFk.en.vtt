00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.540
 this is what it will cost us to make a macro an environment with the system 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.239
 domotic a train 

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:13.129
 he would go directly to 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:14.769
 configuration 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.490
 per cent we would go environments 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.960
 in environments years we lived an environment 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.099
 three atmospheres we would put your name in this case we are going to put smoke loupe 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:33.670
 once with a man the environment we would see the devices that we want 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.720
 Add 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.450
 in this case of those that we have in the panel we are going to take the plug yet 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.150
 let's catch the light 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.150
 and we are going to take the blind 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.430
 the fact is what we want or to disconnect it 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.660
 the light what we want that we have understood is to approve it 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.680
 and the blind 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.680
 what we want is to upload it 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.400
 we already have and we go environments 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.110
 we will see that there is an environment that we have created as 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.230
 automatically from any remote boarding in this case we're going to 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.329
 fuck my dad 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:14.499
 where we did not have to add any software it did not work 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.710
 wireless device that had 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.560
 per cent a wi-fi or internet connection 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.950
 percent and a browser to connect the system in this case we go to ipad 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.950
 that we are going to shoot the red sea 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.730
 we have the inta 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.280
 directly we do not access the screen we will go environments 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.450
 and we are going to uncover in macro as you see common 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.240
 these days we have awarded to 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.980
 lanÃºs has been paid 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.860
 and the blind has come up 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.800
 It's as simple as doing things with two reasons 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.380
