the<00:00:27.449> predator<00:00:27.900> better<00:00:28.140> for<00:00:28.410> fishing<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:28.980> we

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
the predator better for fishing and we

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.650 
the predator better for fishing and we
thought<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.519> best<00:00:29.550> thing<00:00:29.820> would<00:00:30.060> be<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.480> get
