 brioche pure butter so that's why you 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.230
 will need a salad bowl first and foremost 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.579
 it's having a legged drummer 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.599
 if you do not go you can do 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:29.250
 all this with a wooden spoon you 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.030
 will need a tablespoon of flower 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:41.219
 of orange a packet of yeast 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:46.710

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:58.190
 of milk a teaspoon of salt 2 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.200
 tablespoons of water 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.899
 and to finish cooking soup with sugar 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.129
 in powder 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.469
 we will now be able to start 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.210
 the recipe to start you go 

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:12.240
 put all the flour in your 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:17.670
 salad bowl and you go there and put by 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.819
 above the yeast sachet you to them 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.819
 mix 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:32.009
 you then add the water and the 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:38.209
 milk here you are the milk 3 spoons to 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.209
 soup spoonful of water 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.440
 you 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:02:00.310
 we will then incorporate the salt the sugar 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.050
 as well as the eggs 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.910
 the dumpling really thick enough 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.410
 now will incorporate the butter so 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.020
 at the beginning, in fact, you needed 100 g 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.280
 of butter you melt it and you 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.190
 will leave to cool a little 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.350
 to harden a little more and there 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.000
 we'll embedded three times so 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.000
 you put a first part 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:10.689
 we add a second part and put 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.890
 the rest do not forget if you do not 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.540
 no drummer in fact you go 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.549
 start with a wooden spoon at 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.299
 mix the whole is then you 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.299
 go finish by hand 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:32.040
 we will now add the spoon to 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.040
 orange blossom soup 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.700
 and we will finish beating 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.680
 the preparation is ready we will 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.880
 now put in a mold 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.500
 now that the dough is ready we are going 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.740
 can be directly in front of the 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.930
 world 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.580
 so either you buttered it and you the 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.500
 floured and you'll put the mash to 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.750
 inside me I advise you more 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.340
 to use parchment paper that 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.660
 will have a mold release a lot 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:30.010
 the easier you take your sheet of 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:43.960
 parchment paper and you're going to put it 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:46.770
 the whole of the preparation you 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.770
 remove the surplus 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.370
 then once it's done we go 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.740
 make the dough rise 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.169
 so for that to be you expect about 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.030
 an hour and a half be you go 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.580
 put your oven to heated to the 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.750
 minimum temperature you put to 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.760
 heat for five minutes 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.220
 then you go to the tables you 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.280
 wait 3 minutes and you go 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.750
 put your buns inside her 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.790
 will swell much faster 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:17.590
 there it will only take you an hour in 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:20.350
 done now we only have to stay 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.570
 wait for the brioche to rise and we 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.370
 will come back for the thigh 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:28.290
 an hour later we searched 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.290
 so the brioche that is in the oven 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.380
 that's how you can see 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:37.720
 she is well mounted so we will be able 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.180
 move on to cooking for that you do I 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.400
 make it your oven at 180 Â° for a 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.530
 ten minutes before putting in the oven 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.370
 brioche inside that goes also 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:50.020
 cook at 180 degrees for 35 minutes 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.580
 I leave it like that if you 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.620
 prefer more golden you can 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.690
 brush an egg yolk on the 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.639
 on it before cooking it 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.750
 will be a lot more golden actually 35 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:00.789
 minutes later cooking is 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:15.520
 now finished let's go out 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:17.380
 the fake brioche here and you go 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.069
 be able to unmould immediately I 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.069
 advise you elsewhere 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.639
 she is now ready for the 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.970
