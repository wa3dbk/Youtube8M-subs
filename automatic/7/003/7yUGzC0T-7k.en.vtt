Down<00:00:44.489> Goes<00:00:44.520> my<00:00:44.910> back<00:00:45.180> cuz<00:00:45.780> it's<00:00:45.930> not<00:00:46.039> level<00:00:47.039> 100

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
Down Goes my back cuz it's not level 100

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.150 
Down Goes my back cuz it's not level 100
which<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:49.280> mistakenly<00:00:50.280> brought<00:00:51.860> so<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:52.890> said<00:00:53.070> on

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
which I mistakenly brought so I said on

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.770 
which I mistakenly brought so I said on
my<00:00:53.280> grill<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.730> he<00:00:53.789> said<00:00:54.030> switch<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.719> he

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
my grill and he said switch and he

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.029 
my grill and he said switch and he
predicts<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.140> earthquake<00:00:55.530> nicely<00:00:55.890> and

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
predicts that earthquake nicely and

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.520 
predicts that earthquake nicely and
switches<00:00:56.430> into<00:00:56.579> wheezing<00:00:57.350> which<00:00:58.350> has

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
switches into wheezing which has

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.719 
switches into wheezing which has
levitate<00:01:00.050> and<00:01:01.050> he's<00:01:01.980> gonna<00:01:02.280> go<00:01:02.550> for<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
levitate and he's gonna go for the

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.390 
levitate and he's gonna go for the
lowest<00:01:05.729> which<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.180> predicted<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:07.590> go<00:01:08.220> into

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
lowest which I predicted and I go into

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.359 
lowest which I predicted and I go into
my<00:01:09.180> emboar<00:01:10.790> and<00:01:12.350> I<00:01:13.350> don't<00:01:13.920> know<00:01:13.979> what<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.159> do

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
my emboar and I don't know what to do

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.039 
my emboar and I don't know what to do
here<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.000> went<00:01:15.180> for<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.750> nitrocharge

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
here so I just went for the nitrocharge

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.719 
here so I just went for the nitrocharge
just<00:01:16.470> get<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.740> speed<00:01:17.009> boost<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:19.220> you<00:01:20.220> just<00:01:20.549> go

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
just get the speed boost and you just go

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.399 
just get the speed boost and you just go
forth<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> ball<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.840> was<00:01:22.080> really

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
forth on the ball I I was really

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.770 
forth on the ball I I was really
producing<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.310> thunderbolt<00:01:23.820> right<00:01:24.330> there<00:01:25.130> um

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
producing a thunderbolt right there um

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.600 
producing a thunderbolt right there um
before<00:01:27.780> taking<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.500> just<00:01:29.220> wanted<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.430> be

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
before taking it I just wanted to be

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.649 
before taking it I just wanted to be
sure<00:01:30.560> toys<00:01:31.880> switching<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.909> visor<00:01:33.150> but<00:01:33.420> now<00:01:33.630> I

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
sure toys switching to visor but now I

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.490 
sure toys switching to visor but now I
get<00:01:34.020> speed<00:01:34.350> boost<00:01:35.060> there's<00:01:36.060> not<00:01:36.180> really<00:01:36.360> a

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
get speed boost there's not really a

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.499 
get speed boost there's not really a
point<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.979> don't<00:01:38.640> really<00:01:38.759> have<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.090> special

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
point I don't really have a special

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.200 
point I don't really have a special
attacker<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:40.320> same<00:01:41.189> which<00:01:41.460> really<00:01:41.729> sighs<00:01:42.000> oh

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
there's a wheezing is a pretty big

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.010 
there's a wheezing is a pretty big
problem<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:45.020> gives<00:01:46.020> me<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.200> willies<00:01:47.720> as<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.869> go

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
problem and gives me the willies as I go

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.780 
problem and gives me the willies as I go
for<00:01:49.259> thrash<00:01:49.560> which<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.159> outrage

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
for thrash which is like outrage

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.649 
for thrash which is like outrage
acceptance<00:01:51.360> for<00:01:51.600> normal<00:01:52.350> times<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:53.659> should

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
acceptance for normal times I should

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.600 
acceptance for normal times I should
really<00:01:54.930> switch<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.409> move<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:55.979> do<00:01:56.189> something

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
really switch that move and do something

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.550 
really switch that move and do something
else<00:01:56.869> but<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.290> wanted<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.740> see<00:01:58.950> it<00:02:00.350> used<00:02:01.350> on

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
else but I wanted to see it used on

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.740
