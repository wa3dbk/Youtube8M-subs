 certainly loading will be a bit slow 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.730
 wifi is not exactly the best for 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.400
 any case while the lotus team is then

 duch between the keys g to which there is present 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.970

 they then intervened 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.870
 and exposure is not 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.190
 the classic with what is possible 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.260

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.950
 voltage 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.849
 already because on the side 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.849

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.080

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.210
 from 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.670
 in short, in the characters 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.740
 really a great product 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.120
 this 11.6-inch screen is 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.120
 really very bright and very 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.310
 and realistic colors 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.750
 bile drilling starting from 26 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.750
 October 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.480
 year at a price of about one thousand 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.250
 in the basic version 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.290

 got 24 gb of ram 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:25.290
 even if there is no information yet 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.500
 precise about it certainly is not a 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.880
 price 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.000
 popular mortars really enter 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.870

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.710
 in large number two 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:41.670
 the creations of 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.670
 just think it's a complete pc for 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.440
 to think that we can also work 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.080
 you can also use applications 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.200
 professionals that in short make this 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.840
 event really 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.669
 complete can be used from 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.320
 people for the moment with 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.560
 we conclude because we refer you to one 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.750

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.470
 more in-depth for the moment 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.000
 that's all 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.710
