fluid content in the battery this

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.700 
fluid content in the battery this
battery<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:20.340> actually<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.710> serviceable

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
battery is actually a serviceable

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.939 
battery is actually a serviceable
battery<00:00:23.240> more<00:00:24.240> than<00:00:24.390> 50%<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.289> vehicles

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
battery more than 50% of the vehicles

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.609 
battery more than 50% of the vehicles
today<00:00:26.099> have<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.760> maintenance-free<00:00:27.720> battery<00:00:28.109> in

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
today have a maintenance-free battery in

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.019 
today have a maintenance-free battery in
them<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:28.949> will<00:00:29.220> not<00:00:29.400> be<00:00:29.460> able<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.789> check

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
them so you will not be able to check

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.240 
them so you will not be able to check
them<00:00:30.240> but<00:00:30.599> for<00:00:30.810> those<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.349> can<00:00:31.619> it's

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
them but for those that you can it's

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
them but for those that you can it's
simply<00:00:32.790> prying<00:00:33.719> off<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.680> cap<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.820> get<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
simply prying off the cap to get to the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.229 
simply prying off the cap to get to the
hydraulic<00:00:36.809> fluid<00:00:39.680> using<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.860> hydrometer<00:00:41.550> to

hydraulic fluid using a hydrometer to

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.139 
hydraulic fluid using a hydrometer to
test<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.690> battery<00:00:42.870> which<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.770> simply<00:00:44.190> like<00:00:45.120> a

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
test the battery which is simply like a

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.810 
test the battery which is simply like a
turkey<00:00:45.570> baster<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.989> squeeze<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.559> bulb

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
turkey baster you squeeze the bulb

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
turkey baster you squeeze the bulb
insert<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.940> into<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.239> battery<00:00:48.539> where<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
insert it into the battery where the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.910 
insert it into the battery where the
fluid<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.370> fill<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.489> hydrometer<00:00:51.649> so<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.770> you

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
fluid is fill the hydrometer so that you

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.160 
fluid is fill the hydrometer so that you
can<00:00:53.070> then<00:00:53.100> read<00:00:53.660> whether<00:00:54.660> or<00:00:54.809> not<00:00:54.899> this

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
can then read whether or not this

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.510 
can then read whether or not this
