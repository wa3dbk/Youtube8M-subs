00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.050
 group share 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.990
 In short, it seems to me that in order 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.949
 to 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:10.039
 percent 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:12.359
 build any concept 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:14.379
 in particular 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:17.310
 a look at art follows first 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.099
 answer another line question and 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.220
 much more important common 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.550
 why do checks live? 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.769
 Chechikov exist 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:28.369
 use 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.689
 our stay here on earth for that 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:32.760
 to roll 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.040
 spiritually 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.830
 basic hicks 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.930
 it means that our art is recent 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.710
 our serve what for this 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.020
 or let's say I chose another principle 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.300
 the process of thinking about life for yourself is obvious and 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.160
 arts 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.390
 would look to me 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.460
 in another sense I am you 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.120
 had to invent something else 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.790
 due to the fact that I own 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.610
 the meaning of the us through the warehouse 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.400
 we define on so me 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.030
 it seems like art 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.020
 must 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.020
 help man 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.200
 develop in this direction 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.810
 that is, in short, it is difficult to 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.840
 Togo 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.300
 to help people 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.700
 spiritually change grow 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.380
 I do not know there was such a point of view that 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.280
 art 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.240
 thus informative as 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.540
 all the rest of the spectrum 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.670
 intellectual and spiritual 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.240
 funeral activities I generally do not 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.660
 too believe 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.890
 possibility of knowledge 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.440
 I have almost one style 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.400
 knowing us is more and more distracting from 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.630
 the main goal 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.810
 about our knowledge they 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.100
 and the more we know the less we know about 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.890
 it can also be reality and 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.909
 the most distinguished is the ability to see 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.909
 wide 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.220
 need a man to 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.880
 to help him 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.070
 spiritually soar 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.880
 rise above yourself 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.230
 using what he 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.200
 wish for freedom
