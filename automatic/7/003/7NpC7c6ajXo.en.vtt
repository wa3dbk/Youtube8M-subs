00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
can do about that so if you're just

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.630

in them no matter what you do you can

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.600 
in them no matter what you do you can
help<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.180> out<00:01:03.420> by<00:01:04.049> by<00:01:04.559> stirring<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.100> very

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
help this out by by stirring it very
