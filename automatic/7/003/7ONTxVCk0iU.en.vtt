and<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.610> there's<00:01:50.880> made<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.299> two<00:01:51.570> totally

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
and so there's made of two totally

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.740 
and so there's made of two totally
different<00:01:52.729> components<00:01:53.729> like<00:01:53.880> this<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.570> made

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
different components like this is made

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.090 
different components like this is made
of<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.990> different<00:01:55.140> material<00:01:55.380> even<00:01:55.979> though

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
of a different material even though

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.800 
of a different material even though
they're<00:01:56.280> both<00:01:56.310> plastic<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.180> clear
