00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
do this in NC double-a too but it's just

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.919

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
as you can see the dt comes right in he

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.069 
as you can see the dt comes right in he
actually<00:02:13.799> missed<00:02:14.189> right<00:02:14.489> there<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:15.079> computer
