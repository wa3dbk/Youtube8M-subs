00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.240
 thawing use heat directly 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.850
 from the deep in the preheated oven 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:23.090
 give 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:25.460
 top bottom heat 250 degrees and then 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.330
 baking paper is clear 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.330
 13 to 15 minutes 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.680
 So much for this and there I would just go 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:51.420
 let's say we pack this pizza 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:51.420
 out of space stands andrea 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.369
 doctor about the oven fresh 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.950
 I do not know, he is one now 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.070
 given similarity 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:15.260
 the similarity in any case is yes 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:24.030
 even frozen office packed in 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:29.060
 Of course, foil must be removed and then 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:32.370
 is the whole of a poplar and up 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.459
 104 on it looks like the whole frozen 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.110
 measured and yes I would the places 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.030
 now push in the oven and see you 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.150
 then again 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.150

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.150
 so welcome back that is now 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.560
 finished my pizza out of the oven and me 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.700
 unfortunately I have to admit I have one here 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.910
 a little too long left in it though 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.720
 it's just barely 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.340
 At least he guesses is a very like saying 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.540
 you've gotten to dare a bit but 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.540
 the rest looks very good 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:22.040
 I do not like that 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:24.200
 all the rest and preheated oven 250 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.040
 just as they are on them and I had 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.870
 they now separate twelve minutes 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:40.760
 and who cares, it's a bit of a dream 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:50.020
 become knife and fork and we look 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:04:01.620
 like all this when it looks like 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:04:01.620
 come on so you can get the pizza and 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.700
 yes, at least they just look 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.660
 and spit through the already can eat 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.780
 and delicious 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.169
 although the brand is a bit brown 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.169
 has become 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:43.990
 I can not really complain to me 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:52.210

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:54.660

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.630

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.729
 the supplied baking paper will remain 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:13.979
 do not stick as you can see here 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:16.199
 can cut wonderfully and very much 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.449
