00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.450
 and then I'll make a good end of the game 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.280
 assassin's creed 3 and it's been a while 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.670
 that the game released but I think it's still 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.969
 it's worth catching the game and playing because 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.529
 For this game, it's really fucking good and I wanted to 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.930
 talk a little about the awards he 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.400
 had to actually talk about things that did not 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.300
 awards because it is he won nothing 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.939
 face 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.710
 like that, he should have arrived 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.980
 maybe in the game of the year 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.989
 I do not know if I'll play any more 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.780
 nor for your best game 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.360
 adventure goes that this played a fucking game 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.700
 come and still on or games 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.090
 I do not live at all but for example or 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.239
 games access is often said that 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.780
 he that game the disappointment of the year that this 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.820
 goes by the wheel it may not have been 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:01:01.070
 the same expectations that everyone 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:03.690
 I had but the game, it's fucking expensive, back here. 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:10.140
 from the flames of revolution 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:15.270
 the camera will place you're not playing 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.890
 but I think Americans 1775 conform 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.890
 Latin American 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:02:08.300
 good good is the portuguese cover here has 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.300
 a software in an instruction manual in 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.300
 weihai 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.110
 I think it's one that a new route has 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.080
 Portuguese Let's see but the game is the game 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.150
 was scheduled in Portuguese to have the 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.110
 dubbing in Portuguese I'll have to do 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.150
 a download 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.360
 now I can not do this 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.120
 download because I'm traveling then 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.650
 I do not have internet 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.610
 but I'll see if then as such the 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:41.019
 speed and then I I see how is the 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:47.760
 Good side, I'll let you open here a lot. 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:51.730
 careful to open I 'm afraid of 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:03:08.739
 rip the acap 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:03:25.510
 I think I could pull this 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:28.180
 tip of the hardest veil open here 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.810
 I think I showed but also the team. 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:35.829
 with the original game is also not 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.130
 focusing now you can take this part 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.130
 here on the side 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:46.090
 many people put this stamp inside the 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:47.739
 xbox and wii xbox that xbox box 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:53.019
 about the game 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:57.510
 I never put it, I do not even know what it is. 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.510
 mania or whatever worth something 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:19.020
 our difficulty opens it normally 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.020
 disgrace 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:39.130
 watching two player cds or green with a 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:49.330
 single player two business players that 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:50.470
 should be a player in front and in the 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.630
 back 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.940
 only it has code right in front 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.870
 Well, I wish I had not taken off my hat. 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:02.470
 I can see that 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:04.330
 and then we'll see the flags here 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:09.480
 side 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:12.600
 I think it's just the language in Portuguese 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.600
 from Portugal 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:33.640
 but then show the manual as well 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:41.040
 very simple even if you do not make a new 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:41.040
 more simple manual does not matter much 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:58.510
 is the passport you get will focus get 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:01.540
 instant access to multiplayer game 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:05.310
 unlock your unique character to 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.310
 shadow or shadow 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.610
 Good but then this is what I wanted 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.320
 show you 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:18.790
 I hope you enjoyed 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:20.140
 The video of a boxing is that's it then it's 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:25.260
 beauty 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.260
 Thank you and said
