00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.809 
and over again because either you just
kind<00:02:39.069> of<00:02:39.129> gap<00:02:39.310> though<00:02:39.489> because<00:02:39.670> you're

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
kind of gap though because you're

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.550 
kind of gap though because you're
playing<00:02:39.970> it<00:02:40.209> so<00:02:40.360> often<00:02:40.569> and<00:02:41.019> you<00:02:41.049> got<00:02:41.260> that<00:02:41.440> one

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
playing it so often and you got that one

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.050 
playing it so often and you got that one
you're<00:02:41.680> like<00:02:41.769> oh<00:02:41.890> one<00:02:42.250> more<00:02:42.400> in<00:02:42.519> my<00:02:42.640> ad<00:02:42.819> or

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.970 
you're like oh one more in my ad or
whatever<00:02:43.360> so<00:02:43.660> and<00:02:44.200> that's<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.829> only

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
whatever so and that's the only

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.949 
whatever so and that's the only
difficult<00:02:45.370> part<00:02:45.400> of<00:02:45.700> this<00:02:45.819> song<00:02:46.060> basically<00:02:46.329> um

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
difficult part of this song basically um

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.870 
difficult part of this song basically um
anyways<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.170> song<00:02:50.380> is<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:51.160> right<00:02:51.280> hand<00:02:51.459> it<00:02:51.640> is

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
anyways the song is the right hand it is

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.229 
anyways the song is the right hand it is
AG<00:02:52.540> in<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:53.019> b-flat<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:54.819> you're<00:02:54.940> going<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:55.090> keep

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
AG in a b-flat and you're going to keep

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.210 
AG in a b-flat and you're going to keep
that<00:02:55.480> eight<00:02:55.660> times<00:02:55.870> because<00:02:56.380> part<00:02:56.769> one<00:02:57.010> and

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
that eight times because part one and

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.210 
that eight times because part one and
two<00:02:57.280> are<00:02:57.700> exactly<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.209> same<00:02:58.390> so<00:02:59.069> little<00:03:00.069> math

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
two are exactly the same so little math

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:08.449 
two are exactly the same so little math
for<00:03:00.760> you<00:03:00.970> two<00:03:01.540> times<00:03:01.840> four<00:03:02.290> is<00:03:02.349> eight<00:03:02.890> so<00:03:03.220> eight

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.650 

times<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:10.540> then<00:03:10.660> we're<00:03:10.750> going<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:10.900> go<00:03:11.019> over<00:03:11.230> to

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
times and then we're going to go over to

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.759 
times and then we're going to go over to
the<00:03:13.660> next<00:03:13.780> one<00:03:13.930> part<00:03:14.170> three<00:03:14.350> and<00:03:14.470> four<00:03:14.650> are

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
the next one part three and four are

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.289 
the next one part three and four are
basically<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.310> same<00:03:15.340> thing<00:03:15.760> but<00:03:15.790> part<00:03:16.120> four

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
basically the same thing but part four

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.150 
basically the same thing but part four
is<00:03:16.359> a<00:03:16.389> little<00:03:16.540> different<00:03:16.780> so<00:03:16.840> part<00:03:17.230> three<00:03:17.500> is<00:03:17.709> B

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
is a little different so part three is B

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.750 
is a little different so part three is B
flat<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:18.579> game<00:03:18.819> keep<00:03:19.690> that<00:03:19.870> four<00:03:20.049> times<00:03:20.200> and

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
flat and game keep that four times and

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.780 
flat and game keep that four times and
then<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:22.750> last<00:03:22.959> one<00:03:23.260> parts<00:03:23.769> part<00:03:24.370> four<00:03:24.549> story

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
then the last one parts part four story

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:34.080 
then the last one parts part four story
is<00:03:25.000> B<00:03:25.660> flat<00:03:26.109> and<00:03:26.350> D<00:03:27.329> done<00:03:28.329> twice<00:03:28.690> and<00:03:29.109> then<00:03:33.090> yeah

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
is B flat and D done twice and then yeah

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.479 
is B flat and D done twice and then yeah
it's<00:03:34.329> done<00:03:34.870> twice<00:03:35.200> here<00:03:36.120> but<00:03:38.250> because<00:03:39.250> usually

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
it's done twice here but because usually

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.449 
it's done twice here but because usually
everything's<00:03:39.940> played<00:03:40.090> in<00:03:40.209> fours<00:03:41.280> that's<00:03:42.280> only

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
everything's played in fours that's only

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:43.289 
everything's played in fours that's only
half<00:03:42.730> of<00:03:42.849> it

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
half of it

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.319 
half of it
the<00:03:43.930> next<00:03:44.170> one's<00:03:44.319> going<00:03:44.440> to<00:03:44.500> be<00:03:44.650> B<00:03:44.889> flat<00:03:45.760> and<00:03:46.000> C

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
the next one's going to be B flat and C

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.120 
the next one's going to be B flat and C
so<00:03:49.329> keep<00:03:49.630> that<00:03:49.780> fourth<00:03:50.079> about<00:03:50.380> two<00:03:50.650> times<00:03:50.829> and

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130
