we always have to sell some and so here
I<00:00:25.800> am<00:00:25.920> just<00:00:26.250> listing<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.699> few<00:00:26.730> players<00:00:27.119> I

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
I am just listing a few players I

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.450 
I am just listing a few players I
believe<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.320> haven't<00:00:28.590> got<00:00:28.859> much<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.250> future

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
believe I haven't got much of a future

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.540 
believe I haven't got much of a future
at<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.210> club<00:00:30.390> or<00:00:30.750> just<00:00:31.679> feel<00:00:31.859> like<00:00:32.099> we've<00:00:32.399> got

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
at the club or just feel like we've got

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.729 
at the club or just feel like we've got
too<00:00:32.790> many<00:00:32.910> players<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.600> position<00:00:33.930> so

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
too many players in that position so

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.770 
too many players in that position so
thought<00:00:35.040> probably<00:00:35.700> just<00:00:36.030> best<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.420> get<00:00:36.540> rid<00:00:36.750> of

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
thought probably just best to get rid of

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.709 
thought probably just best to get rid of
a<00:00:36.930> few<00:00:37.110> players<00:00:38.030> so<00:00:39.030> they<00:00:39.210> are<00:00:39.329> guys<00:00:39.480> they're

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719

players<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:42.989> guys<00:00:43.399> suggested<00:00:44.399> one<00:00:44.640> player

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
players so you guys suggested one player

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.029 
players so you guys suggested one player
quite<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> few<00:00:45.690> times<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.469> was<00:00:46.590> Lucas

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
quite a few times and that was Lucas

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.200 
quite a few times and that was Lucas
Piazon<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:48.020> Chelsea<00:00:49.309> place<00:00:50.309> primarily<00:00:50.670> as<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
Piazon of Chelsea place primarily as a

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.479 
Piazon of Chelsea place primarily as a
left<00:00:51.600> wing<00:00:51.840> but<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.410> also<00:00:52.500> play<00:00:52.920> as<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.070> striker

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
left wing but can also play as a striker

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.250 
left wing but can also play as a striker
I<00:00:53.879> believe<00:00:54.120> as<00:00:54.270> well<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:56.120> cost<00:00:57.120> quite<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.480> small

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
I believe as well and cost quite a small

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.770 
I believe as well and cost quite a small
amount<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.710> money<00:00:58.920> 400k<00:00:59.879> isn't<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.359> bad<00:01:00.570> and

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
amount of money 400k isn't that bad and

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.070 
amount of money 400k isn't that bad and
so<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.500> ended<00:01:01.590> up<00:01:01.800> buying<00:01:02.039> him<00:01:02.719> he's<00:01:03.719> only<00:01:03.870> got

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
so I ended up buying him he's only got

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.620 
so I ended up buying him he's only got
61<00:01:04.530> rating<00:01:05.010> but<00:01:05.280> I'm<00:01:05.700> sure<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.030> go<00:01:06.180> suggest

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
the moment he's a striker didn't really

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.830 
the moment he's a striker didn't really
think<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.549> buy<00:01:41.790> him<00:01:42.030> purely<00:01:42.390> for<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.600> fact

think to buy him purely for the fact

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.539 
think to buy him purely for the fact
that<00:01:42.869> we've<00:01:43.079> got<00:01:43.259> quite<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.619> few<00:01:43.829> strikers<00:01:44.310> at

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
that we've got quite a few strikers at

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.940 
that we've got quite a few strikers at
the<00:01:44.700> club<00:01:44.939> already<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.750> i<00:01:45.780> put<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> lone<00:01:46.590> bit<00:01:46.829> in

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
the club already so i put a lone bit in

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.830 
the club already so i put a lone bit in
and<00:01:47.189> was<00:01:47.369> successful<00:01:48.979> next<00:01:49.979> player<00:01:50.840> didn't

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and was successful next player didn't

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.539 
and was successful next player didn't
think<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:52.170> would<00:01:52.350> pull<00:01:52.619> off<00:01:52.770> but<00:01:53.070> it's

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
think this would pull off but it's

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.760 
think this would pull off but it's
always<00:01:53.700> worth<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.600> punt<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.560> was

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
always worth the a punt and that was

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.660 
always worth the a punt and that was

the<00:01:59.759> stats<00:01:59.969> he<00:02:00.299> looks<00:02:00.659> really<00:02:00.960> good<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.979> costs

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
the stats he looks really good it costs

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.359 
the stats he looks really good it costs
a<00:02:02.460> lot<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.850> money<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.869> think<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.200> just

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
a lot of money and so I think I just

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.819 
a lot of money and so I think I just
gave<00:02:05.369> up<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.570> for<00:02:07.320> some<00:02:07.439> reason<00:02:07.469> I

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
gave up on that and for some reason I

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.210 
gave up on that and for some reason I
thought<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.420> his<00:02:09.420> teammate<00:02:09.959> would<00:02:10.470> be<00:02:10.649> cheaper

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
thought in his teammate would be cheaper

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.940 
thought in his teammate would be cheaper
but<00:02:11.879> that<00:02:12.390> was<00:02:12.569> not<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.810> case<00:02:13.110> here

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
but that was not the case here

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.150 
but that was not the case here
act<00:02:14.099> a<00:02:14.310> lot<00:02:14.790> more<00:02:15.000> expensive<00:02:15.590> I<00:02:16.590> actually

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
act a lot more expensive I actually

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.520 
act a lot more expensive I actually
ended<00:02:17.459> up<00:02:17.700> putting<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.150> cheeky<00:02:18.959> loan<00:02:19.170> bidding

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
ended up putting a cheeky loan bidding

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.449 
ended up putting a cheeky loan bidding
for<00:02:19.739> him<00:02:19.920> but<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:20.489> didn't<00:02:21.030> pull<00:02:21.209> off<00:02:22.190> so<00:02:23.190> guys

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
for him but that didn't pull off so guys

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.270 
for him but that didn't pull off so guys
with<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.849> players<00:02:24.120> are<00:02:24.510> at<00:02:24.930> my<00:02:25.230> disposal<00:02:25.769> we

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
with the players are at my disposal we

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.479 
with the players are at my disposal we
went<00:02:26.400> into<00:02:26.690> preseason<00:02:27.690> against<00:02:28.379> valagam<00:02:29.190> I

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
went into preseason against valagam I

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.520 
went into preseason against valagam I
think<00:02:30.060> that's<00:02:30.180> how<00:02:30.330> it's<00:02:30.480> pronounced<00:02:30.930> not

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
think that's how it's pronounced not

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.930 
think that's how it's pronounced not
really<00:02:31.800> quite<00:02:32.069> sure<00:02:32.250> what<00:02:32.400> league<00:02:32.610> there<00:02:32.819> in
