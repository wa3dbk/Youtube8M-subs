ever going anywhere like really
important<00:03:40.519> anymore<00:03:40.730> so<00:03:41.329> then<00:03:41.989> to<00:03:42.560> go<00:03:42.739> with<00:03:42.950> it

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
important anymore so then to go with it

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.160 
important anymore so then to go with it
since<00:03:43.760> I<00:03:43.940> did<00:03:44.209> make<00:03:44.359> it<00:03:44.480> in<00:03:44.599> spring<00:03:44.750> break<00:03:45.019> it

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
since I did make it in spring break it

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.599 
since I did make it in spring break it
was<00:03:45.260> still<00:03:45.500> like<00:03:45.799> a<00:03:45.829> little<00:03:46.010> bit<00:03:46.250> on<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.459> cold

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
was still like a little bit on the cold

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.879 
was still like a little bit on the cold
side<00:03:46.910> that<00:03:47.120> year<00:03:47.299> so<00:03:48.230> I<00:03:48.260> figured<00:03:48.560> I'll<00:03:48.769> go

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889

ahead<00:03:48.980> and<00:03:49.340> make<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:50.030> little<00:03:50.630> caplet<00:03:51.639> jacket<00:03:52.639> to

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
ahead and make a little caplet jacket to

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.970 
ahead and make a little caplet jacket to
wear<00:03:52.970> with<00:03:53.180> it<00:03:53.329> doesn't<00:03:54.019> really<00:03:54.200> provide<00:03:54.530> any

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
wear with it doesn't really provide any
