 producing a minute would be possible today 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.710
 watch the park with your loved ones 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.440
 movies listen to music and even share 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.180
 sharing her files with her friends 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.520
 continues to gain popularity 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.290
 torrent trackers sites are located 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.300
 links for this exchange also 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.160
 develop but in contrast to this 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.840
 british authorities and record 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.030
 companies start unprecedented 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.950
 campaign to combat file sharing 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.380
 first signs of tightening policy 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.390
 A letter from the National Bureau of 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.710
 investigate fraud in it 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.110
 says that for such an activity 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.810
 may face up to 10 years in prison 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.060
 rt channel talked with the founder 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.739
 one of the torin sites that got 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.880
 this is a letter from the British authorities and 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.160
 published it 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.300
 he asked not to reveal his present 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.880
 the name and that's what the officer said was 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.950
 maybe part of their strategy is 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.680
 tom to open such sites has become 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.780
 as difficult and dangerous as possible but I don't 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.410
 I think this will stop file sharing in 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.450
 Overall that question of the torrents we also 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.579
 discuss with blogger James devil 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.009
 studying digital policy issues 

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:09.740
 thank you for finding us time, james 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.719
 Immediately explain to our viewers here 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.459
 can see how people listen to music and 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:16.159
 watching videos on their computers and 

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:18.350
 phones when it comes to torrents 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.959
 and file sharing where the line 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.909
 between legal and illegal points about 

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:25.069
 we must try this and consist one of 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.259
 problems this question is very vague 

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:29.329
 regulated if you take someone 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.520
 someone else's music or video and place on 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.259
 your site is completely obvious 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.329
 being in violation of copyright 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.039
 if you provide a link to the report 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.039
 repository containing the same 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:40.969
 British law material 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.099
 providing such a link is pure 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:45.229
 not technically illegal but 

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:47.539
 if you have a website on which thousands 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.249
 such links and you place next to 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.130
 them advertising and get from this site 

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:53.329
 income under British law 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.819
 fraud cases are being initiated 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.739
 but here itâ€™s rather just rhetoric 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:59.329
 because from the moment they sent 

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:01.639
 this letter is not legislation 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.409
 changed and any owner torrent 

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:05.389
 whose sites are haunted by such 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.470
 laws can only be threatened 

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:10.470
 4-year prison sentence 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.240
 such hair 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.310
 we will closely monitor these 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.310
 investigate and report to you all new 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.330
