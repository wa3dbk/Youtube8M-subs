what<00:01:12.360> happened<00:01:12.840> but<00:01:12.869> they<00:01:13.170> are<00:01:13.400> getting<00:01:14.400> them

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
what happened but they are getting them

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.740 
what happened but they are getting them
back<00:01:14.760> up<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:16.040> ninety<00:01:17.040> percent

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
back up and it is in ninety percent

back up and it is in ninety percent
pretty<00:01:18.750> good<00:01:18.960> shape<00:01:19.229> i<00:01:19.560> would<00:01:19.740> say<00:01:19.890> i<00:01:20.100> would

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
pretty good shape i would say i would

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.899 
pretty good shape i would say i would
give<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.580> but<00:01:21.390> i'm<00:01:22.070> assuming<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
give it but i'm assuming that in the

give it but i'm assuming that in the
time<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.689> come<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:25.229> will<00:01:25.530> be<00:01:25.740> back<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.280> its

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
time to come it will be back to its

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.749 
time to come it will be back to its
regular<00:01:27.110> self<00:01:28.110> once<00:01:28.890> we<00:01:29.159> give<00:01:29.369> them<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.610> little

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
regular self once we give them a little

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.640
