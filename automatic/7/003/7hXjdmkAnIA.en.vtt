00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 hello to all and we are not on 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.330
 a video 2 eleven 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.480
 so today I 'm going to show you 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.110
 how to make an inverter so with 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.759
 two solar panels so I you 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.660
 showed because in fact the principle 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.510
 solar panels is that it 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.590
 light collar of light and me this 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.000
 that I would like to show you this is 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.279
 how the elect but when it is dark 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.949
 because it's so much more useful 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.529
 for that we made an inverter I 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.349
 you were showing here the proof the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.870
 shudder my house ah yes I specify that 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.030
 I just creative but I allowed 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.320
 cheating 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.250
 so I made my house like that and 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.989
 I would love to put you in 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.969
 comment as solo 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.129
 if we can put the day or the night 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:50.070
 here it was a little parenthesis so 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.780
 to make an inverter so you you 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.789
 just have to put a solar panel 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.739
 of lara stone so there it is day in 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:03.239
 the urss to him but there you do 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:08.549
 the inverter so the lamp is off this 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.970
 which turns off the language of 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.860
 redstone 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.180
 then it will not be long to get dark 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.780
 so here's that game after game 3 in 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.780
 hand on my house 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.810
 so I'll take you a bunch 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:34.540
 house waiting until almost night 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.789
 So So here cares but 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.110
 just the restaurant languages for you 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.210
 show so you can do several 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.729
 deco good there I took those who 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.210
 ate the best and they were 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:49.360
 so you're going to knock a panel 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:56.549
 solar there as I showed down 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:02:00.069
 restore it the inverter and lara stone 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.950
 he really stupid she was doing 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.289
 every day so that it touches all 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.350
 lamps 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.369
 here we are chilling the keys all 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.700
 doubled middle beaumont because it takes 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:18.010
 lyricist stopping stone to the lamp 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:22.090
 so there's more than two games 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.480
 because I see that it is it does 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.260
 not long 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:31.049
 I'm going to wait for you 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:39.000
 I'm going to open a little parenthesis this 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:41.829
 so that's wink the g8 of a video on 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.959
 you will be issued a video that's the 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:46.329
 presentation of a channel not mine of 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.130
 my jean channel makes it clear that he 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:51.180
 is done so this is the only video 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.709
 lemmy is here so I take advantage 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.540
 it's version 1.5 one finds 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.400
 solar panels takes advantage of this for 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.510
 put another video that will be you 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.180
 useful I hope so here is no 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.230
 late to do so that's why 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.579
 I would like you to put a 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.579
 comment if we can have 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:13.879
 put the enemy or the daydain as 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:18.590
 cheat because here we get bored a little 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:18.590
 that's it 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.160
 here 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:45.379
 we did not delay there again the time 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:48.530
 so I 'm really sorry for that 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:59.420
 time but it's also a way a 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:59.840
 little bit so I'm going to put a roof of 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:06.469
 My house 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:08.930
 in the meantime you can hide the 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:14.019
 restaurant and besides I'm not going to 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.019
 to do there we avatars houses a little 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.800
 stalled 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:39.120
 So that's worked 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.280
 you see that now it's dark 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.590
 and who thanks to an inverter and the 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.699
 tintin I specify because you see that the 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.789
 stopping stone is off 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.409
 so that's good and a light subject that 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:52.199
 did there was to him so 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:54.050
 the inverter that makes that turns on 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:05:01.740
 that she lights up all the lamps 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:03.599
 So here so that you ben voila I 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:08.939
 so I said to myself as thaler you me 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:10.830
 hid down I think yes it's 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:13.229
 So everything I say bah more for 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.439
 a new video because I'm going to put some 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:19.020
 others do not worry remember 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:20.669
 not that low if not remember it 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.319
 what you want but so what if you 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.419
 rained 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:26.909
 love and if you follow a lot my 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.800
 videos and you loved my two videos 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:29.610
 because next with two but you 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.629
 worry I will put 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:37.279
 many frolics subscribe so here you are 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:40.279
 I tell you more and yeah bah more 

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:40.279
 Hi
