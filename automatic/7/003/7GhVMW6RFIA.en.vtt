00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:08.400
 then there are and there must be and I think 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.440
 that the last match the team had 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.000
 proved that if they did it was easy 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.160
 we absolutely must say why not 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.060
 an atmosphere of happiness of joyful celebration one 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.760
 week where there was so much party 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.810
 many connections so many pats on 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.250
 shoulders and clear that it is not easy for a 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.320
 boy than boys who did 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.080
 have been under pressure for so many 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.180
 months is always at 300 per hour with the head 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.329
 with the spirit with the grace the legs with 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.450
 the heart and continue on those levels 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.920
 however, even with the launch we tried 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.430
 to do the best unfortunately we are not 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.250
 successful 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.170
 we were not good at putting the ball 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.059
 inside because of opportunities we have 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.329
 created rather many but not 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.590
 we had the skill of 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.079
 to concretize them we will have to try to 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.910
 continue also because period 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.410
 despite all also of evaluations and 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.409
 continue to work with the head 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.909
 right on the races to continue giving 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.760
 continuity to performance and results 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.260
 to do further as I said precisely 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.939
 further checks 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.189
 let's face a team too 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.900
 that if you don't go deal with all the 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.180
 fair criteria of respect of 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:23.430
 organization of attention and 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.570
 risk mentality because citadel is one 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.700
 of the teams in better shape than the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.500
 the league says the latest in the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.439
 last eight games nine games do not know 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.450
 the last four have been won seven 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.490
 he certainly won them in a way 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.049
 consecutive is doing it did it a 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.310
 great path is a work group 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.549
 working together with the same technician 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.360
 for several years he has included players 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:48.360
 also right and therefore is now experiencing a 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.710
 very bright championship period e 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.430
 we will have to face it with great 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.350
 attention and great concentration 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.810
 mariska is getting ahead is better 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.170
 he is much better but for tomorrow he cannot 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.850
 recover 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.640
 let's say it's catching up will make one 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.100
 right work week because 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.399
 this annoyance blessed annoyance 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.130
 seems to be averted and therefore good 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.690
 so eros made himself available with 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.610
 the head with the heart with all that 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.819
 which are its characteristics and has 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.590
 had like so many others become 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.120
 other players who are here one 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.360
 exponential growth under all 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.280
 both physical and mental aspects 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.989
 tactical technique but this does not concern 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.880
 he alone would say that it concerns so many 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.800
 defense players three defense four 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.080
 they were in the process of playing we are 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.090
 returning already 4 if you see when the 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.680
 ball is on one side the zap gets up a lot 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.120
 we go to four behind or even 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.560
 three 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.600
 we must be good at knowing 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.250
 adapt depending on where the ball a 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.080
 know how to change according to the team 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.600
 opponent plays with a point or two 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.370
 tips and then go and modulate this 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.319
 kind of attitude is on outsiders 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.910
 that the sliding of the line 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.250
 defensive and to propose it in 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.620
 match in progress beyond the form 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.549
 initial or form because when 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.140
 we will know how to do this in a right way 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.760
 coordinated manner with characteristics 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.170
 right and we will also be able to be 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.150
 unpredictable because we could go 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.769
 raise an exterior to one side go to 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.480
 slip to 4 then play on one 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.519
 central striker with two defenders only 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.049
 instead that could go to go to 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.730
 gain numerical superiority in 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.200
 middle of the field jumping out with a 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.670
 central from in the middle of the field a 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.500
 defender as we often do in phase 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.209
 of possession then go to vary 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.400
 these square situations that on 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.280
 which we always work a little the speech 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.780
 of the four-by-three defense this does not 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.070
 it's because we prepare this year 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.260
 what we should do then the year 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.060
 next viceversa the modules do the 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.799
 no and us players characteristics 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.359
 we will have to understand and evaluate when it will end 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.220
 then the boys will be the season 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.890
 they can stay with us and those who 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.660
 then we will eventually succeed because 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.489
 some guys maybe will be integrated and 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.350
 understand well what will be the 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.500
 features and then we'll go on with 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.500
 work
