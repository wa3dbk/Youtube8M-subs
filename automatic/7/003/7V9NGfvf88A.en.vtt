on 5 and I wanted to make a
clarification<00:02:15.930> here<00:02:16.819> this<00:02:17.819> lens<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.599> hold

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
clarification here this lens that I hold

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.880 
clarification here this lens that I hold
in<00:02:19.109> my<00:02:19.140> hand<00:02:19.590> is<00:02:19.829> the<00:02:19.920> wide<00:02:20.459> angle<00:02:20.760> lens<00:02:21.209> and

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
in my hand is the wide angle lens and

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.500 
in my hand is the wide angle lens and
it's<00:02:22.890> written<00:02:23.159> on<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.609> side<00:02:23.819> of<00:02:23.879> it<00:02:24.180> there<00:02:24.359> if

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
it's written on the side of it there if

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.229 
it's written on the side of it there if
you<00:02:24.629> get<00:02:24.840> confused<00:02:25.349> like<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.739> just<00:02:25.799> did<00:02:26.239> simply

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
you get confused like I just did simply

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.819 
you get confused like I just did simply
let's<00:02:27.450> look<00:02:27.599> at<00:02:27.750> what's<00:02:27.959> written<00:02:28.200> on<00:02:28.409> the<00:02:28.590> side

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
let's look at what's written on the side

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.130 
let's look at what's written on the side
of<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.099> lens<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.730> on<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.420> side<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.959> big

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
of the lens and on the side of the big

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.920 
of the lens and on the side of the big
lens<00:02:31.379> you<00:02:31.650> can<00:02:31.680> see<00:02:31.980> here<00:02:32.340> it's<00:02:32.939> got<00:02:33.090> fish'<00:02:33.390> and

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
lens you can see here it's got fish' and

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.259 
lens you can see here it's got fish' and
if<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.709> have<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.099> lens<00:02:35.310> remove<00:02:35.730> that's<00:02:36.090> where

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
if you have the lens remove that's where

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.990 
if you have the lens remove that's where
you<00:02:36.359> get<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.659> macro<00:02:37.140> shots<00:02:37.500> from<00:02:37.859> so<00:02:38.640> what<00:02:38.849> I'm

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
you get the macro shots from so what I'm

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.750 
you get the macro shots from so what I'm
going<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.239> do<00:02:39.389> now<00:02:39.659> is<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.769> can<00:02:40.950> see<00:02:41.189> how<00:02:41.519> this

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
going to do now is you can see how this

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.940 
going to do now is you can see how this
comparison<00:02:42.420> size<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.230> quarter<00:02:43.769> that's

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
comparison size to the quarter that's

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.360 
comparison size to the quarter that's
laying<00:02:44.219> here<00:02:44.959> it's<00:02:45.959> not<00:02:46.170> very<00:02:46.470> much<00:02:46.739> bigger<00:02:47.099> at

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
laying here it's not very much bigger at

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.660 
laying here it's not very much bigger at
all<00:02:47.549> actually<00:02:48.510> they're<00:02:48.689> about<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.019> same<00:02:49.230> size

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
all actually they're about the same size

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.170 
all actually they're about the same size
so<00:02:50.670> now<00:02:50.879> I'm<00:02:51.060> going<00:02:51.239> to<00:02:51.389> take<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.599> shot<00:02:52.549> of<00:02:53.549> the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
so now I'm going to take a shot of the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.500 
so now I'm going to take a shot of the
camera<00:02:55.129> using<00:02:56.129> the<00:02:56.280> macro<00:02:56.730> lens<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.329> this

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
camera using the macro lens of this

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.050 
camera using the macro lens of this
quarter<00:02:58.049> and<00:02:58.290> I'm<00:02:59.220> going<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.459> tap<00:02:59.669> it<00:02:59.819> there

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
quarter and I'm going to tap it there

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.960 
quarter and I'm going to tap it there
too<00:03:00.389> and<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:01.530> could<00:03:01.739> see<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:01.980> could<00:03:02.159> even<00:03:02.489> zoom

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
too and you could see I could even zoom

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.979 
too and you could see I could even zoom
in<00:03:03.209> more<00:03:03.239> and<00:03:04.220> it's<00:03:05.220> very<00:03:05.579> hard<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.480> take<00:03:06.959> a

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
in more and it's very hard to take a

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.170 
in more and it's very hard to take a
shot<00:03:08.299> using<00:03:09.299> this<00:03:09.750> without<00:03:10.739> it<00:03:10.980> being<00:03:11.250> on<00:03:11.669> a

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
shot using this without it being on a

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.849 
shot using this without it being on a
tripod<00:03:13.250> because<00:03:14.250> it's<00:03:14.669> supposed<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.150> be<00:03:15.359> on<00:03:15.750> a

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
tripod because it's supposed to be on a

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:27.680 
tripod because it's supposed to be on a
half<00:03:16.859> inch<00:03:19.159> from<00:03:20.159> the<00:03:22.370> actual

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.780 

all<00:03:28.690> right<00:03:28.840> that<00:03:29.110> one<00:03:29.290> wanting<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.770> bad<00:03:29.980> all

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
all right that one wanting to bad all

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.270 
all right that one wanting to bad all
right<00:03:30.880> now<00:03:31.180> let's<00:03:31.450> go<00:03:31.600> ahead<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:31.990> screw<00:03:32.980> the

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
right now let's go ahead and screw the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.790 
right now let's go ahead and screw the
actual<00:03:34.770> wide-angle<00:03:35.770> lens<00:03:36.040> on<00:03:36.460> and<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:38.590> wide

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
actual wide-angle lens on and the wide

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.070 
actual wide-angle lens on and the wide
angle<00:03:39.040> lens<00:03:39.460> is<00:03:40.330> supposed<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:40.990> give<00:03:41.230> us<00:03:41.410> I

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
angle lens is supposed to give us I

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.830 
angle lens is supposed to give us I
think<00:03:44.080> it<00:03:44.230> said<00:03:44.500> 180<00:03:45.400> degrees<00:03:45.940> field<00:03:46.480> of<00:03:46.660> view

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
think it said 180 degrees field of view

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.840 
think it said 180 degrees field of view
or<00:03:47.350> that<00:03:47.590> may<00:03:47.770> have<00:03:47.860> been<00:03:47.980> for<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.370> fish<00:03:48.610> yeah

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
or that may have been for the fish yeah

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.500 
or that may have been for the fish yeah
the<00:03:49.060> fishy<00:03:49.270> I<00:03:49.390> was<00:03:49.600> 180<00:03:50.260> and<00:03:50.850> it<00:03:51.850> says<00:03:52.330> the

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
the fishy I was 180 and it says the

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.170 
the fishy I was 180 and it says the
wide-angle<00:03:52.950> expands<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.280> native<00:03:54.790> viewing

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
wide-angle expands the native viewing

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.110 
wide-angle expands the native viewing
angle<00:03:55.540> x<00:03:55.660> 2<00:03:55.720> x<00:03:56.140> okay<00:03:56.710> so<00:03:56.920> let's<00:03:57.310> let's<00:03:57.700> look<00:03:57.940> at

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
angle x 2 x okay so let's let's look at

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.530 
angle x 2 x okay so let's let's look at
how<00:03:58.300> it<00:03:58.360> looks<00:03:58.690> through<00:03:59.410> the<00:03:59.440> lens<00:04:01.170> here<00:04:02.170> is

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
how it looks through the lens here is

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.030 
how it looks through the lens here is
the<00:04:04.540> first<00:04:04.720> shot<00:04:05.020> I'm<00:04:05.170> gonna<00:04:05.290> take<00:04:05.560> here<00:04:05.860> is

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
the first shot I'm gonna take here is

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.870 
the first shot I'm gonna take here is
just<00:04:06.340> but<00:04:06.700> with<00:04:07.360> with<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:07.890> wide<00:04:08.890> angle<00:04:09.340> lens

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
just but with with the wide angle lens

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.990 
just but with with the wide angle lens
and<00:04:10.620> we're<00:04:11.620> going<00:04:11.800> to<00:04:11.830> compare<00:04:12.280> it<00:04:12.340> to<00:04:12.520> the<00:04:12.700> one

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
and we're going to compare it to the one

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.199 
and we're going to compare it to the one
to<00:04:13.990> see<00:04:14.200> how<00:04:14.410> it<00:04:14.590> looks<00:04:14.800> just<00:04:15.010> with<00:04:15.460> a<00:04:15.490> regular

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
to see how it looks just with a regular

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.039 
to see how it looks just with a regular
photo<00:04:17.250> just<00:04:18.250> without<00:04:18.700> any<00:04:19.000> lens<00:04:19.359> just<00:04:19.690> taking

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
photo just without any lens just taking

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.160 
photo just without any lens just taking
it<00:04:20.170> through<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.560> iphone<00:04:21.040> 5<00:04:21.370> and<00:04:21.810> you<00:04:22.810> can<00:04:22.990> see

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
it through the iphone 5 and you can see

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.140 
it through the iphone 5 and you can see
that<00:04:23.410> there<00:04:23.590> are<00:04:23.830> quite<00:04:24.520> a<00:04:24.580> bit<00:04:24.700> of<00:04:24.970> difference

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
that there are quite a bit of difference
