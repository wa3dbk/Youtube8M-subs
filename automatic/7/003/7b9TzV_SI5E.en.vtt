00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
that so let's get into the review so the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.779 
that so let's get into the review so the
presently<00:00:55.230> seems<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.890> vary<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.250> little<00:00:56.370> bit<00:00:56.520> I

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
presently seems to vary a little bit I

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.099 
presently seems to vary a little bit I
think<00:00:56.820> some<00:00:57.180> girls<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.510> found<00:00:57.719> them<00:00:57.899> for

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
think some girls have found them for

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.349 
think some girls have found them for
about<00:00:58.170> 3<00:00:58.559> 99<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.309> then<00:00:59.340> every<00:00:59.969> time<00:01:00.000> I've

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
about 3 99 and then every time I've

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.389 
about 3 99 and then every time I've
purchased<00:01:00.600> them<00:01:00.899> they've<00:01:01.140> been<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:01.590> 39<00:01:02.039> and

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
purchased them they've been for 39 and

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.189 
purchased them they've been for 39 and
sometimes<00:01:02.730> buy<00:01:02.850> one<00:01:03.030> get<00:01:03.120> one<00:01:03.180> half<00:01:03.329> off<00:01:03.629> so

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
sometimes buy one get one half off so

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.289 
sometimes buy one get one half off so
still<00:01:04.470> very<00:01:04.920> very<00:01:05.040> affordable<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.090> price

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
still very very affordable so the price

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.910 
still very very affordable so the price
is<00:01:06.330> great<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.500> what<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> packaging

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
is great this is what the packaging

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.590 
is great this is what the packaging
looks<00:01:08.220> like<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.850> kind<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.060> traditional

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
looks like it's kind of traditional

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.649 
looks like it's kind of traditional
Milani<00:01:10.049> shiny<00:01:10.799> gold<00:01:11.159> packaging<00:01:11.939> it's<00:01:12.510> a

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
Milani shiny gold packaging it's a

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.570 
Milani shiny gold packaging it's a
little<00:01:12.869> bit<00:01:12.990> bulky<00:01:13.530> that's<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.130> only<00:01:14.369> kind<00:01:14.400> of

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
little bit bulky that's the only kind of

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.120 
little bit bulky that's the only kind of
negative<00:01:15.030> i<00:01:15.180> would<00:01:15.360> say<00:01:15.540> about<00:01:15.659> them<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.860> get

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
negative i would say about them you get

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.710 
negative i would say about them you get
for<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.360> 439<00:01:18.960> or<00:01:19.200> 399<00:01:19.710> or<00:01:20.009> whatever<00:01:20.310> they<00:01:20.460> cost

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
for the 439 or 399 or whatever they cost

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.859 
for the 439 or 399 or whatever they cost
you<00:01:21.720> get<00:01:21.960> 0<00:01:22.140> point<00:01:22.409> 0<00:01:22.500> 5<00:01:23.040> ounces<00:01:23.549> or<00:01:23.790> 1.4<00:01:24.659> grams

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
you get 0 point 0 5 ounces or 1.4 grams

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.810 
you get 0 point 0 5 ounces or 1.4 grams
so<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.500> great<00:01:25.799> amount<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.159> product<00:01:26.549> that's

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
so a great amount of product that's

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.420 
so a great amount of product that's
great<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:28.170> they<00:01:28.290> look<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
great and they look like this in the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.499 
great and they look like this in the
packaging<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.030> they<00:01:30.119> kind<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.360> have<00:01:30.479> that

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
packaging so they kind of have that

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.109 
packaging so they kind of have that
little<00:01:30.780> bit<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.200> dome<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:32.040> there<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.579> them<00:01:32.850> or

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
little bit of a dome in there in them or

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.480 
little bit of a dome in there in them or
like<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.299> dip<00:01:33.720> or<00:01:33.930> something<00:01:34.189> so<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.220> think<00:01:35.310> that

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
like a dip or something so I think that

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.520 
like a dip or something so I think that
kind<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.850> helps<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.630> know<00:01:36.750> match<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.259> sort<00:01:37.470> of

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
kind of helps you know match the sort of

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.160 
kind of helps you know match the sort of
jail<00:01:37.890> name<00:01:38.189> I'll<00:01:39.180> get<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.570> formula<00:01:39.990> later

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.810 
jail name I'll get to the formula later
and<00:01:40.409> talk<00:01:40.530> about<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> minute<00:01:41.250> but<00:01:41.430> just

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
and talk about that in a minute but just

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.249 
and talk about that in a minute but just
kind<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.030> wanted<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.360> mention<00:01:42.540> that's<00:01:43.079> what

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
kind of wanted to mention that's what

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.929

saw on the swatches they're very

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.370 
saw on the swatches they're very
pigmented<00:05:04.849> the<00:05:05.570> only<00:05:05.840> ones<00:05:06.020> that<00:05:06.139> are<00:05:06.229> maybe

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
pigmented the only ones that are maybe

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.469 
pigmented the only ones that are maybe
slightly<00:05:06.800> less<00:05:07.190> pigmented<00:05:07.729> are<00:05:07.970> the<00:05:08.090> satin

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
slightly less pigmented are the satin

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.659 
slightly less pigmented are the satin
matte<00:05:08.660> but<00:05:09.470> I<00:05:09.770> think<00:05:09.979> that's<00:05:10.099> just<00:05:10.250> kind<00:05:10.610> of

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
matte but I think that's just kind of

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.480 
matte but I think that's just kind of
the<00:05:10.729> nature<00:05:10.970> of<00:05:11.289> matte<00:05:12.289> eyeshadows<00:05:13.039> you<00:05:13.370> know

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
the nature of matte eyeshadows you know

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.330 
the nature of matte eyeshadows you know
when<00:05:13.669> you<00:05:13.759> compare<00:05:14.180> this<00:05:14.599> one<00:05:14.870> to<00:05:14.979> like<00:05:15.979> this

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
when you compare this one to like this

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.089 
when you compare this one to like this
shadow<00:05:16.699> this<00:05:17.030> is<00:05:17.180> a<00:05:17.210> shimmer<00:05:17.650> it's<00:05:18.650> just<00:05:18.979> a

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
shadow this is a shimmer it's just a

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:21.879 
shadow this is a shimmer it's just a
really<00:05:19.400> dimensional<00:05:20.389> bright<00:05:20.930> pigmented

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
really dimensional bright pigmented

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.279 
really dimensional bright pigmented
shadow<00:05:22.280> whereas<00:05:23.150> this<00:05:23.300> is<00:05:23.479> more<00:05:23.720> of<00:05:23.750> that<00:05:23.870> kind

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
shadow whereas this is more of that kind

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:27.370 
shadow whereas this is more of that kind
of<00:05:24.380> boring<00:05:24.860> sort<00:05:25.370> of<00:05:25.520> a<00:05:25.639> matte<00:05:26.300> color<00:05:26.659> that

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
of boring sort of a matte color that

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.529 
of boring sort of a matte color that
really<00:05:27.860> completes<00:05:28.250> your<00:05:28.430> looks<00:05:28.729> it's<00:05:29.090> great

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539 
really completes your looks it's great

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:32.290 
really completes your looks it's great
for<00:05:29.870> transitioning<00:05:30.800> another<00:05:31.250> color<00:05:31.610> you<00:05:32.180> know

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
for transitioning another color you know

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.969 
for transitioning another color you know
if<00:05:32.389> you<00:05:32.510> use<00:05:32.659> this<00:05:32.810> by<00:05:32.990> itself<00:05:33.050> it's<00:05:33.680> not<00:05:33.860> going

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
if you use this by itself it's not going

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:35.950 
if you use this by itself it's not going
to<00:05:34.070> be<00:05:34.130> nearly<00:05:34.280> as<00:05:34.490> pretty<00:05:34.729> as<00:05:35.000> if<00:05:35.570> you<00:05:35.690> use

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
to be nearly as pretty as if you use

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.600 
to be nearly as pretty as if you use
something<00:05:36.289> to<00:05:36.440> blend<00:05:36.740> it<00:05:36.830> out<00:05:36.979> so<00:05:37.250> these

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
something to blend it out so these

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.460 
something to blend it out so these
really<00:05:38.000> do<00:05:38.240> serve<00:05:38.659> their<00:05:38.870> purpose<00:05:39.229> and<00:05:39.349> they

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
really do serve their purpose and they

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.080 
really do serve their purpose and they
have<00:05:39.650> a<00:05:39.680> place<00:05:40.010> and<00:05:40.310> I<00:05:40.699> think<00:05:40.909> that<00:05:41.000> they

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
have a place and I think that they

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.240 
have a place and I think that they
perform<00:05:41.479> great<00:05:41.690> as<00:05:42.470> far<00:05:42.710> as<00:05:42.740> how<00:05:42.919> they<00:05:43.070> work

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
perform great as far as how they work

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.070 
perform great as far as how they work
together<00:05:43.430> they<00:05:43.669> blend<00:05:44.270> really<00:05:44.449> well<00:05:44.599> they

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
together they blend really well they

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.320 
together they blend really well they
apply<00:05:45.470> really<00:05:45.830> easily<00:05:46.159> they're<00:05:46.760> not<00:05:47.030> too<00:05:47.300> soft

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
apply really easily they're not too soft

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.420 
apply really easily they're not too soft
so<00:05:47.870> they<00:05:47.960> don't<00:05:48.139> blend<00:05:48.440> together<00:05:48.650> or<00:05:49.190> blend

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
so they don't blend together or blend

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.270 
so they don't blend together or blend
away<00:05:49.750> they<00:05:50.750> don't<00:05:50.930> get<00:05:51.050> muddy<00:05:51.409> they<00:05:51.889> really

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
away they don't get muddy they really

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.060 
away they don't get muddy they really
work<00:05:52.550> very<00:05:52.759> well<00:05:53.150> together<00:05:53.599> they<00:05:54.349> last<00:05:54.710> really

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
work very well together they last really

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.279 
work very well together they last really
well<00:05:55.250> on<00:05:55.280> the<00:05:55.490> eyes<00:05:55.669> too<00:05:55.699> I<00:05:56.539> always<00:05:56.990> wear<00:05:57.259> a

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
well on the eyes too I always wear a

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:59.290 
well on the eyes too I always wear a
primer<00:05:57.620> with<00:05:57.979> any<00:05:58.250> kind<00:05:58.520> of<00:05:58.639> eyeshadow<00:05:59.030> that<00:05:59.120> I

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
primer with any kind of eyeshadow that I

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.510 
primer with any kind of eyeshadow that I
use<00:05:59.630> so<00:05:59.960> I<00:05:59.990> do<00:06:00.139> wear<00:06:00.440> a<00:06:00.470> primer<00:06:00.770> with<00:06:01.009> these<00:06:01.159> but

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
use so I do wear a primer with these but

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.610 
use so I do wear a primer with these but
they<00:06:01.940> were<00:06:02.000> very<00:06:02.419> well<00:06:02.990> throughout<00:06:03.289> the<00:06:03.470> day

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
they were very well throughout the day

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.010 
they were very well throughout the day
and<00:06:03.860> I<00:06:04.310> think<00:06:04.610> they<00:06:04.729> are<00:06:04.759> overall<00:06:05.330> great

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
and I think they are overall great

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.980 
and I think they are overall great
shadows<00:06:06.500> and<00:06:06.770> for<00:06:07.400> about<00:06:07.789> four<00:06:08.180> dollars<00:06:08.360> or<00:06:08.780> so

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
shadows and for about four dollars or so

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.710 
shadows and for about four dollars or so
I<00:06:09.229> think<00:06:09.530> they're<00:06:09.800> an<00:06:09.889> awesome<00:06:10.070> value<00:06:10.580> and<00:06:11.120> the

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
I think they're an awesome value and the

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.240 
I think they're an awesome value and the
only<00:06:11.900> thing<00:06:12.020> I<00:06:12.259> would<00:06:12.380> maybe<00:06:12.500> change<00:06:12.860> is<00:06:13.070> the

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
only thing I would maybe change is the

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.740 
only thing I would maybe change is the
packaging<00:06:13.669> I<00:06:13.820> would<00:06:14.000> make<00:06:14.150> them<00:06:14.270> a<00:06:14.300> little<00:06:14.539> bit

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
packaging I would make them a little bit

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.930 
packaging I would make them a little bit
more<00:06:14.960> compact<00:06:15.440> but<00:06:16.070> as<00:06:16.190> far<00:06:16.340> as<00:06:16.400> the<00:06:16.550> formula

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
more compact but as far as the formula

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.730 
more compact but as far as the formula
and<00:06:17.120> performance<00:06:17.630> and<00:06:17.810> the<00:06:17.930> color<00:06:18.169> range<00:06:18.440> I

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
and performance and the color range I

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.469 
and performance and the color range I
think<00:06:19.099> they're<00:06:19.250> awesome<00:06:19.280> and<00:06:19.759> really<00:06:20.150> really

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 
think they're awesome and really really
