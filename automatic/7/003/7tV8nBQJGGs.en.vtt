they damage the cells and kill many
cells<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:43.370> produce<00:02:43.550> disease

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
cells and produce disease

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.920 
cells and produce disease
so<00:02:45.080> this<00:02:45.640> stops<00:02:46.640> this<00:02:46.910> damage<00:02:47.360> of<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.690> cells
