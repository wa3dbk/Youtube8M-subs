00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:09.580
 Hello. Now, let's start a flash course. 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:13.780
 In the last lesson, I explained twin animation. 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:18.820
 Among them break I've animated the description of the chef Ching 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:22.570
 Frame Animation and Full Animation Action School k Flash Animation 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.529
 In the words jindago kind of animation so divided into three 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.510
 I gave it to you. 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:30.429
 Among them , shape animation and motion animation exist in twin animation. 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.510
 I told you this. 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:39.070
 I can not tell you that the lecture is not running for 10 minutes. 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:45.100
 Not like once again like to explain to the chef to putting the finishing 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:48.760
 The party will screen the files that were attached in my last lecture that I 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.239
 I think you guys will have it. 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:57.370
 Let's look at it again and give us some ideas. 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:59.170
 Then open a new window again and try again to explain the SHIFT 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.910
 I'll take you in once. 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.439
 Like a magpie on a shelf in putting this course I also want the same 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.549
 The explanation for some language 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:14.740
 So now I will at first try to continue this course one also 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:19.750
 Do the same on the left side and draw another shape on the right side 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:24.460
 Let 's try this one. Now this time, 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:29.710
 In this lecture, I changed the color to green and made a circle. 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:35.350
 I will see it. If I draw a circle on the left side, it will automatically go to # 1. 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:38.409
 Black the gray rectangle showing so that the data is so 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.880
 I hope you understand that it is a point. 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.630
 I'll change the name to shape in Layera 1 , double-click it. 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.630
 Please 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:53.090
 I'll write it as a shape. 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:58.090
 Now let's click on the 50th frame with your mouse. 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:01.039
 In the last lecture wrote a circular to right with me making an empty frame 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:06.530
 I worked on the data. 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:10.789
 This time, you change the position of the same eater and change the shape of the immune 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:16.250
 I'll try to do it. Now, when I do, 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:21.860
 To change the scene while extending to frame 60, fox 10, f 5 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.989
 Key is to extend only scene f to a change to the extended scenes 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.920
 Please press key 6. 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:32.569
 Well, strictly speaking, you can think of it as a kind of replication function . 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:37.280
 If you press the 50th frame and the 1st frame at the intersection like this, 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:41.269
 If you press the 50th frame at an intersection , there is no change in shape and no change in position 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:46.730
 You can check that the same data is in the same place. 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:49.549
 The result is that the scene from 1 to 49 is the same as 50 times 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.840
 You can think of it as a clone. 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:58.700
 No. 50 pressing the frame pushes haejusimyeon the data move to the next 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:03.470
 You can do this using the black n Selection Tool Selection Tool 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:08.150
 So, the same data has been repositioned like this. 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:12.920
 I explained how it could be implemented . 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.450
 The parties will try again to apply the same shape floating chair 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.400
 Click 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:24.319
 1've no time frame or between 50 times since then click on the bottom 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:29.810
 Let's implement the shape in the part called trim . 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:33.889
 When the mistake is applied properly, the frame goes from gray to light green 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:38.720
 You can see that there is a solid arrow 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:42.079
 Let's try it out. Let's move from left to right. 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.380
 You can see that animation is implemented 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.300
 by the way 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:52.130
 The shape of the boot must be a change in appearance is not such a thing to happen 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:56.390
 Shape King is the main purpose of the change. 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:04:00.350
 It's a good idea to build various animations by using 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.810
 There are also features that can be modified so only the daily position without words 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:07.940
 I have a choice. 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:12.560
 Uh 10 o'clock on, press it once more sure word cool on the stage frame 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:16.549
 The next time you press the toolbox, 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.880
 If that'll then click on the section that allows you to adjust the angle of the air so 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:24.350
 Baum, where you come like this 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:27.650
 After pressing the assist key or after pressing the Alt key, 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.170
 When pressed with the sheet, and thus pulling the clock occurs, the size change 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:34.100
 Here it is this much would be greatly 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:37.610
 If so, this time, go to Frame 1, and we'll cut it down a bit. 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:42.560
 Let's cut it down with r2 and ct pressed. 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:47.720
 Because it is not a symbol now , 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:52.700
 If you want to reduce the size proportionally, you have to press r2 57 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:58.640
 If the symbol is later determined, will there be some hot-key features? 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:59.690
 And do not get confused. Okay, then number one was a smaller circle, number 50 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.520
 It's bigger. 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:09.650
 When you hit Enter, you get a change in size as you move. 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:11.960
 The change of position and the shit that can give a big change is also the same as that of Shelsting 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:17.660
 This is characteristic. 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:22.040
 But ultimately the purpose of shaping is to change the size of the position of change 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:23.420
 I think that we use it most when we do model changes. 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.410
 I'll give it to you. 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.430
 So how can you make a change in the shape of the 50th frame click 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.870
 Please do it. 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:35.080
 This ensures that the data in frame 50 is selected on the stage. 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:39.429
 When this happens 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:43.929
 Release the mouse once on the stage, then move the mouse 

00:05:39.429 --> 00:05:45.399
 If you put it on the bottom of the mouse point, the arc will come out . 

00:05:43.929 --> 00:05:49.719
 Part came out 

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:51.429
 In this case, when you push the left button , 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:55.239
 You can 

00:05:51.429 --> 00:06:00.459
 Such a feature that a shape change can occur in a person 2 

00:05:55.239 --> 00:06:04.929
 As a result, this kind of shape that the left and 

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:06.579
 It is not a symbol or a symbol, and each element of the four tabas 

00:06:04.929 --> 00:06:11.349
 It is possible 

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:13.089
 That is to say, the most basic condition for she's chinging is the brain 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:16.629
 With a vector image 

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:17.529
 What's highs vector shapes that you see will enter Iran again hit 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:23.349
 I'll do it 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:28.389
 Then as the garden moves increasingly to 50, the deformed shape and size 

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:30.579
 Teuni out while you are automatically generated by the two chefs we Ting 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:35.110
 I can tell you this. 

00:06:30.579 --> 00:06:39.219
 So , in addition to this, the shape hint of the shell sting is changed so 10 points 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.360
 You can change the shape of the click so that you can give that reference point 

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:45.099
 There are some parts. 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:48.699
 In fact, if the parts do not claim the correct target 7 points, 

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:52.599
 There are a lot of things that do not work as well as you want 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:57.429
 Well, I personally think that some of those parts are more accurate 

00:06:52.599 --> 00:07:03.069
 I came to give some explanation I could be happy to ensure a clean concept 

00:06:57.429 --> 00:07:07.689
 I also like to use the function of that silpin t do not work 

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:12.129
 That's because I have a lot of people here 

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:15.489
 Let's cool it. Actually, the motion-to-be part is rather more than the shape team. 

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:19.239
 If you can understand a little about it 

00:07:15.489 --> 00:07:23.110
 Let 's hit it once again and see if the shape changes 

00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:28.149
 I hope you guys have a lot of practice. 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:29.289
 This was the ultimate goal in shaping. 

00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:32.739
 I will. 

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:37.329
 So the shelf putting course zest to fit yijeongdoro 

00:07:32.739 --> 00:07:42.129
 In fact, there is a way to toward the characters is how to use the cl-stick back 

00:07:37.329 --> 00:07:44.349
 This is because I'm going to mention it again for a moment 

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:49.329
 I'll finish it. 

00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:54.699
 This tutorial is a two-step process that explains how shaping works. 

00:07:49.329 --> 00:07:59.110
 I explained to you that when you look at the lecture, 

00:07:54.699 --> 00:08:03.099
 The parts that are not e-mailed or commented or you 

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:05.169
 What Naver intellectuals yiradeunji in the car the way once more find those Notes 

00:08:03.099 --> 00:08:09.839
 Maybe you should see 

00:08:05.169 --> 00:08:09.839
 Let's finish this lecture. Thank you.
