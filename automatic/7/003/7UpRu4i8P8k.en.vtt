00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.430
 the number two in my irish top 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:22.060
 The list is the big all-rounder 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.550
 bio how should you always have it with you 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.230
 because they use brook trout just as well 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.659
 like salmon and sea trout come 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.130
 can 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:32.500
 supposedly the bio is supposed to be white there 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.440
 Care mimic a sect that it only 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.390
 when the hawthorn flowers but ours 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.309
 artificial videos from fischer vom 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.309
 first to the last day of 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:26.940
 credit suisse 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.830
 but now to my variant of the video 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:22.250
 Hook size vary from 8 to 16 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.640
 I take a tenth here that is 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.750
 practically a standard and comes first 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:33.709
 then attach it thread on it as always 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:39.080
 as a basis for the fly there is now 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.590
 many pictures the bibione a day 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.830
 tie 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.230
 but I like it very well find it 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.540
 I put it in here again 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.810
 the silver-colored or silver wire what 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.000
 always want to take 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.430
 and he walks around three times and there he is 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.890
 our day or stallion like us already 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.320
 knowledge 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.660
 The body of the bio is black 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.200
 made of red and black floss 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.570
 the trick is just that the black one 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:13.640
 It is divided into two productions 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:16.519
 find now only in the black and 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.160
 this will now be about 25 percent of 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.459
 body bound so beautifully slim 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.459
 his 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:32.989
 I 'm a tailor from time to time 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:37.310
 200 mm bronze and now comes the red 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:40.760
 pay is about 50 now 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.530
 percent of the body we make out so 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.610
 you have to do that a few more times 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.610
 settle here 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:04.900
 the last part of the body the third 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:07.510
 black again pay page I am a 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.600
 and make sure that front enough again 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.050
 place is to hack after 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.050
 get 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:22.390
 I think so 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:23.910
 Switzerland from which would for the bio can 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:28.500
 To be long 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.500
 also cheer about hard length 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:36.640
 the excellent again stand out 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.810
 I do not need the well and here 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.520
 I'll take the first one again 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.440
 Pieces away 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.210
 but as always I'm over 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.210
 know about hooking it after repository 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:50.370
 do 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:52.540
 Now I'm the thing 167 times around 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.200
 so that you do not involve in the process 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.300
 slips 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.560
 this would be home wrapped around me 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.740
 that means that they are over the whole 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.960
 body stretches 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:08.440
 just make sure that this 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.020
 single windings far or relatively 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.570
 Far apart are the red ones 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.610
 shining through the body and not 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.700
 under the black one would have lost completely 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.390
 going 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.610
 Now I'll take mine again 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.669
 silver wire and find the contrary to the 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.430
 windows direction of the echl and how one 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:30.000
 wonder 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:32.680
 The hacker shifters stay upright 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.960
 and if not involved still 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:40.390
 a little bit against that I start 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.780
 tie me here with the one now 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.780
 hazards 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:06:02.860
 and cut the back we can here 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:06:06.310
 gone, too, the polymer of it will take place as 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:10.300
 always at the end of a fly in the whole 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:11.220
 decisive thing ten and twelve times 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:23.890
 around or something 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:29.200
 until you have really nice headnotes and 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:34.360
 there is a bio that is just a drop 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:40.290
 paint board and then fish for us 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:43.290
 formulated and still the error is 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.290
 perform
