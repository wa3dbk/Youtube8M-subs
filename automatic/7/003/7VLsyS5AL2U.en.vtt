00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
like if you take a guy first overall

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.270 
like if you take a guy first overall
he's<00:01:16.479> got<00:01:16.630> a<00:01:16.660> starter<00:01:17.080> no<00:01:17.410> I<00:01:17.440> think<00:01:17.800> it's<00:01:18.100> every

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
he's got a starter no I think it's every

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.560 
he's got a starter no I think it's every
situation<00:01:18.789> is<00:01:18.820> different<00:01:18.880> every

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
situation is different every

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.940 
situation is different every
quarterbacks<00:01:19.960> different<00:01:20.320> summer<00:01:20.530> more

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
quarterbacks different summer more

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.889 
quarterbacks different summer more
advanced<00:01:21.940> than<00:01:21.970> others<00:01:22.330> in<00:01:22.360> terms<00:01:22.600> of<00:01:22.750> their

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
advanced than others in terms of their

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.529 
advanced than others in terms of their
little<00:01:23.220> mentally<00:01:24.220> ahead<00:01:24.490> of<00:01:24.610> the<00:01:24.670> game<00:01:24.850> where

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
little mentally ahead of the game where

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:28.230 
little mentally ahead of the game where
they<00:01:25.659> you<00:01:26.050> can<00:01:26.380> go<00:01:26.500> ahead<00:01:26.590> and<00:01:26.710> plan<00:01:27.009> so<00:01:27.789> some

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
they you can go ahead and plan so some

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.340 
they you can go ahead and plan so some
quarterbacks<00:01:28.479> need<00:01:28.750> a<00:01:28.780> little<00:01:28.960> bit<00:01:29.050> more<00:01:29.200> time

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
quarterbacks need a little bit more time

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.080 
quarterbacks need a little bit more time
so

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
so

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.789 
so
Aaron<00:01:30.299> Rodgers<00:01:30.630> benefited<00:01:31.380> from<00:01:31.439> having<00:01:31.590> a
