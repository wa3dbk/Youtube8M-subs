00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
off-white and we're going to make them

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.070 
off-white and we're going to make them
red<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:25.230> do<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.500> I'm<00:00:26.039> going<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.430> use

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
red and to do that I'm going to use

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.189 
red and to do that I'm going to use
fabric<00:00:28.080> mate<00:00:28.490> die<00:00:29.490> marker<00:00:30.029> with<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.599> chisel<00:00:30.869> tip

fabric mate die marker with a chisel tip
it's<00:00:31.859> actually<00:00:32.189> very<00:00:32.309> easy<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.850> do<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:34.040> want

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
it's actually very easy to do you want

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.520 
it's actually very easy to do you want
to<00:00:35.309> grab<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.239> marker<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.809> just<00:00:37.320> start

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
to grab the marker and just start

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.340 
to grab the marker and just start
working<00:00:37.680> along<00:00:38.160> on<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:39.570> stitching<00:00:39.960> itself

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
working along on the stitching itself

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.160 
working along on the stitching itself
don't<00:00:40.800> worry<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.250> you're<00:00:41.430> getting<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.170> to

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
don't worry that you're getting it on to

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.010 
don't worry that you're getting it on to
the<00:00:43.469> leather<00:00:43.680> alongside<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.789> stitching<00:00:45.210> go

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
the leather alongside the stitching go

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.750 
the leather alongside the stitching go
over<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.469> couple<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.829> times<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.340> can<00:00:47.550> work

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
over it a couple of times you can work

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.520 
over it a couple of times you can work
about<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.450> foot<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:50.250> stitches<00:00:50.879> at<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> time

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
about a foot of the stitches at a time

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.389 
about a foot of the stitches at a time
or<00:00:52.530> at<00:00:52.620> least<00:00:52.770> that's<00:00:52.949> what<00:00:53.010> I've<00:00:53.160> been<00:00:53.190> doing

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
or at least that's what I've been doing

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.470 
or at least that's what I've been doing
you<00:00:54.239> can<00:00:54.390> certainly<00:00:54.570> do<00:00:54.930> more<00:00:55.739> or<00:00:56.129> less

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
you can certainly do more or less

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.840 
you can certainly do more or less
because<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.870> die<00:00:58.079> takes<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.010> long<00:00:59.190> time<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.670> dry

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
because the die takes a long time to dry

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.930 
because the die takes a long time to dry
the<00:01:00.809> marker<00:01:01.079> says<00:01:01.289> 24<00:01:01.829> hours<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.760> works

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
the marker says 24 hours and that works

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.990 
the marker says 24 hours and that works
for<00:01:03.090> our<00:01:03.149> advantage<00:01:03.600> because<00:01:03.920> we<00:01:04.920> lay<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.909> out

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
for our advantage because we lay it out

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.600 
for our advantage because we lay it out
here<00:01:06.060> all<00:01:06.810> along<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:08.130> see<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.490> it's

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
here all along and you can see that it's

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.000 
here all along and you can see that it's
seeping<00:01:08.880> into<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.299> stitches<00:01:09.869> it's<00:01:10.500> also<00:01:10.650> kind

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
seeping into the stitches it's also kind

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.880 
seeping into the stitches it's also kind
of<00:01:11.100> laying<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.670> side<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.180> leather<00:01:12.330> and

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
of laying on the side of the leather and

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.530 
of laying on the side of the leather and
that's<00:01:13.890> not<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.070> problem<00:01:14.310> because<00:01:14.790> after<00:01:15.390> we

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
that's not a problem because after we

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.050 
that's not a problem because after we
have<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.840> done<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> little<00:01:16.860> ways<00:01:17.100> then<00:01:17.700> we<00:01:17.909> take

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
have it done a little ways then we take

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
have it done a little ways then we take
a<00:01:18.380> rag<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.700> simply<00:01:20.700> wipe<00:01:21.509> along<00:01:21.869> the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
a rag and simply wipe along the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.950 
a rag and simply wipe along the
stitching<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.830> we've<00:01:23.040> dyed<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.750> what<00:01:24.750> it'll

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
stitching that we've dyed and what it'll

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.450 
stitching that we've dyed and what it'll
do<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:26.159> will<00:01:26.400> soak<00:01:26.790> up<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.650> extra<00:01:28.650> dye<00:01:28.979> that

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
do is it will soak up the extra dye that

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.190 
do is it will soak up the extra dye that
is<00:01:29.610> on<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.850> leather<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.840> not<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
is on the leather but not on the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.450 
is on the leather but not on the
stitching<00:01:31.530> because<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:31.920> already<00:01:32.070> soaked

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
stitching because it's already soaked

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.069 
stitching because it's already soaked
into<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.790> stitching<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.329> it's<00:01:33.630> not<00:01:33.810> coming

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
into the stitching and it's not coming

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.069 
into the stitching and it's not coming
out<00:01:34.229> anytime<00:01:34.590> soon<00:01:35.000> so<00:01:36.000> there<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.240> go<00:01:36.390> take

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
out anytime soon so there you go take

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.910 
out anytime soon so there you go take
your<00:01:37.229> time<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:38.750> work<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.990> whole<00:01:40.170> interior

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
and in no time at all you can have

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.210 
and in no time at all you can have
yourself<00:01:44.420> custom<00:01:45.420> stitching<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.680> whatever

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
that much more expensive cars would have

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.550 
that much more expensive cars would have
had<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.600> shame<00:01:54.600> for<00:01:54.630> didn't<00:01:55.110> give<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.439> us

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
had a shame for didn't give that to us

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.090 
had a shame for didn't give that to us
but<00:01:55.770> we<00:01:56.189> can<00:01:56.219> do<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.549> ourselves<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:57.930> markers<00:01:58.860> I

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
but we can do it ourselves the markers I

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.030 
but we can do it ourselves the markers I
picked<00:01:59.549> up<00:01:59.700> at<00:02:00.030> Hobby<00:02:00.509> Lobby<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.110> they're

picked up at Hobby Lobby and they're

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.060 
picked up at Hobby Lobby and they're
