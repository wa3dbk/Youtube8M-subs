for<00:00:48.909> Teixeira<00:00:49.600> not<00:00:49.900> so<00:00:50.140> much<00:00:50.580> because<00:00:51.580> of<00:00:51.850> his

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940

UFC 144 we hear reports of him

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:05.039 
UFC 144 we hear reports of him
increasingly<00:01:03.150> being<00:01:04.150> out<00:01:04.360> of<00:01:04.390> shaping<00:01:04.690> camp

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
increasingly being out of shaping camp

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.270 
increasingly being out of shaping camp
at<00:01:05.229> 262<00:01:06.130> to<00:01:07.090> 55<00:01:07.540> to<00:01:07.750> 60<00:01:08.200> and<00:01:08.380> then<00:01:08.770> he's<00:01:08.920> making

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
at 262 to 55 to 60 and then he's making

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.789 
at 262 to 55 to 60 and then he's making
those<00:01:09.369> drastic<00:01:09.909> weight<00:01:10.119> cuts<00:01:10.390> um<00:01:10.720> and<00:01:11.260> it

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
those drastic weight cuts um and it

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.320 
those drastic weight cuts um and it
seems<00:01:11.979> like<00:01:12.159> he's<00:01:12.369> going<00:01:12.670> down<00:01:12.909> and<00:01:13.150> weight

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
seems like he's going down and weight

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.850 
seems like he's going down and weight
and<00:01:13.450> getting<00:01:13.630> in<00:01:13.810> shape<00:01:14.049> just<00:01:14.350> to<00:01:14.470> get<00:01:14.650> paid

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
and getting in shape just to get paid

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.920 
and getting in shape just to get paid
rather<00:01:15.220> than<00:01:15.490> Teixeira<00:01:16.030> who's<00:01:16.240> gonna<00:01:16.450> be

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
rather than Teixeira who's gonna be

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.660 
rather than Teixeira who's gonna be
dropping<00:01:17.320> that<00:01:17.560> way<00:01:17.740> who's<00:01:18.159> also<00:01:18.340> a<00:01:18.490> huge

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
dropping that way who's also a huge

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.940 
dropping that way who's also a huge
light<00:01:18.850> heavyweight<00:01:19.210> to<00:01:20.170> come<00:01:20.350> to<00:01:20.470> win<00:01:20.650> it

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
light heavyweight to come to win it

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.740 
light heavyweight to come to win it
seems<00:01:21.250> like<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.610> shares<00:01:21.850> very<00:01:22.240> very<00:01:22.540> hungry

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
seems like the shares very very hungry

know<00:02:07.690> he's<00:02:07.930> so<00:02:08.080> talented<00:02:08.319> but<00:02:08.649> sometimes<00:02:09.039> he

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:09.159 
know he's so talented but sometimes he

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:10.979 
know he's so talented but sometimes he
doesn't<00:02:09.340> show<00:02:09.580> up<00:02:09.610> well<00:02:10.269> then<00:02:10.599> he<00:02:10.690> showed<00:02:10.869> up

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
doesn't show up well then he showed up

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.149 
doesn't show up well then he showed up
for<00:02:11.170> that<00:02:11.260> fight<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:11.590> surprised<00:02:11.860> a<00:02:11.890> lot<00:02:12.099> of

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:12.159 
for that fight and surprised a lot of

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.399 
for that fight and surprised a lot of
people<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:12.610> argue<00:02:12.790> arguably<00:02:13.450> one<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:13.870> so<00:02:14.230> that

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:14.409 
people and argue arguably one it so that

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:16.229 
people and argue arguably one it so that
certainly<00:02:14.709> is<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.920> possibility<00:02:15.159> with<00:02:15.819> rampage

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
certainly is a possibility with rampage

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.180 
certainly is a possibility with rampage
here<00:02:16.569> I'm<00:02:16.870> not<00:02:17.170> going<00:02:17.319> to<00:02:17.379> count<00:02:17.590> on<00:02:17.769> it<00:02:17.920> and

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
here I'm not going to count on it and

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.649 
here I'm not going to count on it and
even<00:02:18.370> if<00:02:18.459> he<00:02:18.519> does<00:02:18.730> show<00:02:18.760> up<00:02:19.000> in<00:02:19.120> decent<00:02:19.480> shape

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
even if he does show up in decent shape

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.899 
even if he does show up in decent shape
I<00:02:20.200> still<00:02:20.530> would<00:02:20.709> favor<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.190> share<00:02:21.370> slightly

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
I still would favor to share slightly

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.120 
I still would favor to share slightly
rampage<00:02:22.599> she's<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:22.930> flat-footed<00:02:23.440> boxer<00:02:24.069> and

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
rampage she's a flat-footed boxer and

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.920 
rampage she's a flat-footed boxer and
when<00:02:24.250> guys<00:02:24.400> throw<00:02:24.670> strikes<00:02:24.970> Tim<00:02:25.240> he<00:02:25.569> plants

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
when guys throw strikes Tim he plants

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.260 
when guys throw strikes Tim he plants
his<00:02:26.050> feet<00:02:26.260> he<00:02:26.470> covers<00:02:26.830> up<00:02:27.010> he<00:02:27.160> tucks<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.700> tries

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
his feet he covers up he tucks and tries

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.220 
his feet he covers up he tucks and tries
to<00:02:28.300> counter<00:02:28.569> what

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
to counter what

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.290 
to counter what
power<00:02:29.680> hooks<00:02:29.980> well<00:02:30.220> to<00:02:30.670> share<00:02:30.879> that<00:02:31.090> plays

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
power hooks well to share that plays

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.729 
power hooks well to share that plays
right<00:02:31.450> into<00:02:31.510> his<00:02:31.780> game<00:02:32.019> because<00:02:32.230> he<00:02:32.440> likes<00:02:32.620> to

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
right into his game because he likes to

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.410 
right into his game because he likes to
stay<00:02:32.980> at<00:02:33.129> range<00:02:33.340> throw<00:02:33.700> straight<00:02:33.940> punches

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
stay at range throw straight punches

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.839 
stay at range throw straight punches
long<00:02:34.810> kicks<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:35.769> I<00:02:36.099> think<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.549> share<00:02:36.760> is

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
long kicks so I think to share is

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.160 
long kicks so I think to share is
probably<00:02:37.120> going<00:02:37.239> to<00:02:37.330> pick<00:02:37.480> them<00:02:37.629> apart<00:02:37.720> and

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
probably going to pick them apart and

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.720 
probably going to pick them apart and
then<00:02:38.349> you<00:02:38.500> ought<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.620> also<00:02:38.830> consider<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.580> fact

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
then you ought to also consider the fact

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.580 
then you ought to also consider the fact
that<00:02:39.819> maybe<00:02:40.000> rampage<00:02:40.420> does<00:02:40.690> come<00:02:40.930> in<00:02:41.080> really

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
that maybe rampage does come in really

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.229 
that maybe rampage does come in really
unmotivated<00:02:41.980> out<00:02:42.430> of<00:02:42.580> shape<00:02:42.760> then<00:02:42.970> that<00:02:43.090> makes

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
unmotivated out of shape then that makes

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.240 
unmotivated out of shape then that makes
me<00:02:43.420> like<00:02:43.569> to<00:02:43.780> share<00:02:43.959> it<00:02:44.110> even<00:02:44.379> more<00:02:44.530> so<00:02:44.830> I<00:02:45.010> do

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
me like to share it even more so I do

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.860 
me like to share it even more so I do
think<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.580> line<00:02:45.730> might<00:02:45.940> be<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.060> tiny<00:02:46.390> bit<00:02:46.540> hind

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
think the line might be a tiny bit hind

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.089 
think the line might be a tiny bit hind
when<00:02:47.049> the<00:02:47.110> fight<00:02:47.260> actually<00:02:47.590> comes<00:02:47.769> around<00:02:48.040> I

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
when the fight actually comes around I

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.559 
when the fight actually comes around I
hope<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.370> get<00:02:48.489> a<00:02:48.549> little<00:02:48.819> bit<00:02:48.940> lower<00:02:49.090> line<00:02:49.330> into

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
hope to get a little bit lower line into

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.150 
hope to get a little bit lower line into
share<00:02:49.750> before<00:02:49.959> I<00:02:50.110> lay<00:02:50.230> my<00:02:50.379> personal<00:02:50.799> money<00:02:50.920> on

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
share before I lay my personal money on

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.979 
share before I lay my personal money on
them<00:02:51.310> but<00:02:51.700> for<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.060> sake<00:02:52.209> of<00:02:52.239> show<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.569> will<00:02:52.840> put

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
them but for the sake of show I will put

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.030 
them but for the sake of show I will put
my<00:02:53.019> money<00:02:53.230> on<00:02:53.319> him<00:02:53.470> because<00:02:53.590> I<00:02:53.769> definitely

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
my money on him because I definitely

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.589 
my money on him because I definitely
think<00:02:54.220> he's<00:02:54.400> more<00:02:54.610> likely<00:02:54.790> winner<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.360> there

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
think he's more likely winner and there

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.360 
think he's more likely winner and there
is<00:02:55.720> not<00:02:55.840> enough<00:02:56.140> value<00:02:56.440> on<00:02:56.560> rampage<00:02:56.920> not<00:02:57.160> even

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
is not enough value on rampage not even

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.460 
is not enough value on rampage not even
