need a flash so let's go ahead and try
and<00:02:32.709> let's<00:02:33.430> try<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:33.730> get<00:02:33.819> a<00:02:33.879> shot<00:02:34.090> at<00:02:34.299> this

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
and let's try and get a shot at this

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.210 
and let's try and get a shot at this
thing<00:02:34.599> we've<00:02:34.840> got<00:02:35.019> into<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.410> train<00:02:35.650> position

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
thing we've got into the train position

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.940 
thing we've got into the train position
right<00:02:36.849> about<00:02:37.030> in<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.209> center<00:02:37.480> of<00:02:37.950> these

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
right about in the center of these

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
right about in the center of these
psyche<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.690> get<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.810> light<00:02:41.049> stand<00:02:41.970> pretty

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
psyche and get the light stand pretty

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.210 
psyche and get the light stand pretty
much<00:02:43.180> right<00:02:43.450> near<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:43.750> front<00:02:43.930> so<00:02:44.890> what<00:02:45.099> we're

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
much right near the front so what we're

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.979 
much right near the front so what we're
going<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.370> do<00:02:45.579> is<00:02:45.849> just<00:02:46.030> get<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.239> bounce<00:02:46.540> cards

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
going to do is just get the bounce cards

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.559 
going to do is just get the bounce cards
as<00:02:47.170> close<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.220> edge<00:02:48.579> of<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:48.940> frame<00:02:49.299> of<00:02:49.510> the

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
as close to the edge of the frame of the

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.990 
as close to the edge of the frame of the
shot<00:02:49.840> as<00:02:50.110> possible<00:02:50.709> so<00:02:51.400> that<00:02:51.430> we<00:02:51.640> can<00:02:51.790> really

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
shot as possible so that we can really

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.150 
shot as possible so that we can really
highlight<00:02:52.269> all<00:02:52.599> the<00:02:52.720> detail<00:02:53.110> of<00:02:53.260> this<00:02:53.380> of<00:02:53.590> the

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
highlight all the detail of this of the

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.970 
highlight all the detail of this of the
Train<00:02:54.640> and<00:02:54.989> then<00:02:55.989> we're<00:02:56.349> going<00:02:56.500> to<00:02:56.530> set<00:02:56.799> this

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
Train and then we're going to set this

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.830 
Train and then we're going to set this
and<00:02:57.519> just<00:02:57.730> be<00:02:57.880> real<00:02:58.060> still<00:02:58.329> with<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:58.630> as<00:02:58.750> we

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
and just be real still with it as we

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.309 
and just be real still with it as we
take<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.110> shot<00:02:59.140> let's<00:02:59.620> see<00:02:59.739> what<00:02:59.860> happens

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.569 

that<00:03:05.319> looks<00:03:05.500> pretty<00:03:05.650> good<00:03:05.769> not<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.370> lot<00:03:06.549> of

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
that looks pretty good not a lot of

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.190 
that looks pretty good not a lot of
shadow<00:03:06.850> it's<00:03:07.060> just<00:03:07.239> an<00:03:07.359> infinite<00:03:07.630> background

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
shadow it's just an infinite background

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.479 
shadow it's just an infinite background
and<00:03:08.380> those<00:03:08.470> are<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.709> two<00:03:08.889> things<00:03:09.160> that<00:03:09.340> are

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
and those are the two things that are

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.920 
and those are the two things that are
really<00:03:09.819> important<00:03:10.269> when<00:03:10.299> you're<00:03:10.540> taking<00:03:10.870> a

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
really important when you're taking a

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.930 
really important when you're taking a
shot<00:03:11.139> particularly<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:11.920> a<00:03:11.980> product<00:03:12.370> you<00:03:12.579> want

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
shot particularly of a product you want

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.879 
shot particularly of a product you want
to<00:03:13.180> have<00:03:13.269> color<00:03:13.569> corrected<00:03:14.170> accurate<00:03:14.680> light

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:14.889 
to have color corrected accurate light

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:16.259 
to have color corrected accurate light
and<00:03:15.130> you<00:03:15.549> want<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.819> have<00:03:15.880> a<00:03:15.940> seamless

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
and you want to have a seamless

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.819 
and you want to have a seamless
background<00:03:16.660> so<00:03:17.200> that<00:03:17.230> people<00:03:17.650> pay<00:03:17.799> attention

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
background so that people pay attention

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.470 
background so that people pay attention
to<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.310> product<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:18.850> not<00:03:18.940> everything<00:03:19.299> else

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
to the product and not everything else

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.940 
to the product and not everything else
in<00:03:19.600> the<00:03:19.690> picture<00:03:19.840> that's<00:03:20.319> what<00:03:20.470> my<00:03:20.620> studio

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
in the picture that's what my studio

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.740 
in the picture that's what my studio
does<00:03:21.160> for<00:03:21.370> even<00:03:21.819> with<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:21.970> simple<00:03:22.329> camera<00:03:22.480> like

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
does for even with a simple camera like

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.960 
does for even with a simple camera like
this<00:03:22.900> let's<00:03:23.590> try<00:03:23.769> it<00:03:23.829> with<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:23.980> red<00:03:24.220> frame<00:03:24.700> and

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
this let's try it with a red frame and

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.780 
this let's try it with a red frame and
see<00:03:25.120> if<00:03:25.180> we<00:03:25.269> get<00:03:25.359> the<00:03:25.420> same<00:03:25.690> result

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.220 

it's<00:03:31.790> a<00:03:31.909> little<00:03:32.209> darker<00:03:32.599> maybe<00:03:32.870> we're<00:03:33.079> going

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
it's a little darker maybe we're going

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.770 
it's a little darker maybe we're going
to<00:03:33.319> need<00:03:33.469> to<00:03:33.879> pull<00:03:34.879> these<00:03:35.030> in<00:03:35.269> and<00:03:35.480> see<00:03:35.599> if<00:03:35.659> we

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
to need to pull these in and see if we

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.949 
to need to pull these in and see if we
can<00:03:37.120> let's<00:03:38.120> give<00:03:38.269> it<00:03:38.329> a<00:03:38.359> shot<00:03:40.450> and<00:03:41.450> again<00:03:41.780> the

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
can let's give it a shot and again the

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.059 
can let's give it a shot and again the
only<00:03:42.079> thing<00:03:42.170> you're<00:03:42.439> going<00:03:42.590> to<00:03:42.650> see<00:03:42.829> in<00:03:42.950> that

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069

want to get them as close to the item as
we<00:04:11.000> can<00:04:11.650> but<00:04:12.650> not<00:04:13.099> in<00:04:13.370> our<00:04:13.549> frame<00:04:16.419> the<00:04:17.419> other

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
we can but not in our frame the other

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:18.879 
we can but not in our frame the other
thing<00:04:17.900> if<00:04:18.079> you're<00:04:18.259> looking<00:04:18.590> through<00:04:18.739> the

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
thing if you're looking through the

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.349 
thing if you're looking through the
camera<00:04:19.099> and<00:04:19.370> you<00:04:19.430> see<00:04:19.459> that<00:04:19.789> there<00:04:19.970> might<00:04:20.209> be<00:04:20.239> a

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
camera and you see that there might be a

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.290 
camera and you see that there might be a
little<00:04:20.630> bit<00:04:20.720> of<00:04:20.840> glare<00:04:21.470> on<00:04:21.650> your<00:04:22.039> item<00:04:22.370> you<00:04:22.639> can

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
little bit of glare on your item you can

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.080 
little bit of glare on your item you can
turn<00:04:23.840> off<00:04:24.169> the<00:04:24.560> ambient<00:04:25.039> lighting<00:04:25.250> to<00:04:25.789> get<00:04:25.970> the

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
turn off the ambient lighting to get the

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.150 
turn off the ambient lighting to get the
best<00:04:26.300> shot<00:04:26.720> it's<00:04:27.080> really<00:04:27.560> a<00:04:27.590> good<00:04:27.770> idea<00:04:28.070> to

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
best shot it's really a good idea to

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.640 
best shot it's really a good idea to
have<00:04:28.310> all<00:04:28.729> the<00:04:28.940> other<00:04:29.060> lights<00:04:29.360> off<00:04:29.690> but<00:04:30.410> if<00:04:30.530> you

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
have all the other lights off but if you

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.879 
have all the other lights off but if you
can't<00:04:30.919> do<00:04:31.099> that<00:04:31.930> turn<00:04:32.930> off<00:04:33.110> a<00:04:33.139> few<00:04:33.470> of<00:04:33.560> them<00:04:33.710> and

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
can't do that turn off a few of them and

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.460 
can't do that turn off a few of them and
that<00:04:34.039> can<00:04:34.220> help<00:04:34.370> as<00:04:34.639> well<00:04:34.940> to<00:04:35.810> remove<00:04:36.169> some<00:04:36.440> of

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
that can help as well to remove some of

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.860 
that can help as well to remove some of
the<00:04:36.620> glare<00:04:36.949> so<00:04:37.280> let's<00:04:37.490> see<00:04:37.669> what<00:04:37.849> that<00:04:37.880> does<00:04:38.570> as

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
the glare so let's see what that does as

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.149 
the glare so let's see what that does as
I<00:04:39.460> photograph<00:04:41.349> there<00:04:42.349> are<00:04:42.440> Maven<00:04:42.830> a<00:04:42.889> little

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:43.159 
I photograph there are Maven a little

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:46.060 
I photograph there are Maven a little
bit<00:04:43.310> too<00:04:43.460> much<00:04:43.580> glare<00:04:43.940> on<00:04:44.180> this<00:04:44.389> one<00:04:44.889> what<00:04:45.889> are

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
bit too much glare on this one what are

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.920 
bit too much glare on this one what are
some<00:04:46.370> more<00:04:46.490> lights<00:04:46.729> in<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.120> room<00:04:47.150> so<00:04:47.750> that

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
some more lights in the room so that

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.529 
some more lights in the room so that
just<00:04:48.229> the<00:04:48.320> wedding<00:04:48.770> from<00:04:49.010> my<00:04:49.820> studio<00:04:50.300> is

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
just the wedding from my studio is

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.600 
just the wedding from my studio is
really

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
really

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.730 
really
or<00:04:53.150> in<00:04:53.389> that<00:04:53.509> last<00:04:53.689> photo<00:04:53.990> that<00:04:54.139> we<00:04:54.289> took<00:04:54.319> we

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
or in that last photo that we took we

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.219 
or in that last photo that we took we
noticed<00:04:55.129> that<00:04:55.460> it<00:04:56.030> was<00:04:56.180> a<00:04:56.210> little<00:04:56.389> overexposed

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
noticed that it was a little overexposed

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.980 
noticed that it was a little overexposed
the<00:04:57.710> camera<00:04:58.069> setting<00:04:58.430> here<00:04:58.759> we<00:04:59.449> felt<00:04:59.689> like<00:04:59.750> it

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
the camera setting here we felt like it

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.839 
the camera setting here we felt like it
was<00:05:00.110> exposing<00:05:00.530> too<00:05:00.830> much<00:05:01.009> and<00:05:01.219> most<00:05:01.400> cameras

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
was exposing too much and most cameras

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:03.820 
was exposing too much and most cameras
today<00:05:02.150> allow<00:05:02.629> you<00:05:02.689> to<00:05:03.050> dial<00:05:03.259> in<00:05:03.530> what's<00:05:03.680> called

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
today allow you to dial in what's called

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:04.510 
today allow you to dial in what's called
an<00:05:03.979> exposure

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
an exposure

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.730 
an exposure
offset<00:05:05.000> where<00:05:05.689> you<00:05:05.750> can<00:05:05.900> either<00:05:06.080> reduce<00:05:06.229> the

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
offset where you can either reduce the

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.350 
offset where you can either reduce the
overall<00:05:06.979> exposure<00:05:07.370> that<00:05:07.729> all<00:05:07.849> the<00:05:08.000> photos<00:05:08.270> are

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
overall exposure that all the photos are

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.300 
overall exposure that all the photos are
taking<00:05:08.689> in<00:05:08.810> or<00:05:08.960> increasing<00:05:09.530> so<00:05:09.800> we've<00:05:09.949> reduced

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
taking in or increasing so we've reduced

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.770 
taking in or increasing so we've reduced
it<00:05:10.520> and<00:05:10.729> we're<00:05:11.120> going<00:05:11.270> to<00:05:11.330> give<00:05:11.479> it<00:05:11.509> another

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
it and we're going to give it another

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.450 
it and we're going to give it another
shot<00:05:12.080> here<00:05:12.379> and<00:05:12.469> see<00:05:12.620> if<00:05:12.710> we<00:05:12.830> can<00:05:12.979> get<00:05:13.129> a<00:05:13.159> camera

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
shot here and see if we can get a camera

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.629 
shot here and see if we can get a camera
or<00:05:13.819> a<00:05:13.879> shot<00:05:14.419> with<00:05:14.629> better<00:05:14.870> exposure<00:05:15.430> we<00:05:16.430> think

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
or a shot with better exposure we think

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:17.890 
or a shot with better exposure we think
that<00:05:16.759> looks<00:05:16.969> a<00:05:17.060> lot<00:05:17.180> better<00:05:17.360> we<00:05:17.569> still<00:05:17.780> have

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
that looks a lot better we still have

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:28.220 
that looks a lot better we still have
all<00:05:18.050> the<00:05:18.169> detail<00:05:19.060> but<00:05:20.060> the<00:05:20.900> white<00:05:21.110> spots

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230
