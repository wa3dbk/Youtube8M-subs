to the 9th for it before the running out
of<00:00:28.190> room<00:00:28.400> because<00:00:28.760> of<00:00:28.850> the<00:00:28.910> heel<00:00:29.090> of<00:00:29.120> the

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.210 
of room because of the heel of the
guitar<00:00:29.660> so<00:00:29.960> go<00:00:30.140> as<00:00:30.200> high<00:00:30.410> as<00:00:30.440> you<00:00:30.620> can<00:00:30.740> go<00:00:31.010> but

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
should be the 12th fret now what we're

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:37.720 
should be the 12th fret now what we're
going<00:00:35.989> to<00:00:36.110> do<00:00:36.289> probably<00:00:37.039> because<00:00:37.340> of<00:00:37.370> timer

00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:41.929 
mechanics of how to do it in this

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:43.630 
mechanics of how to do it in this
segment<00:00:42.170> and<00:00:42.589> in<00:00:42.679> the<00:00:42.800> next<00:00:42.920> video<00:00:43.339> will

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
segment and in the next video will

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.310 
segment and in the next video will
actually<00:00:43.969> play<00:00:44.120> through<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.659> entire<00:00:44.690> pattern

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
actually play through the entire pattern

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.139 
actually play through the entire pattern
starting<00:00:45.890> from<00:00:46.069> the<00:00:46.159> first<00:00:46.190> position<00:00:46.760> all<00:00:47.059> the

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
starting from the first position all the

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.569 
starting from the first position all the
way<00:00:47.239> up<00:00:47.329> to<00:00:47.449> the<00:00:47.480> 12th<00:00:47.719> position<00:00:48.370> so<00:00:49.370> let's

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
way up to the 12th position so let's

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.970 
way up to the 12th position so let's
just<00:00:49.760> do<00:00:49.879> a<00:00:49.909> quick<00:00:50.120> summary<00:00:50.510> to<00:00:51.499> complete<00:00:51.859> the

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
just do a quick summary to complete the

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.279 
just do a quick summary to complete the
process<00:00:52.219> of<00:00:52.699> playing<00:00:52.969> one<00:00:53.300> position<00:00:53.839> we<00:00:53.989> start

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
process of playing one position we start

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:56.049 
process of playing one position we start
here<00:00:54.530> on<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:54.859> low<00:00:55.010> E<00:00:55.039> string<00:00:55.190> with<00:00:55.670> our<00:00:55.789> first

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
here on the low E string with our first

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.250 
here on the low E string with our first
fret<00:00:56.329> we<00:00:57.170> play<00:00:57.409> one<00:00:57.739> two<00:00:58.219> three<00:00:59.030> four<00:00:59.600> we<00:01:00.079> move

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
fret we play one two three four we move

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.060 
fret we play one two three four we move
up<00:01:00.379> to<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:00.559> next<00:01:00.649> string<00:01:01.039> 1<00:01:01.460> 2<00:01:01.999> 3<00:01:02.449> 4<00:01:03.019> and<00:01:03.679> so<00:01:03.710> on

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
up to the next string 1 2 3 4 and so on

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.310 
up to the next string 1 2 3 4 and so on
a<00:01:04.250> whip<00:01:04.640> to<00:01:04.699> our<00:01:04.970> high<00:01:05.120> string<00:01:05.510> along<00:01:05.810> two

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
a whip to our high string along two

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.610 
a whip to our high string along two
three<00:01:07.040> four<00:01:07.690> that<00:01:08.690> what<00:01:08.810> we<00:01:08.930> do<00:01:09.080> is<00:01:09.229> we<00:01:09.409> just

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
three four that what we do is we just

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.670 
three four that what we do is we just
reverse<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:09.979> procedure<00:01:10.340> or<00:01:11.060> three<00:01:11.720> two<00:01:12.170> one

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
reverse the procedure or three two one

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.360 
reverse the procedure or three two one
next<00:01:13.340> string<00:01:13.580> 4<00:01:13.910> 3<00:01:14.480> 2<00:01:14.930> on<00:01:15.380> all<00:01:15.800> the<00:01:16.010> way<00:01:16.160> up<00:01:16.340> to

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
next string 4 3 2 on all the way up to

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.200 
next string 4 3 2 on all the way up to
our<00:01:16.730> low<00:01:17.420> string<00:01:17.780> again<00:01:17.900> four<00:01:18.470> three<00:01:19.100> two<00:01:19.610> one

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
our low string again four three two one

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.170 
our low string again four three two one
now<00:01:20.840> here's<00:01:21.080> how<00:01:21.260> we<00:01:21.320> change<00:01:21.680> positions<00:01:22.430> when

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
now here's how we change positions when

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.260 
now here's how we change positions when
we<00:01:23.330> work<00:01:23.510> our<00:01:23.690> way<00:01:23.720> backwards<00:01:24.110> four<00:01:24.890> three<00:01:25.490> two

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
we work our way backwards four three two

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.530 
we work our way backwards four three two
one<00:01:27.170> as<00:01:28.070> soon<00:01:28.280> as<00:01:28.370> we<00:01:28.490> hit<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.700> one<00:01:29.060> what<00:01:29.390> we're

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
one as soon as we hit the one what we're

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.330 
one as soon as we hit the one what we're
going<00:01:29.660> to<00:01:29.750> do<00:01:29.930> is<00:01:30.170> we're<00:01:30.350> going<00:01:30.470> to<00:01:30.560> slide<00:01:31.010> up

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
going to do is we're going to slide up

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.750 
going to do is we're going to slide up
one<00:01:32.180> fret<00:01:32.480> to<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:33.170> second<00:01:33.650> fret<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:34.580> that

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
one fret to the second fret and that

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.660 
one fret to the second fret and that
puts<00:01:35.060> us<00:01:35.180> into<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.630> second<00:01:36.050> position<00:01:36.670> so

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
puts us into the second position so

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.820 
puts us into the second position so
let's<00:01:37.850> just<00:01:38.120> kind<00:01:38.270> of<00:01:38.360> repeat<00:01:38.660> that<00:01:38.870> four

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
let's just kind of repeat that four

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
let's just kind of repeat that four
three<00:01:40.790> two

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
three two

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.270 
three two
slide<00:01:43.850> up<00:01:44.020> that<00:01:45.020> puts<00:01:45.289> us<00:01:45.409> into<00:01:45.679> the<00:01:45.890> second

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
slide up that puts us into the second

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.780 
slide up that puts us into the second
position

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.610 

or<00:01:49.790> that<00:01:50.330> way<00:01:50.420> we<00:01:50.600> can<00:01:50.780> work<00:01:50.990> our<00:01:51.200> way<00:01:51.230> back<00:01:51.590> up

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
or that way we can work our way back up

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.590 
or that way we can work our way back up
and<00:01:52.100> then<00:01:52.220> reverse<00:01:52.580> it<00:01:52.760> four<00:01:53.000> three<00:01:53.030> two<00:01:53.420> one

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
and then reverse it four three two one

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.360 
and then reverse it four three two one
so<00:01:53.870> now<00:01:54.020> we're<00:01:54.200> in<00:01:54.380> that<00:01:54.500> second<00:01:54.980> position

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
so now we're in that second position

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.520 
so now we're in that second position
domain<00:01:55.760> I'll<00:01:56.030> repeat<00:01:56.810> that<00:01:56.870> for<00:01:57.140> you<00:01:57.260> one<00:01:57.410> more

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
domain I'll repeat that for you one more

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.350 
domain I'll repeat that for you one more
time<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:57.980> this<00:01:58.070> time<00:01:58.130> I<00:01:58.370> won't<00:01:58.580> talk<00:01:59.090> through

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
time and this time I won't talk through

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.910 
time and this time I won't talk through

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.180 

you<00:02:12.690> see<00:02:12.840> how<00:02:12.960> I<00:02:13.020> actually<00:02:13.230> slid<00:02:13.830> into<00:02:14.070> the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
you see how I actually slid into the

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.920 
you see how I actually slid into the
position<00:02:14.550> without<00:02:14.880> losing<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.480> be<00:02:17.000> too

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
position without losing to be too

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.420 
position without losing to be too
slide<00:02:19.930> up

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.030 

see<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.580> goes<00:02:23.760> one<00:02:23.970> more<00:02:24.090> time<00:02:27.710> slide<00:02:28.710> in<00:02:29.010> the

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
see that goes one more time slide in the

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.660 
see that goes one more time slide in the
second<00:02:29.520> position

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.540 

one<00:02:32.240> more<00:02:32.390> time<00:02:32.630> for<00:02:32.990> three

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
one more time for three

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.620 
one more time for three
slide

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.060

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
so that's how we work our way up and

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.480 
so that's how we work our way up and
down<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.400> positions<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.830> of<00:02:44.830> course<00:02:45.190> once

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
down the positions and of course once

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.070 
down the positions and of course once
