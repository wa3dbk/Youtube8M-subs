00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
system a little bit better from the back

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:35.750 
system a little bit better from the back
side<00:00:31.700> you<00:00:32.700> can<00:00:32.850> see<00:00:32.880> how<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:34.219> water<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.370> pumped

side you can see how the water is pumped
into<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.180> system<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.469> left<00:00:39.620> and<00:00:40.620> then<00:00:40.800> you

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
into the system on the left and then you

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.520 
into the system on the left and then you
can<00:00:41.070> see<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> right-hand<00:00:41.969> side<00:00:42.410> where<00:00:43.410> it

can see on the right-hand side where it

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.880 
can see on the right-hand side where it
actually<00:00:43.710> overflows<00:00:44.690> out<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.989> last<00:00:46.410> tube

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
actually overflows out this last tube

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.810 
actually overflows out this last tube
and<00:00:47.989> then<00:00:48.989> runs<00:00:49.289> back<00:00:49.410> into<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.129> into<00:00:50.730> the
