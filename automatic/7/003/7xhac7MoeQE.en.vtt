00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
combination you want so let's go ahead

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.540 
combination you want so let's go ahead
and<00:00:36.690> get<00:00:36.840> started<00:00:36.960> with<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.980> intro<00:00:38.340> riff

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
and get started with the the intro riff

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.690 
and get started with the the intro riff
which<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.600> not<00:00:39.750> exactly<00:00:39.930> how<00:00:40.559> grande<00:00:41.399> does<00:00:41.550> it

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
which is not exactly how grande does it

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.040 
which is not exactly how grande does it
on<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.059> record<00:00:42.989> but<00:00:43.230> it's<00:00:43.410> pretty<00:00:43.890> darn<00:00:44.129> close

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
on the record but it's pretty darn close

00:00:45.050 --> 00:01:14.219 
on the record but it's pretty darn close
and<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.530> sounds<00:00:46.950> like<00:00:47.610> this

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.460 

all<00:01:15.229> right<00:01:15.409> so<00:01:16.869> let's<00:01:17.869> go<00:01:18.049> ahead<00:01:18.110> and<00:01:18.259> get<00:01:18.380> into

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
all right so let's go ahead and get into

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.080 
all right so let's go ahead and get into
that<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.740> for<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:19.130> majority<00:01:19.369> of<00:01:19.549> that<00:01:19.729> part

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
the open B string which is it the same

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.789 
the open B string which is it the same

times<00:01:37.100> in<00:01:37.369> an<00:01:37.460> eighth<00:01:37.610> note<00:01:37.640> pattern<00:01:41.259> then

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
times in an eighth note pattern then

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.249 
times in an eighth note pattern then
you're<00:01:42.380> gonna<00:01:42.530> take<00:01:43.299> the<00:01:44.299> fifth<00:01:44.600> string<00:01:45.020> of

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
you're gonna take the fifth string of

the B plus that four on the G to get

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.450 
the B plus that four on the G to get
that<00:01:50.090> so

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.030 

so<00:01:57.240> then<00:01:57.390> eight<00:01:57.660> hits<00:01:58.230> of<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.500> four<00:01:58.770> or<00:01:58.860> five

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
b2 a2 on the be still with that full on

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.340 
b2 a2 on the be still with that full on
the<00:02:07.860> G<00:02:11.240> so<00:02:12.240> you<00:02:12.270> hit<00:02:12.690> six<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.640> four<00:02:15.000> and

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
the G so you hit six of that to four and

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.250 
the G so you hit six of that to four and
then<00:02:16.350> back<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.890> two<00:02:17.130> more<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.730> those<00:02:18.450> five<00:02:18.900> four

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
then back to two more of those five four

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.440 
then back to two more of those five four
and<00:02:19.620> then<00:02:20.550> land<00:02:20.850> on<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:22.290> for<00:02:23.280> pulling<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.270> be

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
and then land on a for pulling the be

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.750 
and then land on a for pulling the be
and<00:02:24.720> still<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.260> full<00:02:25.500> on<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.650> G<00:02:25.920> so

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
and still that full on the G so

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.040 
and still that full on the G so
altogether<00:02:27.209> let<00:02:27.540> me<00:02:27.600> show<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:27.900> whole

altogether let me show you that whole

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:37.480 
altogether let me show you that whole
part

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:47.040 

all<00:02:38.490> right<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:38.910> then<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.090> do<00:02:39.270> 16<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:40.170> those<00:02:40.290> 4<00:02:40.620> 4

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.770 

all<00:02:47.950> right<00:02:48.040> so<00:02:48.220> as<00:02:48.280> you<00:02:48.370> saw<00:02:48.550> there<00:02:48.790> in<00:02:49.570> the

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
all right so as you saw there in the

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.440 
all right so as you saw there in the
last<00:02:49.990> sound<00:02:50.890> exactly<00:02:51.100> 16<00:02:51.670> of<00:02:51.760> those<00:02:51.820> 4<00:02:52.150> it's

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
last sound exactly 16 of those 4 it's

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.360 
last sound exactly 16 of those 4 it's
probably<00:02:52.720> more<00:02:52.780> like<00:02:52.990> 14<00:02:53.830> and<00:02:54.070> then<00:02:54.160> near<00:02:54.340> the

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
probably more like 14 and then near the

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.330 
probably more like 14 and then near the
end<00:02:54.490> you<00:02:54.670> do<00:02:57.840> so<00:02:58.840> then<00:02:59.020> from<00:02:59.440> that<00:02:59.590> 14<00:03:00.070> just

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
end you do so then from that 14 just

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.300 
end you do so then from that 14 just
hammer<00:03:00.580> on<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.970> 5<00:03:01.210> then<00:03:02.200> off<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:02.740> then<00:03:03.040> land

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
slow so you can really get how many

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.390 
slow so you can really get how many
times<00:03:31.080> you<00:03:31.380> play<00:03:31.620> each<00:03:31.860> note

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400

that's also the vs. and you do that
whole<00:03:55.480> thing<00:03:56.220> two<00:03:57.220> times<00:03:57.550> and<00:03:58.110> then<00:03:59.110> you<00:03:59.590> start

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
whole thing two times and then you start

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.680 
whole thing two times and then you start
