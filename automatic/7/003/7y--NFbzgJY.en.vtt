00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
company crops and it kind of reminded me

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.920 
company crops and it kind of reminded me
of<00:00:43.610> that<00:00:44.610> new<00:00:44.879> rilakkuma<00:00:45.629> um<00:00:47.300> series<00:00:48.300> where

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
of that new rilakkuma um series where

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.060 
of that new rilakkuma um series where
they<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.910> fabric<00:00:50.910> sewn<00:00:51.539> into<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.079> ears<00:00:52.410> with

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
they have fabric sewn into the ears with

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.900 
they have fabric sewn into the ears with
like<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> floral<00:00:53.730> pattern<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.980> thought<00:00:56.850> I

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
like a floral pattern so I thought I

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.860 
like a floral pattern so I thought I
would<00:00:57.000> get<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.449> because<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.840> really

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
would get this because it really

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.830 
would get this because it really
reminded<00:00:58.469> me<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.649> that<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.000> got<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.449> big

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
reminded me of that and I got this big

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.600 
reminded me of that and I got this big
memo<00:01:04.110> pad<00:01:05.030> fashion<00:01:06.030> cat<00:01:07.010> also<00:01:08.010> by<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.159> company

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
crooks and which is really weird about

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.340 
crooks and which is really weird about
this<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:13.159> it's<00:01:14.159> not<00:01:14.420> like<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.080> memo

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
this is that it's not like just the memo

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.800 
this is that it's not like just the memo
pad<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:16.860> they're<00:01:16.979> like<00:01:17.189> games<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.790> here<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.330> do

not know what you're supposed to do I

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.219 
not know what you're supposed to do I
kind<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.299> feel<00:01:21.450> like<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.900> maybe<00:01:22.049> an

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
kind of feel like this is maybe an

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.420 
kind of feel like this is maybe an
answer<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:24.229> game<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.590> then<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.740> come<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.400> a

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
answer a game and then you come to a

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.030 
answer a game and then you come to a
conclusion<00:01:28.100> um<00:01:29.720> this<00:01:30.720> one<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> spot<00:01:31.829> the

conclusion um this one is a spot the
differences<00:01:33.530> so<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:35.009> one<00:01:35.159> has<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.340> bow<00:01:35.869> this

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
differences so this one has a bow this

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.710 
differences so this one has a bow this
has<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> hat<00:01:37.409> this<00:01:38.369> hardest<00:01:38.850> blue<00:01:39.030> this<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.450> red

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.420 

this<00:01:47.979> is<00:01:48.159> more<00:01:48.369> like<00:01:48.399> a<00:01:48.579> normal<00:01:50.039> memo<00:01:51.039> paper

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
this is more like a normal memo paper

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:59.100 
this is more like a normal memo paper
sheet<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.710> this<00:01:54.579> one<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:58.000> I'm<00:01:58.630> not<00:01:58.840> quite<00:01:58.990> sure

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
sheet and this one so I'm not quite sure

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.380 
sheet and this one so I'm not quite sure
what<00:01:59.409> they<00:01:59.560> say<00:01:59.860> but<00:01:59.920> I<00:02:00.369> really<00:02:00.759> like<00:02:00.969> that<00:02:01.149> the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
what they say but I really like that the

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.880 
what they say but I really like that the
shape<00:02:01.719> is<00:02:02.020> a<00:02:03.600> shaped<00:02:04.600> of<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.899> character<00:02:05.590> not

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
shape is a shaped of the character not

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.229 
shape is a shaped of the character not
just<00:02:06.159> a<00:02:06.310> square<00:02:06.850> like<00:02:07.149> normally<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:10.060> got

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
just a square like normally and I got

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:17.009 
just a square like normally and I got
another<00:02:11.430> moped<00:02:12.430> like<00:02:12.640> that<00:02:13.500> um<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:16.019> it's

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
another moped like that um and it's

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.870 
another moped like that um and it's
basically<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.590> same<00:02:17.970> idea<00:02:19.500> behind<00:02:20.500> those<00:02:21.040> so

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
basically the same idea behind those so

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:31.589 
basically the same idea behind those so
there's<00:02:22.150> this<00:02:22.420> game<00:02:30.239> it's<00:02:31.239> a<00:02:31.299> little<00:02:31.420> bit

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
there's this game it's a little bit

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.080 
there's this game it's a little bit
different<00:02:32.110> but<00:02:32.680> I'm<00:02:32.799> really<00:02:33.040> cute<00:02:33.579> and<00:02:33.880> I<00:02:33.970> was

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
different but I'm really cute and I was

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.390 
different but I'm really cute and I was
like<00:02:34.209> this<00:02:34.360> character<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:34.900> lot<00:02:35.110> because<00:02:36.010> I'm<00:02:36.250> an

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
like this character a lot because I'm an

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.130 
like this character a lot because I'm an
Aries<00:02:36.819> and<00:02:37.120> so<00:02:38.400> little<00:02:39.400> shapes<00:02:39.880> and<00:02:40.420> stuff<00:02:40.599> are

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
Aries and so little shapes and stuff are

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
foot kinda but um the other ones are
just<00:05:50.970> fine<00:05:51.270> and<00:05:51.570> you<00:05:51.840> can<00:05:52.020> always<00:05:53.539> get<00:05:54.539> rid<00:05:54.750> of

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
just fine and you can always get rid of

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.680 
just fine and you can always get rid of
those<00:05:55.080> by<00:05:55.410> just<00:05:55.650> pouring<00:05:56.070> a<00:05:56.190> small<00:05:56.729> amount<00:05:57.570> of

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
those by just pouring a small amount of

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.999 
those by just pouring a small amount of
frozen<00:05:57.930> over<00:05:58.289> it

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:00.009 
frozen over it

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:06.570 
frozen over it
then<00:06:00.189> I<00:06:00.219> got<00:06:02.789> this<00:06:03.789> frame<00:06:04.240> mold<00:06:05.430> which<00:06:06.430> I

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
then I got this frame mold which I

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:14.010 
then I got this frame mold which I
thought<00:06:06.819> is<00:06:07.089> really<00:06:07.659> pretty

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.279 

and<00:06:14.169> then<00:06:15.160> I<00:06:15.190> got<00:06:15.400> this<00:06:15.879> cameo<00:06:16.569> mole<00:06:16.810> this<00:06:17.169> is

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
and then I got this cameo mole this is

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:21.600 
and then I got this cameo mole this is
just<00:06:17.470> a<00:06:17.710> cab<00:06:18.009> John<00:06:18.370> mold<00:06:18.699> and<00:06:19.800> this<00:06:20.800> supposedly

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
just a cab John mold and this supposedly

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.990 
just a cab John mold and this supposedly
goes<00:06:22.030> into<00:06:22.479> this<00:06:22.659> frame<00:06:23.490> I'm<00:06:24.490> not<00:06:24.699> quite<00:06:24.970> sure

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
goes into this frame I'm not quite sure

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.070 
goes into this frame I'm not quite sure

hoping<00:06:29.530> to<00:06:29.680> get<00:06:29.830> it<00:06:29.979> together<00:06:30.190> like<00:06:30.639> that<00:06:30.879> but

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479
