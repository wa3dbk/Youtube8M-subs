ultimate for closets in general solid

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.900 
ultimate for closets in general solid
allows<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.199> apply<00:00:19.500> 2d<00:00:20.070> constraints<00:00:20.760> to

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
allows you to apply 2d constraints to

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.509 
allows you to apply 2d constraints to
the<00:00:21.029> lines<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.539> arts<00:00:21.869> making<00:00:22.740> up<00:00:22.890> shapes<00:00:23.220> of

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519

solid<00:00:26.670> then<00:00:26.820> maintains<00:00:27.359> these<00:00:27.570> constraints

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
solid then maintains these constraints

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.919 
solid then maintains these constraints
when<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.410> edit<00:00:28.560> these<00:00:28.830> objects<00:00:29.539> this<00:00:30.539> movie

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
when you edit these objects this movie

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.100 
when you edit these objects this movie
will<00:00:31.140> demonstrate<00:00:31.769> dimension<00:00:32.279> constraints

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
will demonstrate dimension constraints

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.750 
will demonstrate dimension constraints
these<00:00:34.110> allow<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.680> apply<00:00:34.950> fixed<00:00:35.520> dimension

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
these allow you to apply fixed dimension

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.080 
these allow you to apply fixed dimension
distances<00:00:36.630> or<00:00:37.200> angles<00:00:37.710> between<00:00:38.610> lines<00:00:38.850> and

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.630 

it<00:02:50.180> is<00:02:50.360> described<00:02:50.840> in<00:02:51.020> a<00:02:51.080> health<00:02:51.290> files<00:02:51.560> as<00:02:51.860> it

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
it is described in a health files as it

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.700 
it is described in a health files as it
allows<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.360> constrain<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.320> distance

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
allows you to constrain the distance

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.400 
allows you to constrain the distance
between<00:02:54.890> two<00:02:55.310> cat<00:02:55.610> objects<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.840> a<00:02:56.870> fixed<00:02:57.290> or

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
between two cat objects to a fixed or

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.930 
between two cat objects to a fixed or
parametric<00:02:57.830> value<00:02:58.340> along<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.120> X<00:02:59.270> or<00:02:59.480> Y<00:02:59.510> axis

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.440 

so<00:03:04.940> let's<00:03:05.150> edit<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.600> shape<00:03:05.780> of<00:03:05.960> this<00:03:06.050> cabinet

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
so let's edit the shape of this cabinet

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.660 
so let's edit the shape of this cabinet
we're<00:03:08.450> going<00:03:08.690> to<00:03:08.810> select<00:03:09.050> ortho<00:03:09.680> distance<00:03:10.130> in

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
we're going to select ortho distance in

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.860 
we're going to select ortho distance in
this<00:03:11.600> scenario<00:03:12.110> I<00:03:12.380> select<00:03:12.950> my<00:03:13.040> first<00:03:13.370> point

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
this scenario I select my first point

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.040 
this scenario I select my first point
and<00:03:15.070> then<00:03:16.070> I<00:03:16.130> cross<00:03:16.460> over<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:17.150> I'm<00:03:17.750> going<00:03:17.960> to

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
and then I cross over and I'm going to

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.080 
and then I cross over and I'm going to
select<00:03:18.380> this<00:03:18.710> one<00:03:18.920> here<00:03:21.340> as<00:03:22.340> I<00:03:22.520> pull<00:03:22.790> out<00:03:22.820> the

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
select this one here as I pull out the

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.140 
select this one here as I pull out the
line<00:03:23.330> again<00:03:24.140> we<00:03:24.440> can<00:03:24.620> either<00:03:24.830> do<00:03:24.980> a<00:03:25.010> value<00:03:25.970> or

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
line again we can either do a value or

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.690 
line again we can either do a value or
add<00:03:26.720> a<00:03:27.010> an<00:03:28.010> equation<00:03:29.980> and<00:03:30.980> it<00:03:31.130> shows<00:03:31.310> me<00:03:31.520> that<00:03:31.640> I

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
add a an equation and it shows me that I

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.020 
add a an equation and it shows me that I
have<00:03:31.760> 18<00:03:32.360> inches<00:03:34.900> so<00:03:35.900> let's<00:03:36.110> say<00:03:36.320> this<00:03:36.730> and<00:03:37.730> see

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
have 18 inches so let's say this and see

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:47.500 
have 18 inches so let's say this and see
what<00:03:38.209> happens<00:03:38.540> when<00:03:39.470> we<00:03:39.530> stretch<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.190> cabinet

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.440 

even<00:03:48.510> though<00:03:48.629> our<00:03:48.659> interior<00:03:49.439> has<00:03:49.709> changed<00:03:50.450> if

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
even though our interior has changed if

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.319 
even though our interior has changed if
we<00:03:51.689> measure<00:03:53.150> at<00:03:54.150> this<00:03:54.269> point<00:03:54.769> to<00:03:55.769> this<00:03:55.950> point

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
we measure at this point to this point

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.970 
we measure at this point to this point
you<00:03:57.329> see<00:03:57.540> that<00:03:57.569> we<00:03:57.840> are<00:03:57.870> still<00:03:58.200> at<00:03:58.439> the<00:03:58.560> 18

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
you see that we are still at the 18

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:06.410 
you see that we are still at the 18
inches<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.980> third<00:04:05.250> type<00:04:05.549> of<00:04:05.730> dimension

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
inches the third type of dimension

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.240 
inches the third type of dimension
constraint<00:04:07.909> is<00:04:08.909> called<00:04:09.299> length<00:04:09.890> this<00:04:10.890> allows

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
constraint is called length this allows

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.300 
constraint is called length this allows
you<00:04:11.459> to<00:04:11.670> constrain<00:04:12.239> the<00:04:12.420> length<00:04:12.659> of<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:12.930> line<00:04:13.310> if

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
you to constrain the length of a line if

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.789 
you to constrain the length of a line if
they<00:04:14.579> need<00:04:14.819> arises<00:04:15.150> for<00:04:15.900> a<00:04:15.930> single<00:04:16.440> line

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.719 

moving<00:04:19.799> on<00:04:19.919> to<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:20.280> next<00:04:20.579> one<00:04:20.789> is<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:22.289> radius

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
moving on to the next one is the radius

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.860 
moving on to the next one is the radius
the<00:04:23.729> radius<00:04:23.760> option<00:04:24.449> allows<00:04:24.660> you<00:04:24.690> to

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
the radius option allows you to

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.689 
the radius option allows you to
constrain<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.470> radius<00:04:25.919> of<00:04:26.100> an<00:04:26.220> arc<00:04:26.460> or<00:04:26.639> a

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
constrain the radius of an arc or a

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:37.240 
constrain the radius of an arc or a
circle

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.440 

so<00:04:38.000> let's<00:04:38.210> edit<00:04:38.390> the<00:04:38.630> shape<00:04:40.210> go<00:04:41.210> to<00:04:41.270> a

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
so let's edit the shape go to a

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.010 
so let's edit the shape go to a
dimension<00:04:41.810> radius<00:04:43.060> so<00:04:44.060> you<00:04:44.120> simply<00:04:44.600> select

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
dimension radius so you simply select

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.600 
dimension radius so you simply select
the<00:04:45.320> cat<00:04:45.620> object<00:04:46.720> you<00:04:47.720> see<00:04:47.930> the<00:04:48.080> radius<00:04:48.610> and

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
the cat object you see the radius and

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.610 
the cat object you see the radius and
you<00:04:49.670> simply<00:04:50.060> select<00:04:50.450> a<00:04:50.720> point<00:04:50.870> the<00:04:51.260> second

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
you simply select a point the second

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.770 
you simply select a point the second
time<00:04:52.210> again<00:04:53.210> either<00:04:53.480> a<00:04:53.660> value<00:04:54.110> or<00:04:54.320> text<00:04:54.830> and

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
time again either a value or text and

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.740 
time again either a value or text and
now<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:56.840> radius<00:04:57.560> of<00:04:57.770> this<00:04:58.040> arc<00:04:58.340> is

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
now the radius of this arc is

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.020 
now the radius of this arc is
constrained<00:04:59.750> so<00:05:00.560> that<00:05:00.740> when<00:05:00.890> you<00:05:01.070> edit<00:05:01.730> the

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.330 

the<00:05:14.360> last<00:05:14.600> dimension<00:05:14.810> constraint<00:05:15.620> is<00:05:15.890> for

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
the last dimension constraint is for

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:24.380 
the last dimension constraint is for
angles

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.730 

again<00:05:25.390> you<00:05:25.570> are<00:05:25.660> prompted<00:05:25.900> at<00:05:26.200> the<00:05:26.290> lower<00:05:26.470> left

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
again you are prompted at the lower left

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.950 
again you are prompted at the lower left
to<00:05:26.920> select<00:05:27.520> your<00:05:27.640> first<00:05:27.820> CAD<00:05:28.120> object<00:05:30.000> and<00:05:31.000> then

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
to select your first CAD object and then

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.980 
to select your first CAD object and then
you<00:05:32.140> will<00:05:32.320> select<00:05:32.530> your<00:05:32.800> second<00:05:33.220> one<00:05:36.990> again

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
you will select your second one again

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.080 
you will select your second one again
you<00:05:38.440> have<00:05:38.620> the<00:05:38.800> ability<00:05:39.280> to<00:05:39.310> put<00:05:39.550> in<00:05:39.670> a<00:05:39.760> value

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
you have the ability to put in a value

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.550 
you have the ability to put in a value
or<00:05:40.120> text<00:05:40.840> this<00:05:41.500> is<00:05:41.710> 135<00:05:42.580> degrees<00:05:43.080> or<00:05:44.080> just<00:05:44.290> fine

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
or text this is 135 degrees or just fine

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.240 
or text this is 135 degrees or just fine
and<00:05:44.860> as<00:05:45.550> you<00:05:45.700> can<00:05:45.850> see<00:05:45.910> if<00:05:46.570> this<00:05:47.380> angle<00:05:47.440> is<00:05:47.980> now

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
and as you can see if this angle is now

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:58.580 
and as you can see if this angle is now
constrained<00:05:51.300> so<00:05:52.300> if<00:05:52.570> we<00:05:52.750> save<00:05:53.050> the<00:05:53.230> cabinet

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:07.570 

and<00:05:59.590> then<00:05:59.740> stretch<00:06:00.040> it<00:06:00.070> out

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.370 

you<00:06:08.580> can<00:06:08.760> see<00:06:08.940> that<00:06:09.090> this<00:06:09.300> angle<00:06:09.570> is<00:06:09.930> still

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
you can see that this angle is still

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.260 
you can see that this angle is still
maintained<00:06:10.890> even<00:06:11.370> though<00:06:11.490> the<00:06:11.640> other<00:06:11.820> angles

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
maintained even though the other angles

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.040 
maintained even though the other angles
may<00:06:12.480> have<00:06:12.690> changed<00:06:14.450> this<00:06:15.450> concludes<00:06:15.870> the
