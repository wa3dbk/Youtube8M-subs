joint now this one right here is 4200

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.780 
joint now this one right here is 4200
milliamp<00:03:31.739> all<00:03:32.739> right<00:03:32.919> so<00:03:33.069> now<00:03:33.190> this<00:03:33.370> one<00:03:33.579> is

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
milliamp all right so now this one is

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.809 
milliamp all right so now this one is
seven<00:03:34.389> thousand<00:03:35.079> seven<00:03:36.010> thousand<00:03:36.519> milliamp

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
seven thousand seven thousand milliamp

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.030 
seven thousand seven thousand milliamp
look<00:03:37.269> at<00:03:37.359> the<00:03:37.450> difference

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
look at the difference

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.009 
look at the difference
it's<00:03:39.040> almost<00:03:39.250> actually<00:03:39.940> thinner<00:03:40.239> than<00:03:40.900> the

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
it's almost actually thinner than the

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.780 
it's almost actually thinner than the
forty<00:03:41.290> two<00:03:41.410> hundred<00:03:41.440> mile<00:03:41.739> and<00:03:41.980> I<00:03:42.160> believe

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
forty two hundred mile and I believe

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.680 
forty two hundred mile and I believe
that<00:03:44.130> it's<00:03:45.130> almost<00:03:45.400> actually<00:03:45.579> thinner<00:03:46.000> so

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
that it's almost actually thinner so

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:47.819 
that it's almost actually thinner so
let's<00:03:46.870> drop<00:03:47.019> it<00:03:47.169> on<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.410> see<00:03:47.500> what<00:03:47.560> it<00:03:47.650> looks

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
let's drop it on and see what it looks

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.409 
let's drop it on and see what it looks

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
thousand milliamp better you would think

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.119 
thousand milliamp better you would think
it's<00:03:58.150> gonna<00:03:58.239> be<00:03:58.450> about<00:03:58.599> this<00:03:58.840> thick<00:03:59.010> but<00:04:00.010> now
