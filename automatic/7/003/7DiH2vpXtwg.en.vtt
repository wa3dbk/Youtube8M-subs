00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello everyone how are you before 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.210
 no books that I have a very bad voice 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.670
 and because I had a serious day 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.559
 disastrous but everything with fever I have 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.750
 been all day crying me the snot 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.250
 at school all he has gone wrong we will 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.990
 that has had a pretty disastrous day 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.150
 and I was recording a video for that 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.710
 I have such a snotty voice, good things 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.810
 that we are running out of April 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.430
 April has been an incredible month have 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.010
 spent a lot of good things and 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.500
 premiere new section is the section it 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.090
 going to call favorites of the month worth and going 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.980
 to be that each end of the month 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.440
 I'm going to upload a video naming the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.090
 favorite of each month is to say favorites 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.190
 fashion food series program 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.500
 television et cetera etcetera so without 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.210
 more delay we started because the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.800
 fashion favorites I could teach you a 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.480
 heap of clothes that I have 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.489
 bought this month as I have this month 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.500
 bought a lot of super things 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.930
 pretty but if I had to choose a 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.870
 pledge I would show you this from here to see 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.870
 this shirt to glove that is so with 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.260
 dots and blue and white strips and 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.309
 dots 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.560
 black and seriously when I get home 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.909
 wat I fell in love with the pull and bear and it's 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.530
 this season so you can 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.090
 find in stores on the web 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.430
 I will calmly teach you also 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.920
 these shoes that you all know 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.840
 are the typical nike but I have a 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.490
 problem have taken a month to arrive and 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.500
 I have small ones so I'm going to 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.750
 have to wait another month for 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.070
 get a bigger size so 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.170
 I have a rage 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.539
 in the food favorites seriously 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.119
 urgency stoics I love you can that 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.369
 sound very absurd but this chocolate in 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.979
 serious that is cool what happens is the 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.630
 leader is worth it like dark chocolate with 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.319
 little pieces of raspberry that you have inside 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.740
 as well as caramelized and is very delicious 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:46.899
 all the tablet a day to see if not 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.330
 you are going to have consequences in the series 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.940
 favorite basically the looming one 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.709
 has been impressive this month besides the 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.119
 that is coming has returned from a small 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:57.039
 even though they had in the eighth 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.289
 season and new chapters is me 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.000
 charming a lot so the 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.470
 program the favorite television the 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.209
 I'm not really seeing the 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.320
 tele this month since I consume more 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:07.510
 Internet 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.850
 so I do not have any program 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.470
 favorite television on the channel 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.940
 youtube I'm going to show you a channel that 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.770
 surely you do not know but to me 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.600
 love this month been super flawed 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.209
 this channel called kevin that comes 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.010
 and is basically a blogger who goes up 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.260
 videos like me but your videos do not 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.120
 they have something special I love and 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.000
 Well, I only follow a lot 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.250
 in the favorite installer without the minor 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.170
 doubt marc fornell marc fornÃ© for 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.150
 that you do not know is an instagram is 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.849
 a famous model that uploads photos and 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.860
 instagram in which he leaves then dressing 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.819
 this clothes different in different places 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.110
 in your photos seriously your photos are wow 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.370
 impressively pretty to follow 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.950
 everyone will install what is is 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.750
 awesome the favorite movie like 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.329
 I do not like that I have not seen this month 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.000
 no movie can sound a little 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:58.489
 absurd but I have not seen any but and 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.260
 the favorite book because neither this time 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.970
 I have not read any book and attention 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.739
 you need your help because in school 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.230
 I have been asked to choose a book for 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.370
 read and I do not know which book to choose 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.989
 preferably I would like a book that 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.849
 I had a movie for later 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.920
 after reading the book watch the movie 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.659
 and he likes books a lot more with 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.579
 movies since it seems to me like I do not know 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.290
 very original so it is known is 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.579
 some book that has a movie tell me 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.650
 leave in the comments what 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.230
 I would appreciate a lot in the song 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.819
 favorite you could play here all 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.000
 the playlist that I have in 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.630
 spotify but let's choose some 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.630
 yes 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.590
 in the favorite application for the truth 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.510
 that I would not know how to choose among so many 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.730
 If I had to choose one, I would choose 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.620
 Basque and bsc or camps I do not know why you 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.080
 I say Basque because I think it's not called 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.660
 Basque is called bsc ocampo I call him Basque 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.920
 because it is a photo editor with which 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.150
 He edited all the photos that is the same 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.070
 instagram and carry an application 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.880
 quite practical and quite simple to 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.890
 edit the photos that simple 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.260
 in the favorite place if I had to 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.300
 choosing one would choose the retirement park 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.100
 from madrid I have not gone to Madrid this month 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.900
 but I went at the end of last month so 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.820
 let's tell it like this month 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.920
 loved this park because it's like a 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.690
 park that is in the center but is very 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.770
 quiet where you can relax and 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.950
 you can enjoy views 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.140
 incredible in the favorite random the 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.480
 I really would not know what to choose because 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.370
 I do not have a random favorite this month 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.530
