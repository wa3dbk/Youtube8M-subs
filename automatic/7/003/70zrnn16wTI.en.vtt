00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.480
 hello good friends, I bring you the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.500
 review of the perfection rom as they say 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.210
 that this rom is perfect good first 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.009
 we go 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.860
 I will tell you the characteristics 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:29.370
 interface based on 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.070
 on samsung galaxy s from the series s 2 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.170
 until the new s 4 sounds 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.440
 tone call notifications 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:42.220
 original samsung galaxy s 4 alarms 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:47.220
 alexa gives for more 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.220
 internal memory of what the phone is 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.940
 without applying trash 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.280
 default application updated the 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.240
 latest version featured apps 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.160
 as 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:09.220
 the color of the vibration on the buttons 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.760
 back and from minus to almost 1 depression here 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.200
 this vibrates and like it moves you like 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.200
 that you want to see fall but 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.880
 as it makes you fall if repressions here 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.640
 it's a bar that wants to be a bar where 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.050
 I am now 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.940
 well now let's see what we 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.970
 it interests us we are starting 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.490
 is here as is the notification bar 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.220
 here you can download me 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:40.909
 so that it shows a little and good as in 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:44.870
 the cool button of s 4 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.720
 and let's see what are the 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.200
 everything that is produced works and everything 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.409
 it works here as you see it brings 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.320
 very similar to what the es4 the 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.600
 settings 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:04.350
 make 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.350
 Android version 2.3 point 6 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.520
 compilation number 3.0 you can 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.260
 update here 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.260
 do not lose the 3g 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.150
 let's see what the player is 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.150
 music see 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.930
 well let's play the music of 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.930
 over here 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.420
 these recordings 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.420
 shit 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.790
 let's play a music 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.760
 well let's reproduce this 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.180
 and as you see there is the player well 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.180
 pimp 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.340
 to this volume 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:19.319
 It is very, very cool do not know if it 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.219
 want to take out to put it 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.219
 again 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:31.670
 let's see brings the pressure already 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.640
 updated because 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.510
 will not be with this rom me to me 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:41.630
 like evolution and how they see this are 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.390
 the notes here we can choose 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.570
 we can write any bullshit 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.570
 here 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.819
 it must also be calendar here we can 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.190
 write notebook 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.440
 and so 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.590
 bring to control what is our 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.800
 cpu and now let's see what the 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.190
 watch as they see it is the typical clock 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.360
 forever 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.360
 let's see the gallery 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.000
 thin 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:28.090
 there is the gallery is the typical samsung 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.090
 as always has not changed at all 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.880
 well 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.880
 we have the radio 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.569
 because they are the archives and I am here 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.040
 a little cool as you can see there 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:44.900
 you can grant him 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.000
 rock requests so they can 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.000
 change what they want 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.449
 the typical now let's see what is the 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:59.230
 keyboard as you can see the keyboard is 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:02.520
 similar of that 42 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.520
 in contacts 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.449
 same as those of s 4 and brings titanium 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:13.449
 Bacchus 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:13.449
 pre-installed 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.580
 as you see to grant permission to 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.580
 allow 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.550
 and it is already 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.550
 we accept 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.910
 well if it works well is also low 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.450
 control 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.000
 is here is to download to put it 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.250
 night 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.620
 at night she moves I do not know how she 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.990
 will call without being screen first 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:51.190
 I think that's how I pronounce it, I'm the one 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:54.410
 for what is English and calendar 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.950
 let's grab the calculator in the 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:00.120
 calculator that has changed is 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.120
 it's changed 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.789
 wallpaper to be put in the background 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:13.110
 there is a first day here 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.580
 we can edit the funds to do what 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.580
 I want you 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.580
 where 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.890
 over here 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:32.330
 is where we can modify here 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.130
 we can modify a series of things by 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.500
 example what is the blockade there they see it 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.510
 to look for it or so 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.210
 very annoying or because sometimes he does not want 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.560
 come down and here we can change it if we do not 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.160
 like 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.160
 this here 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.660
 how are they going to see her change and then friends 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.210
 that has been all in a few days I will be 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:56.230
 doing how to install it for this rom 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.760
 it is required to be from the stock rice 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:03.700
 I hope you liked it, do not forget to give it 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.700
