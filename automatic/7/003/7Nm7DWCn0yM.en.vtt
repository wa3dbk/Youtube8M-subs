going for about eleven dollars and the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.600 
going for about eleven dollars and the
basic<00:00:32.369> features<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.789> the<00:00:33.000> book<00:00:33.239> are<00:00:33.629> that<00:00:34.610> it's

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
basic features of the book are that it's

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.340 
basic features of the book are that it's
a<00:00:35.730> bonded<00:00:36.149> leather<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.629> it's<00:00:36.750> not<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.899> genuine

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
a bonded leather so it's not a genuine

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.630 
a bonded leather so it's not a genuine
leather<00:00:37.949> it<00:00:38.399> has<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:39.559> satin<00:00:40.559> ribbon<00:00:40.800> marker

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
leather it has a satin ribbon marker

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.040 
leather it has a satin ribbon marker
here<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.239> then<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.899> could<00:00:43.019> tell<00:00:43.199> that<00:00:43.469> it's<00:00:44.129> a

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
here and then you could tell that it's a

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.139 
here and then you could tell that it's a
decorated<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.949> edges<00:00:47.280> here<00:00:47.460> second<00:00:47.909> burn

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
decorated on the edges here second burn

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.599 
decorated on the edges here second burn
so<00:00:48.479> it's<00:00:48.629> not<00:00:48.749> like<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.170> gold<00:00:49.469> leaf

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
so it's not like that gold leaf

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.139 
so it's not like that gold leaf
it's<00:00:50.909> more<00:00:51.089> of<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.210> burnt<00:00:51.739> decoration<00:00:52.739> on<00:00:53.149> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
it's more of a burnt decoration on the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.799 
it's more of a burnt decoration on the
edges<00:00:54.600> here<00:00:54.949> then<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.039> can<00:00:56.159> see<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.809> marbled

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
edges here then you can see the marbled

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.389 
edges here then you can see the marbled
and<00:00:57.960> papers<00:00:58.379> on<00:00:58.499> the<00:00:58.589> inside<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.949> snow<00:00:59.129> I

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.990 
the outside here you can see the raised
ribs<00:01:10.680> they're<00:01:10.979> not<00:01:11.130> as<00:01:11.280> defined<00:01:11.670> there's

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
ribs they're not as defined there's

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.160 
ribs they're not as defined there's
something<00:01:12.299> you'd<00:01:12.450> get<00:01:12.689> from<00:01:12.899> the<00:01:13.020> east

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
something you'd get from the east

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.920 
something you'd get from the east
impress<00:01:13.619> but<00:01:14.460> once<00:01:14.640> again<00:01:14.850> you're<00:01:15.630> getting

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
impress but once again you're getting

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.510 
impress but once again you're getting
what<00:01:16.170> you're<00:01:16.579> you're<00:01:17.579> paying<00:01:17.820> for<00:01:18.350> so<00:01:19.350> uh<00:01:19.520> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
what you're you're paying for so uh the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.029 
what you're you're paying for so uh the
paper<00:01:20.729> overall<00:01:21.329> is<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.539> nice<00:01:21.750> quality<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.289> don't

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
paper overall is a nice quality I don't

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.630 
paper overall is a nice quality I don't
believe<00:01:23.399> it's

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
believe it's

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.529 
believe it's
acid-free<00:01:26.640> or<00:01:26.820> notes<00:01:27.030> or<00:01:27.149> anything<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.479> that

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
acid-free or notes or anything like that

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.300 
acid-free or notes or anything like that
but<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.289> think<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.799> little<00:01:29.009> bit<00:01:29.130> thicker

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
but I think it is a little bit thicker

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.959 
but I think it is a little bit thicker
than<00:01:29.490> normal<00:01:29.990> it<00:01:30.990> has<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> nice<00:01:31.560> feel<00:01:32.399> to<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.729> but

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
than normal it has a nice feel to it but

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.289 
than normal it has a nice feel to it but
the<00:01:33.420> text<00:01:33.899> itself<00:01:34.350> it's<00:01:35.039> clear<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.820> haven't

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
the text itself it's clear I haven't

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.870 
the text itself it's clear I haven't
seen<00:01:36.479> any<00:01:36.750> any<00:01:37.590> mistakes<00:01:38.189> or<00:01:38.520> anything<00:01:38.670> like

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
seen any any mistakes or anything like

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.480 
seen any any mistakes or anything like
that<00:01:38.939> no<00:01:39.359> fudging<00:01:39.960> nose<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.710> know<00:01:40.829> no<00:01:41.039> smudges

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
that no fudging nose you know no smudges

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.830 
that no fudging nose you know no smudges
throughout<00:01:43.310> there<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.460> some<00:01:44.880> mess<00:01:45.179> in<00:01:45.509> terms

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
throughout there is some mess in terms

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.260 
throughout there is some mess in terms
of<00:01:46.109> the<00:01:46.229> glue<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.799> some<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.250> edges<00:01:47.609> here<00:01:47.880> it

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
of the glue on some of the edges here it

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.830 
of the glue on some of the edges here it
is<00:01:48.570> printed<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.560> bound<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:50.280> China<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.179> you

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
is printed and bound in China so you

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.310 
is printed and bound in China so you
have<00:01:51.929> to<00:01:52.079> take<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.439> into<00:01:52.679> account<00:01:52.770> as<00:01:53.159> well

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
have to take that into account as well

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.709 
have to take that into account as well
it's<00:01:55.700> it's<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> nice<00:01:56.850> book<00:01:57.060> if<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.329> want<00:01:57.359> to<00:01:57.600> go
