in there

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:59.610 
in there
now<00:03:58.359> I<00:03:58.450> remember<00:03:58.780> when<00:03:58.989> I<00:03:59.019> was<00:03:59.170> a<00:03:59.230> kid<00:03:59.409> my<00:03:59.590> dad

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
now I remember when I was a kid my dad

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.550 
now I remember when I was a kid my dad
always<00:04:00.010> used<00:04:00.129> bacon<00:04:00.730> grease<00:04:01.000> so<00:04:01.870> if<00:04:02.049> you<00:04:02.260> are

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
always used bacon grease so if you are

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.080 
always used bacon grease so if you are
one<00:04:02.739> to<00:04:02.859> say<00:04:03.010> bacon<00:04:03.370> grease<00:04:03.549> in<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.819> fridge

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
one to say bacon grease in the fridge

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.140 
one to say bacon grease in the fridge
then<00:04:04.480> that<00:04:04.750> would<00:04:04.930> obviously<00:04:05.109> be<00:04:05.439> yummy

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
then that would obviously be yummy

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.459 
then that would obviously be yummy
anyways<00:04:07.150> we're<00:04:07.329> gonna<00:04:07.420> go<00:04:07.629> some<00:04:07.870> cracker<00:04:08.170> egg

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:08.469 
anyways we're gonna go some cracker egg

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:13.500 
anyways we're gonna go some cracker egg
and<00:04:09.269> typically<00:04:10.269> this<00:04:10.569> is<00:04:10.810> done<00:04:11.159> with<00:04:12.159> an<00:04:12.519> egg

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
and typically this is done with an egg

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.349 
and typically this is done with an egg
where<00:04:14.349> the<00:04:14.470> yolk<00:04:14.739> is<00:04:14.919> not<00:04:15.099> broken<00:04:15.489> but<00:04:16.269> if

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
where the yolk is not broken but if

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.939 
where the yolk is not broken but if
you're<00:04:16.599> making<00:04:16.930> for<00:04:17.289> someone<00:04:17.650> that<00:04:17.680> doesn't

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
you're making for someone that doesn't

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.150 
you're making for someone that doesn't
like<00:04:18.459> their<00:04:18.759> our<00:04:18.880> yolk<00:04:19.150> runny<00:04:19.449> then<00:04:20.259> just<00:04:21.039> go

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
like their our yolk runny then just go

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.320 
like their our yolk runny then just go
ahead<00:04:21.370> and<00:04:21.459> break<00:04:21.639> that<00:04:21.849> yolk<00:04:24.120> there's<00:04:25.120> also

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
ahead and break that yolk there's also

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.580 
ahead and break that yolk there's also
two<00:04:25.660> ways<00:04:25.810> you<00:04:25.930> can<00:04:26.080> do<00:04:26.139> this<00:04:26.169> some<00:04:26.440> people

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
two ways you can do this some people

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.879 
two ways you can do this some people
like<00:04:26.919> to<00:04:26.949> flip<00:04:27.580> their<00:04:28.419> egg<00:04:28.750> and<00:04:29.169> cook<00:04:29.650> it<00:04:29.740> that

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
like to flip their egg and cook it that

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.550 
like to flip their egg and cook it that
way<00:04:30.070> I<00:04:30.400> just<00:04:30.849> like<00:04:31.509> to<00:04:31.720> take<00:04:31.900> a<00:04:31.960> little<00:04:32.199> bit<00:04:32.440> of

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
way I just like to take a little bit of

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.390 
way I just like to take a little bit of
