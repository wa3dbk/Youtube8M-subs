00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.389
 let's try now at the engine test room once they have been 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.250
 designed components have been made assembled is tested for 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.440
 detect emissions performance and consumption and cancel the effect 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:21.630
 specialization 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.420
 Engineer from Friday morning now used turning comedies 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.419
 this activity also with the aid of qualification 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.440
 the amberjack promoter life is an environment in which thanks to the help of 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.390
 a dynamometric brake 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.720
 metric and in any case the presence of refrigerant fluids 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.110
 lubricant you can run engine trying to replicate more 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.020
 possible 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.010
 vehicle operation 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.170
 these signals are used to judge point by point of 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.010
 engine operation goodness or not and combustion 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.030
 home and optimization 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.350
 bari direction 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.159
 then the motor is obviously made to work thanks to a system of 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.880
 fume extraction to a fuel supply system 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.440
 to an external cooling system with 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.320
 of the cooling water of a heat exchanger that lasts a system of 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.850
 lubrication in this way we are able to punctually carry out all those 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.070
 TV calibration differently directly on the vehicle would not be 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.070
 can optimize 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.310
 we must at this very moment 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.730
 at the roller bench it is here that the engine must eventually show 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.760
 talk about the performances for which it was designed 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.160
 and it is here for example let's take a look at that control strategies 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.160
 engine developed sine you foresee pods and it is immediately known that you go to check 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.680
 also that individual components designed by damn lens capable of 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.119
 withstand the stresses of road use 

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:16.119
 to 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:21.340
 the vehicle application activity takes place halfway directly on the road 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:24.109
 and the laboratory is the business of 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:29.189
 this mythic car is leading is a verification activity of achievement 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.189
 target consumption 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:39.499
 the myth model will respect the euro 5 legislation here is the bank 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:44.129
 final test of the object or in which all the strategies of the control unit 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.250
 engine control 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.250
 come the verification yourself 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:59.700
 I have been little known emails easily perceived roads inappropriately 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:02.279
 head. is the relative one 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:05.579
 to the acoustic comfort inside the passenger compartment 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.719
 the engine must not transmit unwanted vibration and noise 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:14.159
 penalties for the user to lose his comfort 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.590
 the engineer map rally car responsible for iesce dstt 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:22.049
 condor inside the anechoic chamber that one of the tools that will come 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.799
 used for metaponto this sea aspect 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.770
 in these months of activity the specialists have been unitary 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.760
 and to guarantee a behavior such as motor vibrations and was adequate 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.760
 and in line with the brendan fraser 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.689
 just playing with my type I take care of the qualitative improvement of all 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:49.799
 aspects of our future but we hope to have made a den by focusing on work 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.760
 I remember 25 years ago I gave my first to make you fall in love with something 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.499
 I say they no longer had a distinctive nightmare noise that I still remember today 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:03:58.220
 Big emotion
