Phillips head screws and retainers it's

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.410 
Phillips head screws and retainers it's
really<00:00:12.960> not<00:00:13.049> that<00:00:13.110> hard<00:00:13.820> if<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:15.030> trying<00:00:15.299> to

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
really not that hard if you trying to

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.470 
really not that hard if you trying to
keep<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:16.520> sellable<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.550> not<00:00:17.970> trying<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.270> break

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
keep it sellable and not trying to break

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.599 
keep it sellable and not trying to break
it<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:19.439> takes<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.800> little<00:00:19.920> bit<00:00:20.010> longer<00:00:20.220> but

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
it it takes a little bit longer but

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.099 
it it takes a little bit longer but
otherwise<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.300> can<00:00:21.420> just<00:00:21.570> rip<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.810> out<00:00:21.930> and

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
otherwise you can just rip it out and

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.730 
otherwise you can just rip it out and
call<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.380> day

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740
