00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.780
 company do not know how the magna god of 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.090
 chicken but it's a very funny way 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.769
 of eating raw foods and it's also 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.140
 a very good alternative to whatever 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:22.089
 that to take mysterious flesh is true 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.890
 they are many ingredients but you do not 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:26.109
 intimidate because basically we're going to 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.089
 pour it all in 1 nicolás my little 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.980
 system to mix is ​​to start with 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.500
 all the liquids and then add all 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.060
 the spices so we put the syrup 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.190
 of maple and apple cider vinegar 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.190
 and we give a pulse for a second 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.850
 and now add the garlic powder 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.410
 miso the cayenne the cumin the salt and the 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.800
 Chia seeds we've had a 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.800
 soaking 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.690
 Chia seeds are super foods 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.880
 they are full of proteins of origin 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.280
 vegetable are very rich in fatty acids 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.170
 omega 3 and they are also full of fibers 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.750
 so they keep you full people 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.580
 use them as an aid to lose weight are 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.580
 great to incorporate into your diet 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.910
 Now let's add the ingredients 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.800
 bigger 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.330
 we do this now because we wanted 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.560
 our spices totally 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.330
 incorporated in the last step we're going 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.520
 to strain our dried tomatoes that 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.380
 they were soaking and we put them in the 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.020
 blender we put a little onion 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.590
 also the red pepper and finally 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.590
 our corn 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.520
 and it may be that in this step a 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.310
 little as is happening right now 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.030
 just remove the lid and push everything 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.030
 a little down 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:03.479
 that's when the magic happens we put it 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.479
 in a bowl and now 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.229
 I have a high speed blender 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.450
 so this is not in the texture 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.550
 perfect but if you have a blender 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.440
 normal you can also use a very 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.790
 coffee boy to get that texture 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.790
 oxygenated assigns it 0 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.610
 very well perfect you do not have to put them 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.040
 too much time because it will become 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.000
 a different texture so all the 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.000
 public too 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.750
 and now let's make the seeds of 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.040
 sunflower exactly the same 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.040
 and to grind 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:50.660
 perfect adapt very well very talk is 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.130
 all we have left is to add our 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.240
 nutritional yeast in the best action 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.240
 we are simply going to mix 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.860
 we have finished with our base now 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.860
 let's make a mix of bread crumbs 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.870
 very very fast it 's basically seeds 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.970
 of linen a bit of paprika and a little 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.120
 come out but I've been a little bit and now we're going 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.549
 to make our planes is that now 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.110

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.459
 our breading and baking tray 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.970
 that I'm going to put a little bit of the role of 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.970
 thought 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.579
 use my hands most of the time 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.409
 because that's what I do and then what 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:33.269
 we did a little bit in our breading 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:33.269
 we crush the tray well 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:41.380
 there is your nuggets we are going to make another 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:43.240
 triumph you avenge spoonful hands do not 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.170
 we did well on each side we paid 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.640
 a little bit and now here they are made if 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.710
 you have a dehydrator the cops 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.350
 someone during one night most of 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.970
 people do not have so in the oven to 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.310
 95 degrees centigrade during 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.820
 about an hour leave the round 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.870
 you put them one more hour 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.580
 now that we have them in the oven 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.130
 dehydrator let's do our 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.480
 BBQ sauce is basically pouring a 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.480
 Lots of things in the blender
