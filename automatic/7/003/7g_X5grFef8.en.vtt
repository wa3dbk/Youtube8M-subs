00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
you can hide one here quick getaway spot

you can hide one here quick getaway spot
these<00:02:03.259> these<00:02:04.259> power-ups<00:02:04.649> here<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.450> over

these these power-ups here the over
shields<00:02:06.899> spawn<00:02:07.380> at<00:02:07.680> different<00:02:08.039> times<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.550> think

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
shields spawn at different times I think

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.410 
shields spawn at different times I think
it's<00:02:08.940> 30<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.360> 60<00:02:09.950> so<00:02:10.950> they'll<00:02:11.129> be

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
it's 30 and 60 so they'll be

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.559 
it's 30 and 60 so they'll be
there<00:02:11.540> are<00:02:11.660> different<00:02:11.810> points<00:02:13.330> I'm<00:02:14.330> gonna<00:02:14.510> go

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
there are different points I'm gonna go

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:15.699 
there are different points I'm gonna go
through<00:02:14.599> the<00:02:14.840> haunted<00:02:14.959> house<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.230> minute

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
through the haunted house a minute

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.830 
through the haunted house a minute
because<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.220> teleporter<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:16.940> a<00:02:17.030> custom<00:02:17.450> powerup

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
because a teleporter to a custom powerup

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.790 
because a teleporter to a custom powerup
makes<00:02:18.050> you<00:02:19.120> very<00:02:20.319> powerful<00:02:21.319> so<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:21.620> can

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
makes you very powerful so you can

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.260 
makes you very powerful so you can

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
possibly take out the zombie because

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.270 
possibly take out the zombie because

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
he's going to be pretty tough to take

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.250

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:08.909 
let's see how many times it takes us now

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:10.309 
let's see how many times it takes us now
I'm<00:05:09.029> back<00:05:09.120> in<00:05:09.300> the<00:05:09.360> house<00:05:09.509> how<00:05:10.020> many<00:05:10.169> times

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:10.319 
I'm back in the house how many times

I'm back in the house how many times
will<00:05:10.500> take<00:05:10.710> me<00:05:10.860> to<00:05:10.979> get<00:05:11.069> to<00:05:11.219> the<00:05:11.279> kill<00:05:11.490> ball<00:05:11.719> now

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:12.719 
will take me to get to the kill ball now

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:15.709 
will take me to get to the kill ball now
I'm<00:05:12.840> in<00:05:12.930> here<00:05:13.639> all<00:05:14.639> right<00:05:14.969> back<00:05:15.210> in<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:15.449> shack

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:15.719 
I'm in here all right back in the shack

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:18.469 
I'm in here all right back in the shack

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
so you see up I could go through several

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.420 
so you see up I could go through several
times<00:05:18.870> before<00:05:19.169> getting<00:05:19.740> killed<00:05:19.949> by<00:05:20.069> the<00:05:20.129> kill

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
times before getting killed by the kill

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.159 
times before getting killed by the kill
ball<00:05:21.139> basically<00:05:22.139> I<00:05:22.770> have<00:05:23.189> the<00:05:24.000> game<00:05:24.449> style<00:05:24.870> set

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.300 
ball basically I have the game style set
up<00:05:25.319> to<00:05:25.469> where<00:05:25.620> the<00:05:25.680> zombie<00:05:26.250> has<00:05:26.779> poor<00:05:27.779> camo<00:05:28.379> so

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
up to where the zombie has poor camo so

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.379 
up to where the zombie has poor camo so
he's<00:05:29.940> not<00:05:30.089> completely<00:05:30.479> invisible<00:05:30.960> but<00:05:32.389> he

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
he's not completely invisible but he

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.649 
he's not completely invisible but he
will<00:05:33.569> be<00:05:33.659> hard<00:05:33.930> to<00:05:34.050> pick<00:05:34.289> up<00:05:34.469> at<00:05:34.650> first<00:05:34.889> glance

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659 
will be hard to pick up at first glance

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:38.600 
will be hard to pick up at first glance
he'll<00:05:36.659> move<00:05:36.810> faster<00:05:37.500> obviously<00:05:38.310> he<00:05:38.490> has<00:05:38.580> a

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
he'll move faster obviously he has a

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.300 
he'll move faster obviously he has a
