00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.059
 welcome to a new one 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.920
 edition of gardener pÃ¶tschke green tip 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.230
 nice that looks again and again 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.759
 Today I want to show you how you are 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.560
 your successfully wintered 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.260
 potted plants from winter quarters 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.260
 clear out and repot if necessary 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.100
 soon it starts the summer is coming up 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.320
 the door 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.270
 our time is not exactly the right time 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.919
 hardy potted plants again after 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.079
 outside on the balcony or the terrace 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.059
 to vacate 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.230
 because from the beginning of may is usually no more 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.660
 to expect frost 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.850
 Personally, I take advantage of this opportunity 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.260
 the room always rey my 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.820
 potted plants of a conscientious 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.970
 undergo inspection 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.760
 For example, I attach great importance to this 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.320
 the pot size because through the years 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.340
 This can quickly become too small 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.170
 be at the latest when the Earth's orbit 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.090
 is completely rooted through and the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.449
 Plant begins to take care of it's time 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.449
 to trade 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.810
 in choosing the new planter 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.030
 you should pay attention that it is in the 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.760
 diameter two to three centimeters 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.890
 is bigger than the old one 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.350
 In addition, the pot 1 hole in the hole 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.000
 Soil will have excess gravel 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.430
 and rainwater can drain 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.380
 prevents a punk shard over the hole 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.840
 doing a later washing out of the earth 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.970
 so that no waterlogging can occur 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.160
 I feel the pot first with one 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.320
 layer bled 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.350
 then I would be a permeable 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.180
 piece flows it serves as a separation 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.210
 between the drainage and the plant soil 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.250
 which I now put in the pot, however 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.310
 not too much because the plant must be yes 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.009
 even fit into it and this now 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.490
 from her old pot if that is not 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.740
 she could turn upside down 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.100
 Carefully hold on to the trunk and through 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.110
 Slightly knock on the bottom of the pot 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.880
 now only in the new top position 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:15.489
 with earth fill Lightly press the 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.970
 Do not forget gis rand and then good 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.970
 Pour 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.499
 after clearing and transplanting 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.030
 you should start your potted plants first 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:30.219
 set up in a sheltered place 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.189
 so that they are beautiful slowly to the 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:34.810
 Sun exposure can get used to this 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.760
 That's it 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.889
 before I go all the way again 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.040
 I summarize individual today 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:44.230
 one more tip for you 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.639
 container plant devour the asseln 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.049
 or to protect ants 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:51.609
 I put them on certain bucket feet 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:55.739
 the adequate space of 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:55.739
 Keep pot bottom to earth 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.560
