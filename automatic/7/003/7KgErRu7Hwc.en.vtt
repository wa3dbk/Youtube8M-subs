system you would think it would be

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.860 
system you would think it would be
mercury<00:00:35.790> because<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:36.180> closest<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.660> Sun

mercury because it's closest to the Sun
but<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.350> has<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.710> much<00:00:37.890> carbon<00:00:38.460> dioxide<00:00:39.620> that's

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
but it has so much carbon dioxide that's

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.100
