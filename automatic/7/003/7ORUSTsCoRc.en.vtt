you Monday afternoon quick update on my
tank<00:00:07.300> if<00:00:08.230> you<00:00:08.290> saw<00:00:08.800> last<00:00:09.040> video<00:00:09.370> I<00:00:09.700> had<00:00:10.210> added

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:10.540 
tank if you saw last video I had added

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.660 
tank if you saw last video I had added
the<00:00:10.570> driftwood<00:00:11.080> it's<00:00:11.650> still<00:00:11.950> not<00:00:12.130> waterlogged

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.670 
the driftwood it's still not waterlogged

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.250 
the driftwood it's still not waterlogged
but<00:00:13.000> it's<00:00:13.150> getting<00:00:13.450> near<00:00:13.630> which<00:00:13.870> is<00:00:13.900> why<00:00:14.140> I've

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.260 
but it's getting near which is why I've

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.069 
but it's getting near which is why I've
got<00:00:14.440> the<00:00:14.620> bag<00:00:14.800> of<00:00:15.010> rocks<00:00:15.190> and<00:00:15.519> the<00:00:15.839> giant<00:00:16.839> brick

00:00:17.069 --> 00:00:17.079 
got the bag of rocks and the giant brick

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:20.069 
got the bag of rocks and the giant brick
on<00:00:17.289> it<00:00:17.470> and<00:00:17.769> um<00:00:18.159> I<00:00:18.609> think<00:00:19.119> if<00:00:19.300> you<00:00:19.449> remember<00:00:19.869> I

00:00:20.069 --> 00:00:20.079 
on it and um I think if you remember I

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:22.710 
on it and um I think if you remember I
put<00:00:20.320> the<00:00:20.439> brick<00:00:20.710> and<00:00:21.669> I<00:00:21.759> bowled<00:00:21.970> it<00:00:22.300> in<00:00:22.449> water

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
put the brick and I bowled it in water

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.079 
put the brick and I bowled it in water
first<00:00:23.079> for<00:00:23.409> about<00:00:23.499> a<00:00:23.589> hour<00:00:23.679> to<00:00:24.220> remove<00:00:24.789> any

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:25.089 
first for about a hour to remove any

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:27.389 
first for about a hour to remove any
bacteria<00:00:26.079> and<00:00:26.199> parasites<00:00:26.349> and<00:00:26.859> whatnot<00:00:27.189> and

00:00:27.389 --> 00:00:27.399 
bacteria and parasites and whatnot and

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:30.870 
bacteria and parasites and whatnot and
same<00:00:27.609> for<00:00:27.880> the<00:00:28.029> UH<00:00:28.060> for<00:00:28.960> the<00:00:29.019> rocks<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.699> that's

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
same for the UH for the rocks so that's

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.299 
same for the UH for the rocks so that's
just<00:00:31.029> something<00:00:31.239> to<00:00:31.419> keep<00:00:31.509> in<00:00:31.810> mind<00:00:32.020> I<00:00:32.320> wanted

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
just something to keep in mind I wanted

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:34.680 
just something to keep in mind I wanted
to<00:00:33.399> show<00:00:33.609> you<00:00:33.640> or<00:00:33.879> something<00:00:34.300> I<00:00:34.359> don't<00:00:34.539> know<00:00:34.629> if

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
to show you or something I don't know if

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.529 
to show you or something I don't know if
you<00:00:34.780> can<00:00:34.899> see<00:00:35.199> it<00:00:35.350> but<00:00:35.590> I've<00:00:35.680> got<00:00:36.539> blue-green

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:37.539 
you can see it but I've got blue-green

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.009 
you can see it but I've got blue-green
algae<00:00:37.780> or<00:00:38.199> cyanobacteria<00:00:38.440> as<00:00:39.340> they<00:00:39.579> call<00:00:39.850> it

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
algae or cyanobacteria as they call it

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.130 
algae or cyanobacteria as they call it
kind<00:00:41.019> of<00:00:41.140> growing<00:00:41.350> in<00:00:41.620> my<00:00:41.739> tank<00:00:42.899> kind<00:00:43.899> of<00:00:43.989> hard

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
kind of growing in my tank kind of hard

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.069 
kind of growing in my tank kind of hard
to<00:00:44.170> see<00:00:45.210> my<00:00:46.210> next<00:00:46.390> video<00:00:46.570> is<00:00:46.780> gonna<00:00:46.870> be<00:00:46.960> about

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
to see my next video is gonna be about

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.139 
to see my next video is gonna be about
how<00:00:47.379> to<00:00:47.410> treat<00:00:47.800> that<00:00:47.829> I<00:00:48.399> already<00:00:48.850> found<00:00:49.000> a

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
how to treat that I already found a

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.759 
how to treat that I already found a
great<00:00:49.359> solution<00:00:49.660> to<00:00:49.929> that<00:00:50.050> which<00:00:50.379> involves

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
great solution to that which involves

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:53.849 
great solution to that which involves
using<00:00:50.920> hydrogen<00:00:51.429> peroxide<00:00:51.730> in<00:00:52.359> a<00:00:52.449> syringe<00:00:52.859> but

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:53.859 
using hydrogen peroxide in a syringe but

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:55.739 
using hydrogen peroxide in a syringe but
I<00:00:53.890> will<00:00:54.129> talk<00:00:54.309> about<00:00:54.489> that<00:00:54.760> later<00:00:54.969> and<00:00:55.420> that's

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:55.749 
I will talk about that later and that's

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:59.310 
I will talk about that later and that's
also<00:00:55.929> kind<00:00:56.260> of<00:00:56.289> why<00:00:56.469> I<00:00:56.800> have<00:00:57.730> the<00:00:58.320> aeration

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
also kind of why I have the aeration

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.610 
also kind of why I have the aeration
going<00:00:59.829> on<00:00:59.980> is<00:01:00.280> a<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.899> easiest<00:01:02.199> way<00:01:02.320> to<00:01:02.379> treat

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
going on is a the easiest way to treat

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.460 
going on is a the easiest way to treat
see<00:01:02.829> my<00:01:02.949> bacterias<00:01:03.460> to<00:01:03.699> over<00:01:04.210> aerate<00:01:04.600> it<00:01:04.630> which

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
see my bacterias to over aerate it which

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.530 
see my bacterias to over aerate it which
is<00:01:05.680> why<00:01:06.070> we'll<00:01:06.310> talk<00:01:06.490> about<00:01:06.640> using<00:01:07.240> hydrogen

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
is why we'll talk about using hydrogen

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.020 
is why we'll talk about using hydrogen
peroxide<00:01:07.780> and<00:01:08.410> treating<00:01:08.850> blue-green<00:01:09.850> algae

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
peroxide and treating blue-green algae

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.090 
peroxide and treating blue-green algae
anyways<00:01:10.540> today<00:01:11.200> I<00:01:11.230> wanted<00:01:11.530> to<00:01:11.620> talk<00:01:11.800> to<00:01:11.950> y'all

anyways today I wanted to talk to y'all
about<00:01:12.130> these<00:01:12.610> this<00:01:12.970> plant<00:01:13.300> water<00:01:14.080> wisteria

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
about these this plant water wisteria

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.060 
about these this plant water wisteria
and<00:01:15.010> propagation<00:01:15.790> and<00:01:16.500> I've<00:01:17.500> got<00:01:17.710> my<00:01:17.830> room

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
and propagation and I've got my room

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.970 
and propagation and I've got my room
over<00:01:18.340> there<00:01:18.490> that's<00:01:19.300> been<00:01:19.690> growing<00:01:20.140> it's<00:01:20.830> been

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
over there that's been growing it's been

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.340 
over there that's been growing it's been
growing<00:01:21.190> nice<00:01:21.460> and<00:01:21.730> fast

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
growing nice and fast

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.880 
growing nice and fast
but<00:01:23.350> today<00:01:23.890> we'll<00:01:24.190> be<00:01:24.660> propagating<00:01:25.660> this<00:01:26.650> one

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
but today we'll be propagating this one

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.310 
but today we'll be propagating this one
right<00:01:27.040> here<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:28.450> I've<00:01:28.570> already<00:01:28.810> taken<00:01:29.020> out

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
right here that I've already taken out

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.680 
right here that I've already taken out
it<00:01:29.620> was<00:01:29.740> over<00:01:29.950> here<00:01:30.130> in<00:01:30.160> the<00:01:30.310> corner<00:01:30.700> and<00:01:30.910> I'm

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
it was over here in the corner and I'm

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.880 
it was over here in the corner and I'm
just<00:01:31.870> gonna<00:01:31.990> show<00:01:32.260> you<00:01:32.320> how<00:01:32.500> it's<00:01:32.650> real<00:01:32.860> easy

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
just gonna show you how it's real easy

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.450 
just gonna show you how it's real easy
it's<00:01:33.430> like<00:01:33.640> a<00:01:33.670> two-step<00:01:34.420> process<00:01:35.460> water

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
it's like a two-step process water

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.180 
it's like a two-step process water
Asteria<00:01:37.000> is<00:01:37.150> really<00:01:37.450> easy<00:01:37.720> um<00:01:38.500> if<00:01:38.680> you<00:01:38.830> look<00:01:39.010> on

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
Asteria is really easy um if you look on

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.310 
Asteria is really easy um if you look on
this<00:01:39.310> one<00:01:39.550> you<00:01:39.640> can<00:01:39.790> see<00:01:39.970> a<00:01:40.000> root<00:01:40.240> system<00:01:40.480> you

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
this one you can see a root system you

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.160 
this one you can see a root system you
find<00:01:41.380> a<00:01:41.590> good<00:01:41.740> backdrop<00:01:42.750> you'll<00:01:43.750> see<00:01:43.990> right

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
find a good backdrop you'll see right

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.620 
find a good backdrop you'll see right
there<00:01:44.550> all<00:01:45.550> you<00:01:45.820> really<00:01:45.970> have<00:01:46.150> to<00:01:46.270> keep<00:01:46.420> in

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
there all you really have to keep in

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.580 
there all you really have to keep in
mind<00:01:47.640> when<00:01:48.640> propagating<00:01:49.420> water<00:01:49.720> wisteria<00:01:49.960> is

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
mind when propagating water wisteria is

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.290 
mind when propagating water wisteria is
to<00:01:51.250> cut<00:01:51.550> below<00:01:52.150> the<00:01:52.630> root<00:01:52.870> and<00:01:53.760> at<00:01:54.760> the<00:01:54.940> bottom

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
to cut below the root and at the bottom

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.870 
to cut below the root and at the bottom
as<00:01:55.510> you<00:01:56.110> can<00:01:56.260> see<00:01:56.590> kind<00:01:57.040> of<00:01:57.160> like<00:01:57.310> right<00:01:57.550> here

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
as you can see kind of like right here

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.610 
as you can see kind of like right here
there's<00:01:58.480> a<00:01:58.570> little<00:01:58.780> bit<00:01:58.960> of<00:01:59.080> a<00:01:59.200> root<00:01:59.350> stem

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
there's a little bit of a root stem

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.840 
there's a little bit of a root stem
going<00:01:59.950> on<00:02:00.100> so<00:02:00.670> it<00:02:00.880> on<00:02:01.810> a<00:02:01.870> receiver<00:02:02.380> you<00:02:02.830> look<00:02:03.730> at

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
going on so it on a receiver you look at

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.390 
going on so it on a receiver you look at
it<00:02:03.940> has<00:02:04.240> roots<00:02:04.780> growing<00:02:05.200> throughout<00:02:05.560> it<00:02:05.800> it

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
it has roots growing throughout it it

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.400 
it has roots growing throughout it it
has<00:02:06.550> roots<00:02:06.820> at<00:02:06.970> the<00:02:07.000> bottom<00:02:07.540> the<00:02:07.810> middle<00:02:07.990> and

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
has roots at the bottom the middle and

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.100 
has roots at the bottom the middle and
the<00:02:08.530> top

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
the top

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.680 
the top
everywhere<00:02:09.649> it<00:02:09.890> grows<00:02:10.130> roots<00:02:10.399> which<00:02:11.300> is<00:02:11.480> why

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
everywhere it grows roots which is why

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.620 
everywhere it grows roots which is why

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
as you cut into your water wisteria and

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.340 
as you cut into your water wisteria and
you<00:03:10.010> can<00:03:10.160> infect<00:03:10.489> it<00:03:10.700> with<00:03:10.880> whatever<00:03:11.150> might<00:03:11.450> be

you can infect it with whatever might be
in<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.620> previous<00:03:13.370> plant<00:03:13.700> so<00:03:13.970> you<00:03:14.000> might<00:03:14.269> want

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
in the previous plant so you might want

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.650 
in the previous plant so you might want
to<00:03:14.510> run<00:03:15.110> some<00:03:15.640> hydrogen<00:03:16.640> peroxide<00:03:16.910> over<00:03:17.299> these

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
to run some hydrogen peroxide over these

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.330 
to run some hydrogen peroxide over these
or<00:03:17.870> just<00:03:18.019> give<00:03:18.140> them<00:03:18.290> a<00:03:18.320> real<00:03:18.500> good<00:03:18.650> rinse<00:03:18.920> or

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.729 
or just give them a real good rinse or
you<00:03:19.700> know<00:03:19.820> hot<00:03:20.120> water<00:03:20.390> something<00:03:21.350> like<00:03:21.500> that

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
you know hot water something like that

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.490 
you know hot water something like that
so<00:03:22.519> anyways<00:03:22.850> let<00:03:23.000> me<00:03:23.030> set<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.360> camera<00:03:23.690> down<00:03:23.720> so

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
so anyways let me set the camera down so

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.009 
so anyways let me set the camera down so
I<00:03:24.560> can<00:03:24.739> cut<00:03:24.890> this<00:03:25.100> for<00:03:25.280> your<00:03:25.459> own<00:03:25.489> point<00:03:29.019> and

I can cut this for your own point and
then<00:03:30.200> here's<00:03:30.590> our<00:03:30.709> plant<00:03:31.070> I<00:03:31.400> have<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.239> root

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
then here's our plant I have the root

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.740 
then here's our plant I have the root
right<00:03:33.470> here<00:03:33.730> all<00:03:34.730> I'm<00:03:34.880> gonna<00:03:35.060> do<00:03:35.330> is<00:03:35.360> I'm<00:03:35.660> gonna
