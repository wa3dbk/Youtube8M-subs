 Pruning Conifer 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Last year, I remade the core and maintained the shape, but made it smaller by one turn 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 Choose the branch to be the core 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Choose a branch that is about to stretch out of the side 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Cut the side branch of the branch to be used as a new core as much as possible. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Stand the selected branch and tie it with twine 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Based on the newly erected core, we will trim the tree shape into a triangle. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 If you cut the leaves as they are, the cut edge will stand out and cut diagonally along the flow of the leaves 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 As I go down, I imagine the tree form that the hem spreads, and cut while adjusting the length of each part 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 Check the crown line while looking at the whole 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 If space is an issue, induce and adjust the direction of the branches 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 As the core part has a little volume, adjust it 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 Conifer pruning is complete
