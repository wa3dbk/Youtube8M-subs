very tiny not a lot of meat on them but

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.630 
very tiny not a lot of meat on them but
people<00:03:30.570> could<00:03:30.840> kill<00:03:31.140> tens<00:03:31.710> of<00:03:31.920> thousands<00:03:32.520> of

them we believe were shot here so that
contributed<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.560> decline<00:03:34.860> but<00:03:35.250> also<00:03:35.400> the

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
contributed a decline but also the

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.790

decline in the habitat not only here but

decline the wild rice in particular is
one<00:03:41.580> of<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.730> most<00:03:41.850> important<00:03:42.330> foods<00:03:42.510> here<00:03:42.840> for

one of the most important foods here for

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.690 
one of the most important foods here for
them<00:03:43.140> and<00:03:43.230> has<00:03:43.530> declined<00:03:43.860> dramatically<00:03:44.430> and

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
them and has declined dramatically and

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.100 
them and has declined dramatically and
the<00:03:44.790> birds<00:03:45.030> have<00:03:45.210> gone<00:03:45.390> right<00:03:45.600> down<00:03:45.810> along

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
the birds have gone right down along

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.750 
the birds have gone right down along
with<00:03:46.140> them<00:03:46.470> but<00:03:46.830> you<00:03:47.040> can't<00:03:47.280> study<00:03:47.580> them

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
with them but you can't study them

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.490 
with them but you can't study them
unless<00:03:48.210> you<00:03:48.390> can<00:03:48.540> catch<00:03:48.750> him<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.230> biggest

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
unless you can catch him the biggest

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.900 
unless you can catch him the biggest
challenge<00:03:49.950> was<00:03:50.070> trying<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.520> catch<00:03:50.700> them

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
challenge was trying to catch them

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.460 
challenge was trying to catch them
because<00:03:51.180> they're<00:03:51.540> so<00:03:51.690> secretive<00:03:51.960> they<00:03:52.290> only

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
because they're so secretive they only

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.350 
because they're so secretive they only
fly<00:03:52.770> at<00:03:53.010> night<00:03:53.070> when<00:03:53.610> they're<00:03:53.730> migrate<00:03:54.180> and

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
fly at night when they're migrate and

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.240 
fly at night when they're migrate and
they<00:03:54.840> stay<00:03:55.050> in<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.260> marsh<00:03:55.470> vegetation<00:03:55.500> all

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
they stay in the marsh vegetation all

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.640 
they stay in the marsh vegetation all
day<00:03:56.460> long<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:57.000> one<00:03:57.630> of<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.780> least<00:03:57.990> seen<00:03:58.410> birds

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
day long and one of the least seen birds

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.230 
day long and one of the least seen birds
so<00:03:58.980> my<00:03:59.310> challenge<00:03:59.700> was<00:03:59.820> only<00:04:00.090> about<00:04:00.150> a

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
so my challenge was only about a

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.520 
so my challenge was only about a
thousand<00:04:00.720> these<00:04:00.840> birds<00:04:01.050> had<00:04:01.200> ever<00:04:01.350> been

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
thousand these birds had ever been

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.980 
thousand these birds had ever been
captured<00:04:01.770> and<00:04:02.100> banded<00:04:02.430> up<00:04:02.580> until<00:04:02.910> about<00:04:03.030> 1992

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
captured and banded up until about 1992

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.170 
captured and banded up until about 1992
so<00:04:04.860> since<00:04:05.130> then<00:04:05.310> we've<00:04:05.460> captured<00:04:05.700> a<00:04:05.910> ban<00:04:06.060> at

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
so since then we've captured a ban at

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.270 
so since then we've captured a ban at
over<00:04:06.360> 5,000<00:04:07.170> and<00:04:07.290> developing<00:04:07.740> a<00:04:07.890> technique

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
over 5,000 and developing a technique

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.800 
over 5,000 and developing a technique
using<00:04:08.760> this<00:04:08.850> trap<00:04:09.150> you<00:04:09.300> can<00:04:09.360> see<00:04:09.600> right<00:04:09.750> over

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
using this trap you can see right over

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.980 
using this trap you can see right over
here<00:04:10.080> if<00:04:10.140> you<00:04:10.170> follow<00:04:10.410> me<00:04:10.590> over<00:04:10.770> here<00:04:11.900> what<00:04:12.900> you

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
here if you follow me over here what you

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.170 
here if you follow me over here what you
see<00:04:13.230> this<00:04:13.770> is<00:04:13.920> this<00:04:14.400> would<00:04:14.520> be<00:04:14.640> set<00:04:14.850> up<00:04:14.940> in<00:04:15.060> the

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
see this is this would be set up in the

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.539 
see this is this would be set up in the
marsh<00:04:15.420> vegetation<00:04:15.480> this<00:04:16.200> trap<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.710> it's

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
and will walk in here so if you watch

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.890 
and will walk in here so if you watch
this<00:05:12.700> I'll<00:05:13.450> actually<00:05:13.720> show<00:05:14.110> one<00:05:14.320> here<00:05:14.650> now<00:05:15.900> so

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
this I'll actually show one here now so

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.300 
this I'll actually show one here now so
here's<00:05:17.260> how<00:05:17.380> the<00:05:17.440> bird<00:05:17.650> would<00:05:17.830> enter<00:05:18.010> the<00:05:18.100> trap

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
here's how the bird would enter the trap

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.770 
here's how the bird would enter the trap
as<00:05:18.490> it<00:05:18.610> walks<00:05:18.790> along<00:05:19.000> the<00:05:19.150> fence<00:05:19.390> it<00:05:19.630> would

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
as it walks along the fence it would

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.350 
as it walks along the fence it would
enter<00:05:19.990> here<00:05:20.230> and<00:05:20.380> then<00:05:20.970> walk<00:05:21.970> through<00:05:22.240> the

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
enter here and then walk through the

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.810 
enter here and then walk through the
funnel<00:05:22.570> and<00:05:22.920> zip<00:05:23.920> into<00:05:24.130> the<00:05:24.220> trap<00:05:24.460> and<00:05:24.640> be

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
funnel and zip into the trap and be

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.480 
funnel and zip into the trap and be
captured<00:05:25.240> in<00:05:25.390> this<00:05:25.510> manner<00:05:25.810> so<00:05:26.380> after<00:05:27.220> a<00:05:27.250> while

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
captured in this manner so after a while

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.890 
captured in this manner so after a while
at<00:05:27.670> being<00:05:27.910> in<00:05:28.060> there<00:05:28.240> let<00:05:28.540> me<00:05:28.570> just<00:05:28.660> walk

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
at being in there let me just walk

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.650 
at being in there let me just walk
around<00:05:29.170> to<00:05:29.260> the<00:05:29.290> side<00:05:29.680> here<00:05:29.710> for<00:05:30.040> a<00:05:30.100> second<00:05:30.660> and

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
around to the side here for a second and

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.870 
around to the side here for a second and
it<00:05:32.290> would<00:05:32.380> enter<00:05:32.620> the<00:05:32.740> box<00:05:32.920> and<00:05:33.190> you<00:05:33.640> see<00:05:33.670> it

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
it would enter the box and you see it

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.340 
it would enter the box and you see it
just<00:05:34.030> entered<00:05:34.300> into<00:05:34.510> the<00:05:34.600> box<00:05:34.780> and<00:05:35.050> now<00:05:35.140> it's

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
just entered into the box and now it's

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.830 
just entered into the box and now it's
captured<00:05:35.800> where<00:05:36.250> we<00:05:36.370> can<00:05:36.520> go<00:05:36.640> over<00:05:36.790> here<00:05:37.120> in

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
captured where we can go over here in

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.360 
captured where we can go over here in
the<00:05:38.830> marsh<00:05:39.070> and<00:05:39.640> reach<00:05:40.360> in<00:05:40.630> and<00:05:41.100> get<00:05:42.100> the<00:05:42.220> bird

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
the marsh and reach in and get the bird

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.610 
the marsh and reach in and get the bird
out<00:05:42.610> and<00:05:42.880> sometimes<00:05:43.600> we<00:05:43.780> might<00:05:43.930> catch<00:05:44.200> a<00:05:44.320> dozen

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
out and sometimes we might catch a dozen

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.740 
out and sometimes we might catch a dozen
or<00:05:44.710> more<00:05:44.740> of<00:05:45.100> these<00:05:45.280> in<00:05:45.490> one<00:05:45.640> capture<00:05:46.120> on

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
or more of these in one capture on

or more of these in one capture on
capture<00:05:47.260> session<00:05:47.650> we've<00:05:48.040> had<00:05:48.190> like<00:05:48.340> maybe

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
capture session we've had like maybe

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.400 
capture session we've had like maybe
twelve<00:05:48.970> sites<00:05:49.270> eleven<00:05:49.660> or<00:05:49.750> twelve<00:05:49.810> sites<00:05:50.170> and

one year we banded over 1200 now let's
walk<00:05:52.630> over<00:05:52.750> here<00:05:53.050> I'll<00:05:53.170> show<00:05:53.200> you<00:05:53.350> what<00:05:53.530> we

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
walk over here I'll show you what we

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.530 
walk over here I'll show you what we
would<00:05:53.770> do<00:05:53.860> is<00:05:53.980> next<00:05:54.280> to<00:05:54.370> the<00:05:54.460> bird<00:05:54.670> and<00:05:54.880> part<00:05:55.480> of

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
would do is next to the bird and part of

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.540 
would do is next to the bird and part of
our<00:05:55.660> processing<00:05:56.380> because<00:05:57.010> so<00:05:57.190> little<00:05:57.310> is

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
our processing because so little is

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.190 
our processing because so little is
known<00:05:57.760> no<00:05:58.000> one<00:05:58.150> really<00:05:58.360> understood<00:05:58.720> like<00:05:59.020> how

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
known no one really understood like how

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.020 
known no one really understood like how
to<00:05:59.260> sex<00:05:59.620> these<00:05:59.800> birds<00:06:00.100> so<00:06:00.580> we've<00:06:00.700> been<00:06:00.760> trying

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
to sex these birds so we've been trying

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.550 
to sex these birds so we've been trying
to<00:06:01.090> come<00:06:01.210> up<00:06:01.240> with<00:06:01.360> a<00:06:01.510> method<00:06:01.900> for<00:06:02.170> example

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
to come up with a method for example

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.870 
to come up with a method for example
measuring<00:06:03.160> the<00:06:03.280> bill<00:06:03.460> length<00:06:03.700> and

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
measuring the bill length and

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.850 
measuring the bill length and
millimeters<00:06:04.360> or<00:06:04.510> Coleman<00:06:04.930> it's<00:06:05.050> called<00:06:05.290> right

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
millimeters or Coleman it's called right

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.220 
millimeters or Coleman it's called right
like<00:06:06.070> this<00:06:06.280> twenty<00:06:06.910> point<00:06:07.150> six<00:06:07.450> seven<00:06:07.630> this<00:06:08.050> is

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.230 
like this twenty point six seven this is

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.230 
like this twenty point six seven this is
indicative<00:06:08.470> of<00:06:08.800> a<00:06:08.890> male<00:06:09.100> also<00:06:09.610> measuring<00:06:10.150> the

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
indicative of a male also measuring the

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.910 
indicative of a male also measuring the
length<00:06:10.450> of<00:06:10.600> the<00:06:10.690> metatarsus<00:06:11.350> and<00:06:11.470> the<00:06:11.530> Tarsus

length of the metatarsus and the Tarsus

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.620 
length of the metatarsus and the Tarsus
bone<00:06:12.160> is<00:06:12.430> another<00:06:12.760> thing<00:06:13.000> we've<00:06:13.150> developed

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
bone is another thing we've developed

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.360 
bone is another thing we've developed

for this everything is pointing to a
male<00:06:17.140> in<00:06:17.320> this<00:06:17.440> one<00:06:17.650> also<00:06:17.950> we<00:06:18.250> would<00:06:18.370> measure

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
male in this one also we would measure

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.490 
male in this one also we would measure
toe<00:06:18.880> and<00:06:19.090> a<00:06:19.120> few<00:06:19.270> other<00:06:19.390> body<00:06:19.630> parts<00:06:19.990> one<00:06:20.410> of

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
toe and a few other body parts one of

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.930 
toe and a few other body parts one of
the<00:06:20.560> really<00:06:20.920> important<00:06:21.340> things<00:06:21.400> and<00:06:21.700> looking

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
the really important things and looking

the really important things and looking
at<00:06:22.060> body<00:06:22.270> weight<00:06:22.540> and<00:06:22.660> condition<00:06:23.110> in<00:06:23.230> terms<00:06:23.260> of

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
at body weight and condition in terms of

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.470 
at body weight and condition in terms of
the<00:06:23.620> migration<00:06:24.190> we<00:06:24.610> weigh<00:06:24.820> them<00:06:25.000> we<00:06:25.210> put<00:06:25.390> them

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:25.480 
the migration we weigh them we put them

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.420 
the migration we weigh them we put them
in<00:06:25.570> the<00:06:25.660> small<00:06:25.930> great<00:06:26.320> bag<00:06:26.560> such<00:06:26.860> as<00:06:27.010> this<00:06:27.220> and

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
in the small great bag such as this and

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.470 
in the small great bag such as this and
get<00:06:27.880> a<00:06:27.910> weight<00:06:28.180> so<00:06:28.920> slip<00:06:29.920> this<00:06:30.070> shut<00:06:30.550> take<00:06:31.300> this

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.480 
get a weight so slip this shut take this

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.510 
get a weight so slip this shut take this
small<00:06:31.780> scale<00:06:32.110> and<00:06:32.350> clip<00:06:32.950> it<00:06:33.100> on<00:06:33.220> here<00:06:33.490> and

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
small scale and clip it on here and

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.250 
small scale and clip it on here and
weigh<00:06:33.820> them<00:06:33.940> in<00:06:34.060> grams<00:06:34.330> so<00:06:34.600> if<00:06:34.810> we<00:06:34.930> capture

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:35.260 
weigh them in grams so if we capture

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.540 
weigh them in grams so if we capture
this<00:06:35.350> bird<00:06:35.560> again<00:06:35.770> in<00:06:35.890> a<00:06:35.950> few<00:06:36.160> weeks<00:06:36.190> while

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
this bird again in a few weeks while

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.460 
this bird again in a few weeks while
it's<00:06:36.669> still<00:06:36.910> here<00:06:37.120> we<00:06:37.510> know<00:06:37.690> right<00:06:37.870> now<00:06:38.140> this

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.470 
it's still here we know right now this

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.040 
it's still here we know right now this
bird<00:06:38.770> is<00:06:39.040> ninety<00:06:39.520> five<00:06:39.760> grams<00:06:40.300> which<00:06:40.660> is<00:06:40.690> quite

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050 
bird is ninety five grams which is quite

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.550 
bird is ninety five grams which is quite
heavy

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 
heavy

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.250 
heavy
force<00:06:41.830> or<00:06:42.100> rail<00:06:42.370> 95<00:06:43.060> grams<00:06:43.360> almost<00:06:43.900> off<00:06:44.080> the

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.260 
force or rail 95 grams almost off the

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.310 
force or rail 95 grams almost off the
scale<00:06:44.560> so<00:06:45.100> this<00:06:45.310> bird<00:06:45.550> very<00:06:46.210> heavy<00:06:46.540> and

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.320 
scale so this bird very heavy and

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.000 
scale so this bird very heavy and
preparing<00:06:48.100> itself<00:06:48.370> for<00:06:48.760> the<00:06:48.850> migration<00:06:49.450> and

preparing itself for the migration and
another<00:06:51.010> thing<00:06:51.190> we've<00:06:51.340> done<00:06:51.490> of<00:06:51.639> course<00:06:51.850> we

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
another thing we've done of course we

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.480 
another thing we've done of course we
would<00:06:52.150> ban<00:06:52.360> them<00:06:52.570> I've<00:06:52.900> got<00:06:53.169> a<00:06:53.560> band<00:06:54.190> here

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
would ban them I've got a band here

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.280 
would ban them I've got a band here

hurt the bird in any way and it will

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.990 
hurt the bird in any way and it will
stay<00:07:17.830> on<00:07:18.010> for<00:07:18.190> the<00:07:18.220> life<00:07:18.460> of<00:07:18.580> the<00:07:18.639> bird<00:07:18.820> we've
