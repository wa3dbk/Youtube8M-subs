00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.470 
assure you guys had a randomized text

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.040 
assure you guys had a randomized text
and<00:00:07.700> this<00:00:08.700> is<00:00:08.910> quite<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.179> lot<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.450> code<00:00:09.660> so<00:00:09.960> i'll

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
and this is quite a lot of code so i'll

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.600 
and this is quite a lot of code so i'll
put<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.380> source<00:00:10.620> code<00:00:10.860> for<00:00:11.070> this<00:00:11.190> app<00:00:11.400> in<00:00:11.550> the

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
put the source code for this app in the

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.220 
put the source code for this app in the
video<00:00:11.849> description<00:00:11.969> so<00:00:12.630> basically<00:00:12.990> what<00:00:13.139> this

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
video description so basically what this

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.950 
video description so basically what this
is<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.969> when<00:00:14.969> you<00:00:15.030> click<00:00:15.210> randomize<00:00:15.630> it

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
is is when you click randomize it

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.019 
is is when you click randomize it
randomly<00:00:16.350> picks<00:00:16.650> out<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.920> name<00:00:17.279> here<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:17.940> it

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
randomly picks out a name here so it

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.700 
randomly picks out a name here so it
goes<00:00:18.180> Peter<00:00:18.500> Bob<00:00:19.500> Peter<00:00:20.400> Tom<00:00:21.439> you<00:00:22.439> know<00:00:22.529> just

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
goes Peter Bob Peter Tom you know just

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.590 
goes Peter Bob Peter Tom you know just
randomly<00:00:23.100> chooses<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.580> bunch<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.939> names<00:00:24.180> but<00:00:24.390> I

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
randomly chooses a bunch of names but I

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.220 
randomly chooses a bunch of names but I
click<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.869> random<00:00:25.170> itís<00:00:25.350> button<00:00:25.619> um<00:00:27.230> and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
click the random itís button um and

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.480 
click the random itís button um and
today<00:00:28.619> I'll<00:00:28.710> show<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:28.920> guys<00:00:29.010> how<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.189> do<00:00:29.340> that

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
today I'll show you guys how to do that

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.990 
today I'll show you guys how to do that

library and drag in a view now we can

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.830 
library and drag in a view now we can
start<00:01:19.920> designing<00:01:20.280> your<00:01:20.369> interface<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.780> I'm

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
start designing your interface so I'm

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.469 
start designing your interface so I'm
just<00:01:21.960> going<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.140> get<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.290> button<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:26.299> I'm<00:01:27.299> just

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
just going to get a button and I'm just

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:36.109 
just going to get a button and I'm just
going<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.689> say<00:01:29.780> randomized

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.779 

and<00:01:37.119> I<00:01:37.719> get<00:01:37.840> a<00:01:37.869> dragon<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.289> label<00:01:38.649> and<00:01:41.789> that's

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
and I get a dragon a label and that's

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.340 
and I get a dragon a label and that's
where<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.119> actual<00:01:43.390> randomized<00:01:43.930> stuff<00:01:44.200> will

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
where the actual randomized stuff will

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:52.880 
where the actual randomized stuff will
be<00:01:44.610> i'll<00:01:45.610> just<00:01:45.970> select<00:01:50.490> what<00:01:51.490> should<00:01:51.670> i<00:01:51.729> say

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
be i'll just select what should i say

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.260 
be i'll just select what should i say
this<00:01:53.890> is<00:01:54.039> a<00:01:54.069> gang<00:01:54.310> go<00:01:54.429> to<00:01:54.520> randomize<00:01:54.939> a<00:01:55.000> bunch

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
this is a gang go to randomize a bunch

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.809 
this is a gang go to randomize a bunch
of<00:01:55.590> names<00:01:56.590> or<00:01:57.250> words<00:01:57.610> more<00:01:58.450> like<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.700> i'm<00:02:00.759> just

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
of names or words more like so i'm just

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:05.039 
of names or words more like so i'm just
going<00:02:01.030> to<00:02:01.090> say<00:02:01.210> words<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.869> i'll<00:02:04.869> make<00:02:05.020> it

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
going to say words and i'll make it

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.930 
going to say words and i'll make it
bigger<00:02:06.390> make<00:02:07.390> it<00:02:07.569> nicer<00:02:08.049> and<00:02:08.700> stretch<00:02:09.700> it<00:02:09.729> out

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
bigger make it nicer and stretch it out

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.550 
bigger make it nicer and stretch it out
a<00:02:10.000> bit<00:02:10.119> because<00:02:10.690> that<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.019> words<00:02:11.230> are<00:02:11.319> longer

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
a bit because that the words are longer

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.800 
a bit because that the words are longer
you<00:02:11.799> want<00:02:11.950> them<00:02:12.069> to<00:02:12.099> still<00:02:12.370> show<00:02:12.780> make<00:02:13.780> sure

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
you want them to still show make sure

and<00:04:21.109> this<00:04:21.680> is<00:04:21.829> the<00:04:21.919> code<00:04:22.130> I<00:04:22.419> just<00:04:23.419> blow<00:04:24.169> it<00:04:24.290> up<00:04:24.380> a

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
and this is the code I just blow it up a

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.640 
and this is the code I just blow it up a
bit<00:04:24.530> for<00:04:25.100> you<00:04:25.190> guys<00:04:25.870> so<00:04:26.870> this<00:04:27.080> is<00:04:27.260> all<00:04:27.410> the<00:04:27.500> code

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
to put that much in and you don't just

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:12.130 
to put that much in and you don't just
have<00:05:10.820> to<00:05:10.880> have<00:05:11.060> three<00:05:11.270> cases<00:05:11.660> you<00:05:11.780> can<00:05:11.810> just

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
have to have three cases you can just

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.529 
have to have three cases you can just
keep<00:05:12.350> continue<00:05:13.010> copy<00:05:13.220> and<00:05:13.400> pasted<00:05:13.760> rename<00:05:14.450> it

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
keep continue copy and pasted rename it

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.600 
keep continue copy and pasted rename it
to<00:05:14.570> case<00:05:14.810> for<00:05:15.110> just<00:05:15.860> mess<00:05:16.010> around<00:05:16.039> with<00:05:16.430> it<00:05:16.520> a

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
to case for just mess around with it a

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.270 
to case for just mess around with it a
bit<00:05:16.640> but<00:05:16.820> like<00:05:17.210> I<00:05:17.300> said<00:05:17.560> after<00:05:18.560> the<00:05:18.680> case<00:05:18.919> then

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
bit but like I said after the case then

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.159 
bit but like I said after the case then
it'll<00:05:19.430> be<00:05:19.490> colon<00:05:19.910> this<00:05:20.600> is<00:05:20.750> where<00:05:20.900> your<00:05:20.990> code

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
it'll be colon this is where your code

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.350 
it'll be colon this is where your code
goes<00:05:21.440> right<00:05:21.860> in<00:05:21.919> between<00:05:22.039> the<00:05:22.490> case<00:05:22.729> and<00:05:22.760> the

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
goes right in between the case and the

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.830 
goes right in between the case and the
break<00:05:25.030> so<00:05:26.030> i'm<00:05:26.120> just<00:05:26.150> going<00:05:26.360> to<00:05:26.419> change<00:05:26.660> the

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
break so i'm just going to change the

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:36.970 
break so i'm just going to change the
label<00:05:27.229> text<00:05:27.740> to<00:05:30.340> the<00:05:31.340> word<00:05:31.490> Apple

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:51.030

okay<00:05:51.820> so<00:05:51.880> I've<00:05:52.150> Apple<00:05:52.660> glass<00:05:53.050> cards<00:05:53.680> read<00:05:53.950> desc

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
okay so I've Apple glass cards read desc

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.800 
okay so I've Apple glass cards read desc
very<00:05:54.730> random<00:05:55.090> words<00:05:55.300> um<00:05:55.780> and<00:05:57.570> like<00:05:58.570> I<00:05:58.630> said

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
very random words um and like I said

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.110 
very random words um and like I said
before<00:05:59.470> this<00:05:59.980> is<00:06:00.040> just<00:06:00.400> optional<00:06:00.880> and<00:06:01.000> I'm
