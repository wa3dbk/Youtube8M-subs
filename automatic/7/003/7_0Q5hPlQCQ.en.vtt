00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
with most range is kind of a smart

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.310 
with most range is kind of a smart
to<00:02:15.670> do<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:18.370> mp5<00:02:18.790> has<00:02:19.030> great<00:02:19.300> actually<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:20.080> good

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
to do the mp5 has great actually a good

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.900 
to do the mp5 has great actually a good
power<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:20.950> he's<00:02:21.130> just<00:02:21.220> an<00:02:21.370> all-around<00:02:21.460> click

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
power and he's just an all-around click

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.220 
power and he's just an all-around click
on<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:23.170> still<00:02:23.650> works<00:02:23.920> almost<00:02:24.490> as<00:02:24.910> well<00:02:25.230> like

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
on it still works almost as well like

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.290 
on it still works almost as well like
even<00:02:26.830> using<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:27.400> like<00:02:27.490> with<00:02:27.700> stopping<00:02:27.970> power

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
even using it like with stopping power

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.820 
even using it like with stopping power
and<00:02:28.690> then<00:02:28.810> use<00:02:28.960> it<00:02:29.110> with<00:02:29.200> you<00:02:29.290> if<00:02:29.320> you<00:02:29.470> jabber

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.110 
and then use it with you if you jabber
sometimes<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.370> don't<00:02:30.490> even<00:02:30.610> notice<00:02:30.880> a

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
sometimes you don't even notice a

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.420 
sometimes you don't even notice a
difference<00:02:31.300> of<00:02:31.950> course<00:02:32.950> you<00:02:33.130> don't<00:02:33.250> have

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
difference of course you don't have

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.890 
difference of course you don't have
steady<00:02:33.730> aim<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:34.210> you<00:02:34.300> got<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.570> watch<00:02:34.690> out

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900
