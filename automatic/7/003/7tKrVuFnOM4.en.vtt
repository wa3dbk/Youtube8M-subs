you just feel how damn smooth these
these<00:01:59.250> experiences<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.200> yeah<00:02:01.200> compared<00:02:01.890> to

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
these experiences so yeah compared to

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.709 
these experiences so yeah compared to
the<00:02:02.040> monitors<00:02:02.399> in<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.969> market<00:02:03.420> right<00:02:03.509> now<00:02:03.570> I

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
the monitors in the market right now I

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.840 
the monitors in the market right now I
know<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.049> have<00:02:04.259> 75<00:02:04.649> around<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.490> twenty<00:02:05.729> Hertz

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
know you have 75 around a twenty Hertz

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.219 
know you have 75 around a twenty Hertz
you<00:02:06.090> have<00:02:06.210> hundred<00:02:06.479> forty-four<00:02:07.020> heard

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
you have hundred forty-four heard

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.350 
you have hundred forty-four heard
traffic<00:02:07.590> as<00:02:07.710> well<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.729> running<00:02:09.030> on<00:02:09.090> two

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
traffic as well this is running on two

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:09.840 
traffic as well this is running on two
hundred

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
hundred

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.450 
hundred
they<00:02:10.030> hurt<00:02:10.240> with<00:02:10.840> groundbreaking<00:02:11.500> technology

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
they hurt with groundbreaking technology

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.060 
they hurt with groundbreaking technology
technology<00:02:13.270> from<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.960> smart<00:02:14.500> people<00:02:14.650> over<00:02:15.010> at

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
technology from the smart people over at

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.730 
technology from the smart people over at
a<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:15.480> if<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.660> wasn't<00:02:16.870> enough<00:02:17.050> they<00:02:17.620> have

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
a so if that wasn't enough they have

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.510 
a so if that wasn't enough they have
also<00:02:17.950> extremely<00:02:18.700> low<00:02:18.880> input<00:02:19.150> lag<00:02:19.510> so<00:02:19.990> every

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
also extremely low input lag so every

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.800 
also extremely low input lag so every
order<00:02:21.520> every<00:02:21.820> action<00:02:22.030> you're<00:02:22.390> telling<00:02:22.720> your

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
order every action you're telling your

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.320 
order every action you're telling your
computer<00:02:23.320> it's<00:02:23.560> happening<00:02:24.490> it<00:02:24.910> happens

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
computer it's happening it happens

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.940 
computer it's happening it happens
immediately<00:02:25.450> so<00:02:26.110> it's<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.290> great<00:02:26.530> connection

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
immediately so it's a great connection

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.860 
immediately so it's a great connection
between<00:02:27.250> your<00:02:27.730> peripheral<00:02:28.270> your<00:02:28.510> computer

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
between your peripheral your computer

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.620 
between your peripheral your computer
and<00:02:29.020> monitor<00:02:29.110> it's<00:02:29.650> instant<00:02:30.630> environment

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
and monitor it's instant environment

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.060 
and monitor it's instant environment
you're<00:02:31.720> playing<00:02:31.990> in<00:02:32.200> so<00:02:32.770> that's<00:02:32.890> obviously

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
you're playing in so that's obviously

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.530 
you're playing in so that's obviously
going<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.490> increase<00:02:33.820> your<00:02:33.850> headshot<00:02:34.360> rate

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
going to increase your headshot rate

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.570 
going to increase your headshot rate
you're<00:02:35.140> going<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.590> be<00:02:35.650> able<00:02:35.710> to<00:02:35.890> nail<00:02:36.070> all<00:02:36.400> your

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
you're going to be able to nail all your

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.850 
you're going to be able to nail all your
movements<00:02:37.030> way<00:02:37.480> easier<00:02:38.020> because<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.620> feel

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
movements way easier because you feel

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.830 
movements way easier because you feel
like<00:02:39.040> one<00:02:39.400> with<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:39.970> monitor<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.450> guess<00:02:40.630> that

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
like one with the monitor I guess that

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.010 
like one with the monitor I guess that
is<00:02:40.960> the<00:02:40.990> message<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.770> throw<00:02:42.010> out<00:02:42.160> there

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
is the message to throw out there

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.650 
is the message to throw out there
further<00:02:44.020> features<00:02:44.590> again<00:02:45.250> being<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:45.820> VM<00:02:46.180> panel

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
further features again being a VM panel

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.110 
further features again being a VM panel
I<00:02:46.810> know<00:02:47.290> it's<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.470> bit<00:02:47.620> tacky<00:02:47.940> but<00:02:48.940> it's

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
I know it's a bit tacky but it's

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.780 
I know it's a bit tacky but it's
somewhat<00:02:49.540> of<00:02:49.720> a<00:02:49.840> hybrid<00:02:50.170> between<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:51.250> IPS

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
somewhat of a hybrid between the IPS

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.310 
somewhat of a hybrid between the IPS
panel<00:02:52.180> we<00:02:52.360> have<00:02:52.450> seen<00:02:52.690> in<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.990> previous

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
panel we have seen in the previous

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.510 
panel we have seen in the previous
porous<00:02:54.030> gaming<00:02:55.030> monitors<00:02:55.390> and<00:02:55.870> also<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.520> TN

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
porous gaming monitors and also the TN

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.050 
porous gaming monitors and also the TN
panel

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
panel

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.120 
panel
so<00:02:58.180> again<00:02:58.390> hybrid<00:02:58.840> between<00:02:59.020> T<00:02:59.320> and<00:02:59.350> an<00:02:59.740> idea

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
so again hybrid between T and an idea

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.360 
so again hybrid between T and an idea
what<00:03:00.910> is<00:03:01.000> a<00:03:01.030> TN<00:03:01.390> Pamela<00:03:01.870> well<00:03:02.830> that<00:03:03.070> has<00:03:03.190> been

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
what is a TN Pamela well that has been

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.030 
what is a TN Pamela well that has been
the<00:03:03.580> technology<00:03:04.210> the<00:03:04.600> competitors<00:03:05.470> aces<00:03:05.890> that

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
the technology the competitors aces that

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.040 
the technology the competitors aces that
I'd<00:03:06.160> be<00:03:06.280> using<00:03:06.610> for<00:03:06.790> a<00:03:06.820> while<00:03:06.940> a<00:03:07.240> superfast

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
I'd be using for a while a superfast

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.040 
I'd be using for a while a superfast
monitors<00:03:08.560> easily<00:03:09.460> its<00:03:09.760> able<00:03:10.330> to<00:03:10.540> actually<00:03:10.660> run

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
monitors easily its able to actually run

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.770 
monitors easily its able to actually run
at<00:03:11.170> 20<00:03:11.440> Hertz<00:03:11.590> but<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.940> quality<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:13.690> the

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
at 20 Hertz but the quality and the

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.050 
at 20 Hertz but the quality and the
consistency<00:03:13.990> of<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.920> quality<00:03:15.370> is<00:03:15.550> very<00:03:15.700> very

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
consistency of the quality is very very

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.710 
consistency of the quality is very very
low<00:03:16.630> so<00:03:17.320> what<00:03:17.860> do<00:03:18.250> I<00:03:18.340> mean<00:03:18.490> with<00:03:18.720> consistency

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
low so what do I mean with consistency

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.620 
low so what do I mean with consistency
quality<00:03:19.990> well<00:03:20.860> I<00:03:21.160> urge<00:03:21.670> you<00:03:21.850> people<00:03:22.150> with<00:03:22.270> TN

screen supervisor superdork and you you
look<00:03:29.500> in<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.770> center<00:03:30.070> of<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.190> monitor<00:03:30.520> you're

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
look in the center of the monitor you're

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.890 
look in the center of the monitor you're
going<00:03:30.850> to<00:03:30.910> see<00:03:31.090> that<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.450> color<00:03:31.660> is

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
going to see that the color is

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.170 
going to see that the color is
represented<00:03:32.860> perfectly<00:03:33.370> but<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:33.940> further

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
represented perfectly but the further

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.660 
represented perfectly but the further
you<00:03:34.390> go<00:03:34.570> out<00:03:34.750> again<00:03:35.620> this<00:03:35.800> is<00:03:35.950> a<00:03:35.980> 24<00:03:36.520> inch

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
you go out again this is a 24 inch

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.210 
you go out again this is a 24 inch
screen<00:03:36.910> the<00:03:37.030> further<00:03:37.240> you<00:03:37.780> go<00:03:37.960> out<00:03:38.110> into<00:03:39.100> the

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
screen the further you go out into the

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.190 
screen the further you go out into the
corner<00:03:39.580> so<00:03:39.700> you're<00:03:39.820> going<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.030> see<00:03:40.210> a<00:03:40.450> lack<00:03:41.170> of

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
corner so you're going to see a lack of

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.680 
corner so you're going to see a lack of
consistency<00:03:41.680> in<00:03:42.190> quality<00:03:42.220> but<00:03:43.210> here<00:03:43.390> you<00:03:43.510> see

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
consistency in quality but here you see
