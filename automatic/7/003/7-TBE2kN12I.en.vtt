ways that I've seen so far to make good
money<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.550> first<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.119> if<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.510> go<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.779> icon

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989

how quick you go so like six to ten
stores<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.090> if<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.629> do<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> quick<00:00:52.050> math

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
stores and if you do the quick math

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.500 
stores and if you do the quick math
that's<00:00:52.620> like<00:00:52.860> seven<00:00:53.340> seven<00:00:53.879> ish<00:00:53.969> grands<00:00:54.390> so

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
that's like seven seven ish grands so

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.069 
that's like seven seven ish grands so
that's<00:00:54.690> not<00:00:54.840> bad<00:00:55.820> so<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:56.850> that's<00:00:57.390> that's<00:00:57.780> one

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
really you can't really repeat it as

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.609 
really you can't really repeat it as

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.700 
unfortunately you can't do this every
single<00:01:36.509> time<00:01:36.840> which<00:01:37.049> really<00:01:37.320> kind<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.650> sucks

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
single time which really kind of sucks

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.740 
single time which really kind of sucks
if<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.549> could<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:39.060> know<00:01:39.090> walk<00:01:39.509> out<00:01:39.659> to

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
selling the car then you're good so what

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.039 
selling the car then you're good so what
you<00:01:44.850> do<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.149> just<00:01:45.270> scroll<00:01:45.479> down<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.810> sell

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049

here and then it shows you how much you

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.090 
here and then it shows you how much you
can<00:01:48.750> solve<00:01:48.960> for<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.470> then<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.619> sell<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.950> so

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100
