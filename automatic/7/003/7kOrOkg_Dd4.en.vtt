more<00:01:05.899> quickly<00:01:06.110> than<00:01:06.439> boots<00:01:06.950> you<00:01:07.100> have<00:01:07.280> in<00:01:07.430> the

more quickly than boots you have in the
past<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:09.200> flywheel<00:01:09.619> feels<00:01:09.860> a<00:01:09.979> bit<00:01:10.100> lighter

past the flywheel feels a bit lighter

past the flywheel feels a bit lighter
and<00:01:10.549> certainly<00:01:10.880> it<00:01:11.030> grabs<00:01:11.780> a<00:01:11.899> lot<00:01:12.049> faster<00:01:12.619> with

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
and certainly it grabs a lot faster with

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.010 
and certainly it grabs a lot faster with
the<00:01:12.890> four<00:01:13.100> valves<00:01:13.399> up<00:01:13.729> top<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:14.570> injection

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
the fuel injection makes a big

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.730 
the fuel injection makes a big
difference<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:16.549> the<00:01:16.640> way<00:01:16.820> to<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:18.200> engine<00:01:18.530> runs

torquey there's no no hesitating there's
I<00:01:57.370> found<00:01:57.670> was<00:01:57.790> I<00:01:58.030> don't<00:01:58.240> know<00:01:58.360> if<00:01:58.420> it's<00:01:58.600> a

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
I found was I don't know if it's a

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.240 
I found was I don't know if it's a
tuning<00:01:59.020> thing<00:01:59.200> with<00:01:59.320> the<00:01:59.440> Ducati<00:01:59.800> or<00:02:00.010> whether

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
tuning thing with the Ducati or whether

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.670 
tuning thing with the Ducati or whether
it's<00:02:00.460> just<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:01.180> way<00:02:01.300> it<00:02:01.420> is<00:02:01.540> but<00:02:01.870> I<00:02:02.200> found<00:02:02.530> a

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
it's just the way it is but I found a

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.280 
it's just the way it is but I found a
little<00:02:02.830> bit<00:02:02.950> hesitant<00:02:04.050> rolling<00:02:05.050> on<00:02:05.170> the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
little bit hesitant rolling on the

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.430 
little bit hesitant rolling on the
throttle<00:02:05.680> whereas<00:02:06.250> with<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.550> goosey<00:02:06.910> it's

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
throttle whereas with the goosey it's

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.260 
throttle whereas with the goosey it's
it's<00:02:08.440> just<00:02:08.649> solid<00:02:08.860> it<00:02:09.100> never<00:02:09.310> hesitates<00:02:09.910> never

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
it's just solid it never hesitates never

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.530 
it's just solid it never hesitates never
no<00:02:11.230> Hicks<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:11.770> coughs<00:02:12.520> it<00:02:12.790> just<00:02:13.000> rolls<00:02:13.300> right

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
no Hicks and coughs it just rolls right

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.350 
no Hicks and coughs it just rolls right
on<00:02:13.690> nice<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:13.930> smooth<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.590> very<00:02:15.490> powerful<00:02:16.090> and

on nice and smooth and very powerful and
you<00:02:16.870> really<00:02:17.140> feel<00:02:17.350> it<00:02:17.500> you<00:02:17.890> know<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.100> got

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
you really feel it you know you got

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.830 
you really feel it you know you got
something<00:02:18.580> powerful<00:02:19.150> underneath<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:19.810> there

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
something powerful underneath you there

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.200 
something powerful underneath you there
that's<00:02:20.140> for<00:02:20.290> sure

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.240 

one<00:02:26.210> of<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.780> downfalls<00:02:27.230> for<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.070> bike

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250

one of the the downfalls for the bike
for<00:02:28.460> myself<00:02:28.880> I<00:02:29.540> guess<00:02:30.500> for<00:02:30.650> somebody<00:02:30.890> who<00:02:30.950> had

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
for myself I guess for somebody who had

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.290 
for myself I guess for somebody who had
really<00:02:31.280> strong<00:02:31.490> hands<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:31.910> wouldn't<00:02:32.090> be<00:02:32.150> that

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
really strong hands it wouldn't be that

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.710 
really strong hands it wouldn't be that
bad<00:02:32.480> but<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:34.280> did<00:02:34.790> get<00:02:34.910> a<00:02:34.970> little<00:02:35.150> tired<00:02:35.420> not<00:02:35.660> I

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
bad but I did get a little tired not I

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.150 
bad but I did get a little tired not I
don't<00:02:35.840> know<00:02:35.900> if<00:02:35.960> that's<00:02:36.140> just<00:02:36.230> it's<00:02:36.860> probably

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
don't know if that's just it's probably

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.560 
don't know if that's just it's probably
a<00:02:37.220> combination<00:02:37.400> of<00:02:37.790> not<00:02:37.940> having<00:02:38.180> ridden<00:02:38.420> all

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
a combination of not having ridden all

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.830 
a combination of not having ridden all
winter<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:41.090> know<00:02:41.180> it's<00:02:41.330> just<00:02:41.420> first<00:02:41.690> time

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
winter and you know it's just first time

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.660 
winter and you know it's just first time
on<00:02:41.990> the<00:02:42.080> bike<00:02:42.260> kind<00:02:42.410> of<00:02:42.560> thing<00:02:42.740> for<00:02:42.950> quite<00:02:43.400> some

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
on the bike kind of thing for quite some

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.330 
on the bike kind of thing for quite some
time<00:02:43.700> but<00:02:44.690> it<00:02:45.110> was<00:02:45.230> tiring<00:02:45.470> after<00:02:46.130> a<00:02:46.160> while

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
time but it was tiring after a while

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.950 
time but it was tiring after a while
especially<00:02:47.150> with<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.660> you<00:02:47.840> know<00:02:47.870> the

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
especially with the you know the

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.990 
especially with the you know the
stopping<00:02:48.410> and<00:02:48.530> turning<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:48.980> riding<00:02:49.910> in

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
stopping and turning and riding in

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.720 
stopping and turning and riding in
traffic<00:02:50.150> it<00:02:50.570> would<00:02:51.070> it<00:02:52.070> was<00:02:52.160> a<00:02:52.190> little<00:02:52.400> heavy

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
traffic it would it was a little heavy

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.340 
traffic it would it was a little heavy
a<00:02:52.820> little<00:02:53.210> little<00:02:53.480> heavier<00:02:53.720> than<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:53.990> Ducati

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
a little little heavier than the Ducati

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.130 
a little little heavier than the Ducati
but<00:02:54.800> and<00:02:55.250> of<00:02:55.940> course<00:02:56.120> much<00:02:56.300> much<00:02:56.840> heavier<00:02:57.020> than

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
but and of course much much heavier than

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.720 
but and of course much much heavier than
most<00:02:57.380> of<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.590> Japanese<00:02:57.980> bikes<00:02:58.220> I<00:02:58.340> imagine

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
most of the Japanese bikes I imagine

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.570 
most of the Japanese bikes I imagine
well<00:02:59.510> this<00:02:59.630> thing<00:02:59.810> is<00:02:59.930> very<00:03:00.170> new<00:03:00.590> for<00:03:00.620> for<00:03:01.430> good

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
well this thing is very new for for good

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.390 
well this thing is very new for for good
see<00:03:01.700> in<00:03:01.790> a<00:03:01.850> lot<00:03:01.970> of<00:03:02.000> ways<00:03:02.240> no<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.600> engine<00:03:02.930> is<00:03:03.050> a

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
see in a lot of ways no the engine is a

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.770 
see in a lot of ways no the engine is a
radically<00:03:04.400> new<00:03:04.490> work<00:03:04.790> as<00:03:04.970> we<00:03:05.090> talked<00:03:05.300> earlier

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
radically new work as we talked earlier

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.170 
radically new work as we talked earlier
but<00:03:06.470> also<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.950> really<00:03:07.370> big<00:03:07.610> thing<00:03:07.820> that<00:03:08.000> the

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
but also the really big thing that the

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.970 
but also the really big thing that the
dr.<00:03:08.480> joy<00:03:08.630> Whitmer<00:03:08.990> is<00:03:09.110> done<00:03:09.290> for<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.530> factory

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
dr. joy Whitmer is done for the factory

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.160 
dr. joy Whitmer is done for the factory
is<00:03:10.100> to<00:03:10.550> redesign<00:03:10.910> their<00:03:11.240> do<00:03:11.390> rear<00:03:11.570> end<00:03:11.810> when<00:03:12.050> he

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
is to redesign their do rear end when he

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.780 
is to redesign their do rear end when he
was<00:03:12.290> racing<00:03:12.470> these<00:03:12.800> things<00:03:13.100> in<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.340> States

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
was racing these things in the States

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.760 
was racing these things in the States
he<00:03:14.330> developed<00:03:14.750> a<00:03:14.810> suspension<00:03:15.380> system<00:03:15.740> that

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
he developed a suspension system that

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.250 
he developed a suspension system that
basically<00:03:16.300> removed<00:03:17.300> the<00:03:17.450> shaft<00:03:17.690> drive<00:03:17.900> effect

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
basically removed the shaft drive effect

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.720 
basically removed the shaft drive effect
from<00:03:18.440> from<00:03:18.800> driving<00:03:19.010> this<00:03:19.190> thing<00:03:19.430> now<00:03:19.610> they

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
from from driving this thing now they

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.760 
from from driving this thing now they
they<00:03:19.910> still<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.600> rocks<00:03:20.900> a<00:03:21.140> bit<00:03:21.290> right<00:03:21.530> when<00:03:21.680> you

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
they still it rocks a bit right when you

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.200 
they still it rocks a bit right when you
really<00:03:22.040> Revit<00:03:22.370> that<00:03:22.490> the<00:03:22.700> thing<00:03:22.880> tends<00:03:23.120> to

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
really Revit that the thing tends to

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.150 
really Revit that the thing tends to
pull<00:03:23.390> over<00:03:23.540> on<00:03:23.750> like<00:03:23.900> yeah<00:03:24.530> it's<00:03:24.710> kind<00:03:24.920> of<00:03:24.950> fun

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
pull over on like yeah it's kind of fun

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.040 
pull over on like yeah it's kind of fun
but<00:03:25.610> it<00:03:25.760> used<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:26.090> be<00:03:26.210> also<00:03:26.390> that<00:03:26.780> you<00:03:26.930> know

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
but it used to be also that you know

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.390 
but it used to be also that you know
they<00:03:27.200> would<00:03:27.350> the<00:03:27.500> back<00:03:27.680> end<00:03:27.890> would<00:03:28.010> rise<00:03:28.250> and

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
they would the back end would rise and

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.130 
they would the back end would rise and
fall<00:03:28.670> quite<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:28.940> bit<00:03:29.150> as<00:03:29.300> he<00:03:29.480> got<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.750> power<00:03:29.960> on

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
fall quite a bit as he got the power on

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.170 
fall quite a bit as he got the power on
it<00:03:30.170> off<00:03:30.440> but<00:03:30.680> what<00:03:31.340> they've<00:03:31.490> done<00:03:31.580> back<00:03:31.970> in

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
it off but what they've done back in

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.770 
it off but what they've done back in
here<00:03:32.390> now<00:03:32.570> this<00:03:32.810> is<00:03:33.080> huge<00:03:33.320> casting<00:03:33.920> here

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
here now this is huge casting here

bracing<00:03:46.430> up<00:03:46.550> in<00:03:46.700> here<00:03:46.940> makes<00:03:47.240> it<00:03:47.360> even<00:03:47.480> more

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
bracing up in here makes it even more

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.630 
bracing up in here makes it even more
rigid<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:48.440> then<00:03:48.590> there's<00:03:48.830> two<00:03:49.070> back<00:03:49.370> on<00:03:49.400> the

doesn't go through the suspension

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.810 
doesn't go through the suspension
anymore<00:03:57.080> so<00:03:57.620> that<00:03:57.830> the<00:03:57.920> drive<00:03:58.130> shaft<00:03:58.400> out<00:03:58.670> in

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
anymore so that the drive shaft out in

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.400 
anymore so that the drive shaft out in
here<00:03:59.030> is<00:03:59.150> articulated<00:03:59.660> at<00:03:59.720> both<00:03:59.840> ends<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:00.320> the

here is articulated at both ends and the

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.590 
here is articulated at both ends and the
bottom<00:04:01.400> line<00:04:01.550> is<00:04:01.610> that<00:04:01.970> you<00:04:02.090> really<00:04:02.390> don't

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
bottom line is that you really don't

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.820 
bottom line is that you really don't
notice<00:04:02.720> that<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:02.990> shaft<00:04:03.200> drive<00:04:03.500> bike<00:04:03.710> it's

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
notice that the shaft drive bike it's

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.830 
notice that the shaft drive bike it's
not<00:04:03.860> like<00:04:04.130> driving<00:04:04.220> a<00:04:04.490> BMW<00:04:04.640> or<00:04:05.060> an<00:04:05.300> older<00:04:05.540> Gucci

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
not like driving a BMW or an older Gucci

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.660 
not like driving a BMW or an older Gucci
at<00:04:05.990> all<00:04:06.140> it<00:04:06.350> just<00:04:06.380> really<00:04:06.950> is<00:04:07.040> not<00:04:07.190> an<00:04:07.370> effect

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
at all it just really is not an effect

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.780 
at all it just really is not an effect
it's<00:04:07.850> remarkable<00:04:08.390> piece<00:04:08.510> of<00:04:08.540> work

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.149 

the<00:04:11.780> clutch<00:04:12.050> is<00:04:12.260> just<00:04:12.440> a<00:04:12.500> little<00:04:12.769> too<00:04:12.920> tiring

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 
the clutch is just a little too tiring

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:16.599 
the clutch is just a little too tiring
for<00:04:14.030> doing<00:04:14.480> a<00:04:14.540> lot<00:04:14.750> of<00:04:15.010> on<00:04:16.010> the<00:04:16.190> highway<00:04:16.489> it

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
for doing a lot of on the highway it

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.879 
for doing a lot of on the highway it
wouldn't<00:04:16.880> be<00:04:16.940> a<00:04:16.970> problem<00:04:17.209> but<00:04:17.449> in<00:04:17.840> city<00:04:18.470> or<00:04:18.739> in

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
wouldn't be a problem but in city or in

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.469 
wouldn't be a problem but in city or in
town<00:04:19.130> it<00:04:19.400> would<00:04:19.489> be<00:04:19.699> would<00:04:19.970> be<00:04:20.090> a<00:04:20.120> little<00:04:20.329> tough

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
town it would be would be a little tough

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.740 
town it would be would be a little tough
I<00:04:20.660> think<00:04:20.690> and<00:04:21.430> for<00:04:22.430> myself<00:04:22.580> and<00:04:23.060> I<00:04:23.389> found<00:04:23.660> that

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
I think and for myself and I found that

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.860 
I think and for myself and I found that
the<00:04:23.960> the<00:04:24.380> warning<00:04:24.590> lights<00:04:24.919> it<00:04:25.669> just<00:04:26.000> I<00:04:26.330> don't

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
the the warning lights it just I don't

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.930 
the the warning lights it just I don't
know<00:04:26.930> if<00:04:27.050> it's<00:04:27.169> just<00:04:27.229> my<00:04:27.590> height<00:04:27.830> or<00:04:28.160> or<00:04:28.580> what

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
know if it's just my height or or what

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.909 
know if it's just my height or or what
it<00:04:29.060> is<00:04:29.090> but<00:04:29.419> I<00:04:29.870> find<00:04:30.199> that<00:04:30.290> this<00:04:30.530> rubber<00:04:32.919> edging

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
it is but I find that this rubber edging

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.909 
it is but I find that this rubber edging
here<00:04:34.160> it<00:04:34.340> obliterates<00:04:35.300> the<00:04:35.360> warning<00:04:35.660> lights

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
here it obliterates the warning lights

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.140 
here it obliterates the warning lights
perfectly<00:04:36.919> just<00:04:37.250> from<00:04:37.370> where<00:04:37.520> I'm<00:04:37.639> sitting<00:04:38.000> I

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
perfectly just from where I'm sitting I

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.210 
perfectly just from where I'm sitting I
have<00:04:38.330> to<00:04:38.419> duck<00:04:38.630> I<00:04:38.930> have<00:04:39.530> to<00:04:39.620> duck<00:04:39.800> a<00:04:39.830> little<00:04:40.130> bit

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
have to duck I have to duck a little bit

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.900 
have to duck I have to duck a little bit
to<00:04:40.340> see<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.580> warning<00:04:40.880> lights<00:04:41.139> but<00:04:42.729> and<00:04:43.729> I

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
to see the warning lights but and I

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.870 
to see the warning lights but and I
another<00:04:44.539> thing<00:04:44.750> I<00:04:44.870> noticed<00:04:44.900> was<00:04:45.620> I<00:04:46.220> certainly

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
another thing I noticed was I certainly

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.060 
another thing I noticed was I certainly
wouldn't<00:04:47.180> give<00:04:47.330> it<00:04:47.419> up<00:04:47.479> for<00:04:47.539> this<00:04:47.780> but<00:04:48.070> my

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
wouldn't give it up for this but my

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.730 
wouldn't give it up for this but my
niece<00:04:49.419> sort<00:04:50.419> of<00:04:50.510> knocking<00:04:50.870> into<00:04:51.260> the<00:04:51.380> cylinder

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
niece sort of knocking into the cylinder

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.219 
niece sort of knocking into the cylinder
heads<00:04:52.270> but<00:04:53.270> I<00:04:53.300> guess<00:04:53.510> it's<00:04:53.660> you<00:04:53.840> know<00:04:53.960> kind<00:04:54.169> of

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
heads but I guess it's you know kind of

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.080 
heads but I guess it's you know kind of
depends<00:04:54.530> on<00:04:54.560> where<00:04:54.740> you<00:04:54.800> sit<00:04:54.830> on<00:04:55.100> the<00:04:55.190> feet<00:04:55.460> but

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
depends on where you sit on the feet but

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.700 
depends on where you sit on the feet but
I<00:04:56.330> found<00:04:56.750> that<00:04:56.900> the<00:04:56.990> most<00:04:57.080> comfortable<00:04:57.530> spot

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
I found that the most comfortable spot

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.170 
I found that the most comfortable spot
on<00:04:57.949> the<00:04:58.039> seat<00:04:58.250> was<00:04:58.400> right<00:04:58.610> up<00:04:58.729> close<00:04:58.850> to<00:04:59.060> the

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
on the seat was right up close to the

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.860 
on the seat was right up close to the
tank<00:04:59.449> and<00:05:00.880> that<00:05:01.880> was<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.060> best<00:05:02.210> position<00:05:02.690> for

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
tank and that was the best position for

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.779 
tank and that was the best position for
me<00:05:02.990> yet<00:05:03.229> my<00:05:03.650> knees<00:05:03.889> were<00:05:04.039> just<00:05:04.250> brushing<00:05:04.669> on

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
me yet my knees were just brushing on

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.700 
me yet my knees were just brushing on
the<00:05:04.910> cylinder<00:05:05.360> heads<00:05:05.539> which<00:05:05.690> which<00:05:06.080> wasn't<00:05:06.289> I

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
the cylinder heads which which wasn't I

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.020 
the cylinder heads which which wasn't I
mean<00:05:06.889> it<00:05:06.979> wasn't<00:05:07.100> a<00:05:07.220> problem<00:05:07.400> it<00:05:07.729> was<00:05:07.820> just<00:05:07.970> a

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
mean it wasn't a problem it was just a

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.760 
mean it wasn't a problem it was just a
matter<00:05:08.180> of<00:05:08.300> shifting<00:05:08.780> shifting<00:05:09.289> yourself

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
matter of shifting shifting yourself

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.250 
matter of shifting shifting yourself
just<00:05:09.949> you<00:05:10.130> know<00:05:10.250> an<00:05:10.490> inch<00:05:10.850> or<00:05:10.970> so<00:05:11.000> back<00:05:11.300> and<00:05:11.630> and

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
just you know an inch or so back and and

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.320 
just you know an inch or so back and and
that<00:05:12.680> was<00:05:12.770> enough<00:05:13.039> I<00:05:13.340> suspect<00:05:13.970> that<00:05:14.030> a<00:05:14.150> lot<00:05:14.180> of

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
that was enough I suspect that a lot of

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.969 
that was enough I suspect that a lot of
this<00:05:14.510> switch<00:05:14.750> gear<00:05:15.050> is<00:05:15.169> is<00:05:15.380> Nippon<00:05:15.710> Denso
