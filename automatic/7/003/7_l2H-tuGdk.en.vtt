00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.940
 hello I am thierry cloud editor 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.920
 chief of the magazine the fisherman of France 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.410
 today I'm going to show you this 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.590
 what is a casting reel or a 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.369
 spinning reel then 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.890
 traditionally in France 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:25.199
 we use this type of milling this 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.789
 reel is a fixed spinning reel 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:33.210
 that is to say that this part there remain 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.680
 fixed does not move it's this part 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.000
 who turning is going to come wrap the wire 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.469
 on the reel 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.809
 look here we see the movement and 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.640
 it's this movement while the drum 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.289
 remains fixed this pick-up movement 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.780
 accepting this we call the pick up 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.570
 who comes to wrap the wire around the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.020
 coil in reverse on a reel to 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:05.840
 rotating drum is the coil that is 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:10.260
 mobile and the mount that stays fixed so 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.850
 here you have a joystick that allows you to 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.470
 disengage the coil you see it 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.170
 turns to make it thready and when I 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.439
 will make and reel the reel turn to 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.530
 again in the other direction to return 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.869
 surrounded the wire around its axis good 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.509
 so why use a reel to 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.180
 rotating drum simply because 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.720
 that he still has certain advantages 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.110
 incontestable 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:41.790
 first as you can see 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:44.909
 the line comes out directly from the reel 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.880
 we are in direct contact with the 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.280
 son so with theirs so with the 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.600
 fish of course this way 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.299
 we have a lot more power 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.719
 to fight the fish and we have 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.820
 also a lot more sensitivity 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:05.340
 since there is no blind spot and 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.360
 the film forms no angle that it is in 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.110
 live with theirs or the fish when 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.140
 a fish took theirs so voice 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.660
 if the two big advantages of the drum 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.240
 turning one is live with his 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.930
 fish and with his lure and we're in 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.020
 live with his son with his line 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.780
 so we have a lot more power 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.940
 especially during a fight but also 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.250
 for the animation of some time on 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.680
 uses very often to fish the 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.020
 pike today theirs that weighs 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.050
 more than 100 grams which are so very 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.540
 very heavy and a spinning reel 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.200
 turning alas much more suitable 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.510
 because he has a lot more power 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.390
 so it is not recommended to use 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.459
 a fixed drum with Seville late because 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.560
 that the kz would have trouble supporting 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.680
 a long time very abrupt movements 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.850
 animation and shocks to throws 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.270
 with lures that can weigh 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:08.810
 up to 150 g in the same way since 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:11.450
 live with his lure you can 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.270
 have animation maneuvers at the 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.290
 times much more accurately is a lot 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.250
 more sensitive 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.860
 we know exactly where his 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.650
 decoy we will be much better account 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.860
 of the effect produced by a drawn on the 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.600
 they feel much better 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.000
 delicate touches of some fish 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.640
 simply because we are in 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.670
 direct contact without right angle 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.220
 like on the fixed drum this allows 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.470
 more precise animations and 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.890
 reactions to the key faster and 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:49.250
 more accurate also so use a 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.280
 rotating drum as soon as you use 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.110
 as soon as you fish with lures 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.489
 of a certain weight do not use 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.549
 turning especially at the beginning 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:02.150
 below 10 15 grams and get used 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.720
 you to the sensitivity it provides and to 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.820
 the precision that it will allow you 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.900
 to have in your animations and in your 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:13.100
 reactions to the touch 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:16.010
 for the rest this new line and works 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.459
 like a spinning reel it 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.639
 has a brake 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.780
 who is here a star that will allow 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:27.780
 to slow down the fish during the fight 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:31.639
 and curb his ardor and he owns 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:36.150
 also on the side 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.539
 a setting for the events of the 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.680
 coil 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:42.720
 so now you know what is to 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.889
 mill a spinning drum you 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.470
 know these benefits 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.870
 so do not hesitate to take it to you 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.960
 serve and use it whenever 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.960
 It's necessary
