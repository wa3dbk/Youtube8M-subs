00:05:48.300 --> 00:06:08.240 

over<00:05:48.810> the<00:05:49.050> entire<00:05:49.139> shooters

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:16.290 

so<00:06:10.080> no<00:06:11.080> we<00:06:11.800> let<00:06:11.950> this<00:06:12.100> dry<00:06:14.640> it's<00:06:15.640> nice<00:06:15.880> that<00:06:15.910> you

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
so no we let this dry it's nice that you

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.620 
so no we let this dry it's nice that you
are<00:06:16.420> still<00:06:16.660> watching<00:06:17.880> then<00:06:18.880> again<00:06:19.150> that<00:06:19.450> we

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
are still watching then again that we

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:30.080 
are still watching then again that we
forage<00:06:20.080> with<00:06:20.710> this<00:06:20.920> flesh<00:06:21.400> wash<00:06:23.970> the<00:06:24.970> corner

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:36.360 

this<00:06:31.090> procedure<00:06:32.580> makes<00:06:33.580> several<00:06:34.180> times<00:06:35.370> so

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
this procedure makes several times so

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.030 
this procedure makes several times so
you<00:06:36.430> get<00:06:36.700> a<00:06:36.730> very<00:06:37.770> realistic

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:39.040 
you get a very realistic

00:06:39.040 --> 00:07:03.749 
you get a very realistic
rusty<00:06:40.920> surface

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:11.519 

I<00:07:05.129> think<00:07:06.360> this<00:07:07.360> is<00:07:07.479> enough<00:07:09.509> and<00:07:10.509> we<00:07:10.930> will<00:07:11.259> let

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:11.529 
I think this is enough and we will let

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:16.800 
I think this is enough and we will let
us<00:07:11.740> try<00:07:12.009> and<00:07:12.960> start<00:07:13.960> with<00:07:14.080> a<00:07:14.259> real<00:07:14.469> picture
