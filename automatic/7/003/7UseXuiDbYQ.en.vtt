00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
I'm always looking for a way out of

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.120 
I'm always looking for a way out of
situations<00:02:59.140> you<00:03:00.140> arrange<00:03:00.380> three<00:03:00.560> strips

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
situations you arrange three strips

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.580 
situations you arrange three strips
going<00:03:01.760> in<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:01.970> same<00:03:02.120> direction<00:03:02.180> side<00:03:03.110> by<00:03:03.290> side

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
going in the same direction side by side

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.860 
going in the same direction side by side
and<00:03:03.890> not<00:03:04.160> a<00:03:04.220> weave<00:03:04.550> it<00:03:04.790> lifts<00:03:05.270> up<00:03:05.480> this<00:03:05.630> end

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
and not a weave it lifts up this end

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.570 
and not a weave it lifts up this end
it's<00:03:06.380> just<00:03:06.560> like<00:03:06.590> building<00:03:06.980> a<00:03:07.040> lattice<00:03:07.370> pie

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
it's just like building a lattice pie

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.190 
it's just like building a lattice pie
crust<00:03:07.940> kind<00:03:08.180> of<00:03:08.330> think<00:03:08.600> I've<00:03:08.690> seen<00:03:08.900> this<00:03:09.050> done

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
crust kind of think I've seen this done

just dried oregano this is dried oregano
oregano<00:03:43.820> is<00:03:44.270> like<00:03:44.390> one<00:03:44.570> of<00:03:44.600> those<00:03:44.780> one<00:03:45.350> of<00:03:45.380> the

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
oregano is like one of those one of the

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.050 
oregano is like one of those one of the
few<00:03:45.770> herbs<00:03:45.980> I<00:03:46.190> think<00:03:46.459> it's<00:03:46.580> actually<00:03:46.730> better

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
few herbs I think it's actually better

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.330 
few herbs I think it's actually better
grade<00:03:47.480> than<00:03:47.510> it<00:03:47.959> is<00:03:48.110> than<00:03:48.650> it<00:03:48.740> is<00:03:48.890> fresh<00:03:49.130> I

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
grade than it is than it is fresh I

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.040 
grade than it is than it is fresh I
don't<00:03:49.550> like<00:03:49.640> goat<00:03:49.970> cheese<00:03:50.000> what<00:03:50.570> can<00:03:50.720> I<00:03:50.810> what

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
don't like goat cheese what can I what

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.470 
don't like goat cheese what can I what
else<00:03:51.200> can<00:03:51.380> I<00:03:51.440> use<00:03:51.680> baraha<00:03:52.130> would<00:03:52.730> be<00:03:52.910> so<00:03:53.150> good

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
else can I use baraha would be so good

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.260 
else can I use baraha would be so good
with<00:03:53.540> it<00:03:53.840> I<00:03:54.250> think<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.370> goat<00:03:55.580> cheese<00:03:55.820> is<00:03:56.030> good

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
with it I think the goat cheese is good

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.880 
with it I think the goat cheese is good
because<00:03:56.480> it's<00:03:56.870> got<00:03:57.050> you<00:03:57.530> know<00:03:57.590> it's<00:03:57.740> got<00:03:57.860> a

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
because it's got you know it's got a

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.470 
because it's got you know it's got a
little<00:03:58.100> bit<00:03:58.280> of<00:03:58.310> a<00:03:58.430> tang<00:03:58.820> that<00:03:59.090> burrata

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
little bit of a tang that burrata

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.790 
little bit of a tang that burrata
doesn't<00:03:59.959> have<00:04:00.140> and<00:04:00.380> I<00:04:00.410> think<00:04:00.440> it<00:04:00.680> really

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
doesn't have and I think it really

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.010 
doesn't have and I think it really
complements<00:04:01.490> the<00:04:01.640> zucchini<00:04:02.060> well<00:04:02.300> so<00:04:02.690> kind<00:04:02.930> of

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
complements the zucchini well so kind of

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.600 
complements the zucchini well so kind of
any<00:04:03.140> soft<00:04:03.470> cheese<00:04:03.800> you're<00:04:04.160> saying<00:04:04.400> though

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
any soft cheese you're saying though

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.310 
any soft cheese you're saying though
might<00:04:04.850> work<00:04:05.030> whatever<00:04:05.330> whatever<00:04:05.930> you<00:04:06.080> like

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
might work whatever whatever you like

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.620 
might work whatever whatever you like
maybe<00:04:06.620> even<00:04:07.160> a<00:04:07.310> ricotta<00:04:07.670> ricotta<00:04:08.060> would<00:04:08.510> be

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
maybe even a ricotta ricotta would be

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.120 
maybe even a ricotta ricotta would be
really<00:04:08.870> really<00:04:09.110> good<00:04:09.230> you<00:04:09.620> want<00:04:09.800> something

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
really really good you want something

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.949 
really really good you want something
that's<00:04:10.220> soft<00:04:10.580> and<00:04:10.790> fairly<00:04:11.150> bland<00:04:11.450> so<00:04:11.720> that<00:04:11.870> you

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
that's soft and fairly bland so that you

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.080 
that's soft and fairly bland so that you
can<00:04:12.170> kind<00:04:12.709> of<00:04:12.800> beat<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.190> other<00:04:13.310> flavors<00:04:13.790> into

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
can kind of beat the other flavors into

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.820 
can kind of beat the other flavors into
it<00:04:14.209> and<00:04:14.300> add<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.660> flavors<00:04:14.989> that<00:04:15.020> you<00:04:15.170> want<00:04:15.500> and

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
it and add the flavors that you want and

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:16.960 
it and add the flavors that you want and
once<00:04:15.980> that's<00:04:16.160> done<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.609> only<00:04:16.700> thing<00:04:16.790> that's

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
once that's done the only thing that's

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.090 
once that's done the only thing that's
left<00:04:17.030> to<00:04:17.270> do<00:04:17.510> we'll<00:04:18.080> just<00:04:18.230> slice<00:04:18.680> up<00:04:18.890> some<00:04:18.919> of

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
left to do we'll just slice up some of
