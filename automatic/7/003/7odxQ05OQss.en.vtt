00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.490
 wonderful as it is macho that does not 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.490
 we will go see the following notes 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.660
 after having surgery 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.610
 that Martha Quiñones so longed for 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.910
 improve one or another question in your 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.640
 body was discharged where little to 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:35.200
 little we will see the results of this 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.559
 shared change we have a commitment 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.660
 then to fulfill the dream that I already had 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.570
 thanks to a breast augmentation as we see 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.720
 it looks pretty clear could have the 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.570
 doctor the return we can take it 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.300
 clearly yes it has a superior pole 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.230
 of your breasts I have also seen with greater 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.410
 more waist volume 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.970
 more projected to the hips and when 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.770
 let's have another type of theft visit 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.949
 have a full belly button 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.920
 nice without those customer's offspring and 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.260
 stretched so important is surgery 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.090
 how postoperative care would be 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.220
 a good post-operative good as 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.100
 you have accompanied her on the day of three 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.990
 days has never presented pain always 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.460
 I have done I love it in my mom I do not 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.080
 A person also hurts when you speak 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.360
 in the north there pain when you 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.360
 I had pain to see that they have a few days and 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.539
 has not been inflamed is perfect is 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.190
 also located already with 16 days as she 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.140
 presented at the waist very marked 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.180
 it will happen well formed and its navel 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.979
 stretches and functionality especially that 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.560
 I want more relaxed personality 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:46.289
 as our artist there is something that you go 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.429
 to miss the postoperative but that 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.429
 is the suite where you were 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.360
 not really happy and grateful 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.370
 because an excellent job at the doctor 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.920
 we created it I repeat it when I woke up not 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.420
 I thought it was me and I said wow yes I 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.390
 they did but I feel happy I feel 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.250
 grateful grateful it 's nice when a 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.630
 professional copper in you and you feel 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.429
 well you feel satisfied and very 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.200
 grateful with her work too and I 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.300
 I am clear here that a little bit is missing 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.420
 recovery but already like that says 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.920
 we're fine it still does not end all 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.350
 because I know that she feels very good 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.500
 that already the post-operative in theory is 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.360
 high but remember that it deserves 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.530
 to reduce inflammation and we're going to do that 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.840
 through the drainage massages 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.080
 lymphatic we are going to take everything soft 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.390
 let's do let's walk slowly 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.209
 you're not going to be if I'm still going to be that 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.830
 I believe that I from the month but if 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.660
 well I want you to wander and you already walk a 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.100
 little bit more after finishing all the 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.530
 inflammatory fluids begin to 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.030
 drain so you know how to take it 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.320
 until a postoperative the best way 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.510
 to follow the directions to 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.520
 recover me prisoner who prepare 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.100
 because I have seen no jam 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.690
 really all liked but girls 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.570
 they thought patterns always see 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.850
 puts the two shirts one stroke and another 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.710
 to respond very close together so 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.710
 prepare and feed 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.980
 for let's go with everything now maple 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.520
 in our dear friend martín aquino 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.459
 I appreciated the doctor's recommendations 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.099
 to take good care of yourself, you know you do not have to 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.569
 to the letter the postoperative 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.280
 it can be depends a lot on the 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.709
 postoperative many people say to me 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.810
 they did wrong everything does not happen sometimes that 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.500
 they do not take care say for example do not smoke 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.569
 do not expose yourself to dust 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.180
 Do not expose to the sun and it does it's 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.650
 many times it does not depend on the surgeon 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.209
 It depends a lot on the person who has 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.810
 to take care of in the postoperative period I 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.989
 I think she has 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.430
 more or less think a little about your health and 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.920
 also to think he just has to 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.099
 think also in your head is to say no 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.380
 have courage do not act in a good way 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.300
 does not contain is still recovering 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.310
 my dear friend marqueta and is already 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.769
 thinking about you to discuss special with 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.810
 your partners so I think you have 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.880
 to take another attitude boys today 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.989
 after the second lipo I do not 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.060
 I have done nothing and after overcoming a 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.220
 depression I have trouble eating after that 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.110
 probably wait a good time and I 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.120
 what I have to do or massages 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.130
 I've taken care of myself and seen the results 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.570
 is that if you leave me with two exceptions in 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.850
 chad and you are but this makes a very 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.950
 process and how that best milestone is that 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.630
 take care of the process you because you put on 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.460
 eat you get to do everything that 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.520
 when he told you they are not going to look good and 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.510
 scar to take out horrible I sprout 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.280
 forward when you recently left a 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.320
 surgery because you're bloated you want 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.729
 see a result immediately and it's 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.760
 impossible but the good thing is that martita 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.250
 It's in 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.710
 very very good hands so I what 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.230
 I recommend it as a bucket said 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.510
 reassure yourself and marta you are regal now 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:04.210
 has its name the television you know 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.040
 of his existence of everything he does 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.050
 so friends do not need right now 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.370
 to be polemicizing what is a thing 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.370
 has been 10 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.370
 that they respect me and that they forgive me 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.890
 wife and with the respect of the 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:24.160
 viewers but it seems to me that 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:27.850
 Martha Quiñones is spectacular 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.500
 you know you see a great body in the flesh 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.590
 I do not know if they have done anything to him but 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.230
 I see the cava I see how are you 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:38.230
 go ahead or do not stop in this 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.360
 surgery contributed a lot in the life of 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.210
 Marta quiñones because I see her in another or 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.680
 be the truth a change you see is the 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.680
 level of advancement and all these 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:56.580
 for me I suppose 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.580
 in your eyes or something I do not know 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:08.290
 suddenly but when they talk to you about 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.130
 Marta's face that I 'm spectacular and 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:15.130
 with that body he stayed and was amazed 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:16.900
 the bags in the eyes the ears more 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.280
 girls that we let stop eating 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.110
 Care and fainting that's horrible 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.870
 beware of this number 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.460
 emilio out until going to band because 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.530

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.160
 trail to retire because I carry marten with 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.690
 fire 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.260
 Now we are going to recommend our 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.260
 viewers
