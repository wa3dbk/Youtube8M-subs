00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.259
 there is a toilet until eight in the evening 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.820
 unsanitary conditions as they say there is 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.510
 what can hardly be called a shower 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.219
 the neighborhood 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.830
 such conditions and even in the heat 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.230
 Belarus live not the first week 9 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.210
 May did not go to the Uzbek Termez mouse 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.130
 than 4000 kilometers from home to 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.680
 border with afghanistan to tong 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:27.720
 profit value of 20 and no further 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:32.520
 spent the cars temperature at night 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.770
 in this case drops to 30 local 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.309
 kitchen stomach does not stand format 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.800
 we promise that here it is work 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.820
 first time so far from before were like 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.100
 would also be the same under similar but not like that 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.050
 more or less money saves like 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.820
 may need to call home and constantly 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.500
 keep the air conditioner on and 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.480
 similar situations really were 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.280
 last winter Belarusian truckers 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.410
 stuck all in the same uzbekistan 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.120
 true because of the weather the desert has become 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.590
 snow week held out 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.359
 30 degree frost 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.339
 but the queue of heavy trucks is exactly one year 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.860
 back under following transit through 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.549
 uzbekistan in neighboring afghanistan different 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.540
 seasons 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.820
 the carrier is the same 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.890
 the fact that it is time to rescue the Belarusians but not 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.320
 just the carrier is recognized here on the table 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.940
 their 44 last names says the scheme of work 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.130
 international driver in this project 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.230
 This need to arrive in Termez further 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.180
 trailer with cargo taken to afghanistan and 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.830
 as soon as he returns from abroad 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.020
 free trucker trailer him 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.420
 picks up and leaves home from here question 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.729
 why all this time empty trailers don't 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.660
 coming out of afghanistan stands on the very 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.470
 business six firms 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.840
 This Poles Bulgarians Latvians Russians and 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.330
 and 2 Belarusian companies there is difficult 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.130
 judge of course the reason is simple 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.280
 because somewhere this could be 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.280
 trade secret of our customer but 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.800
 according to information such is not quite 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.160
 official there is a problem with customs 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.560
 payments from our customer with 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.479
 Afghan customer by the way Bulgarian 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.400
 the side that she did not share with the Afghan 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.410
 partners can hardly find out from 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.250
 Director of the output and not the altogether 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:12.830
 vacation I can say this model and 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.360
 both complicate the situation that in 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.560
 There is no Belarusian deep in Afghanistan 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.970
 representation and even by 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.720
 part-time there is no one 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.220
 accredited 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.230
 and here is the embassy of our country in 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.630
 Uzbekistan sees no problems and a craving 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.580
 so countrymen truckers do not know but 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.590
 already seems and deploy rescue 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.660
 the operation would be a late carrier 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.730
 promised tomorrow he will begin to withdraw his 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.709
 bolshegruzov home for five cars in 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.570
 the manner in which they once drove into 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.670
 Uzbekistan and more for barrels to them 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.350
 promised solid travel in that 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.360
 including due to simple if they of course 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.510

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.769
