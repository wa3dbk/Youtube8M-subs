00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 it is not possible to rewrite 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.899
 the story is so the verdict is 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.910
 final sound was eliminated yesterday 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.889
 afternoon of the Coupe de France 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.170
 football by the brest club stadium 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.139
 league 1 after the shots on goal 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.029
 4-2 but hard that this story is 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.270
 painful because it will have missed only one 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.000
 nothing a little nothing for this 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.400
 Toggle game for proof it is his 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.769
 who opens the score by saic at the 29th 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.140
 minute a goal that rewards a start 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.090
 almost perfect game in any case in 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.180
 the style of the sonnet full of ardor and 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.770
 talent but in the 41st minute last was 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.920
 takes a ball that damien leclere 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.660
 had just come out and equalizes 1 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.989
 everywhere at the break and despite the will 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.360
 Luçonnais who will never have weakened 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.730
 the score will stay the same until the end 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.100
 of the meeting the extensions there 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.379
 will change nothing the opportunities flies to 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.239
 side or above goals and both 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.640
 teams must therefore decide between 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.590
 shots on goal at this little brest game 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.000
 have it but with regret 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.530
 first a surprise is that we could 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.060
 compete with this team of links 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.100
 now here is the bad it is that 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.909
 we get eliminated at the most penalty 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.470
 hard scenarios so a rudeness 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.939
 despite everything even if the last one was 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.860
 Satisfy our match there we are proud 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.720
 to have a production like that I think 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.250
 we still made the public happy 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.540
 who came to see us we did not have 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.000
 not played little arm 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.009
 we played with the means we know 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.049
 do it so we see it give it as much and 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.240
 and then rewarded pat five boys are 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.320
 very down now when it's a 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.290
 bad for a good to pick up there I 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.880
 know nothing but it's disappointing 102 years 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.000
 to immediately produce something face 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.070
 and beautiful teams 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.710
 it's the sport that's the result 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.040
 account and we stayed in ten 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.410
 days 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.670
 or as tonight the draw of 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.700
 he says he will be more than these tops 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.830
 brest will have a draw to live and play 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.140
 and brest by the voice of his coach 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.030
 did not fail of course to salute 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.340
 his tough opponent and oh how 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.910
 dangerous the 32nd this round of matches 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.310
 special 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.660
 in addition there is a team of Luzon me 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.950
 I had the opportunity to see them the year 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.750
 last against Lyon at the Beaujoire 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.149
 I knew it was a team that 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.350
 play well ball and my colleagues 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.720
 Finisteres who are in the same 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.800
 CFA group told me all openly 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.170
 that it was the best team in the 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.610
 group so I'm not surprised by by 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.970
 the quality of play they have that they have 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.290
 deployed now this is the magic of the 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.910
 cup of France this is always necessary 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.550
 spend his first laps there for that 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.870
 After we enter the rite really 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.850
 the competition after me I'm a 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.370
 coach who is going to suffer for a 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.900
 month and a half waiting for the can will be 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.870
 not finished we have a lot of absentees 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.040
 more hanging a few injured have 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.750
 not make the list of players who 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.650
 were who was absent tonight I had 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.260
 says that I will not make a decision 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.900
 behind the wounded so I 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.510
 suffered to suffered yes even though the goal 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.890
 Brest just before the break their 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.810
 no doubt saved the bet 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.130
 yeah a little bit necessarily the scenario is 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.510
 write now that we can we can we 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.370
 can we can describe it scenario 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.870
 it is true that this goal comes quickly 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.940
 now we had a lot of water 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.620
 makes a big start to the match 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.880
 will be the last fifteen minutes we had 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.799
 Paid something but we paid cash 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.140
 on purpose we could have avoided this shot 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.780
 Frank we knew we had more or less 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.220
 many studied this team of brest and 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.140
 we knew the ball was going to land 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.970
 there daniel taxiing does the job 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.350
 initially and after this it 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.090
 again the lack is a small detail 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.380
 behind lyon we thought they were going 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.510
 take out the ball they played we take 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.120
 a goal there we knew that the ball arrive 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.260
 there had to be attentive to the help 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.540
 disciplined rigorous it was not and 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.769
 we paid it here it's mistakes 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.290
 that we must not do at this level 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.390
 there we do them and we pay them cash 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.540
 same disappointment obviously for the 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.969
 smic players 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.939
 know that they have passed well near 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:41.709
 the feat inevitably that this camp it is 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:45.879
 play on penalties this is the lottery one 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:48.340
 little one chance out of two disappointed in view of the 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:50.709
 content I think we have a good mastery 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.530
 even if at times they have a big 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.209
 highlights we were able to compete with this 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.900
 team again as we had been able 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.250
 do it in lyon 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.590
 except that here we have them outright 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.269
 pushed to the penalty shootout so that's 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.150
 necessarily disappointed but it's true that there 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.519
 a lot of regrets we went to 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.680
 a hair like as you say with 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.170
 effective ion me as a guardian 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.400
 it's very hard because the penaltys 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.620
 you want to be the hero and then 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.570
 finally you are not and it's true 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.699
 that I think the pill is going to be 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.810
 really very very hard to swallow it's 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.430
 often the case as a couple has 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.750
 especially did not finally see 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.900
 so many differences that between two 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.150
 teams usually a team that 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.710
 is lower than I am 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.509
 professional amateur game team 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.560
 that can skew a toy 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:36.460
 behind us it's not our 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.690
 game philosophy in avenue nation wants 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.360
 beat them brest and we wanted to beat them 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.889
 by the game 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.639
 we play in the league we did not want 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.210
 adapt to them it's true that there 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.280
 Normally delivered a nice performance 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.629
 because in terms of quality of play I 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.969
 think we were even superior to 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:53.460
 remains almost more we will have to forget 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:56.250
 this match to plunge back into the 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.330
 championship of CFA even though everyone knows 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.939
 that it will be difficult 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.949
 it's going to be very, very hard now 

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:04.080
 championship we will rethink in time in 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.379
 time it will happen quickly way 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.610
 of an objective it's time so was 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:10.770
 for sure it's going to be very, very complicated 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.449
 to rely on it but here we go 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.669
 is competitors and then in the 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:16.650
 week we're going to do everything to get 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.750
 plunge back on Saturday's match and this 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.319
 Saturday the Vendée Luçon Football is 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.319
 move to the east
