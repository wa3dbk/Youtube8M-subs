00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.699

over<00:02:26.790> 80<00:02:27.030> but<00:02:27.360> i<00:02:27.420> think<00:02:28.050> his<00:02:28.530> piece<00:02:28.860> is<00:02:29.100> random

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
over 80 but i think his piece is random

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.620 
over 80 but i think his piece is random
at<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.300> right<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:32.000> number<00:02:33.000> which<00:02:33.180> would<00:02:33.480> be

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
at the right a number which would be

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.800 
at the right a number which would be
given<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.050> him<00:02:34.170> he's<00:02:34.980> shooting<00:02:35.430> 79<00:02:36.180> maybe

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
given to him he's shooting 79 maybe

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.410 
given to him he's shooting 79 maybe
maybe<00:02:37.440> less<00:02:37.800> I<00:02:38.070> think<00:02:38.460> his<00:02:38.730> shooting<00:02:39.060> cause<00:02:39.240> he

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
maybe less I think his shooting cause he

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.620 
maybe less I think his shooting cause he
has<00:02:39.690> missed<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:40.200> many<00:02:40.500> chances<00:02:40.920> last<00:02:41.250> year

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
has missed so many chances last year

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.480 
has missed so many chances last year
one-on-ones<00:02:42.800> shooting<00:02:43.800> accuracy<00:02:44.040> is<00:02:44.310> not

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
one-on-ones shooting accuracy is not

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.080 
one-on-ones shooting accuracy is not
that<00:02:44.640> good<00:02:44.910> past<00:02:45.630> things<00:02:45.960> not<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.440> good

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
that good past things not that good

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.820 
that good past things not that good
defending<00:02:48.090> although<00:02:48.450> he<00:02:48.690> doesn't<00:02:48.870> defend<00:02:49.650> a

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.440 
defending although he doesn't defend a
lot<00:02:49.980> but<00:02:50.160> he<00:02:50.250> comes<00:02:50.490> back<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.790> gets<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.300> ball

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
lot but he comes back and gets the ball

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.560 
lot but he comes back and gets the ball
a<00:02:51.480> lot<00:02:51.720> so<00:02:52.430> that's<00:02:53.430> why<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.700> pose<00:02:54.000> defending

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
a lot so that's why I pose defending

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.930 
a lot so that's why I pose defending
them<00:02:54.720> but<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:54.960> think<00:02:55.350> he<00:02:55.530> should<00:02:55.710> be<00:02:55.830> an<00:02:55.920> auto<00:02:56.160> 79

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
them but I think he should be an auto 79

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.680 
them but I think he should be an auto 79
with<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.270> right-wing<00:02:57.750> card<00:02:58.050> in<00:02:58.290> fifa15<00:02:59.690> moving

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
on to our next player I think who had
