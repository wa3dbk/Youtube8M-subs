imaginary number we're asked to simplify

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.890 
imaginary number we're asked to simplify
radical<00:00:13.110> -<00:00:13.559> eight<00:00:14.089> imaginary<00:00:15.089> numbers<00:00:15.540> one<00:00:15.870> of

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
radical - eight imaginary numbers one of

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.529 
radical - eight imaginary numbers one of
those<00:00:16.289> weird<00:00:16.859> odd<00:00:17.160> thing<00:00:17.670> at<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.000> beginning

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
those weird odd thing at the beginning

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.689 
those weird odd thing at the beginning
first<00:00:19.170> look<00:00:19.439> at<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.859> go<00:00:20.039> huh

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
first look at a you go huh

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.670 
first look at a you go huh
why<00:00:20.970> would<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.270> want<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.539> do<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.900> okay

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
why would you want to do that okay

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.429 
why would you want to do that okay
someone<00:00:23.189> made<00:00:23.369> up<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.760> rule<00:00:24.060> set<00:00:24.439> square

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
someone made up this rule set square

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.689 
someone made up this rule set square
root<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.890> -1<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:27.000> equal<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:28.039> which<00:00:29.039> means<00:00:29.369> if

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
root of -1 is equal to I which means if

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.600 
root of -1 is equal to I which means if
you<00:00:30.029> square<00:00:30.390> both<00:00:30.449> sides<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:31.349> squared<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.550> equal

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
you square both sides I squared is equal

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.610 
you square both sides I squared is equal
to<00:00:33.380> -1

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
to -1

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.760 
to -1
how<00:00:35.010> odd<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.930> gets<00:00:37.200> even<00:00:37.590> more

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
how odd is that it gets even more

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.670 
how odd is that it gets even more
interesting<00:00:38.520> from<00:00:38.940> there<00:00:39.180> imagine<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.379> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
interesting from there imagine I to the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.560 
interesting from there imagine I to the
fourth<00:00:41.010> what<00:00:41.550> would<00:00:41.700> have<00:00:41.790> happened<00:00:42.180> well

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
fourth what would have happened well

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.910 
fourth what would have happened well
that's<00:00:43.290> equal<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.480> squared<00:00:45.680> squared<00:00:46.680> again

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
that's equal to I squared squared again

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.740 
that's equal to I squared squared again
that's<00:00:47.520> how<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.820> gets<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.210> fourth<00:00:48.480> power

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
that's how it gets the fourth power

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.790 
that's how it gets the fourth power
right<00:00:49.460> this<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.640> minus<00:00:51.120> 1<00:00:51.420> squared<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.710> then

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
right this is minus 1 squared and then

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.729 
right this is minus 1 squared and then
becomes<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.460> positive<00:00:54.360> 1<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.260> here<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.559> this

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
becomes a positive 1 so here is this

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.160 
becomes a positive 1 so here is this
weird<00:00:56.190> thing<00:00:56.550> we<00:00:56.820> call<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.180> margarine<00:00:57.750> number

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
weird thing we call you margarine number

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.660 
weird thing we call you margarine number
I<00:00:58.410> if<00:00:59.280> I<00:01:00.030> squared<00:01:00.899> equal<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.440> minus<00:01:01.800> 1<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
I if I squared equal to minus 1 I to the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.310 
I if I squared equal to minus 1 I to the
fourth<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.300> them<00:01:03.449> becomes<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.519> positive<00:01:05.519> 1

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
fourth of them becomes a positive 1

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.750 
fourth of them becomes a positive 1
we're<00:01:07.320> going<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.560> have<00:01:07.770> more<00:01:08.130> fun<00:01:08.400> with<00:01:08.430> this

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
we're going to have more fun with this

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.340 
we're going to have more fun with this
later<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.090> but<00:01:09.240> let's<00:01:09.570> take<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.840> look<00:01:10.049> at<00:01:10.170> what

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
later on but let's take a look at what

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.950 
later on but let's take a look at what
we<00:01:10.470> do<00:01:10.710> 4<00:01:11.010> minus<00:01:11.850> 8<00:01:12.090> well<00:01:12.450> we're<00:01:12.570> going<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.720> use

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
we do 4 minus 8 well we're going to use

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.020 
we do 4 minus 8 well we're going to use
that<00:01:13.110> definition<00:01:13.680> first<00:01:14.460> thing<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.790> always

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
that definition first thing I always

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.960 
that definition first thing I always
tell<00:01:15.330> students<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:16.189> split<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.310> up<00:01:17.400> into

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
tell students it split it up into

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.520 
tell students it split it up into
something<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.659> know<00:01:18.810> how<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.140> do<00:01:19.350> on

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
something you know how to do on

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.160 
something you know how to do on
something<00:01:19.860> that's<00:01:20.280> new<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.570> part<00:01:21.930> obviously

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
something that's new this part obviously

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.039 
something that's new this part obviously
is<00:01:22.680> new<00:01:23.040> thing<00:01:23.280> by<00:01:23.939> definition<00:01:24.330> which<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.810> been

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
is new thing by definition which is been

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.940 
is new thing by definition which is been
called<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.590> radical<00:01:26.430> root<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.299> 8<00:01:27.770> hopefully<00:01:28.770> by

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
called I radical root of 8 hopefully by

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.539 
called I radical root of 8 hopefully by
now<00:01:29.189> it's<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.610> old<00:01:30.270> thing<00:01:31.079> for<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.430> then

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
now it's a old thing for you and then

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.840 
now it's a old thing for you and then
you<00:01:32.640> have<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:33.060> over<00:01:33.390> here<00:01:33.689> radical<00:01:34.590> too<00:01:34.850> radical

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
you have I over here radical too radical

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.670 
you have I over here radical too radical
for<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:37.400> always<00:01:38.400> think<00:01:39.680> radical

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
for I always think radical

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.889 
for I always think radical
simplification<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.820> kind<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.210> looking<00:01:42.630> for

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
simplification is kind of looking for

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.370 
simplification is kind of looking for
gold<00:01:43.619> nugget<00:01:44.720> you're<00:01:45.720> looking<00:01:46.079> for<00:01:46.290> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
gold nugget you're looking for the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.490 
gold nugget you're looking for the
perfect<00:01:46.680> square<00:01:47.310> perfect<00:01:48.180> square<00:01:48.479> other<00:01:48.689> gold

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
perfect square perfect square other gold

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.760 
perfect square perfect square other gold
nuggets<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.850> if<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.180> have<00:01:51.479> given<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> radical

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
nuggets so if I have given you a radical

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.639 
nuggets so if I have given you a radical
minus<00:01:53.460> 32<00:01:54.060> you're<00:01:54.600> going<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.840> do<00:01:54.960> exactly<00:01:55.259> the

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
minus 32 you're going to do exactly the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.800 
minus 32 you're going to do exactly the
same<00:01:55.680> thing<00:01:56.130> take<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.880> minus<00:01:57.240> out<00:01:57.420> are

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
same thing take the minus out are

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.819 
same thing take the minus out are
leaving<00:01:58.619> Arizona<00:01:59.149> so<00:02:00.149> think<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.960> minus

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
leaving Arizona so think of the minus

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.410 
leaving Arizona so think of the minus
sign<00:02:01.860> as<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.420> cactus<00:02:03.420> needle<00:02:04.250> thorny<00:02:05.250> and

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
sign as a cactus needle thorny and

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.330 
sign as a cactus needle thorny and
unpleasant<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:06.719> taking<00:02:07.200> them<00:02:07.259> out<00:02:07.469> first<00:02:07.860> and

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
unpleasant so taking them out first and

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.699 
unpleasant so taking them out first and
now<00:02:08.640> over<00:02:08.789> here<00:02:09.209> if<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:10.110> don't<00:02:10.319> see<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
now over here if you don't see the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.470 
now over here if you don't see the
perfect<00:02:10.950> square<00:02:11.489> over<00:02:11.670> there<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.270> then<00:02:12.450> you

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
perfect square over there and then you

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.640 
perfect square over there and then you
can<00:02:12.720> start<00:02:13.110> with

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
can start with

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.119 
can start with
four<00:02:13.769> times<00:02:14.040> eight<00:02:14.549> but<00:02:14.939> better<00:02:15.180> yet<00:02:16.129> two

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
four times eight but better yet two

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.220 
four times eight but better yet two
times<00:02:17.459> 16<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.540> much<00:02:19.470> better<00:02:20.129> choice<00:02:21.230> faster

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
times 16 is a much better choice faster

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.380 
times 16 is a much better choice faster
too<00:02:22.470> because<00:02:23.360> 16<00:02:24.360> is<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.980> gold<00:02:25.980> nugget<00:02:26.549> we<00:02:27.180> like

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
too because 16 is a gold nugget we like

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.530 
too because 16 is a gold nugget we like
gold<00:02:27.750> nugget<00:02:28.159> and<00:02:29.159> this<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.519> a<00:02:29.549> four<00:02:29.939> so<00:02:30.510> now

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
gold nugget and this is a four so now

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.460 
gold nugget and this is a four so now
there<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:30.959> a<00:02:31.049> for<00:02:31.379> radical<00:02:31.859> two<00:02:32.099> times<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:33.260> okay

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
there is a for radical two times I okay

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.059 
there is a for radical two times I okay
now<00:02:34.920> one<00:02:35.250> more<00:02:35.430> tip<00:02:36.299> on<00:02:36.569> this<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:37.049> let's<00:02:37.709> see<00:02:37.920> how

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
now one more tip on this I let's see how

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.470 
now one more tip on this I let's see how
stranger<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:38.879> gets

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
stranger it gets

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.530 
stranger it gets
I<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.439> sixth<00:02:40.829> power<00:02:41.069> what<00:02:42.000> do<00:02:42.090> we<00:02:42.180> do<00:02:42.359> for

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
I to the sixth power what do we do for

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.949 
I to the sixth power what do we do for
that

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
that

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.599 
that
well<00:02:44.659> one<00:02:45.659> thing<00:02:45.959> if<00:02:46.139> on<00:02:46.379> the<00:02:46.680> test<00:02:46.980> you

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
well one thing if on the test you

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.680 
well one thing if on the test you
completely<00:02:48.510> blank<00:02:48.930> out<00:02:49.879> have<00:02:50.879> no<00:02:51.090> idea<00:02:51.480> what

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
completely blank out have no idea what

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.599 
completely blank out have no idea what
to<00:02:51.780> do<00:02:51.959> let's<00:02:52.319> just<00:02:52.500> write<00:02:52.769> it<00:02:52.799> out<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:53.400> there's

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
to do let's just write it out so there's

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.009 
to do let's just write it out so there's
three<00:02:53.879> here<00:02:54.150> there's<00:02:54.450> three<00:02:54.659> here<00:02:54.840> all

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
three here there's three here all

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.160 
three here there's three here all
together<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.500> have<00:02:55.680> six<00:02:56.579> every<00:02:57.480> two<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.840> them<00:02:58.079> I

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
together I have six every two of them I

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.589 
together I have six every two of them I
have<00:02:58.379> a<00:02:58.409> minus<00:02:58.829> one<00:02:59.129> so<00:02:59.970> I'm<00:03:00.120> just<00:03:00.180> going<00:03:00.569> to

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
have a minus one so I'm just going to

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.500 
have a minus one so I'm just going to
literally<00:03:00.989> go<00:03:01.739> in<00:03:01.950> there<00:03:02.189> and<00:03:03.090> put<00:03:03.329> them

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
literally go in there and put them

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.050 
literally go in there and put them
together<00:03:03.689> what<00:03:04.260> do<00:03:04.319> I<00:03:04.409> have<00:03:04.620> minus<00:03:05.459> 1<00:03:05.760> times

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
together what do I have minus 1 times

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.050 
together what do I have minus 1 times
minus<00:03:06.329> 1<00:03:06.540> is<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:06.870> positive<00:03:07.139> 1<00:03:07.680> times<00:03:07.950> minus<00:03:08.639> 1

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
minus 1 is a positive 1 times minus 1

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.710 
minus 1 is a positive 1 times minus 1
and<00:03:09.569> guess<00:03:09.780> what<00:03:10.019> I<00:03:10.170> have<00:03:10.319> a<00:03:10.349> minus<00:03:10.769> 1<00:03:10.980> again<00:03:11.720> so

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
and guess what I have a minus 1 again so

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.830 
and guess what I have a minus 1 again so
this<00:03:12.930> I<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:14.099> nth<00:03:14.370> power<00:03:14.579> changes<00:03:15.569> back

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
this I to the nth power changes back

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.150 
this I to the nth power changes back
between<00:03:16.609> plus<00:03:17.609> 1<00:03:17.910> minus<00:03:18.359> 1<00:03:18.599> plus<00:03:18.629> 1<00:03:19.230> minus<00:03:19.260> 1<00:03:19.919> if

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
between plus 1 minus 1 plus 1 minus 1 if

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.970 
between plus 1 minus 1 plus 1 minus 1 if
you<00:03:20.609> get<00:03:20.819> a<00:03:20.849> really<00:03:21.329> weird<00:03:21.810> one<00:03:22.169> that's<00:03:22.650> our

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
you get a really weird one that's our

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.949 
you get a really weird one that's our
power<00:03:23.310> all<00:03:24.239> right<00:03:24.510> I'm<00:03:24.750> sorry<00:03:25.079> times<00:03:25.530> I<00:03:26.959> this

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
power all right I'm sorry times I this

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.939 
power all right I'm sorry times I this
is<00:03:28.169> minus<00:03:28.620> 1<00:03:28.889> times<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.639> and<00:03:30.389> guess<00:03:30.599> what<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:31.109> to

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:31.949 
is minus 1 times I and guess what I to

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:35.319 
is minus 1 times I and guess what I to
the<00:03:32.310> third<00:03:32.340> is<00:03:32.819> equal<00:03:32.879> to<00:03:33.540> minus<00:03:33.959> I<00:03:34.109> all<00:03:34.859> right

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
the third is equal to minus I all right

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.229 
the third is equal to minus I all right
that's<00:03:36.329> enough<00:03:36.510> of<00:03:36.870> that<00:03:36.980> weird<00:03:38.239> imaginary

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
that's enough of that weird imaginary

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:39.740 
that's enough of that weird imaginary
number

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
number

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.050 
number
all<00:03:40.230> right<00:03:40.440> this<00:03:41.250> is<00:03:41.430> how<00:03:41.609> we<00:03:41.669> handle

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
all right this is how we handle

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.460 
all right this is how we handle
imaginary<00:03:42.930> number

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
imaginary number
