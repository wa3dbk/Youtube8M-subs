what's<00:00:29.970> your<00:00:30.179> experiment<00:00:30.689> about<00:00:30.840> dry<00:00:31.740> ice

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
what's your experiment about dry ice

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.850 
what's your experiment about dry ice
okay<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.989> what<00:00:34.260> are<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.440> going<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.649> do

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
okay and and what are you going to do

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.220 
okay and and what are you going to do
with<00:00:35.460> dry<00:00:35.790> eyes<00:00:35.969> gonna<00:00:36.329> see<00:00:36.510> how<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.870> makes<00:00:37.050> an

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
with dry eyes gonna see how it makes an

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.880 
with dry eyes gonna see how it makes an
explosion<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.660> in<00:00:39.660> why<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.410> makes<00:00:40.710> the

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
explosion and in why it makes the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.770 
explosion and in why it makes the
explosion<00:00:41.430> with<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.700> chemical<00:00:42.090> reaction<00:00:42.600> is

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
explosion with the chemical reaction is

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.350 
explosion with the chemical reaction is
ok<00:00:43.770> let's<00:00:44.190> see<00:00:44.370> what<00:00:44.579> happens<00:00:44.940> when<00:00:45.059> we<00:00:45.180> put

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
ok let's see what happens when we put

00:00:45.360 --> 00:01:05.240 
ok let's see what happens when we put
rice<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:46.050> water<00:01:03.439> ok<00:01:04.439> guys<00:01:04.619> what<00:01:04.860> do<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.010> think

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
rice and water ok guys what do you think

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.280 
rice and water ok guys what do you think
would<00:01:05.430> happen<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.060> put<00:01:06.090> soap<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
would happen if we put soap in in the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.750 
would happen if we put soap in in the
water<00:01:10.130> what<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.220> think<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:11.610> gonna

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
water what do you think it's gonna

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.940 
water what do you think it's gonna
happen<00:01:11.970> it's<00:01:12.299> gonna<00:01:12.450> overflow<00:01:12.930> with<00:01:13.680> less

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
happen it's gonna overflow with less

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.130 
happen it's gonna overflow with less
unusual<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.420> really<00:01:15.659> cool<00:01:15.780> who's<00:01:15.930> when<00:01:16.049> you

unusual it's really cool who's when you

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.210 
unusual it's really cool who's when you
pop<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.439> bubbles<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.950> UM<00:01:17.070> carbon<00:01:17.759> dioxide<00:01:18.390> is

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
pop the bubbles the UM carbon dioxide is

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.260 
pop the bubbles the UM carbon dioxide is
good<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.430> likes<00:01:20.840> let's<00:01:21.840> do<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:23.150> we're<00:01:24.150> gonna

we're<00:02:10.520> gonna<00:02:10.640> take<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.450> see<00:02:11.750> if<00:02:12.050> dry<00:02:12.709> ice<00:02:12.860> has

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
we're gonna take and see if dry ice has

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.520 
we're gonna take and see if dry ice has
a<00:02:13.190> different<00:02:13.670> effect<00:02:13.760> in<00:02:14.150> hot<00:02:14.390> water<00:02:14.630> okay<00:02:15.320> how

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
a different effect in hot water okay how

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.970 
a different effect in hot water okay how
order<00:02:16.989> we're<00:02:17.989> going<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.140> do<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.440> outside<00:02:18.650> in

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
order we're going to do it outside in

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.580 
order we're going to do it outside in
case<00:02:19.459> we<00:02:19.850> have<00:02:19.880> any<00:02:20.030> chemical<00:02:20.780> reactions<00:02:21.290> like

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
case we have any chemical reactions like

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:37.360 
case we have any chemical reactions like
the<00:02:21.800> last<00:02:22.040> one<00:02:23.230> yeah<00:02:34.810> you<00:02:35.810> got<00:02:36.130> and<00:02:37.130> we're

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
the last one yeah you got and we're

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.880 
the last one yeah you got and we're
gonna<00:02:37.459> see<00:02:37.580> if<00:02:37.850> it<00:02:38.030> falls<00:02:38.570> down<00:02:38.780> now<00:02:39.500> why<00:02:39.830> do

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
gonna see if it falls down now why do

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.590 
gonna see if it falls down now why do
you<00:02:40.040> guys<00:02:40.280> think<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.989> steam<00:02:41.989> goes<00:02:42.260> down<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:44.390> is

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
you guys think the steam goes down it is

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.789 
you guys think the steam goes down it is
cooler<00:02:45.280> they<00:02:46.280> bear<00:02:46.549> draw<00:02:47.200> all<00:02:48.200> right<00:02:48.320> so<00:02:48.530> cold

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
cooler they bear draw all right so cold

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.340 
cooler they bear draw all right so cold
air<00:02:48.980> drops<00:02:49.370> warm<00:02:49.850> air<00:02:50.030> rises<00:02:50.570> dancer<00:02:51.080> and
