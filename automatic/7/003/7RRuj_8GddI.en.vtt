00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.219
 hello to all and david strand 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.690
 case of blogs to learn painting 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:06.730
 so today we will see how 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.589
 create a fund for this array of 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.450
 candles so I decided to make a 

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:11.769
 very background are compared to the model and 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.749
 to bring out the glow so we 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.449
 start right away by spreading this 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:17.769
 layer of brown with already direct and 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.800
 so we're going to do all our mixes on 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:22.869
 the canvas in general so here we are 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.689
 she all that and look we're even going 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.640
 put the yellow a little red 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.990
 still yellow of the white that we are going 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.089
 mix to norms already have present 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.910
 Here and therefore also the difficulty that 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:37.149
 going to be melting are done by the light of 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.770
 candles that we have already created so 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.270
 here we go forward they are there so 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.539
 the goal actually it's going to be from 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.340
 already cover the entire surface with 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:49.180
 all its nuances and then from 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.350
 work little by little on what to do so 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.149
 also what is important is to 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.219
 never make this a plain background is 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.300
 it's something that's finally I 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.550
 find it pretty bland 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.449
 finally so it's really these 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.460
 small nuances in the background it gives 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.590
 all its depth and precisely one can 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.750
 have fun recreating this mystery trying to 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.280
 put meanings 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.330
 it is a light that we imagine have 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.520
 finally it's not necessary to be 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.340
 rational so here we are almost 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.860
 finished filling all do it again 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.049
 some small work 20 so that's it 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.670
 already for a first base rd I 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.860
 continues to work there in the fund 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.720
 directly from the time of the young here we are 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.600
 done well that's what's tricky this 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.720
 the outlines of the candles so I 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.189
 used a big brush for brush 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.350
 thick enough to do the bottom and for 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.090
 all that is con tour we will really 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.479
 use a brush 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.950
 very fine end and lapointe like you 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.659
 see there to make the outline of 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.829
 the candle we will try not to exceed 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.189
 but at worst if we go beyond we can 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:51.990
 still take the candle here is 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:54.700
 so now it's going to be a work of 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.090
 here are details on his side so that's it 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.369
 to better outline 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.560
 I even move the meaning of my canvas 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.530
 here we do not hesitate we do not have any 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.030
 precise meaning we did according to what 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.209
 arrange us here I return them even 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.849
 in reverse also the difficulty is to 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.010
 be careful not to dip your hand 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.870
 we're going to say in the background it happens to me 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.640
 once in a while but nothing serious 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.980
 obviously we can we to take that 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.829
 so there again look down the 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.450
 video I add the plan of the young man that I 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:29.549
 funds directly we really do all 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.739
 our blends on the canvas and we go to 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.180
 with the already present here I am 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.459
 do not hesitate to put quantity and we 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.780
 sweet mixture mixture of the sacred 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.810
 really these little effects a little bit of 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.489
 mystery it really does not take that the 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.670
 canvas is totally brown I loved me 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:48.760
 tends another a little blue for for 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.590
 give a different sound there is 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.109
 almost no blacks I avoid meters 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.639
 of the edge in general will continue with 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:56.889
 some white yellow one will the 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.540
 watch this fund not seen very 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:00.760
 well the camera but seen as one can 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.079
 see where continent to work 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.609
 so here it's going to be really a 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.630
 little work here is a little the same table 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:09.609
 to people to have a small 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:11.380
 idea of the time to put all this with 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.930
 that's it and we're done 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.109
 so I'm telling you very soon for a 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.819
 new video ended light here 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.989
 and do not hesitate to leave a small 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.329
 comment under the video to give 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.709
 your opinion your questions and pass a 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.709
 good day goodbye
