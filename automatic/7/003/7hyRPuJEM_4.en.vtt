00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
could be traded again it's not the fact

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.809 
could be traded again it's not the fact
that<00:03:30.319> I'm<00:03:30.590> gonna<00:03:30.769> be<00:03:30.980> happy<00:03:31.190> another<00:03:31.519> team

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
it's not the fact you know just again I

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.390 
it's not the fact you know just again I
can't<00:03:35.810> guarantee<00:03:36.019> that<00:03:36.319> nobody<00:03:37.190> can

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
can't guarantee that nobody can

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.789 
can't guarantee that nobody can
guarantee<00:03:37.549> that<00:03:37.870> you<00:03:38.870> know<00:03:38.959> it's<00:03:39.200> just<00:03:39.349> the

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
guarantee that you know it's just the

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:40.599 
guarantee that you know it's just the
way<00:03:39.829> I<00:03:39.980> feel

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
way I feel

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.599 
way I feel
last<00:03:41.090> season<00:03:41.450> I<00:03:41.569> don't<00:03:41.750> want<00:03:41.900> to<00:03:41.989> continue

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
last season I don't want to continue

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.530 
last season I don't want to continue
that's<00:03:43.609> the<00:03:43.730> main<00:03:43.910> point

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
that's the main point

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.589 
that's the main point
so<00:03:46.370> this<00:03:47.370> is<00:03:47.489> my<00:03:47.610> last<00:03:47.760> thought<00:03:48.090> what<00:03:48.360> is<00:03:48.450> the

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
so this is my last thought what is the

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.149 
so this is my last thought what is the
solution<00:03:48.780> if<00:03:49.140> he's<00:03:49.260> not<00:03:49.409> gonna<00:03:49.590> change<00:03:49.890> and

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
solution if he's not gonna change and

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:51.289 
solution if he's not gonna change and
