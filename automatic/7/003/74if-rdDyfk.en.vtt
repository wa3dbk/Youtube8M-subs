00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
to want to find the area where the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.620 
to want to find the area where the
mosquito<00:00:28.800> larvae<00:00:29.310> are<00:00:29.490> they're<00:00:30.090> usually

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
mosquito larvae are they're usually

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.200 
mosquito larvae are they're usually
located<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.619> big<00:00:31.859> bales<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.550> water<00:00:32.850> where

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
located in a big bales of water where

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.540 
located in a big bales of water where
there's<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.510> lot<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.899> direct<00:00:34.230> sunlight<00:00:34.530> as<00:00:34.980> you

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
there's a lot of direct sunlight as you

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.549 
there's a lot of direct sunlight as you
can<00:00:35.730> see<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.149> water<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.630> really<00:00:37.020> green<00:00:37.290> and

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
can see the water is really green and

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.380 
can see the water is really green and
that<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.829> because<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.370> direct<00:00:38.730> sunlight<00:00:39.030> is

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
that is because the direct sunlight is

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.299 
that is because the direct sunlight is
pointing<00:00:39.870> directly<00:00:40.020> at<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.680> little<00:00:41.010> pond

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
pointing directly at this little pond

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.459 
pointing directly at this little pond
type<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.820> thing<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.090> we<00:00:42.270> have<00:00:42.600> which<00:00:43.140> makes

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
type of thing that we have which makes

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.830 
type of thing that we have which makes
it<00:00:43.680> form<00:00:43.950> algae<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.850> mosquito<00:00:45.390> will<00:00:45.600> usually

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
it form algae the mosquito will usually

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.260 
it form algae the mosquito will usually
lay<00:00:46.320> her<00:00:46.500> eggs<00:00:46.739> either<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.700> spring<00:00:48.090> or

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
lay her eggs either in the spring or

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.709 
lay her eggs either in the spring or
summer<00:00:48.800> containing<00:00:49.800> about<00:00:50.100> 100<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.850> 300<00:00:51.510> eggs

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
summer containing about 100 to 300 eggs

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.319 
summer containing about 100 to 300 eggs
per<00:00:52.079> batch<00:00:52.309> so<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.489> two<00:00:53.670> things<00:00:53.969> are<00:00:54.149> going<00:00:54.270> to

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
per batch so the two things are going to

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.420 
per batch so the two things are going to
need<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.690> gather<00:00:54.870> up<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.199> larva<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> net<00:00:56.219> I

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
need to gather up the larva is a net I

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.189 
need to gather up the larva is a net I
recommend<00:00:56.940> using<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.300> net<00:00:57.480> with<00:00:57.629> really<00:00:57.930> small

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
recommend using a net with really small

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.110 
recommend using a net with really small
holes<00:00:58.500> because<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> larvae<00:00:59.370> can<00:00:59.399> escape<00:00:59.879> and

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
holes because the larvae can escape and

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.910 
holes because the larvae can escape and
you're<00:01:00.539> also<00:01:00.660> going<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.050> need<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.500> container

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
you're also going to need a container

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.380 
you're also going to need a container
the<00:01:04.920> first<00:01:05.220> thing<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.489> want<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.790> do<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.180> gather

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
the first thing you want to do is gather

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.300 
the first thing you want to do is gather

aquarium this can be cold water or warm

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.370 
aquarium this can be cold water or warm
water<00:01:11.340> as<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.299> see<00:01:12.600> my<00:01:12.780> fish<00:01:13.049> keep<00:01:13.260> on

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
water as you can see my fish keep on

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
and just to clarify there's no set

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
and just to clarify there's no set
amount<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.159> water<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.700> used

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.310

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.929 
so now to collect the larvae all you're
going<00:01:27.439> to<00:01:27.500> do<00:01:27.680> is<00:01:27.799> easily<00:01:28.219> just<00:01:28.430> scoop<00:01:28.670> it<00:01:28.820> up

going to do is easily just scoop it up
with<00:01:28.969> the<00:01:29.240> net<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.659> sign<00:01:30.619> of<00:01:30.799> healthy<00:01:31.280> larvae<00:01:31.789> is

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
with the net a sign of healthy larvae is

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:33.940 
with the net a sign of healthy larvae is
larvae<00:01:32.509> that<00:01:32.539> squiggles<00:01:33.200> everywhere

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.660 
conditioner will condition any excess
water<00:02:21.140> that<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.620> larvae<00:02:22.010> may<00:02:22.190> have<00:02:22.400> brought

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
water that the larvae may have brought

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.410 
water that the larvae may have brought
in<00:02:22.910> I<00:02:23.120> would<00:02:23.660> add<00:02:23.780> a<00:02:23.810> small<00:02:24.200> squirt<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.970> animal

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
in I would add a small squirt the animal

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.020 
in I would add a small squirt the animal
lock<00:02:26.600> isn't<00:02:27.050> 100%<00:02:27.560> necessary<00:02:28.520> but<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:28.910> is

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
lock isn't 100% necessary but it is

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.970 
lock isn't 100% necessary but it is
great<00:02:29.300> for<00:02:29.480> preventing<00:02:30.020> ammonia<00:02:30.500> from

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
great for preventing ammonia from

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.610 
great for preventing ammonia from
becoming<00:02:31.430> toxic<00:02:31.819> in<00:02:32.300> your<00:02:32.540> tank<00:02:32.780> I<00:02:33.050> would<00:02:33.500> add

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
becoming toxic in your tank I would add

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.310 
becoming toxic in your tank I would add
a<00:02:33.650> drop<00:02:33.980> of<00:02:34.010> this<00:02:34.400> last<00:02:35.360> but<00:02:35.840> certainly<00:02:35.870> not

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
a drop of this last but certainly not

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.860 
a drop of this last but certainly not
least<00:02:36.530> is<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.040> salt<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.970> salt<00:02:38.239> will<00:02:38.450> burn<00:02:38.660> off

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
least is the salt the salt will burn off

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.110 
least is the salt the salt will burn off
any<00:02:39.140> pesticides<00:02:39.950> in<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.250> larvae<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:41.000> will

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
any pesticides in the larvae it will

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.240 
any pesticides in the larvae it will
also<00:02:41.510> add<00:02:41.720> electrolytes<00:02:42.470> to<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:42.830> larvae

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
also add electrolytes to the larvae

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.670 
also add electrolytes to the larvae
making<00:02:43.610> it<00:02:43.700> even<00:02:43.910> more<00:02:44.090> nutritious<00:02:44.420> I<00:02:45.080> would

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
making it even more nutritious I would

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.009 
making it even more nutritious I would
add<00:02:45.860> a<00:02:46.150> 1/2<00:02:47.150> teaspoon<00:02:49.000> so<00:02:50.000> after<00:02:50.420> you<00:02:50.510> add<00:02:50.720> all

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
add a 1/2 teaspoon so after you add all

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.720 
add a 1/2 teaspoon so after you add all
those<00:02:51.260> supplements<00:02:51.590> you're<00:02:52.220> going<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.550> want

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
those supplements you're going to want

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.430 
those supplements you're going to want
to<00:02:52.820> wait<00:02:53.030> for<00:02:53.300> them<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.450> absorb<00:02:53.840> into<00:02:54.200> the

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
to wait for them to absorb into the

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.800 
to wait for them to absorb into the
larvae<00:02:54.860> it<00:02:55.100> takes<00:02:55.670> about<00:02:55.850> an<00:02:56.060> hour<00:02:56.150> or<00:02:56.570> so<00:02:56.780> just

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
larvae it takes about an hour or so just

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.240 
larvae it takes about an hour or so just
for<00:02:59.810> a<00:02:59.870> little<00:03:00.170> glance<00:03:00.440> there<00:03:00.800> will<00:03:00.920> be<00:03:00.950> all

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
for a little glance there will be all

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.970 
for a little glance there will be all
different<00:03:01.700> types<00:03:02.000> of<00:03:02.380> larvae<00:03:03.380> there<00:03:03.800> will<00:03:03.950> be

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
different types of larvae there will be

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.699 
different types of larvae there will be
a<00:03:04.160> big<00:03:04.610> larvae<00:03:05.150> small<00:03:05.630> larvae<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:06.350> then<00:03:06.530> this

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
a big larvae small larvae and then this

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.650 
a big larvae small larvae and then this
other<00:03:06.950> thing<00:03:07.310> I'm<00:03:07.459> not<00:03:07.610> really<00:03:07.670> exactly<00:03:08.450> sure

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
other thing I'm not really exactly sure

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.229 
other thing I'm not really exactly sure
if<00:03:08.690> it's<00:03:09.049> larva<00:03:09.530> or<00:03:09.680> not<00:03:09.829> but<00:03:10.459> it<00:03:10.640> seems<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:11.090> me

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
if it's larva or not but it seems to me

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.390 
if it's larva or not but it seems to me
that<00:03:11.269> most<00:03:11.630> of<00:03:11.840> my<00:03:11.930> fish<00:03:12.140> will<00:03:12.410> not<00:03:12.440> eat<00:03:12.890> it<00:03:15.400> so

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
that most of my fish will not eat it so

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.130 
that most of my fish will not eat it so
now<00:03:16.610> we<00:03:16.640> are<00:03:16.850> going<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.150> start<00:03:17.510> feeding<00:03:17.810> this

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
now we are going to start feeding this

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.130 
now we are going to start feeding this
to<00:03:18.380> my<00:03:18.530> fish<00:03:18.860> so<00:03:19.700> what<00:03:20.120> I<00:03:20.150> use<00:03:20.420> to<00:03:20.630> feed<00:03:20.900> it<00:03:21.019> to

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
to my fish so what I use to feed it to

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.080 
to my fish so what I use to feed it to
my<00:03:21.290> fish<00:03:21.530> is<00:03:21.739> a<00:03:21.769> marina<00:03:22.400> a<00:03:22.489> bit<00:03:22.730> of<00:03:22.850> waste

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
my fish is a marina a bit of waste

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.509 
my fish is a marina a bit of waste
remover<00:03:23.630> these<00:03:24.140> are<00:03:24.320> so<00:03:24.560> easy<00:03:24.590> to<00:03:24.950> use<00:03:25.280> and

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
remover these are so easy to use and

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:26.920 
remover these are so easy to use and
they're<00:03:25.640> pretty<00:03:25.790> similar<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:26.329> a<00:03:26.510> turkey

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
they're pretty similar to a turkey

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.360 
they're pretty similar to a turkey

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:55.190 
baster so anyways I started to pick up
the<00:03:31.519> larvae<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:32.209> here<00:03:32.630> is<00:03:32.750> how<00:03:32.959> they<00:03:33.140> look

Guppies here and here is this a speed
video<00:04:02.680> of<00:04:02.980> them<00:04:03.250> eating<00:04:03.489> the<00:04:03.700> larvae<00:04:04.739> and

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
video of them eating the larvae and

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.449 
video of them eating the larvae and
Guppies<00:04:07.630> are<00:04:07.750> not<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.080> only<00:04:08.260> type<00:04:08.590> of<00:04:08.620> fish

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
Guppies are not the only type of fish

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.640 
Guppies are not the only type of fish
you<00:04:09.640> can<00:04:09.819> feed<00:04:10.060> larvae<00:04:10.510> to<00:04:10.540> you<00:04:10.870> can<00:04:11.050> also<00:04:11.260> feed

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
you can feed larvae to you can also feed

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.280 
you can feed larvae to you can also feed
them<00:04:11.680> to<00:04:12.040> beddows<00:04:12.569> angelfish<00:04:13.569> and<00:04:13.630> gouramis

you can see all the Guppies have
finished<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:32.080> larvae<00:04:32.740> except<00:04:33.070> for<00:04:33.250> that

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
finished the larvae except for that

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:40.760 
finished the larvae except for that
little<00:04:33.610> tiny<00:04:34.500> larvae<00:04:35.500> I<00:04:35.680> guess<00:04:35.950> it's<00:04:36.130> called
