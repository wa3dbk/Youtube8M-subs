00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 on rustica point fr you go 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.560
 learn to repot cacti in 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.560
 imagery 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.389
 the best time to win this 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.850
 made it the end of winter at the beginning of 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.580
 spring when the cacti are in 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.349
 vegetative rest not what is important 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.700
 for cacti it's always about having 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.960
 a well-drained soil 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.670
 so here we have a shape there is a 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.100
 system also to be able to listen to them 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.990
 it's using a mom's diary of 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.390
 do all this we go we 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.019
 worry about the container the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.940
 containing either you drill for good 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:45.630
 drained the substrate the potting soil for that 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:48.210
 I chose to use shards and this 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.850
 are pau questions in reality that 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.030
 we will place on the most 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.899
 rounded down so under 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.329
 the water can pass through it 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.530
 important it is an important gesture 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.700
 since cacti have to be 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.899
 well drained we can also associate 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.330
 some clay balls at the bottom for 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.130
 really make sure of a good drainage on 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.890
 can also put gravel 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.660
 or the pozzolan pozzolan that 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.970
 we will find in our soil 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.850
 special cactus since it takes 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:25.050
 must use a potting soil 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.539
 special cacti then the special potting 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.240
 techt and it's a breeding ground that's good 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.149
 drained and on the inside we're just going 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.479
 find this famous pizza add 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:38.789
 we are already putting a good layer on the bottom 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.940
 the particularity compared to another 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:44.220
 green plant a plant we will not go 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.789
 not the soil 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.580
 the trick to trick worry or a 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:53.670
 shape since it's very spicy of 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.739
 catch him with a diary of the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.450
 circled and we have more than 

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:02.700
 catch it then the priority now 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.149
 we will remove a little bit of 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.000
 potting soil one could use a paintbrush 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:11.009
 since we will renew the art you 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.150
 notice that unlike a 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.780
 green plant is that the soil is 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.250
 dry 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.769
 at the time of repotting and that's a lot 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.250
 easier to avoid hurting also 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.750
 roots 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.110
 we will install 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:26.340
 our form with the newspaper we go the 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.800
 position in our special soil 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.680
 cacti relates to a little bit of 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.690
 loam to the round without much crushed and gold 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.940
 here we will make an association since 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.630
 we will gather several acts 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.890
 and always hear with our newspaper 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.030
 to avoid being clicked 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.530
 so much simpler fingers why 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.380
 a little resistance so here there is a 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.570
 root that was passing right through 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.709
 of the bucket pot so that's a 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.870
 really sign that this plant needs 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.209
 to be potted so what is important 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.950
 that they play was eliminated very small 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.030
 little soil and we will associate it with 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.340
 the other nantes 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.350
 now it remains more than following your 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.600
 tastes your tastes and your colors change 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.540
 they all forms and associate 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.790
 several more cacti plants so 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:20.209
 we have some form cacti sooner 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.209
 erected into a priest we will use 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.760
 so we can see it's still a 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.400
 potting soil that really had very very 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.269
 very dry and especially with chippings 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.820
 background and in particular pozzolan it does not 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.730
 never have to bury them encrypt more 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.400
 deep in the earth there is a 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.820
 risk of rotting powder so we 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.500
 can also associated since brings it together 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.980
 some cacti can be put there too 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.400
 well pebbles give a little bit 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.280
 authors side a little bit mineral this 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.200
 which also allows to have plants 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.200
 a little bit nicer from the east the 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.030
 masters of better structures and a 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.280
 tip 1 when you get stung by 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.890
 decree is to use dough to 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.790
 model you apply it on your your 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.350
 EPIDe 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.320
 and you try to take it out like you 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:13.079
 can then to finish our our 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.989
 potting our assembly we go 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:19.169
 combine gravel from above then 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.120
 it's very pretty necessarily but there is 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.710
 also another reason is that it's okay 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.950
 allow at the time of watering 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.840
 to avoid teeth tamp the earth 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.810
 well, we'll wait a few days 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.970
 before watering if for example I would have 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.460
 damaged or damaged some qualities 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.330
 it must be dry before watering 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.690
 from now 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.160
 well we wish these cacti and 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.300
 well a beautiful lawn since from 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.680
 from now on they are going well 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.680
 develop through repotting
