00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Hello friends, I give you a friendly greeting. 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 My name is Vicente Gamboa, from Trujillo, Peru. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 I want to show that I have Tillandsias home. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Tillandsias are epiphytes, 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 living that is subject to the trunks of trees, 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 although some of them live on the sand. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 They use their roots to hold on to the trunk, 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 not absorb water but the roots absorb water through special scales that have in their leaves. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 They need the rain water and also absorb water from fog and dew. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 This is called tillandsia tillandsia ushenoides, 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 be subject to a branch by its roots and grows downward hanging. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Tillandsias need to receive sunlight for the process of photosynthesis, 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 must also receive adequate irrigation. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 To water Tillandsias can be used tap water with a little aqueous vermicompost. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 The vermicompost provides minerals needed by plants. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Humus can be purchased at any garden store. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 To make the solution of humus, 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 Put a small amount of humus, 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 we pull, ie break the hard parts; 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 then make a funnel with a paper 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 and thus 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 to place it in a bottle. 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 If the end of the funnel is very small cut. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 We need to cut more, 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 then add the humus 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 helping with a stick. 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 We take a little longer, 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 We help to make everything into the bottle. 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Then add tap water, drinking water. 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
 We plugged, 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 and shake to mix everything. 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 This mixture must let it rest for a week. 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 After a week, we can see that the humus has precipitated, 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 leaving an amber solution, 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 This is the solution we are looking for humus. 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 In another bottle, fill water spout, 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 then we take a little of the solution of humus, 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 we take a little, put the sprinkler 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 and mix. 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 Usually, we have to water the liquid tillandsias. 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 Tillandsias We water eleven a day, 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 Displayed dusk 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 to allow time for the plant to absorb the water before it evaporates. 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 We can see the green color of the leaves due to chlorophyll. 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 What color tillandsia see this? 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 It is a silvery color. 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 We now proceed to water it, 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 Dip their leaves, 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 we see that the green color of chlorophyll appears. 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 Having tillandsias at home is very nice, 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 is to have a piece of nature in our window 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
 Been to pleasure to speak to you, God bless you.
