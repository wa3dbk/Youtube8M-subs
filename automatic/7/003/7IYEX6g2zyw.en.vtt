00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
the screen at once okay now when I

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.889 
the screen at once okay now when I
change<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.750> slider<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.260> watch<00:00:46.379> what<00:00:46.530> happens

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
so now unfortunately this is exactly as

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.150 
so now unfortunately this is exactly as
I<00:01:37.610> said<00:01:37.720> when<00:01:38.720> you're<00:01:39.380> in<00:01:39.410> the<00:01:39.530> photo<00:01:39.770> you

I said when you're in the photo you

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.380 
I said when you're in the photo you
cannot<00:01:40.460> adjust<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.940> little<00:01:41.060> of<00:01:41.210> 3d<00:01:42.610> now<00:01:43.610> what

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
cannot adjust the little of 3d now what

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.610 
cannot adjust the little of 3d now what
other<00:01:44.720> people<00:01:44.960> are<00:01:45.020> saying<00:01:45.229> is<00:01:45.410> there<00:01:45.530> is<00:01:45.560> a

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
other people are saying is there is a

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.130 
other people are saying is there is a
slider<00:01:45.920> in<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.610> program<00:01:46.940> itself<00:01:47.240> you're

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
slider in the program itself you're

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.930 
slider in the program itself you're
right<00:01:49.869> there<00:01:50.869> we<00:01:50.930> go<00:01:51.140> but<00:01:52.130> this<00:01:52.250> isn't<00:01:52.430> exactly

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
right there we go but this isn't exactly

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.060 
right there we go but this isn't exactly
the<00:01:53.360> same<00:01:53.540> is<00:01:53.720> it

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
the same is it

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.240 
the same is it
it's<00:01:55.070> not<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.340> same<00:01:55.520> as<00:01:55.700> using<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.510> slider<00:01:56.810> so

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
it's not the same as using the slider so

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.969 
it's not the same as using the slider so
you've<00:01:58.250> got<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.430> two<00:01:58.460> images<00:01:59.590> the<00:02:00.590> sliders

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
you've got the two images the sliders

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:11.380 
you've got the two images the sliders
doing<00:02:01.250> nothing<00:02:01.610> just<00:02:04.330> off<00:02:05.330> or<00:02:05.570> on<00:02:08.380> so
