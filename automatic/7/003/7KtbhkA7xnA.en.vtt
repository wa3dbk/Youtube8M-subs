00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.830
 well it's a while ago I talked something about the 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.100
 changes of microphones that are very 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.020
 interesting in this type of guitar 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.470
 especially because it reminds me of all 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:27.430
 the old sounds of that time the 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.470
 discs that you hear not then I'm going to 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:34.450
 use it with a screamer tube that 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:38.050
 I have here that is tc 808 and I have a delay 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.380
 Analog of Ivan is short as for 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.800
 take out a sound 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:48.020
 from that time no and I liked it because 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.020
 I can well 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.719
 how to emulate 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:03.190
 a time not touching some leaks 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.700
 of those styles and blouses or rockers 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.700
 old 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.290
 ah 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.070
 do not 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.320
 and 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.320
 and 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.660
 and 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.980
 and 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.270
 at 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.280
 Y 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.469
 also the dynamics that the 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.150
 guitar I guess it's because of this guy 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:49.379
 of microphones that are this 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:52.459
 the rich and they were and co2 the only 5 but 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:55.680
 they are well of the time up to the plastics 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:58.760
 they are like a Bakelite that later leaves 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.040
 vegetating you have the whole wave the 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.000
 lever also the bridges all goes 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.950
 towards the sound of this guitar this 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.079
 well I hope you liked it and 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.859
 who can take advantage of this listening 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:16.260
 these guitars come to try them and 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:18.510
 good and see what music can 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.109
 angular or where they can take it or 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.109
 direct us 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.970
 Thank you
