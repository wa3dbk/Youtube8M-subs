good they haven't have a tendency to

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.870 
good they haven't have a tendency to
separate<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.659> will<00:01:54.780> take<00:01:54.960> some<00:01:55.110> steps<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.530> uh

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
separate and will take some steps to uh

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.639 
separate and will take some steps to uh
to<00:01:56.880> alleviate<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.329> later<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.409> I'm<00:01:58.530> just

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.770 
to alleviate that later so I'm just
going<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.829> begin<00:01:59.040> by<00:01:59.360> buffing<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.450> product

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
going to begin by buffing the product

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.350 
going to begin by buffing the product
onto<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.229> skin<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.680> can<00:02:01.829> see<00:02:02.040> with<00:02:02.759> this

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
onto the skin and you can see with this

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.260 
onto the skin and you can see with this
particular<00:02:04.049> application<00:02:04.979> technique<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:06.030> goes

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
particular application technique it goes

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.609 
particular application technique it goes
really<00:02:06.829> really<00:02:07.829> fast<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:09.450> at<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.229> good<00:02:10.440> thing

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
really really fast and at the good thing

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.839 
really really fast and at the good thing
about<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.069> because<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.730> a

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
about that is because it is a

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.760 
about that is because it is a
water-based<00:02:12.330> product<00:02:13.140> or<00:02:13.260> water

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
water-based product or water

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.950 
water-based product or water
tivated<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.640> want<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.000> work<00:02:15.180> quickly<00:02:15.510> because

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
tivated you want to work quickly because

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.930 
tivated you want to work quickly because
as<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.170> dries<00:02:16.680> if<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.250> go<00:02:17.400> over<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:17.850> again

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
as it dries if you go over it again

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.870 
as it dries if you go over it again
it'll<00:02:18.810> begin<00:02:18.960> to<00:02:19.350> chop<00:02:19.650> kind<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.040> chunk<00:02:20.370> apart

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
it'll begin to chop kind of chunk apart

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.510 
it'll begin to chop kind of chunk apart
almost<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.600> so<00:02:22.140> on<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.890> can<00:02:23.010> even<00:02:23.100> see<00:02:23.250> that

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
almost and so on you can even see that

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.370 
almost and so on you can even see that
it's<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.700> little<00:02:23.730> streaky<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.600> that's<00:02:25.080> okay

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
it's a little streaky and that's okay

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.350 
it's a little streaky and that's okay
because<00:02:25.560> will<00:02:25.860> buff<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.310> texture<00:02:26.670> out<00:02:26.820> as<00:02:27.030> we

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
because will buff the texture out as we

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.980 
because will buff the texture out as we
go<00:02:27.390> along<00:02:28.670> so<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.850> same<00:02:30.060> thing<00:02:30.330> I'm<00:02:30.570> with<00:02:30.840> the

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
go along so the same thing I'm with the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.260 
go along so the same thing I'm with the
head<00:02:31.200> will<00:02:31.530> actually<00:02:31.890> just<00:02:32.220> work<00:02:32.430> in<00:02:32.670> buffing

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
head will actually just work in buffing

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.430 
head will actually just work in buffing
motions<00:02:33.660> all<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.320> way<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.940> back<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.480> my

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
motions all the way to the back of my

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.100 
motions all the way to the back of my
skull<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:38.790> what<00:02:39.030> you'll<00:02:39.210> I'll<00:02:39.570> do<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:39.990> I'll

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
skull and what you'll I'll do is I'll

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.860 
skull and what you'll I'll do is I'll
actually<00:02:40.320> use<00:02:40.800> my<00:02:41.340> trusty<00:02:41.580> hand<00:02:41.940> mirror<00:02:42.150> with

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
actually use my trusty hand mirror with

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.350 
actually use my trusty hand mirror with
the<00:02:43.170> mirror<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.710> have<00:02:44.010> in<00:02:44.610> order<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:45.060> look

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
the mirror that I have in order to look

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.570 
the mirror that I have in order to look
behind<00:02:45.630> myself<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.710> actually<00:02:47.100> complete<00:02:47.550> the

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
behind myself and actually complete the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.520 
behind myself and actually complete the
look<00:02:47.790> on<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.030> back<00:02:48.150> of<00:02:48.210> the<00:02:48.390> head<00:02:48.570> this<00:02:49.380> is<00:02:49.470> the

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
look on the back of the head this is the

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.930 
look on the back of the head this is the
first<00:02:49.710> time<00:02:49.800> that<00:02:49.950> I've<00:02:50.100> ever<00:02:50.130> tried<00:02:50.520> anything

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
first time that I've ever tried anything

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.700 
first time that I've ever tried anything
like<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.690> so<00:02:52.020> it<00:02:52.050> should<00:02:52.440> be<00:02:52.560> an<00:02:52.650> interesting

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
like this so it should be an interesting

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.620 
like this so it should be an interesting
experiment<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:54.150> we'll<00:02:54.270> come<00:02:54.450> back

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
experiment and so we'll come back

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.470 
experiment and so we'll come back
together<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.680> see<00:02:56.400> what<00:02:56.670> it<00:02:56.760> looks<00:02:57.000> like<00:02:57.180> once

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
together and see what it looks like once

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.070 
together and see what it looks like once
I<00:02:57.600> had<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.810> entire<00:02:58.140> head<00:02:58.470> completed<00:03:00.080> all

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
I had the entire head completed all

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.170 
I had the entire head completed all
right<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:02.010> now<00:03:02.190> you<00:03:02.250> can<00:03:02.580> see<00:03:02.760> we<00:03:02.940> have<00:03:03.150> the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
right and so now you can see we have the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.380 
right and so now you can see we have the
entire<00:03:03.810> head<00:03:04.200> covered<00:03:04.740> in<00:03:04.950> turquoise<00:03:05.520> there

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
entire head covered in turquoise there

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.970 
entire head covered in turquoise there
are<00:03:06.510> some<00:03:06.660> spots<00:03:06.930> that<00:03:07.140> aren't<00:03:07.350> completely

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
are some spots that aren't completely

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.070 
are some spots that aren't completely
covered<00:03:08.460> and<00:03:08.640> that's<00:03:08.940> okay<00:03:09.240> because<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.900> next

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
covered and that's okay because the next

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.660 
covered and that's okay because the next
step<00:03:10.290> in<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.500> process<00:03:10.530> is<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.220> actually<00:03:11.370> take

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
step in the process is to actually take

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.310 
step in the process is to actually take
a<00:03:11.700> little<00:03:11.940> bit<00:03:12.120> of<00:03:12.180> makeup<00:03:12.480> forever<00:03:12.870> flash

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
a little bit of makeup forever flash

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.740 
a little bit of makeup forever flash
color<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.890> number<00:03:14.550> zero<00:03:14.970> which<00:03:15.330> is<00:03:15.360> a

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
color and number zero which is a

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.140 
color and number zero which is a
turquoise<00:03:16.410> color<00:03:16.770> and<00:03:17.040> I've<00:03:17.400> warmed<00:03:17.700> it<00:03:17.880> up<00:03:17.970> on

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
turquoise color and I've warmed it up on

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.670 
turquoise color and I've warmed it up on
the<00:03:18.240> back<00:03:18.390> of<00:03:18.420> my<00:03:18.600> hand<00:03:18.959> I'm<00:03:19.260> going<00:03:19.410> to<00:03:19.530> use<00:03:19.650> my

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
the back of my hand I'm going to use my

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.500 
the back of my hand I'm going to use my
stippling<00:03:20.370> brush<00:03:20.490> that's<00:03:20.730> been<00:03:20.970> cleaned<00:03:21.270> and

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
stippling brush that's been cleaned and

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.360 
stippling brush that's been cleaned and
dried<00:03:21.720> off<00:03:22.050> in<00:03:22.380> order<00:03:22.770> to<00:03:22.920> sort<00:03:23.160> of<00:03:23.250> now

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
dried off in order to sort of now

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.520 
dried off in order to sort of now
lightly<00:03:23.790> buff<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.209> over<00:03:24.720> this<00:03:24.930> product<00:03:25.350> that

lightly buff it over this product that
has<00:03:25.680> now<00:03:25.830> dried<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:26.490> what<00:03:26.940> it'll<00:03:27.120> do<00:03:27.270> is<00:03:27.300> sort

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600

has now dried and what it'll do is sort
of<00:03:27.690> fill<00:03:27.959> in<00:03:27.990> all<00:03:28.320> those<00:03:28.440> little<00:03:28.680> cracks<00:03:28.980> and

of fill in all those little cracks and

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.610 
of fill in all those little cracks and
crevices<00:03:29.640> where<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:30.390> products<00:03:30.810> didn't<00:03:31.200> go<00:03:31.350> on

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
crevices where the products didn't go on

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.320 
crevices where the products didn't go on
completely<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.310> totally<00:03:32.430> evenly<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:33.180> then

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
completely and totally evenly and then

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.970 
completely and totally evenly and then
you<00:03:33.420> can<00:03:33.570> powder<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:33.959> all<00:03:34.080> together<00:03:34.260> what's

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
you can powder it all together what's

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.350 
you can powder it all together what's
great<00:03:35.130> about<00:03:35.220> this<00:03:35.520> is<00:03:35.580> it<00:03:35.790> also<00:03:36.030> gives<00:03:36.180> you<00:03:36.270> a

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
great about this is it also gives you a

highlight and strong definition and you

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:07.070 
highlight and strong definition and you
can<00:07:05.070> see<00:07:05.280> there<00:07:05.520> that<00:07:05.550> it<00:07:05.880> starts<00:07:06.150> to<00:07:06.210> cut<00:07:06.870> away

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 
can see there that it starts to cut away

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.260 
can see there that it starts to cut away
and<00:07:07.229> become<00:07:07.650> a<00:07:07.710> really<00:07:08.009> strong<00:07:08.280> highlight<00:07:08.699> I'm

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:09.270 
and become a really strong highlight I'm

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.899 
and become a really strong highlight I'm
also<00:07:09.419> going<00:07:09.599> to<00:07:09.659> do<00:07:09.810> it<00:07:09.960> on<00:07:10.740> the<00:07:11.099> top<00:07:11.340> of<00:07:11.669> the

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:11.909

00:07:25.499 --> 00:07:25.509 

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:27.700 

so<00:07:26.509> you<00:07:26.599> can<00:07:26.780> see<00:07:26.930> that<00:07:26.960> that<00:07:27.169> highlight

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:27.710 
so you can see that that highlight

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:35.980 
so you can see that that highlight
beginning<00:07:28.159> to<00:07:28.340> to<00:07:29.120> arrive<00:07:33.729> and<00:07:34.729> if<00:07:35.629> you<00:07:35.749> can't

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.409 
to do them in any particular order I
just<00:07:45.529> find<00:07:45.830> that<00:07:45.979> if<00:07:46.310> i<00:07:46.460> highlight<00:07:46.669> first<00:07:47.210> my

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:47.419 
just find that if i highlight first my

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:50.649 
just find that if i highlight first my
contour<00:07:47.930> seems<00:07:48.169> up<00:07:48.349> to<00:07:48.729> be<00:07:49.729> a<00:07:49.759> little<00:07:50.060> bit<00:07:50.300> more

00:07:50.649 --> 00:07:50.659 
contour seems up to be a little bit more

00:07:50.659 --> 00:07:53.379 
contour seems up to be a little bit more
intense<00:07:51.529> or<00:07:51.800> more<00:07:51.949> obvious<00:07:52.340> so<00:07:52.879> I'm<00:07:53.210> going<00:07:53.360> to

00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:53.389 
intense or more obvious so I'm going to

00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:55.089 
intense or more obvious so I'm going to
continue<00:07:53.689> to<00:07:53.840> highlight<00:07:54.259> with<00:07:54.439> the<00:07:54.560> white

00:07:55.089 --> 00:07:55.099 
continue to highlight with the white

00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:57.610 
continue to highlight with the white
mixture<00:07:55.460> and<00:07:56.090> then<00:07:56.180> we'll<00:07:56.539> begin<00:07:56.870> to<00:07:57.110> contour

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:57.620 
mixture and then we'll begin to contour

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.860 
mixture and then we'll begin to contour
the<00:07:57.650> look
