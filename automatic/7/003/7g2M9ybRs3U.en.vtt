00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.529 
to make do with an off-the-rack version
the<00:00:20.189> right<00:00:20.369> collar<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:21.029> one<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.420> most

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
the right collar is one of the most

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.259 
the right collar is one of the most
important<00:00:22.109> features<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.619> get<00:00:22.920> right<00:00:23.160> what<00:00:24.090> you

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
important features to get right what you

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.300 
important features to get right what you
want<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.570> do<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.560> idea<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.980> frame<00:00:26.130> your

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
want to do is the idea is to frame your

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.380 
want to do is the idea is to frame your
face<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.789> collar<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.180> most

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
face and the collar is the most

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.050 
face and the collar is the most
important<00:00:27.779> part<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.230> if<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.460> are<00:00:29.670> thinner

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
important part so if you are thinner

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.179 
important part so if you are thinner
that<00:00:30.390> means<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.840> want<00:00:31.080> wider<00:00:31.590> lines<00:00:31.890> to

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
that means you want wider lines to

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.799 
that means you want wider lines to
counterbalance<00:00:32.489> your<00:00:33.000> already<00:00:33.300> narrow<00:00:33.510> lines

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
counterbalance your already narrow lines

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.440 
counterbalance your already narrow lines
and<00:00:34.170> if<00:00:34.710> perhaps<00:00:35.070> you're<00:00:35.460> shorter<00:00:36.000> stockier

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
and if perhaps you're shorter stockier

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.920 
and if perhaps you're shorter stockier
then<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.410> want<00:00:37.620> narrower<00:00:38.340> lines<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.809> know

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
then you want narrower lines to you know

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.630 
then you want narrower lines to you know
balance<00:00:40.200> out<00:00:40.590> what<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.040> already<00:00:41.100> have<00:00:41.460> is

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
balance out what you already have is

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.490 
balance out what you already have is
wide<00:00:41.879> lines<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.960> elements<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.350> you're

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
wide lines in the elements that you're

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.900 
wide lines in the elements that you're
looking<00:00:43.739> for<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.280> should<00:00:44.460> start<00:00:44.670> with<00:00:44.820> the

looking for you should start with the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.810 
looking for you should start with the

chest and shoulders for instance this is

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.060 
chest and shoulders for instance this is
what<00:00:48.000> we<00:00:48.090> call<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.390> yoke<00:00:48.600> or<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.070> shoulder

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
what we call the yoke or the shoulder

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.250 
what we call the yoke or the shoulder
measurement<00:00:50.449> and<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.480> want<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.899> kind<00:00:52.199> of

measurement and you want it to kind of

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.479 
measurement and you want it to kind of
just<00:00:52.440> come<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.739> where<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:52.890> have<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.100> natural

just come to where you have a natural
drop<00:00:53.699> there<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.210> then<00:00:54.690> fall<00:00:54.899> off<00:00:54.930> sometimes

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
drop there and then fall off sometimes

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.430 
drop there and then fall off sometimes
you'll<00:00:55.920> see<00:00:56.160> where<00:00:56.940> it's<00:00:57.629> too<00:00:57.840> small<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.410> you

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
you'll see where it's too small and you

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.470 
you'll see where it's too small and you
can<00:00:58.620> see<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.859> shoulder<00:00:59.160> protruding<00:00:59.640> or<00:00:59.789> more

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
often you'll see the yoke fall all the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.310 
often you'll see the yoke fall all the
way<00:01:02.370> down<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.820> sleeves<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.960> looks<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.229> little

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
way down the sleeves it looks a little

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.429 
way down the sleeves it looks a little
bit<00:01:04.530> sloppy<00:01:05.030> next<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.150> want<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.420> trim<00:01:07.170> across

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
your chest but not tight I think the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.370 
your chest but not tight I think the
biggest<00:01:10.970> misconception<00:01:11.970> guys<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.200> that

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
biggest misconception guys have is that

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.340 
biggest misconception guys have is that

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
hit a very specific point what you

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.550

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
be a little bit long okay so when you

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.200 
be a little bit long okay so when you
unbutton<00:01:22.470> your<00:01:22.560> cuff<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:23.400> falls<00:01:23.729> down<00:01:23.880> your

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
hand farther and then you want to size

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.039 
hand farther and then you want to size
the<00:01:26.520> cuff<00:01:26.670> appropriately<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.869> rests

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
the cuff appropriately so that it rests

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.200 
the cuff appropriately so that it rests
on<00:01:28.290> your<00:01:28.470> hand<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.950> then<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.729> way<00:01:29.880> when

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.490 
that's a good question and one thing I
would<00:01:41.220> say<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.759> if<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.210> are<00:01:42.899> gonna<00:01:43.290> get<00:01:43.439> a

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
would say is if you are gonna get a

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.840 
would say is if you are gonna get a
ready-made<00:01:43.770> shirt<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.310> might<00:01:44.460> have<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.729> make

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
ready-made shirt you might have to make

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.700 
ready-made shirt you might have to make
some<00:01:45.030> minor<00:01:45.180> alterations<00:01:45.470> think<00:01:46.470> about<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
some minor alterations think about the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.010 
some minor alterations think about the
simplest<00:01:47.040> alterations<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.270> on<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.479> shirt<00:01:48.780> if

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
simplest alterations and on a shirt if

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.260 
simplest alterations and on a shirt if
you<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.189> can<00:01:50.340> very<00:01:50.520> easily<00:01:50.579> shorten<00:01:51.210> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
you can you can very easily shorten the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.539 
you can you can very easily shorten the
sleeves<00:01:51.390> slightly<00:01:51.960> or<00:01:52.170> move<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.070> cuff<00:01:53.250> button

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
sleeves slightly or move the cuff button

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.399 
sleeves slightly or move the cuff button
to<00:01:53.759> get<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.000> desired<00:01:54.270> effect<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:55.229> make<00:01:55.380> sure

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
to get the desired effect so make sure

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.630 
to get the desired effect so make sure
you<00:01:55.590> buy<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.740> short<00:01:56.009> sleeve<00:01:56.189> that's<00:01:56.369> long

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
you buy a short sleeve that's long

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.039 
you buy a short sleeve that's long
enough<00:01:56.670> because<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.329> can't<00:01:57.570> lengthen<00:01:57.780> a

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
enough because you can't lengthen a
