these little things little obstacles in

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.330 
these little things little obstacles in
the<00:04:19.580> way<00:04:19.660> um<00:04:20.660> like<00:04:21.530> right<00:04:21.739> here<00:04:21.980> you're<00:04:22.130> trying

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
the way um like right here you're trying

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.520 
the way um like right here you're trying
to<00:04:22.400> get<00:04:22.520> through<00:04:22.820> but<00:04:23.030> the<00:04:23.240> doors<00:04:23.960> not<00:04:24.170> opening

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
I thank you but I think it's the same

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.950 
I thank you but I think it's the same
voice<00:04:46.610> actor<00:04:46.790> just<00:04:47.300> a<00:04:47.360> little<00:04:47.480> thing<00:04:47.750> there

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
voice actor just a little thing there

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.800 
voice actor just a little thing there
but<00:04:48.740> uh<00:04:48.770> and<00:04:49.220> so<00:04:50.120> this<00:04:50.300> is<00:04:50.450> like<00:04:50.540> one<00:04:50.690> of<00:04:50.720> the

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
but uh and so this is like one of the

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.510 
but uh and so this is like one of the
obstacles<00:04:51.020> you<00:04:51.440> have<00:04:51.530> to<00:04:51.590> like<00:04:51.710> defend<00:04:51.920> here

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
obstacles you have to like defend here

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.550 
obstacles you have to like defend here
and<00:04:54.970> so<00:04:55.970> in<00:04:56.330> one<00:04:56.750> of<00:04:56.780> those<00:04:56.930> rooms<00:04:57.290> there's

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
and so in one of those rooms there's

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.190 
and so in one of those rooms there's
actually<00:04:57.830> Intel<00:04:58.340> I<00:04:59.000> don't<00:04:59.630> really<00:04:59.840> know<00:05:00.020> where

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
actually Intel I don't really know where

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.610 
actually Intel I don't really know where
all<00:05:00.470> the<00:05:00.620> Intel<00:05:00.950> is<00:05:01.160> so<00:05:01.720> you<00:05:02.720> know<00:05:02.840> go<00:05:03.410> watch

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
all the Intel is so you know go watch

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.500 
all the Intel is so you know go watch

it's like Achievement Hunter they have
all<00:05:05.630> the<00:05:05.750> Intel<00:05:05.870> locations<00:05:06.140> um<00:05:07.070> so<00:05:07.730> you<00:05:08.540> go

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
all the Intel locations um so you go

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.990 
all the Intel locations um so you go
down<00:05:09.140> here<00:05:09.410> into<00:05:09.620> the<00:05:09.890> armory<00:05:10.280> and<00:05:10.670> there's<00:05:10.940> a

so<00:05:48.590> um<00:05:49.590> right<00:05:50.100> here<00:05:50.430> he<00:05:51.270> says<00:05:51.450> like<00:05:51.600> there's<00:05:51.780> a

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
so um right here he says like there's a

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.950 
so um right here he says like there's a
lot<00:05:51.930> of<00:05:51.960> guys<00:05:52.170> coming<00:05:52.470> in<00:05:52.680> there<00:05:53.270> so<00:05:54.270> and<00:05:54.300> you

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
lot of guys coming in there so and you

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.670 
lot of guys coming in there so and you
have<00:05:55.050> to<00:05:55.170> defend<00:05:55.410> the<00:05:56.250> door<00:05:56.520> while<00:05:56.910> they<00:05:57.150> all

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
have to defend the door while they all

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.970 
have to defend the door while they all
prolly<00:05:58.680> waits<00:05:59.010> to<00:05:59.310> get<00:05:59.460> it<00:05:59.550> open<00:05:59.880> and<00:06:00.500> so<00:06:01.500> riot

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:01.980 
prolly waits to get it open and so riot

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.850 
prolly waits to get it open and so riot
shields<00:06:02.430> are<00:06:02.580> pretty<00:06:02.850> cool<00:06:03.090> their<00:06:03.390> new<00:06:03.860> weapon

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
shields are pretty cool their new weapon

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.300 
shields are pretty cool their new weapon
in<00:06:04.950> the<00:06:05.040> game<00:06:05.250> um<00:06:06.320> it's<00:06:07.320> just<00:06:07.680> a<00:06:07.770> defensive

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
in the game um it's just a defensive
