 they ask me to teach them some words of 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:51.860
 Let us know that Finnish is a language 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.620
 ancient a language very different from the 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.829
 vast majority of the languages â€‹â€‹that are 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.790
 they speak in europe but they do not fall for 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.540
 back the end is not so complicated and 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.300

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.909
 a magic line that surrounds the north pole 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:53.140

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:57.270

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:01.929

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:08.289
 which means good afternoon 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.760

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.460

 at Christmas time we can say in 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:10.420
 May what Merry Christmas means 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:14.660
 let's say it again a may a place 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:18.980
 saying goodbye can sometimes be a little 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:22.820
 sad but in short it is also there are several 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:26.900
 options to say goodbye the way 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:30.110
 formal to say until then is the one 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:34.310
 min that min is a bit difficult 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:37.209
 say it there are no much simpler ways 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.610
 in general the Finns are not 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:45.730
 picky if you want to say goodbye 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:51.680
 plainly there are two formulas hey hey or 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:55.370
 I go to my Japanese friends very very les 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.970
 It seems very funny since it sounds like a 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:02.209
 little to Japanese 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:06.049
 we have already seen a score of words 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:09.230
 in Finnish you can review the list of 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:13.640
 all of them at the end of the video to 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.880
 help you remember them I was not 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.690
 forgetting two very words 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.880
 important 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:25.390
 it's about my assistants here in 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:30.229
 laponia my reindeer in ends is said by 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:33.610
 I repeat for in Lapland they are given names 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:39.340
 very reminiscent of my reindeer as of 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:44.260
 mallkus or the lama and my pixies 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:48.580
 elf in the end is said silly 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:51.910
 one of my pixies the fool said 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:55.480
 that Finnish could not be such a language 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:05:01.200
 difficult since even children more 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:01.200
 small speak Finnish in Finland 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:10.050
 but it's time to say goodbye to good luck with 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.050
 Finnish 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:16.060
 I am very 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.060
 be nice 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:25.759
 I do it because pencil your moment 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:30.409
 nobody sees 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:30.409
 increases aiba 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:41.150
 live and tv and new york half that this 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.150
 it goes 

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:51.169
 therefore since it gives me 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:53.770
 hey hey i'm going 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:53.770
