00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 moin moin place welcome to 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.059
 a first video of my little new one 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.700
 series wm 2014 in brazil today my 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.639
 first video I would like to have a few 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.360
 words about the topstars of the 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.949
 losing world championship there 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.640
 on the one hand the portuguese cristiano 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.890
 ronaldo just like messi is normal but 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.449
 a candidate for the title football god 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.130
 Although he holds in the election 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.730
 world footballer so far always the shorter 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.590
 drawn 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.810
 Nevertheless, the fair is actually in 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.579
 he can do almost nothing for one thing 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.940
 better at tricking and hit everything 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.170
 look incredibly casual 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.059
 cristiano ronaldo for me one of the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.910
 topstars of the world championship I am 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.480
 Glad he is still with Portugal 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.660
 could qualify 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.100
 yes then we come too 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.940
 argentina the topstars arge the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.829
 topstar argentina is younger messi 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.170
 not a few are of the opinion that messi 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.579
 the football god par excellence is not 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.710
 wonder if you look for his example 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.170
 last season's values ​​look at 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.670
 The league hit in 32 plays incredible 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.260
 46 times in addition to 14 templates 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.840
 a truly divine power yes 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.430
 lionel messi at the fc barcelona under 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.740
 contract we come already to 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.290
 next top star the absolute top star 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:22.500
 the brazilian national team 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:24.720
 lehmann the hope child of a whole 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.790
 nation is called brazil 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.950
 one of nena the megatalent sour 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.259
 together with messi at barca play for 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.900
 play so well that this awesome duo 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.470
 our eleven at the wm not opposite 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.770
 stands 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.659
 then we have the france from 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.310
 French how should it be otherwise 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.439
 from ribery from fc bavaria munich what the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.840
 franzose is currently showing in the square 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.460
 Only one conclusion is that he was so good 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.229
 never in vain is that 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.159
 edeltechniker europe footballer of the 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.500
 become one year old 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.090
 schlitzohr as he is also seems the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.700
 title of world footballer this year 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.570
 possible and at the wm maybe too 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.180
 the wm title 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.280
 then I still have a guardian 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.210
 German except by national team 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.520
 the death 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.289
 that müller as the top star of the wm 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.900
 I also found out there have many 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.400
 many others can take for example 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.500
 is also a hot candidate but 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.170
 thomas müller joined us four years ago 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.270
 the wm 2010 in south africa 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.190
 scorer and i believe 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.319
 junior players of the tournament and 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.630
 that's why mister casual plays since 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.920
 years to an absolute top level 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.980
 even if in public 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.980
 Perception among all the super-stars 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.290
 My opinion is a little too short 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.780
 wrongly as a miller the game 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.590
 there is a great performance for the game 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.530
 only very rarely 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.640
 yes these are my 455 topstars now 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.530
 World Cup in Brazil and now 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.050
 are you asked who are for you or 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.790
 who is the top star for you ? 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.560
 Brazil write me the comments 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.190
 so that we could talk about it 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.280
 I am very happy 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.880
 and as I said I am now more often wm 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.410
 videos bring in this format and yes 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.269
 so much for what I hope from me 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.530
 does not like it 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.330
 Remember to write in the comments 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.730
 thumbs up and then see us 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.370
 Soon again with a theme about the wm 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.640
