00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
two lanes out of three at one time it

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.439

causes monumental traffic jams but the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.200 
causes monumental traffic jams but the
reason<00:01:00.719> why<00:01:00.989> they<00:01:01.170> do<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.789> keep<00:01:03.000> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
reason why they do this is to keep the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.870 
reason why they do this is to keep the
traffic<00:01:03.690> won<00:01:03.870> by<00:01:04.049> very<00:01:04.379> slowly<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.580> there's<00:01:05.790> no

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
traffic won by very slowly so there's no

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.170 
traffic won by very slowly so there's no
chance<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.780> work<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.229> getting<00:01:07.439> hurt<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.180> can

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
chance of the work is getting hurt I can

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.060 
chance of the work is getting hurt I can
understand<00:01:09.630> why<00:01:09.750> they<00:01:09.900> do<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.110> but<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
understand why they do it but the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.890 
understand why they do it but the
traffic<00:01:11.460> jams<00:01:12.090> are<00:01:12.420> immense<00:01:14.150> every<00:01:15.150> single
