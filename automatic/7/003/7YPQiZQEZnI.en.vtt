00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.190
 that's all of the world so today I 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.500
 will you introduce a little tutorial this 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.139
 will not be super good quality but 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.940
 it will be to repair a pc so for 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.690
 the moment I will show you see her 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.680
 that two accomplices and so it's a ca 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.740
 this is fujitsu with this one it's old 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.990
 pc it was still a pc with windows xp 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.789
 vasseux su and so I have a problem and has 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.800
 not very long when I should you 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.040
 piss that that makes me that there we can 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.040
 turn 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.800
 all but it does not work then for those 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.370
 it is very easy to base your 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.470
 computer that will be removed from cable and with 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.030
 five hectares over there I do not know 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:01:01.199
 how to do it but if I ever put myself 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:06.140
 so here to repair those you 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:09.210
 go first is one of your pc 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.009
 so to turn it off completely done 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.440
 with these 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:16.770
 tibo turns after there is the small plug 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:20.310
 there so want to shoot like that more of the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.200
 court rate a facade your 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.179
 computer is off the tv always 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.970
 on and so it's all stupid 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:32.670
 so I broke my ass to 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.060
 turn disassemble be increased actually 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:41.399
 it was all stupid so here you see 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:44.759
 so that's where there is I had 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.380
 three cd memory sticks yes and their 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.290
 repertoire 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.270
 so we can have up to 20 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.600
 memory cards me it is to vote 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.500
 up to 4 for a CD strikethrough memory 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:02.750
 of dj guys who are really not 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:06.180
 so to know which one is not working 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.759
 you take to remove yourself like this 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.310
 so directly removed those that are not going 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.010
 not what I was going to do that I already have 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.760
 tried i know this is where will be missing 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.260
 so in fact it's this little bar is there 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.140
 which is a small problem so for 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.190
 the remove you push who if you have 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.510
 a kind of 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:32.580
 two little bits this time over 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:37.740
 treated water or made it look if I have 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:41.610
 nothing to what then 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:45.600
 she is English we put back here so I 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.610
 reopened theirs down the rhine and a 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.510
 pushes until it has to be worth 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:03:00.440
 better go to be the legacy before 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:03:10.730
 which sinks down an axis so here 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:13.650
 we can grow his coffee we read 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.340
 that and blame we will play before the 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:23.960
 ideally cable also connected to the word 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.960
 on start your pc turns 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.200
 the 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:35.019
 and will his TV so here's your 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.879
 computer is repaired so it's not 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.879
 all the time like this if he will have to do 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:49.230
 it depends a little on computers 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.230
 so I promise you that turns out well 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:04:02.650
 this is the time it is var this is good for 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.709
 the moment I will have to put everything away because 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:10.420
 that the orange gt there again your 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:13.200
 computer load but benefit it's 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:20.680

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:23.710

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:57.449

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:57.449
