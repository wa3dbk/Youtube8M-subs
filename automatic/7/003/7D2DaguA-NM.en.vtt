now i'm taking my maybelline black
studio<00:03:33.850> liner<00:03:34.330> I<00:03:34.569> think<00:03:34.840> that's<00:03:34.990> what<00:03:35.140> it's

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
studio liner I think that's what it's

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.340 
studio liner I think that's what it's
called<00:03:35.319> and<00:03:35.709> I'm<00:03:36.490> just<00:03:36.850> like<00:03:37.120> lining<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.080> top

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
called and I'm just like lining the top

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.560 
called and I'm just like lining the top
of<00:03:38.590> my<00:03:38.770> eye<00:03:38.800> and<00:03:39.250> I<00:03:39.340> think<00:03:39.700> I<00:03:39.850> do<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:40.240> bottom

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
of my eye and I think I do the bottom

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.470 
of my eye and I think I do the bottom
later<00:03:40.900> as<00:03:41.230> well<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:41.850> just<00:03:42.850> apply<00:03:43.060> some

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
later as well and just apply some

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.509 
later as well and just apply some
mascara<00:03:43.570> and<00:03:44.290> yes

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.949 

so<00:03:49.519> the<00:03:49.700> eyelashes<00:03:50.269> I'm<00:03:50.390> using<00:03:50.599> today<00:03:50.840> are

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
so the eyelashes I'm using today are

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.339 
so the eyelashes I'm using today are
Katy<00:03:51.530> Perry<00:03:51.980> lashes<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.969> coppell<00:03:53.719> ones<00:03:54.109> or

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
Katy Perry lashes the coppell ones or

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:55.539 
Katy Perry lashes the coppell ones or
whatever<00:03:54.590> they're<00:03:54.739> called<00:03:54.769> and<00:03:55.370> I<00:03:55.430> actually

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
whatever they're called and I actually

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.209 
whatever they're called and I actually
have<00:03:55.909> like<00:03:56.090> purple<00:03:56.959> throw<00:03:57.590> on<00:03:57.620> so<00:03:58.010> I<00:03:58.040> thought

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:58.219 
have like purple throw on so I thought

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:00.250 
have like purple throw on so I thought
it<00:03:58.370> was<00:03:58.489> appropriate<00:03:58.670> I<00:03:59.239> don't<00:03:59.420> know<00:03:59.480> and<00:03:59.750> as

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
it was appropriate I don't know and as

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.309 
it was appropriate I don't know and as
usual<00:04:00.500> while<00:04:01.280> my<00:04:01.849> lash<00:04:02.359> glue<00:04:02.540> is<00:04:02.780> drying<00:04:03.079> on<00:04:03.290> my

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
usual while my lash glue is drying on my

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.679 
usual while my lash glue is drying on my
eyelashes<00:04:03.950> I<00:04:04.129> always<00:04:04.489> prime<00:04:04.819> my<00:04:05.000> face<00:04:05.030> in<00:04:05.569> the

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:05.689 
eyelashes I always prime my face in the

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:10.420 
eyelashes I always prime my face in the
meantime<00:04:08.109> so<00:04:09.109> basically<00:04:09.650> i<00:04:09.769> wasn't<00:04:10.250> going<00:04:10.370> to
