 Fiesta which represents 35% of sales 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.029
 Ford in France in a market of 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.599

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.020
 sports a front worthy of the db9 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.360

 this new facade brings 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.870
 undeniably a gain in liveliness 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.250
 the general look of the car as to the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.230

 back part we will not talk about 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.000
 stylistic revolution but a bet 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.470
 to the standards of the moment of the design even the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.180
