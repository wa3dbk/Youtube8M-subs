that one pointedness of energy and

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.319 
that one pointedness of energy and
attention<00:01:14.729> brings<00:01:15.729> about<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:16.119> mass

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
attention brings about the mass

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.710 
attention brings about the mass
foundation<00:01:17.079> really<00:01:17.470> quickly<00:01:18.360> most<00:01:19.360> people

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
foundation really quickly most people

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.289 
foundation really quickly most people
are<00:01:19.840> scattered<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:20.619> their<00:01:21.040> interest<00:01:21.549> and

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
are scattered and their interest and

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:23.760 
are scattered and their interest and
where<00:01:22.509> they<00:01:22.659> place<00:01:22.899> their<00:01:23.170> attention<00:01:23.649> and

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
where they place their attention and

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.760 
where they place their attention and
their<00:01:23.920> energy<00:01:24.430> is<00:01:25.329> all<00:01:25.600> in<00:01:25.990> many<00:01:26.290> different

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
their energy is all in many different

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.940 
their energy is all in many different
areas<00:01:26.950> of<00:01:27.460> life<00:01:27.939> and<00:01:28.360> so<00:01:28.659> they're<00:01:29.439> much<00:01:29.619> slower

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
areas of life and so they're much slower

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.980 
areas of life and so they're much slower

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
had to do is walk around and gather it I

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.729

mean all we had to do is pick it up and
make<00:02:22.950> use<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.760> now<00:02:24.600> we<00:02:24.660> think<00:02:25.110> we<00:02:26.040> we

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
make use of it and now we think we we

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.120 
make use of it and now we think we we
could<00:02:26.880> improve<00:02:27.030> upon<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:27.720> but<00:02:28.200> now<00:02:28.380> we<00:02:28.440> make

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
could improve upon that but now we make

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.780 
could improve upon that but now we make
a<00:02:29.160> living<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:30.330> we<00:02:30.450> have<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:31.020> try<00:02:31.350> to<00:02:31.580> pay<00:02:32.580> the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
a living and we have to try to pay the
