currently broadcasting reference signals
out<00:01:13.540> to<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.110> vehicles<00:01:14.560> so<00:01:15.310> she<00:01:15.430> turns<00:01:15.729> into<00:01:15.940> in

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
out to the vehicles so she turns into in

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.870 
out to the vehicles so she turns into in
this<00:01:16.990> case<00:01:17.229> that<00:01:17.380> says<00:01:17.560> 93.7<00:01:18.400> if<00:01:18.640> you<00:01:18.700> choose

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
this case that says 93.7 if you choose

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.300 
this case that says 93.7 if you choose
your<00:01:19.030> vehicle<00:01:19.060> into<00:01:19.479> 93.7<00:01:20.170> it<00:01:20.950> actually

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
your vehicle into 93.7 it actually

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.260 
your vehicle into 93.7 it actually
here's<00:01:21.640> what<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.750> computer<00:01:23.020> is<00:01:23.170> playing<00:01:24.270> so

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
here's what the computer is playing so

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.109 
here's what the computer is playing so
then<00:01:25.510> I<00:01:25.540> have<00:01:25.780> just<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:27.040> standard<00:01:27.430> cat<00:01:27.640> 5e

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
then I have just the standard cat 5e

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.750 
then I have just the standard cat 5e
wire<00:01:28.660> going<00:01:29.050> out<00:01:29.200> to<00:01:29.410> the<00:01:29.440> controllers<00:01:30.040> I'll

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
wire going out to the controllers I'll

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.430 
wire going out to the controllers I'll
try<00:01:31.030> to<00:01:31.090> show<00:01:31.240> you<00:01:31.420> that<00:01:31.570> but<00:01:31.930> it's<00:01:32.050> dark<00:01:32.320> up

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.240 
there so I don't think I'll be able to
but<00:01:34.390> I'll<00:01:34.510> give<00:01:34.630> it<00:01:34.660> a<00:01:34.750> go<00:01:37.890> all<00:01:38.890> right<00:01:39.040> guys

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250

but I'll give it a go all right guys
here's<00:01:39.640> my<00:01:39.700> app<00:01:40.030> controller<00:01:41.940> obviously<00:01:42.940> it's

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
here's my app controller obviously it's

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.610 
here's my app controller obviously it's
going<00:01:43.180> to<00:01:43.330> be<00:01:43.390> very<00:01:43.420> difficult<00:01:43.600> to<00:01:44.020> see<00:01:44.260> it's

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
going to be very difficult to see it's

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.920 
going to be very difficult to see it's

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
best I can the setup setup it's also

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.830 
best I can the setup setup it's also
raining<00:01:50.200> which<00:01:50.530> is<00:01:50.830> intrepid<00:01:51.520> great<00:01:51.790> so<00:01:52.750> I've

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
raining which is intrepid great so I've

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.550 
raining which is intrepid great so I've
got<00:01:53.020> my<00:01:53.730> controller<00:01:54.730> mounted<00:01:54.940> on<00:01:55.240> my<00:01:55.720> deck

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
got my controller mounted on my deck

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.899 
got my controller mounted on my deck
fence<00:01:56.830> out<00:01:57.010> here<00:01:57.220> and<00:01:57.510> as<00:01:58.510> you<00:01:58.570> can<00:01:58.780> see<00:01:59.909> it's

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
fence out here and as you can see it's

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.940 
fence out here and as you can see it's
running<00:02:01.330> flashing<00:02:02.230> lights<00:02:02.500> and<00:02:02.620> various

running flashing lights and various

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.140 
running flashing lights and various
signals<00:02:04.620> so<00:02:05.620> what's<00:02:06.340> currently<00:02:06.700> playing<00:02:06.909> is

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
signals so what's currently playing is

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.630 
signals so what's currently playing is

but that's what it is I will set up an
audio<00:02:13.209> system<00:02:13.540> outside<00:02:13.720> too<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.709> trick<00:02:14.980> or

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
audio system outside too so the trick or

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.890 
audio system outside too so the trick or
treaters<00:02:15.340> can<00:02:15.519> hear<00:02:15.760> that<00:02:15.970> as<00:02:16.360> well<00:02:16.630> as<00:02:16.750> the
