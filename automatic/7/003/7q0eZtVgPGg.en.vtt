higher alkaline and chlorine than other

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.119 
higher alkaline and chlorine than other
areas<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:03.690> it's<00:01:03.840> much<00:01:04.080> safer<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.530> always<00:01:04.920> use

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
areas so it's much safer to always use

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.930 
across the floor to make sure everything
is<00:04:20.790> even<00:04:21.239> this<00:04:22.109> should<00:04:22.380> be<00:04:22.560> dampened<00:04:23.190> before

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
is even this should be dampened before

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.910 
is even this should be dampened before
you<00:04:24.090> start<00:04:24.390> this<00:04:24.540> process<00:04:24.810> this<00:04:25.590> should<00:04:25.770> be

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
you start this process this should be

00:04:25.920 --> 00:05:50.879 
you start this process this should be
dampened<00:04:26.340> before<00:04:26.700> you<00:04:26.790> start<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.150> process
