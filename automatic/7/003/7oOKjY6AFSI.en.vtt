I'm<00:00:09.020> a<00:00:09.110> little<00:00:09.350> bit<00:00:09.440> of<00:00:09.530> a<00:00:09.620> keyboard<00:00:09.770> nerd<00:00:10.190> if

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:10.430 
I'm a little bit of a keyboard nerd if

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.980 
I'm a little bit of a keyboard nerd if
you<00:00:10.639> watched<00:00:10.850> my<00:00:11.000> youtube<00:00:11.480> channel<00:00:11.510> you'll

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:13.100 
see that I have a whole bunch of reviews

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.400 
see that I have a whole bunch of reviews
of<00:00:13.190> mechanical<00:00:13.850> keyboards<00:00:14.299> like<00:00:15.049> this<00:00:15.230> one

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
of mechanical keyboards like this one

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.250 
of mechanical keyboards like this one
right<00:00:15.680> here<00:00:15.740> for<00:00:16.070> instance<00:00:16.480> so<00:00:17.480> when<00:00:17.990> I<00:00:18.020> was

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
right here for instance so when I was

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.740 
right here for instance so when I was
watching<00:00:18.740> the<00:00:19.130> movie<00:00:19.280> Tron<00:00:19.760> Legacy<00:00:20.000> recently

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
watching the movie Tron Legacy recently

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.080 
watching the movie Tron Legacy recently
on<00:00:20.840> the<00:00:20.930> plane<00:00:21.200> I<00:00:21.560> was<00:00:22.040> watching<00:00:22.760> that<00:00:22.790> scene

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
on the plane I was watching that scene

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.610 
on the plane I was watching that scene
where<00:00:23.300> Sam<00:00:23.540> is<00:00:23.780> typing<00:00:24.110> on<00:00:24.200> a<00:00:24.230> virtual

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:24.620 
where Sam is typing on a virtual

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.920 
where Sam is typing on a virtual
keyboard<00:00:24.770> and<00:00:25.550> he<00:00:26.300> makes<00:00:26.450> it<00:00:26.570> look<00:00:26.690> very<00:00:26.720> easy

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
keyboard and he makes it look very easy

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.080 
keyboard and he makes it look very easy
and<00:00:27.260> natural<00:00:27.380> and<00:00:27.650> works<00:00:27.830> really<00:00:27.950> well<00:00:28.160> I<00:00:28.460> was

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
and natural and works really well I was

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.920 
and natural and works really well I was
very<00:00:29.210> impressed

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
very impressed

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.870 
very impressed
I've<00:00:30.320> tried<00:00:30.590> typing<00:00:30.980> on<00:00:31.190> virtual<00:00:31.490> keyboards

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
I've tried typing on virtual keyboards

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.990 
I've tried typing on virtual keyboards
before<00:00:32.710> particularly<00:00:33.710> on<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:34.250> person<00:00:34.879> who

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
before particularly on the person who

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.780 
before particularly on the person who
works<00:00:35.180> on<00:00:35.329> iPads<00:00:36.160> and<00:00:37.160> I'm<00:00:37.280> not<00:00:37.460> very<00:00:37.579> good<00:00:37.640> at

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
works on iPads and I'm not very good at

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.360 
works on iPads and I'm not very good at
it<00:00:38.050> I'm<00:00:39.050> much<00:00:39.290> better<00:00:39.530> with<00:00:39.620> physical

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
it I'm much better with physical

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.889 
it I'm much better with physical
keyboards<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:40.850> chemical<00:00:41.239> keyboards<00:00:41.690> the

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
keyboards and chemical keyboards the

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:43.870 
keyboards and chemical keyboards the
lotteries<00:00:42.470> are<00:00:42.530> quicker<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:42.950> better

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
lotteries are quicker the better

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.300 
lotteries are quicker the better
so<00:00:44.210> I<00:00:44.510> thought<00:00:44.870> I<00:00:44.899> would<00:00:45.110> do<00:00:45.680> some<00:00:45.860> experiments

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.310 
so I thought I would do some experiments

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.290 
so I thought I would do some experiments
and<00:00:46.430> see<00:00:46.520> if<00:00:46.610> I<00:00:46.700> can<00:00:46.850> create<00:00:47.090> a<00:00:47.270> virtual

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
and see if I can create a virtual

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.299 
and see if I can create a virtual
keyboard<00:00:47.780> like<00:00:48.079> the<00:00:48.200> one<00:00:48.320> Neutron<00:00:48.649> that<00:00:49.100> might

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
keyboard like the one Neutron that might

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.549 
keyboard like the one Neutron that might
work<00:00:49.760> better<00:00:50.120> than<00:00:50.540> once<00:00:50.989> I've<00:00:51.140> used<00:00:51.170> to<00:00:51.470> the

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
work better than once I've used to the

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.030 
work better than once I've used to the
past

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.100 

okay<00:00:56.040> so<00:00:56.100> let's<00:00:56.460> take<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.940> closer<00:00:57.300> look<00:00:57.600> at<00:00:57.900> the

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
okay so let's take a closer look at the

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.980 
okay so let's take a closer look at the
keyboard<00:00:58.500> itself<00:00:59.010> or<00:00:59.390> keyboards<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.540> guess<00:01:00.840> I

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:00.990 
keyboard itself or keyboards I guess I

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.390 
keyboard itself or keyboards I guess I
should<00:01:01.170> say<00:01:01.350> since<00:01:01.410> there<00:01:01.860> are<00:01:01.920> actually<00:01:02.190> two

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
should say since there are actually two

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.850 
should say since there are actually two
of<00:01:02.430> them<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:03.780> keyboard<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.350> split<00:01:04.710> between

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
of them the keyboard is split between

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.120 
of them the keyboard is split between
two<00:01:05.250> iPads<00:01:05.990> and<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.170> reason<00:01:07.410> I<00:01:07.500> did<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.740> is

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
two iPads and the reason I did that is

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.760 
two iPads and the reason I did that is
because<00:01:08.510> one<00:01:09.510> iPad<00:01:09.840> it's<00:01:10.080> not<00:01:10.260> large<00:01:10.470> enough

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
because one iPad it's not large enough

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.969 
because one iPad it's not large enough
to<00:01:10.800> accommodate<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.490> full-size<00:01:12.240> keyboard<00:01:12.979> it's

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
to accommodate a full-size keyboard it's

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.640 
to accommodate a full-size keyboard it's
all<00:01:14.190> written<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.729> web<00:01:15.090> technologies<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.020> HTML

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
all written in web technologies so HTML

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.790 
all written in web technologies so HTML
Javascript<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.310> CSS<00:01:17.540> so<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.570> can<00:01:19.050> switch<00:01:19.650> over

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
Javascript and CSS so I can switch over

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.370

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
request to keyboard HTML I can just pass

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.139 
request to keyboard HTML I can just pass
in<00:01:25.680> whether<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:25.979> want<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.430> right<00:01:26.640> or<00:01:26.910> the<00:01:27.030> left

order to get rid of the browser Chrome
and<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.509> make<00:01:36.660> it<00:01:36.780> look<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> little<00:01:37.110> slicker<00:01:37.440> if

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
and to make it look a little slicker if

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.800 
and to make it look a little slicker if
you're<00:01:38.610> seeing<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.850> difference<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.450> color

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
you're seeing a difference in color

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.389 
you're seeing a difference in color
between<00:01:39.899> the<00:01:40.229> two<00:01:40.410> keyboards<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:40.979> keyboard

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
between the two keyboards that keyboard

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.270 
between the two keyboards that keyboard
on<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.030> right<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.350> Retina<00:01:43.740> display<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.130> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
on the right is a Retina display and the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.340 
on the right is a Retina display and the
one<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.610> left<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:44.970> my<00:01:45.149> pad<00:01:45.390> too<00:01:45.660> so<00:01:45.990> they

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
one on the left is my pad too so they

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.150 
one on the left is my pad too so they
have<00:01:46.500> slightly<00:01:47.460> different<00:01:47.790> color<00:01:48.030> profiles

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
have slightly different color profiles

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.830 
have slightly different color profiles
I'm<00:01:50.160> sharing<00:01:50.520> events<00:01:50.850> between<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.210> two<00:01:51.540> sides

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
I'm sharing events between the two sides

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.219 
I'm sharing events between the two sides
of<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.110> keyboard<00:01:52.229> using<00:01:53.220> nodejs<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.600> socket

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
of the keyboard using nodejs and socket

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.190 
of the keyboard using nodejs and socket
IO<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.880> also<00:01:56.880> with<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.149> terminal<00:01:57.539> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
IO and also with the terminal the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.390 
IO and also with the terminal the
terminal<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.590> course<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.890> not<00:01:59.040> actually

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
terminal of course is not actually

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.080 
terminal of course is not actually
terminal<00:01:59.820> it's<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.900> an<00:02:01.530> HTML<00:02:01.950> text<00:02:02.430> area<00:02:02.670> so

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
terminal it's just an HTML text area so

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.910 
terminal it's just an HTML text area so
it's<00:02:03.810> all<00:02:03.900> written<00:02:04.110> with<00:02:04.200> web<00:02:04.350> technologies

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
it's all written with web technologies

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.250 
it's all written with web technologies
and<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.490> was<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> lot<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.909> fun<00:02:06.150> to<00:02:06.270> prototype<00:02:06.570> in

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
and it was a lot of fun to prototype in

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.930 
and it was a lot of fun to prototype in
fact<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.860> think<00:02:08.070> it<00:02:08.280> was<00:02:08.369> more<00:02:08.580> fun<00:02:08.790> to

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
fact I think it was more fun to

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.020 
fact I think it was more fun to
prototype<00:02:09.209> than<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.049> to<00:02:10.380> actually<00:02:10.709> use<00:02:11.030> but

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
prototype than it is to actually use but

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.910 
prototype than it is to actually use but
but<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:12.989> know<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.140> was<00:02:13.230> fun<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.500> build<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.890> I

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
but you know it was fun to build and I

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.920 
but you know it was fun to build and I
learned<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.160> few<00:02:14.190> things<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.820> that's<00:02:15.780> what

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
learned a few things and that's what

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.460 
learned a few things and that's what
it's<00:02:16.049> all<00:02:16.140> about

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.810 

okay<00:02:20.470> so<00:02:20.530> let's<00:02:20.830> give<00:02:20.980> this<00:02:21.100> virtual<00:02:21.490> keyboard

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
okay so let's give this virtual keyboard

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.910 
okay so let's give this virtual keyboard
a<00:02:21.880> try<00:02:22.090> first<00:02:23.080> of<00:02:23.230> all<00:02:23.320> I<00:02:23.350> can<00:02:23.500> type<00:02:23.680> pretty

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
a try first of all I can type pretty

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.920 
a try first of all I can type pretty
well<00:02:24.190> on<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.490> normal<00:02:24.850> keyboard<00:02:25.060> this<00:02:25.570> is<00:02:25.750> a

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
well on a normal keyboard this is a

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.040 
well on a normal keyboard this is a
Philco<00:02:26.320> magic<00:02:26.650> touch<00:02:26.830> -<00:02:27.270> with<00:02:28.270> MX<00:02:28.540> jerry<00:02:28.810> brown

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
Philco magic touch - with MX jerry brown

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.290 
Philco magic touch - with MX jerry brown
switches<00:02:29.320> if<00:02:29.590> you're<00:02:29.740> curious<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.370> it's<00:02:31.210> one

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
switches if you're curious and it's one

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:41.220 
switches if you're curious and it's one
of<00:02:31.390> my<00:02:31.450> favorites<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.080> I<00:02:32.260> can<00:02:32.410> type<00:02:32.560> on<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:40.230> so

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
of my favorites and I can type on it so

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.330 
of my favorites and I can type on it so
I'm<00:02:41.320> not<00:02:41.410> gonna<00:02:41.560> send<00:02:41.890> me<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.010> world<00:02:42.190> reference

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
I'm not gonna send me a world reference

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.130 
I'm not gonna send me a world reference
or<00:02:42.580> anything<00:02:42.730> but<00:02:42.970> I<00:02:43.210> can<00:02:43.450> type<00:02:43.630> further<00:02:43.840> wall

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
or anything but I can type further wall

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.900 
or anything but I can type further wall
so<00:02:44.620> let's<00:02:44.830> see<00:02:44.980> how<00:02:45.100> I<00:02:45.160> do<00:02:45.310> now<00:02:45.580> I<00:02:45.610> want<00:02:45.640> a

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
so let's see how I do now I want a

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:58.770 
so let's see how I do now I want a
virtual<00:02:46.240> keyboard<00:02:50.850> this<00:02:51.850> is<00:02:52.240> a<00:02:54.630> test<00:02:55.630> to<00:02:57.780> see

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
virtual keyboard this is a test to see

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:18.320 
virtual keyboard this is a test to see
how<00:02:59.440> well<00:03:05.490> type<00:03:06.490> on<00:03:06.880> a<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:12.060> virtual<00:03:17.190> keyboard

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
how well type on a the virtual keyboard

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:28.160 
how well type on a the virtual keyboard
almost<00:03:19.330> there<00:03:19.600> good<00:03:21.630> Animas<00:03:22.630> you<00:03:23.110> can<00:03:24.010> see<00:03:26.520> I'm

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
almost there good Animas you can see I'm

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:37.949 
almost there good Animas you can see I'm
not<00:03:29.550> I<00:03:30.550> am<00:03:31.060> not<00:03:31.480> very<00:03:33.990> good<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:37.540> there<00:03:37.840> you<00:03:37.930> have

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
not I am not very good so there you have

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.830 
not I am not very good so there you have
it<00:03:38.080> I<00:03:38.770> think<00:03:39.550> it's<00:03:39.700> safe<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.000> say<00:03:40.360> that<00:03:40.390> this<00:03:40.660> is

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
it I think it's safe to say that this is

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.960 
it I think it's safe to say that this is
pretty<00:03:41.050> much<00:03:41.260> a<00:03:41.320> failed<00:03:41.709> experiment

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.370 

okay<00:03:46.970> so<00:03:47.030> looked<00:03:47.450> at<00:03:47.540> I<00:03:47.570> find<00:03:47.810> about<00:03:47.870> virtual

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
okay so looked at I find about virtual

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.440 
okay so looked at I find about virtual
keyboards<00:03:48.890> during<00:03:49.190> this<00:03:49.280> experiment<00:03:49.700> other

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
keyboards during this experiment other

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.270 
keyboards during this experiment other
than<00:03:50.660> the<00:03:50.720> fact<00:03:50.900> that<00:03:51.050> I<00:03:51.350> don't<00:03:51.590> type<00:03:51.800> real<00:03:52.010> on

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
than the fact that I don't type real on

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.990 
than the fact that I don't type real on
them

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
them

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.490 
them
I<00:03:53.030> learned<00:03:53.570> that<00:03:53.780> having<00:03:53.990> the<00:03:54.170> full-size

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
I learned that having the full-size

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.920 
I learned that having the full-size
keyboard<00:03:54.740> is<00:03:55.070> enough<00:03:55.430> I<00:03:55.700> thought<00:03:56.210> that<00:03:56.510> having

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
keyboard is enough I thought that having

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.360 
keyboard is enough I thought that having
a<00:03:57.020> bigger<00:03:57.260> keyboard<00:03:57.560> than<00:03:57.860> what<00:03:58.010> you<00:03:58.130> go<00:03:58.250> on

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
a bigger keyboard than what you go on

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.090 
a bigger keyboard than what you go on
the<00:03:58.430> iPad<00:03:58.790> would<00:03:59.180> instantly<00:03:59.750> make<00:04:00.080> me<00:04:00.350> more

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
the iPad would instantly make me more

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.310 
the iPad would instantly make me more
accurate<00:04:01.550> and<00:04:01.850> more<00:04:02.360> productive<00:04:02.840> and<00:04:03.110> that

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
accurate and more productive and that

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.810 
accurate and more productive and that
was<00:04:03.500> not<00:04:03.770> really<00:04:04.130> the<00:04:04.280> case<00:04:04.430> so<00:04:04.580> I'm<00:04:04.640> a<00:04:04.730> little

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
was not really the case so I'm a little

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.880 
was not really the case so I'm a little
bit<00:04:05.030> better<00:04:05.180> on<00:04:05.300> this<00:04:05.450> keyboard<00:04:05.630> I<00:04:05.840> guess<00:04:06.020> than

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
bit better on this keyboard I guess than

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.770 
bit better on this keyboard I guess than
I<00:04:07.010> am<00:04:07.160> on<00:04:07.490> the<00:04:07.760> iPad<00:04:08.120> keyboard<00:04:08.330> but<00:04:08.660> not

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
I am on the iPad keyboard but not

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.890 
I am on the iPad keyboard but not
significantly<00:04:09.440> I<00:04:10.450> realized<00:04:11.450> that<00:04:11.720> when<00:04:11.870> I

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
significantly I realized that when I

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.990 
significantly I realized that when I
typed<00:04:12.140> on<00:04:12.230> a<00:04:12.260> physical<00:04:12.680> keyboard<00:04:13.000> I'm

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
typed on a physical keyboard I'm

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.300 
typed on a physical keyboard I'm
constantly<00:04:14.570> making<00:04:14.780> adjustments<00:04:15.050> and<00:04:15.830> so

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
constantly making adjustments and so

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.760 
constantly making adjustments and so
you're<00:04:17.270> not<00:04:17.360> aware<00:04:17.510> of<00:04:17.690> it<00:04:17.900> but<00:04:18.230> I<00:04:18.290> think<00:04:18.650> with

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770 
you're not aware of it but I think with

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.710 
you're not aware of it but I think with
every<00:04:19.040> keystroke<00:04:19.220> you're<00:04:19.820> positioning<00:04:20.600> your

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
every keystroke you're positioning your

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.740 
every keystroke you're positioning your
hands<00:04:21.520> sort<00:04:22.520> of<00:04:22.580> for<00:04:22.700> the<00:04:22.760> next<00:04:22.880> keystroke<00:04:23.480> and

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
hands sort of for the next keystroke and

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.390 
hands sort of for the next keystroke and
so<00:04:24.140> you're<00:04:24.290> constantly<00:04:24.530> able<00:04:25.070> to<00:04:25.220> make

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
so you're constantly able to make

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.640 
so you're constantly able to make
corrections<00:04:25.910> and<00:04:26.240> it<00:04:26.960> doesn't<00:04:27.260> slow<00:04:27.380> you<00:04:27.410> down

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
corrections and it doesn't slow you down

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.530 
corrections and it doesn't slow you down
I'm<00:04:27.800> not<00:04:27.950> even<00:04:28.130> aware<00:04:28.310> of<00:04:28.370> it<00:04:28.550> you<00:04:29.330> can<00:04:29.510> just

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
I'm not even aware of it you can just

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.690 
I'm not even aware of it you can just
it's<00:04:30.410> just<00:04:30.560> sort<00:04:30.830> of<00:04:30.920> part<00:04:31.280> of<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.400> typing

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
it's just sort of part of the typing

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.150 
it's just sort of part of the typing
experience<00:04:32.240> I<00:04:33.140> don't<00:04:33.650> have<00:04:33.830> that<00:04:34.010> on<00:04:34.130> a

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
experience I don't have that on a

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.580 
experience I don't have that on a
virtual<00:04:34.400> keyboard<00:04:34.670> and<00:04:35.090> so<00:04:35.360> I<00:04:35.750> think<00:04:36.170> I<00:04:36.440> can

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
virtual keyboard and so I think I can

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.710 
virtual keyboard and so I think I can
you<00:04:36.980> know<00:04:37.070> usually<00:04:37.400> take<00:04:37.670> a<00:04:37.940> few<00:04:38.090> letters<00:04:38.300> okay

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
you know usually take a few letters okay

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.650 
you know usually take a few letters okay
and<00:04:39.110> then<00:04:39.740> I'll<00:04:40.040> drift<00:04:40.430> and<00:04:40.820> the<00:04:41.270> next<00:04:41.570> thing

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
and then I'll drift and the next thing

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.420 
and then I'll drift and the next thing
you<00:04:41.720> know<00:04:41.810> completely<00:04:42.230> Ottoman<00:04:42.680> typing<00:04:43.010> just

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
you know completely Ottoman typing just

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.550 
you know completely Ottoman typing just
your<00:04:43.580> version<00:04:43.910> it's<00:04:44.060> very<00:04:44.270> frustrating<00:04:44.750> so

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
your version it's very frustrating so

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.620 
your version it's very frustrating so
I'm<00:04:45.920> not<00:04:46.010> really<00:04:46.160> sure<00:04:46.510> where<00:04:47.510> this

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
I'm not really sure where this

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.510 
I'm not really sure where this
technology<00:04:47.810> can<00:04:48.320> go<00:04:48.440> to<00:04:48.500> make<00:04:48.710> that<00:04:48.920> better<00:04:49.250> I

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
technology can go to make that better I

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.300 
technology can go to make that better I
tried<00:04:49.850> putting<00:04:50.530> little<00:04:51.530> screen<00:04:51.800> protectors

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
tried putting little screen protectors

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.090 
tried putting little screen protectors
on<00:04:52.940> the<00:04:53.180> the<00:04:53.570> J<00:04:53.840> and<00:04:54.170> the<00:04:54.230> app<00:04:54.380> keys<00:04:54.680> so<00:04:54.950> that<00:04:55.070> I

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
on the the J and the app keys so that I

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.820 
on the the J and the app keys so that I
would<00:04:55.430> be<00:04:55.550> able<00:04:55.610> to<00:04:55.700> find<00:04:56.000> the<00:04:56.360> home<00:04:56.540> road<00:04:56.830> but

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
would be able to find the home road but

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.590 
would be able to find the home road but
of<00:04:57.920> course<00:04:58.100> when<00:04:58.250> you<00:04:58.280> put<00:04:58.460> your<00:04:58.580> fingers<00:04:58.880> on<00:04:59.120> a

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
of course when you put your fingers on a

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.030 
of course when you put your fingers on a
virtual<00:04:59.780> keyboard<00:05:00.080> and<00:05:00.470> you<00:05:00.530> try<00:05:00.740> and<00:05:00.770> find

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
virtual keyboard and you try and find

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.380 
virtual keyboard and you try and find
all<00:05:01.280> real<00:05:01.430> you're<00:05:01.670> actually<00:05:01.970> registering

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
all real you're actually registering

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.770 
all real you're actually registering
keystrokes<00:05:02.950> so<00:05:03.950> then<00:05:04.130> I<00:05:04.160> tried<00:05:04.400> to

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
keystrokes so then I tried to

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.290 
keystrokes so then I tried to
synchronize<00:05:06.850> accelerometer<00:05:07.850> events<00:05:08.150> with

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
synchronize accelerometer events with

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.780 
synchronize accelerometer events with
keystrokes<00:05:08.840> so<00:05:09.110> the<00:05:09.440> theory<00:05:09.740> being<00:05:09.980> that<00:05:10.130> I

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
keystrokes so the theory being that I

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.000 
keystrokes so the theory being that I
could<00:05:11.120> place<00:05:11.360> my<00:05:11.600> hands<00:05:11.840> gently<00:05:12.170> on<00:05:12.560> the<00:05:12.770> glass

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
could place my hands gently on the glass

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.460 
could place my hands gently on the glass
and<00:05:13.250> I<00:05:13.340> could<00:05:13.520> find<00:05:13.760> the<00:05:14.150> home<00:05:14.300> row<00:05:14.510> and<00:05:14.810> it

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
and I could find the home row and it

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.560 
and I could find the home row and it
wouldn't<00:05:15.950> be<00:05:16.040> until<00:05:16.370> I<00:05:16.430> typed<00:05:17.120> with<00:05:17.330> some

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
wouldn't be until I typed with some

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.140 
wouldn't be until I typed with some
amount<00:05:17.780> of<00:05:17.870> force<00:05:18.200> that<00:05:19.010> keystrokes<00:05:20.000> would

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
amount of force that keystrokes would

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.630 
amount of force that keystrokes would
actually<00:05:20.450> register<00:05:21.160> that<00:05:22.160> didn't<00:05:22.520> work

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
actually register that didn't work

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.850 
actually register that didn't work
because<00:05:22.820> I<00:05:23.090> wasn't<00:05:23.420> able<00:05:23.570> to<00:05:24.020> synchronize

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
because I wasn't able to synchronize

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.400 
because I wasn't able to synchronize
accelerometer<00:05:25.700> events<00:05:26.000> and<00:05:26.270> touch<00:05:27.050> events

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
accelerometer events and touch events

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:27.780 
accelerometer events and touch events
which

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
which

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.630 
which
using<00:05:28.120> your<00:05:28.300> very<00:05:29.080> accurately<00:05:29.560> um<00:05:29.920> well<00:05:30.520> it's

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
using your very accurately um well it's

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.310 
using your very accurately um well it's
a<00:05:30.730> it's<00:05:30.760> impossible<00:05:31.300> and<00:05:31.390> I<00:05:31.420> did<00:05:31.690> kind<00:05:32.050> of<00:05:32.140> get

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
a it's impossible and I did kind of get

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.140 
a it's impossible and I did kind of get
it<00:05:32.410> working<00:05:32.680> but<00:05:32.980> none<00:05:33.670> of<00:05:33.700> the<00:05:33.880> weight<00:05:33.970> was

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
it working but none of the weight was

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.730 
it working but none of the weight was
quick<00:05:34.450> enough<00:05:34.690> and<00:05:34.810> fluid<00:05:35.140> enough<00:05:35.380> that<00:05:35.650> it

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
quick enough and fluid enough that it

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.770 
quick enough and fluid enough that it
felt<00:05:35.980> like<00:05:36.100> I<00:05:36.250> was<00:05:36.460> that<00:05:36.970> I<00:05:37.060> was<00:05:37.210> typing<00:05:37.630> on<00:05:37.720> the

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
felt like I was that I was typing on the

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.200 
felt like I was that I was typing on the
real<00:05:37.930> keyboard<00:05:38.730> so<00:05:39.730> I<00:05:39.760> feel<00:05:39.970> like<00:05:40.000> the

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
real keyboard so I feel like the

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.430 
real keyboard so I feel like the
improvements<00:05:40.750> that<00:05:40.810> have<00:05:40.870> to<00:05:41.050> be<00:05:41.080> made<00:05:41.290> to<00:05:41.320> a

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
improvements that have to be made to a

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.830 
improvements that have to be made to a
virtual<00:05:41.860> keyboard<00:05:42.070> our<00:05:42.820> changes<00:05:43.300> that<00:05:43.540> would

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
virtual keyboard our changes that would

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.510 
virtual keyboard our changes that would
keep<00:05:44.230> bringing<00:05:44.710> it<00:05:44.770> closer<00:05:45.040> to<00:05:45.310> an<00:05:45.370> actual

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
keep bringing it closer to an actual

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.460 
keep bringing it closer to an actual
physical<00:05:46.000> keyboard<00:05:46.330> now<00:05:46.930> the<00:05:46.990> advantage<00:05:47.380> of

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
physical keyboard now the advantage of

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:48.660 
physical keyboard now the advantage of
having<00:05:47.650> the<00:05:47.800> virtual<00:05:48.100> keyboard<00:05:48.220> is<00:05:48.520> that<00:05:48.610> you

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:48.670 
having the virtual keyboard is that you

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.310 
having the virtual keyboard is that you
just<00:05:48.760> have<00:05:48.880> this<00:05:49.060> black<00:05:49.330> piece<00:05:49.510> of<00:05:49.690> glass<00:05:49.930> that

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
just have this black piece of glass that

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.520 
just have this black piece of glass that
you<00:05:50.500> can<00:05:50.950> completely<00:05:51.490> customize<00:05:52.320> you<00:05:53.320> can

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
you can completely customize you can

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.890 
you can completely customize you can
change<00:05:53.890> it<00:05:54.100> to<00:05:54.490> work<00:05:55.450> with<00:05:55.570> a<00:05:55.630> specific

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
change it to work with a specific

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.140 
change it to work with a specific
application<00:05:56.710> or<00:05:56.860> you<00:05:57.220> can<00:05:57.370> use<00:05:57.520> it<00:05:57.670> for<00:05:57.880> a<00:05:57.940> game

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
application or you can use it for a game

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.520 
application or you can use it for a game
controls<00:05:58.540> or<00:05:58.750> something<00:05:58.990> like<00:05:59.080> that<00:05:59.140> and<00:05:59.470> just

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
controls or something like that and just

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.640 
controls or something like that and just
have<00:05:59.680> it<00:05:59.830> completely<00:06:00.520> customizable<00:06:01.360> and<00:06:01.650> I

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
have it completely customizable and I

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.530 
have it completely customizable and I
think<00:06:02.890> that<00:06:03.070> the<00:06:03.400> the<00:06:03.430> more<00:06:03.910> you<00:06:03.940> sort<00:06:04.300> of<00:06:04.360> add

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
think that the the more you sort of add
