00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.189
 hi hello girls how are you here I am 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.019
 again with you good this time 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.389
 I bring you an organ or an organizer 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.250
 super easy and is using a few 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.170
 ashtrays here the Japanese enough of 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.080
 these ashtrays that have these little eyes 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.880
 so I wanted to decorate them and use them to 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.189
 the brushes I hope you like this 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.590
 idea is super easy to do good are 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.429
 three as you can see they come with those 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.410
 holes I remove the lid at the time of 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.110
 paint here I'm going to use paint 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.630
 spray but I wanted to separate it the lid 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.610
 because maybe at the moment you do not 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.969
 you want to use it like that and you want to take out 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.000
 those holes and use the normal the 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:49.829
 normal container good I made him like 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.770
 five paint passes because paint 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.010
 with spray is not not easy thing either 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.050
 so you have to apply what's due 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.660
 and do not apply in excess because when 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.250
 apply too much paint spray 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.310
 it tends to run off 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.920
 drips and ugly marks remain, so I 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.250
 I had to paint from little to little go 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.130
 painting these containers and that's why 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.160
 take a lot of time I'm going to draw 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.130
 some lipsticks you can do the design 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.160
 that you like more to you can put for 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.729
 example this mark mack or you can put it 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.560
 this chanel logo can not be 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.250
 put the one you like most so you 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.910
 I wanted to make him what this is 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.910
 lipstick 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:13.150
 well now let's paint the containers 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.150
 You can decorate it your way 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:22.000
 I am using nail polishes 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.000
 because that's what I had 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.950
 I only draw four lipsticks already 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.470
 I was super tired of making the picture 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.450
 and now this so I only did 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.670
 four nothing more 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.170
 but if you want to fill the entire container 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.660
 you can do it so that it is also 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.470
 prettier but I that only you 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.130
 I wanted to do four nothing 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.130
 ah 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.030
 well now I will use what is 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:10.110
 silver enamel to continue giving it 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.110
 shape to the skin 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.240
 ok after using the silver color 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.790
 let's choose the colors we want 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.140
 for lipsticks can do all the 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.140
 tonalities that you want 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.710
 although I have them in the systems 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.910
 more chubby little boys so good you 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.910
 you can do it to your mood 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.290
 they can also make their legs there 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.840
 but also alongside Guardiola 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.440
 He wanted to do more and see if you like it if 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.440
 you can do 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:14.900
 ok let's combine the color and or combine 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:18.609
 with white and made another pitch for 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.609
 for the next life 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.230
 here 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:56.979
 good girls so on they are going to be 

00:04:54.309 --> 00:05:00.639
 to all the labials you are going to 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:03.159
 combine the colors so that you 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.619
 can create different tones for 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:07.239
 lipstick so it looks nice and does not 

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:09.870
 see all the same you can do 

00:05:07.239 --> 00:05:13.220
 different shades 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.220
 and more or less like that 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:19.360
 although it will take the other one we are going to do 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.360
 some skewers 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.590
 what there is with a lot of patience is 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.110
 draw the brushes myself to the last day of 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.450
 entrance into laziness because the truth 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.570
 I was already tired with more with the 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.490
 back and eyes because what I do 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:49.380
 more effort 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.940
 Well, there goes my memory and good 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.690
 I had to go down a bit because if I was not going 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:56.880
 to take a lot of good the hairs the 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.040
 clear systems since I did not have enamel 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.550
 brown so good I had to combine 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.800
 several tones to create it 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.420
 and good so on we are going to do 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.060
 the brushes 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.820
 more or less already have an idea like me 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.310
 I did in the pictures video good 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.380
 more or less like this they can do almost the same 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.300
 although here it's a bit complicated since 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.210
 If the glaze has dried a bit 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.630
 faster and you can not sometimes manage 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.630
 very good 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:33.350
 ok it ends there and good lets it dry 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:36.260
 nothing more and you give him some finishing touches 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:38.360
 and nothing just lets it dry and good 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.130
 almost user that would be all as they can 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.600
 see is a super easy craft of 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.700
 do so I wanted to share them with 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.960
 you guys so we see you girls up 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:50.140
 the next I hope you liked it 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.140
 we see you girls take care much more bye
