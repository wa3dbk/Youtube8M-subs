00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 so my dear friends warmly 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.790
 welcome to a new edition of my 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.170
 player reviews a long time ago 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.760
 but nonetheless, Mann wanted to join 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.950
 a blank sheet of mine 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.380
 opinion to begin because the love with 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.389
 ski except fl championship is mine 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.949
 opinion after enormous against the 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.230
 other players from the team from these 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.650
 for example, a gardener 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.359
 for example, a bad one and have 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.949
 also a photo or something else 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.109
 he simply goes under enormous rows of 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.550
 evaluate the forth so the prices you see 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.260
 about down naturally it must in 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.809
 playstation 3 playstation 4 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.309
 And yes, it is just a little dependent price 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.530
 and how many probably get up from him 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.399
 the transfermarkt are on xbox 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.170
 or playstation us probably 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.910
 Huge numbers on the pc you can see him in 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.320
 not at all but I have the 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.600
 prices now once roughly entered the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.420
 Price is definitely 50 to 120 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.950
 kg each comes down to something like that 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.649
 draws these mothers from the 3 stars 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.879
 skills is okay you can work with 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.649
 is not the nonplusultra what 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.629
 works here constantly awake on foot 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.219
 ever very cool because the sat too 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.050
 really to be here but not always 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.329
 all players so what you see the most 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.040
 in the clips he has these packaged 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.470
 kipping longchance and that's easy 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.330
 enormously rare fifa 15 that have all 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.979
 very few players and that makes him 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.250
 just so cool it's so much fun 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.689
 from the second row 25 meters easy 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.430
 to draw good times with him on it 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.350
 and he just can do it 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.700
 this always close to a goal whether 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.130
 with left to right in the long or 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.380
 short corner you fall and that's what 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.640
 is just so great with the cool makes 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.189
 to do a long shot that makes him too 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.600
 so enormously dangerous are his examples 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.040
 also perfectly well there you can 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.780
 do not complain that comes of course 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.270
 to carry by being in game values 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.060
 Below you can see six better values ​​of 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.430
 the plus the player trades player rich 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.560
 Technology shows you because its dribbling 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.090
 very cool watching the role of the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.020
 Easy to upgrade 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.070
 just great we come now to the conclusion 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.450
 be on the pros and cons with it 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.380
 Of course, a few more points noted 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.549
 have it all a bit more 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.619
 easier to do if he is too 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.000
 So it is really worthwhile 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.290
 tempo plus good start one may now 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.159
 no pace book or the like 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.130
 expect 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.840
 it's really just that he is 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.850
 solid it runs relatively fast to good 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.770
 but that was not faster 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.819
 So 81 sat quite well on what 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.590
 his card is on it 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.819
 strong balance and agility that 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.620
 Of course, going to be there 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.390
 to let 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.799
 These are the things that are really huge 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.060
 stand out where you think so hey 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.540
 okay with that you probably can 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.040
 simply by hand from the bedroom too 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.200
 a good point bomb shot 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.040
 no question so very cool again 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.299
 his shot can be implemented and then what 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.470
 of course, still with those in game values 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.970
 Harmonizing is a very simple one 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.680
 rippling tingling is not with him 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.060
 heavy with role and the role 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.920
 roulette and the simple over boost 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.030
 You can do a lot and accordingly 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.590
 work effectively 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.209
 among other things, is a good preparer 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.069
 which can evaluate a suitable 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.329
 his survey demanded him 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.530
 works as already said as 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.970
 right wing player as well as 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.769
 right midfielder always comes 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.420
 on the play style land so on the contra 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.670
 so that's two points not even 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.349
 so little weigh once in a while 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.599
 inconspicuous there are simply players there 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.129
 goes completely under and there comes 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.950
 next point to carry with you 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.870
 Shares very low stirrers he is not 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.489
 so strong and you just notice that 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.349
 sometimes but nevertheless 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.079
 deserves relatively good ratings that is 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.390
 in my opinion 9,1 if you consider 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.769
 how he plays and how much the nice one 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.690
 sir ultimately cost that is a 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.030
 Silver player with solid values ​​of 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.250
 some he can is easy to link 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.750
 and it just makes it fun with him 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.090
 because every time you play one 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.480
 job makes and you know that it is scarce 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.299
 becomes 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.419
 which is then even if not in there 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.370
 you are happy and so in the sixteenth 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:34.549
 that is partly very very cold 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.989
 at the conclusion and very dry that is 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.609
 simply an enrichment for you 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.019
 team if you can play with him i 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.310
 I wish them a nice day and 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.870
 have fun with the map finds you 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.379
 We'll see each other next time 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.379
 yours again
