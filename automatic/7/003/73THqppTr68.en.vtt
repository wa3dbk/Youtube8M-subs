00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.170
 the motor and the machine with the key in the general 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.120
 stopped running 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.300
 stalled stopped sometimes 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.830
 grabbed your no response 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:30.359
 on gas she did that diagnosis 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:33.140
 errors were on the holland g40 sensor from 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:38.610
 crankshaft position sensor 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:42.300
 Well, as we already had one 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:47.520
 patient that there was a problem with charging 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.590
 decided to check the key very top 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.120
 dead point for the cylinder but the length 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.760
 screwdriver to customize where we look 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.620
 here is this label 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.430
 stopped here you can see that three teeth 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.700
 well 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.740
 pulley on the crankshaft too 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.690
 stopped somewhere 3 4 teeth yes he has 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.450
 Well, removed the gear than such here 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:19.770
 picture 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.520
 the keyway is broken, that is, well, I 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.900
 one edge 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:33.780
 one such puzzle is broken away from someone 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:37.710
 Well, here it is the star itself 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:42.240
 you can pop but the keys on the figs we 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:48.210
 there is no shorter such a nonsense knee like 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:51.119
 it would be necessary to change the sprocket is easier 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.570
 change options now 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.369
 offered to the owner 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:00.630
 Here such nonsense can be at 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:07.920
 negligence replacing the garage we are likely 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:11.790
 do not tighten the fucking bolt how to gear 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.370
 yes badly tightened mlyat forgot to tighten 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.540
 or something to change and here is such a canoe 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:23.400
 and turned the pancakes machine after the block 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:28.440
 so be careful in garages 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.959
 Uncle Vasi mlya sometimes you shouldnâ€™t do 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.040
 trusted people 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.090
 so as not to fall later 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.629
 to another motor or major repair general 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.629
 Good luck to everyone on the road
