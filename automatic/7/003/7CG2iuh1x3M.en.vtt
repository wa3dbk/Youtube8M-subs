Spinosaurus<00:00:36.510> was<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.380> film<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.920> we<00:00:38.010> don't

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
Spinosaurus was in the film and we don't

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.850 
Spinosaurus was in the film and we don't
know<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.460> it's<00:00:38.790> not<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.360> film<00:00:39.600> but<00:00:40.320> if<00:00:40.649> it

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
know that it's not in the film but if it

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.410 
know that it's not in the film but if it
were<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> website<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.910> stuff<00:00:42.210> like<00:00:42.360> that

were on the website and stuff like that

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.420 
were on the website and stuff like that
it<00:00:42.840> would<00:00:42.960> definitely<00:00:43.170> be<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.829> list<00:00:43.890> but

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
it would definitely be on that list but

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.540 
it would definitely be on that list but
since<00:00:44.760> its<00:00:44.969> not<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.210> decided<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.930> leave<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.260> off

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.819 
since its not I decided to leave it off
but<00:00:47.550> if<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.300> were<00:00:48.750> like<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.110> said<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.710> would

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
but if it were like I said it would

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.459 
but if it were like I said it would
definitely<00:00:50.039> be<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:50.820> list<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.719> anyway<00:00:52.140> now

just looks so so intimidating in the

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.340 
just looks so so intimidating in the
trailers<00:04:11.580> probably<00:04:12.239> the<00:04:12.450> second<00:04:13.020> scariest

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350

dinosaur<00:04:14.160> that<00:04:14.850> we've<00:04:15.060> ever<00:04:15.180> seen<00:04:15.480> well<00:04:15.780> it<00:04:15.959> is

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
dinosaur that we've ever seen well it is

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.750 
dinosaur that we've ever seen well it is
a<00:04:16.109> scary<00:04:16.530> status<00:04:16.919> or<00:04:17.070> that<00:04:17.220> we've<00:04:17.370> ever<00:04:17.549> seen

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
a scary status or that we've ever seen

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.360 
a scary status or that we've ever seen
but<00:04:18.359> in<00:04:18.450> my<00:04:18.480> opinion<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:19.169> pterosaurs<00:04:19.680> just<00:04:19.980> a

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
but in my opinion the pterosaurs just a

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.450 
but in my opinion the pterosaurs just a
pterosaur<00:04:21.330> the<00:04:21.510> dimorphodon<00:04:21.840> is<00:04:22.460> slightly

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
pterosaur the dimorphodon is slightly

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.070 
pterosaur the dimorphodon is slightly
scarier<00:04:24.060> although<00:04:24.479> it's<00:04:24.630> not<00:04:24.720> a<00:04:24.840> dinosaur

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
scarier although it's not a dinosaur

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.870 
scarier although it's not a dinosaur
it's<00:04:25.530> a<00:04:25.650> pterosaur

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
it's a pterosaur

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.080 
it's a pterosaur
but<00:04:27.810> yeah<00:04:28.140> the<00:04:28.500> indominus<00:04:28.950> rex<00:04:29.190> well<00:04:29.640> it's<00:04:29.910> got

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
but yeah the indominus rex well it's got

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.200 
but yeah the indominus rex well it's got
that<00:04:30.240> red<00:04:30.540> eye<00:04:30.570> its<00:04:31.260> large<00:04:32.040> teeth<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.880> job

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
that red eye its large teeth the job

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.770 
that red eye its large teeth the job
that<00:04:33.450> unhinges<00:04:34.140> and<00:04:34.380> can<00:04:35.370> just<00:04:35.610> go<00:04:35.790> at<00:04:36.150> 90
