and<00:01:02.449> as<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.570> earlier<00:01:03.750> mentioned<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.500> had<00:01:04.620> this

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
and as I earlier mentioned I had this

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.860 
and as I earlier mentioned I had this
extra<00:01:05.190> coaxial<00:01:05.670> cable<00:01:06.030> thinking<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.690> I<00:01:06.720> was

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
extra coaxial cable thinking that I was

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.190 
extra coaxial cable thinking that I was
gonna<00:01:06.990> need<00:01:07.080> more<00:01:07.700> length<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:09.180> I'm<00:01:09.750> finding

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
gonna need more length but I'm finding

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.859 
gonna need more length but I'm finding
now<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.650> what<00:01:10.890> Moe<00:01:11.159> who<00:01:11.340> provides<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.540> more

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
now that what Moe who provides is more

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.100 
now that what Moe who provides is more
than<00:01:13.020> enough<00:01:13.170> at<00:01:13.500> 16<00:01:13.920> feet<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:15.030> can<00:01:15.479> try<00:01:15.719> a<00:01:15.750> lot

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
than enough at 16 feet I can try a lot

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.990 
than enough at 16 feet I can try a lot
of<00:01:16.140> different<00:01:16.259> angles<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.920> positions<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.520> my

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
of different angles and positions in my

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.770 
of different angles and positions in my
house<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> next<00:01:19.350> step<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.920> for<00:01:20.579> me<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:21.119> hook

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
house so the next step is for me to hook

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.429 
house so the next step is for me to hook
this<00:01:22.049> up<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.829> antenna<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.490> then<00:01:24.439> hook

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
this up to the antenna and then hook

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.499 
this up to the antenna and then hook
this<00:01:25.649> up<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:26.159> my<00:01:26.280> TV<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.880> can<00:01:27.000> see<00:01:27.149> says<00:01:27.329> two

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
this up to my TV you can see says two

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.200 
this up to my TV you can see says two
TVs<00:01:27.899> so<00:01:28.109> it's<00:01:28.369> there's<00:01:29.369> no<00:01:29.549> confusion<00:01:30.030> there

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
TVs so it's there's no confusion there

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.999 
TVs so it's there's no confusion there
and<00:01:30.390> finally<00:01:31.140> I'll<00:01:31.259> need<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.500> plug<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.890> my

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
and finally I'll need to plug in my

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.660 
and finally I'll need to plug in my
amplifier<00:01:35.960> okay<00:01:36.990> because<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:37.859> realized<00:01:38.399> it<00:01:38.579> a

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
amplifier okay because I realized it a

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.069 
amplifier okay because I realized it a
little<00:01:38.820> bit<00:01:38.969> easier<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.299> first<00:01:39.600> hook<00:01:39.840> up<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
little bit easier to first hook up the

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.959 
little bit easier to first hook up the
amplifier<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.859> then<00:01:41.039> hook<00:01:41.310> up<00:01:41.399> the<00:01:41.520> coaxial

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
amplifier and then hook up the coaxial

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.060 
amplifier and then hook up the coaxial
cable<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.570> amplifier<00:01:43.109> this<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.920> how<00:01:44.039> I

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
cable to the amplifier this is how I

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.950 
cable to the amplifier this is how I
started<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.939> can<00:01:45.090> see<00:01:45.240> here<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.570> got<00:01:45.780> the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
started you can see here that I got the

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.779 
started you can see here that I got the
coaxial<00:01:46.649> cable<00:01:46.950> going<00:01:47.130> into<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.369> back<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
coaxial cable going into the back of the

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.749 
coaxial cable going into the back of the
TV<00:01:48.109> nice<00:01:49.109> and<00:01:49.350> tight<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.560> there's<00:01:49.920> no<00:01:50.100> issues

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
TV nice and tight so there's no issues

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.660 
TV nice and tight so there's no issues
later<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.179> and<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.439> have<00:01:52.679> my<00:01:52.920> amplifier<00:01:53.189> hanging

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
later on and I have my amplifier hanging

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.959 
later on and I have my amplifier hanging
down<00:01:53.789> here<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.439> can<00:01:55.590> also<00:01:55.740> see<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.999> I

plugged in the mo who ultimately will

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.390 
plugged in the mo who ultimately will
see<00:02:47.459> what<00:02:47.579> happens<00:02:47.910> here<00:02:48.890> okay<00:02:49.890> right<00:02:50.099> off<00:02:50.250> the

pixelated for the CW okay so now I want

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.270 
pixelated for the CW okay so now I want
to<00:02:56.910> proceed<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.390> optimize<00:02:57.959> my<00:02:58.290> channels<00:02:59.099> in<00:02:59.220> my

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
to proceed to optimize my channels in my

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.949 
to proceed to optimize my channels in my
signal<00:02:59.609> my<00:02:59.819> TV's<00:03:00.150> come<00:03:00.329> up<00:03:00.450> with<00:03:00.569> a<00:03:00.629> number<00:03:00.810> of

signal my TV's come up with a number of

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.270 
signal my TV's come up with a number of
different<00:03:01.290> channels<00:03:01.590> that<00:03:01.620> can<00:03:01.709> receive<00:03:02.069> in

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
different channels that can receive in

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.150 
different channels that can receive in
HD<00:03:02.879> digital<00:03:03.120> my<00:03:04.049> next<00:03:04.319> step<00:03:04.470> is<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.590> optimize

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
HD digital my next step is to optimize

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.000 
HD digital my next step is to optimize
the<00:03:05.430> placement<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:06.060> my<00:03:06.390> mo<00:03:06.750> whoo<00:03:07.010> ultimately

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
the placement of my mo whoo ultimately

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.520 
the placement of my mo whoo ultimately
I'm<00:03:08.790> gonna<00:03:09.030> use<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.390> signal<00:03:09.780> meter<00:03:09.989> on<00:03:10.290> my

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
I'm gonna use the signal meter on my

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.869 
I'm gonna use the signal meter on my
television<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.099> again<00:03:11.340> all<00:03:11.459> televisions

will<00:03:11.970> be<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.060> little<00:03:12.239> bit<00:03:12.329> different<00:03:12.690> but

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
will be a little bit different but

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.020 
will be a little bit different but
normally<00:03:13.379> will<00:03:13.470> hang<00:03:13.829> me<00:03:14.069> tur<00:03:14.129> and<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:14.910> can

here<00:03:35.669> on<00:03:35.849> ABC<00:03:37.880> so<00:03:38.880> this<00:03:39.030> looks<00:03:39.239> pretty<00:03:39.299> good

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
here on ABC so this looks pretty good

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.729 
here on ABC so this looks pretty good
I'm<00:03:39.780> going<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:39.959> be<00:03:40.019> pretty<00:03:40.169> set<00:03:40.380> up<00:03:40.500> for<00:03:40.650> the

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
I'm going to be pretty set up for the

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.620 
I'm going to be pretty set up for the
Superbowl<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.220> believe<00:03:41.549> and<00:03:41.819> as<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:42.359> can<00:03:42.480> see

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
Superbowl I believe and as you can see

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.000 
Superbowl I believe and as you can see
my<00:03:42.750> antenna<00:03:42.989> is<00:03:43.109> actually<00:03:43.349> across<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.859> room

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
my antenna is actually across the room

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.129 
my antenna is actually across the room
so<00:03:44.099> I'm<00:03:44.160> gonna<00:03:44.250> run<00:03:44.400> some<00:03:44.609> cable<00:03:44.819> up<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:45.870> round

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
so I'm gonna run some cable up and round

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.440 
so I'm gonna run some cable up and round
so<00:03:46.440> that<00:03:46.590> it<00:03:46.680> looks<00:03:46.859> nice<00:03:47.069> but<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:48.359> know<00:03:48.389> I

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
so that it looks nice but you know I

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.970 
so that it looks nice but you know I
didn't<00:03:48.630> mention<00:03:48.750> it<00:03:48.959> earlier<00:03:48.989> but<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.560> suggest

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
didn't mention it earlier but I suggest

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.860 
didn't mention it earlier but I suggest
first<00:03:50.519> really<00:03:50.940> getting<00:03:51.239> a<00:03:51.299> connection<00:03:51.569> all

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
first really getting a connection all

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.479 
first really getting a connection all
set<00:03:52.079> up<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.319> then<00:03:52.380> make<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:52.620> look<00:03:52.739> pretty<00:03:53.040> next

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
set up and then make it look pretty next

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.940 
set up and then make it look pretty next
because<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.810> because<00:03:55.319> if<00:03:55.440> you<00:03:55.530> try<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:55.739> work

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
because the because if you try to work

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.740 
because the because if you try to work
on<00:03:56.160> aesthetics<00:03:56.669> too<00:03:56.849> early<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:57.660> know

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
on aesthetics too early you know

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.949 
on aesthetics too early you know
spending<00:03:58.049> a<00:03:58.139> lot<00:03:58.290> of<00:03:58.319> time<00:03:58.410> setting<00:03:59.370> up<00:03:59.959> before

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
spending a lot of time setting up before

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.270 
spending a lot of time setting up before
you<00:04:01.079> know<00:04:01.290> if<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.799> antenna<00:04:02.069> is<00:04:02.220> okay<00:04:03.060> from<00:04:03.359> box

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
you know if the antenna is okay from box

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.479 
you know if the antenna is okay from box
to<00:04:05.540> installation<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:07.590> mo<00:04:07.769> who<00:04:08.010> ultimately

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
to installation the mo who ultimately
