 no problems with that 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.650
 I've never had it 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.229
 because my voice is heavy 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:34.840
 roots and I'm doing some hairstyle 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.840

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.490
 the outside 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.010
 not back 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.010
 so all this we need to sprinkle varnish 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.480

 In principle, the hairstyle is already very beautiful and 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:39.310
 very impressive it looks like 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.000
 you can say the first option is one of 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.670
 options 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.530

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.230
 bouffant 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.290

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:24.620
 fasten 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:24.620

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.560
 call dates tail 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.430
 so make it a little bit like that 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.860
 long not like a regular pigtail 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:01.300
 ordinary spikelet 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.300

 and 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.390
 we will make our pigtail 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:48.400
 more voluminous 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.400

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:06.370
