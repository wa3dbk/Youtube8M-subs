think<00:01:51.659> he<00:01:51.930> was<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.170> guy<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.320> had<00:01:52.590> happened

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
think he was the guy that had happened

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.560 
think he was the guy that had happened
to<00:01:53.159> because<00:01:53.700> he<00:01:53.820> ended<00:01:54.000> up<00:01:54.119> losing<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.479> fight

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
to because he ended up losing that fight

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.120 
to because he ended up losing that fight
and<00:01:54.840> getting<00:01:55.079> roughed<00:01:55.259> up<00:01:55.409> by<00:01:55.590> somebody<00:01:55.890> that

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
and getting roughed up by somebody that

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.819 
and getting roughed up by somebody that
was<00:01:56.340> starving<00:01:56.759> for<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.939> chance<00:01:57.149> at<00:01:57.420> him<00:01:57.570> who<00:01:58.229> was

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
was starving for a chance at him who was

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.620 
was starving for a chance at him who was
more<00:01:59.009> disciplined<00:01:59.520> at<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.700> time<00:01:59.909> all<00:02:00.390> I'm

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
more disciplined at the time all I'm

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.630 
more disciplined at the time all I'm
saying<00:02:00.899> is<00:02:01.079> is<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.290> gamesmanship<00:02:02.159> always

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
saying is is that gamesmanship always

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.639 
saying is is that gamesmanship always
takes<00:02:02.880> place<00:02:03.149> but<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.020> end<00:02:04.200> here's<00:02:04.500> what

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649
