00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
and it's a lot to think about sometimes

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.149 
and it's a lot to think about sometimes
but<00:02:04.509> you<00:02:04.689> know<00:02:04.750> when<00:02:05.170> it<00:02:05.289> is<00:02:05.439> I<00:02:05.619> called<00:02:05.890> my<00:02:05.979> mom

at<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:15.970> same<00:02:16.150> time<00:02:16.480> think<00:02:17.470> about<00:02:17.560> where<00:02:17.890> I

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
at the same time think about where I

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.039 
at the same time think about where I
could<00:02:18.010> be<00:02:18.400> I'm<00:02:19.239> thinking<00:02:19.299> about<00:02:19.599> what<00:02:19.840> could

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
could be I'm thinking about what could

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.080 
could be I'm thinking about what could
have<00:02:20.140> come<00:02:20.290> out<00:02:20.319> of<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.620> accident<00:02:21.069> you<00:02:21.970> know

have come out of the accident you know
it<00:02:22.269> makes<00:02:22.690> it<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.870> little<00:02:22.959> bit<00:02:23.110> easier<00:02:30.060> all<00:02:31.060> your

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
it makes it a little bit easier all your

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.759 
it makes it a little bit easier all your
players<00:02:31.510> are<00:02:31.750> like<00:02:31.870> your<00:02:32.110> children<00:02:32.140> they're
