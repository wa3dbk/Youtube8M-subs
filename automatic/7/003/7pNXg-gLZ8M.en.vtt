00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
all right so me and crazy bougie here

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.919 
all right so me and crazy bougie here
I'm<00:00:02.610> putting<00:00:02.850> an<00:00:02.939> amplifier<00:00:03.360> inside<00:00:03.720> of<00:00:03.810> his

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
I'm putting an amplifier inside of his

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.160 
I'm putting an amplifier inside of his
freaking<00:00:04.290> uplander<00:00:04.830> and<00:00:05.690> so<00:00:06.690> far<00:00:06.899> we've<00:00:07.049> made

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
freaking uplander and so far we've made

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.990 
freaking uplander and so far we've made
this<00:00:07.350> really<00:00:07.589> nice<00:00:07.710> panel<00:00:08.130> back<00:00:08.280> here<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.820> kind

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
this really nice panel back here to kind

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.940 
this really nice panel back here to kind
of<00:00:09.059> mount<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.630> amplifier<00:00:10.170> behind<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.800> wheel

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
of mount the amplifier behind the wheel

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.089 
of mount the amplifier behind the wheel
well<00:00:11.190> cover<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:12.230> does<00:00:13.230> kind<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.650> we<00:00:13.769> got<00:00:13.889> so

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
well cover and does kind of we got so

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.939 
well cover and does kind of we got so
far<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.639> run<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.240> 1<00:00:15.389> amp<00:00:15.599> there<00:00:15.900> Andrews<00:00:16.859> not

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
far to run the 1 amp there Andrews not

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.230 
far to run the 1 amp there Andrews not
too<00:00:17.130> sure<00:00:17.340> we're<00:00:17.550> gonna<00:00:17.640> on<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.820> other<00:00:17.970> amp

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
too sure we're gonna on the other amp

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.490 
too sure we're gonna on the other amp
yet<00:00:18.449> but<00:00:18.600> he<00:00:18.690> was<00:00:18.810> thinking<00:00:19.080> somewhere<00:00:19.320> up

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
yet but he was thinking somewhere up

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.109 
yet but he was thinking somewhere up
along<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:19.890> line<00:00:20.130> somewhere<00:00:20.490> around<00:00:20.670> here

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
along this line somewhere around here

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.500 
along this line somewhere around here
yeah<00:00:21.480> somewhere<00:00:22.350> around<00:00:22.470> there<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.100> then

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
yeah somewhere around there and then

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.000 
yeah somewhere around there and then
we'll<00:00:24.510> take<00:00:24.660> his<00:00:24.930> power<00:00:25.109> cell<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.650> he's<00:00:25.800> got

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
we'll take his power cell that he's got

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.390 
we'll take his power cell that he's got
over<00:00:26.310> here<00:00:26.720> this<00:00:27.720> kind<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.019> helps<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:29.279> know

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
over here this kind of helps you know

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.250 
over here this kind of helps you know
not<00:00:29.880> draw<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.420> much<00:00:30.570> power<00:00:30.840> away<00:00:31.019> from<00:00:31.050> the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
not draw so much power away from the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.889 
not draw so much power away from the
factory<00:00:31.710> system<00:00:32.009> as<00:00:32.430> some<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.420> guys<00:00:33.570> might

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
factory system as some of you guys might

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.100 
factory system as some of you guys might
know<00:00:33.930> it's<00:00:34.620> kinetic<00:00:34.980> power<00:00:35.309> saw<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.840> think

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
know it's kinetic power saw and I think

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.450 
know it's kinetic power saw and I think
he<00:00:37.230> was<00:00:37.350> thinking<00:00:37.380> about<00:00:37.649> put<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.040> right<00:00:38.160> about

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
he was thinking about put it right about

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.940 
he was thinking about put it right about
here<00:00:38.690> yeah<00:00:39.690> pretty<00:00:39.930> sure<00:00:40.079> somewhere<00:00:40.829> around

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
here yeah pretty sure somewhere around

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.450 
here yeah pretty sure somewhere around
there<00:00:41.899> and<00:00:42.899> then<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.590> 4<00:00:43.800> channel<00:00:44.190> will<00:00:44.309> go

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
there and then the the 4 channel will go

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.600 
there and then the the 4 channel will go
here<00:00:44.820> alright<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.960> then<00:00:46.590> we'll<00:00:46.800> put<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.100> mono

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
here alright and then we'll put the mono

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.459 
here alright and then we'll put the mono
block<00:00:47.850> somewhere<00:00:48.360> up<00:00:48.480> above<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.870> right<00:00:48.989> right

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
block somewhere up above it right right

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.650 
block somewhere up above it right right
around<00:00:49.680> there<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:49.950> area<00:00:50.460> there<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.510> gives

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
around there that area there and gives

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.170 
around there that area there and gives
it<00:00:51.780> enough<00:00:51.989> room<00:00:52.170> for<00:00:52.199> everything<00:00:53.090> so<00:00:54.090> that's

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
it enough room for everything so that's

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.580 
it enough room for everything so that's
what<00:00:54.390> kind<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.600> programs<00:00:54.899> we<00:00:54.960> got<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.230> far<00:00:55.440> got

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
what kind of programs we got so far got

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.410 
what kind of programs we got so far got
the<00:00:55.680> thing<00:00:55.829> ripped<00:00:56.010> apart<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:57.120> we<00:00:57.180> got<00:00:57.329> our

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
the thing ripped apart and we got our

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.330 
the thing ripped apart and we got our
buddy<00:00:57.600> here<00:00:57.809> running<00:00:58.020> some<00:00:58.260> RCA<00:00:58.620> cables<00:00:59.190> we

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
buddy here running some RCA cables we

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.799 
buddy here running some RCA cables we
got<00:00:59.489> our<00:00:59.579> 4<00:00:59.789> gauge<00:01:00.000> going<00:01:00.270> up<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.510> our<00:01:00.600> Power

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
got our 4 gauge going up to our Power

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.900 
got our 4 gauge going up to our Power
Cell<00:01:01.140> yes<00:01:01.440> we<00:01:02.309> probably<00:01:02.520> could<00:01:02.789> have<00:01:02.850> done

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
Cell yes we probably could have done

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.230 
Cell yes we probably could have done
zero<00:01:03.090> gauge<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:04.110> again<00:01:04.890> small<00:01:05.549> runs<00:01:05.820> from<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
zero gauge but again small runs from the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.120 
zero gauge but again small runs from the
power<00:01:06.420> cell<00:01:06.780> back<00:01:06.990> there<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.470> two<00:01:07.619> amps<00:01:08.040> so

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
power cell back there to the two amps so

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.120 
power cell back there to the two amps so
in<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.670> future<00:01:08.970> he<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.240> upgrade<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:10.130> he's

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
in the future he can upgrade that he's

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.899 
in the future he can upgrade that he's
got<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.939> 419<00:01:12.689> d<00:01:12.990> DX<00:01:13.290> 419<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.400> -<00:01:14.580> but

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
got the the 419 d DX 419 in the - but

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.600 
got the the 419 d DX 419 in the - but

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
we're just going to jam that in there

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.770 
we're just going to jam that in there
may<00:01:56.130> not<00:01:56.490> make<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.700> look<00:01:56.909> nice<00:01:57.119> at<00:01:57.360> all<00:01:57.450> right

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
may not make it look nice at all right

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.389 
may not make it look nice at all right
now<00:01:58.049> it's<00:01:58.439> gonna<00:01:58.560> be<00:01:58.649> really<00:01:58.860> ugly<00:01:59.040> looking

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
now it's gonna be really ugly looking

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.160 
now it's gonna be really ugly looking
anything<00:01:59.759> we're<00:02:00.420> just<00:02:00.540> going<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.750> put<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:00.990> in

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
anything we're just going to put it in

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.620 
anything we're just going to put it in
the<00:02:01.320> car<00:02:01.560> like<00:02:01.799> this

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
the car like this

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.929 
the car like this
and<00:02:02.990> then<00:02:03.200> it'll<00:02:03.380> work<00:02:03.650> yeah<00:02:03.979> real<00:02:04.460> all<00:02:04.909> right

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
and then it'll work yeah real all right

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.469 
and then it'll work yeah real all right
so<00:02:05.270> I<00:02:05.299> got<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:05.740> amplifier<00:02:07.000> rack<00:02:08.000> I<00:02:08.030> guess<00:02:08.360> you

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
so I got the amplifier rack I guess you

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.600 
so I got the amplifier rack I guess you
could<00:02:08.660> say<00:02:08.979> mounted<00:02:09.979> there<00:02:10.160> at<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.399> three

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
could say mounted there at the three

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.360 
could say mounted there at the three
screws<00:02:10.970> into<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.690> fender<00:02:12.200> well<00:02:12.380> just<00:02:13.160> drilled

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
screws into the fender well just drilled

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.890 
screws into the fender well just drilled
these<00:02:13.489> two<00:02:13.700> holes<00:02:13.970> here<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:14.239> these<00:02:14.569> studs

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
these two holes here so these studs

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.360 
these two holes here so these studs
could<00:02:15.080> stick<00:02:15.290> up<00:02:15.410> on<00:02:15.560> through<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.040> it's<00:02:16.190> kind

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
could stick up on through and it's kind

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.360 
could stick up on through and it's kind
of<00:02:16.459> a<00:02:16.700> really<00:02:17.209> nice<00:02:17.360> sturdy<00:02:17.950> mount<00:02:18.950> for<00:02:19.280> the

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
of a really nice sturdy mount for the

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.790 
of a really nice sturdy mount for the
amplifier<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:20.090> apps<00:02:20.840> obviously<00:02:21.230> get<00:02:21.440> mounted

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
amplifier the apps obviously get mounted

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.199 
amplifier the apps obviously get mounted
next<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.340> boys<00:02:22.520> up<00:02:22.700> front<00:02:22.910> are<00:02:23.030> still

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
next and the boys up front are still

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.840 
next and the boys up front are still
working<00:02:23.360> on<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.660> RCA's<00:02:24.370> Gator<00:02:25.370> down<00:02:25.610> all

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
working on the RCA's Gator down all

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.490 
working on the RCA's Gator down all
right<00:02:26.000> so<00:02:26.060> I<00:02:26.330> got<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.630> amplifier<00:02:27.020> mounted

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
right so I got the amplifier mounted

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.750 
right so I got the amplifier mounted
here<00:02:27.650> just<00:02:27.920> got<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.130> do<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.250> little<00:02:28.430> trimming

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
here just got to do a little trimming

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.979 
here just got to do a little trimming
because<00:02:29.060> Andrew<00:02:29.360> just<00:02:29.510> informed<00:02:29.900> me<00:02:29.930> that

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
because Andrew just informed me that

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.190 
because Andrew just informed me that
this<00:02:30.440> here<00:02:31.280> is<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.610> line<00:02:31.790> not<00:02:32.270> this<00:02:32.569> one<00:02:32.810> here

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
this here is the line not this one here

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.380 
this here is the line not this one here
so<00:02:33.440> this<00:02:34.069> edge<00:02:34.310> of<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.520> amplifier<00:02:34.970> here<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:35.300> is

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
so this edge of the amplifier here it is

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.580 
so this edge of the amplifier here it is
with<00:02:35.540> that<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.810> amplifier<00:02:36.140> with<00:02:36.350> just<00:02:36.500> a

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
with that the amplifier with just a

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.930 
with that the amplifier with just a
piece<00:02:36.769> of<00:02:36.890> woods<00:02:37.069> gotta<00:02:37.280> get<00:02:37.400> trimmed<00:02:37.610> out<00:02:37.790> or

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
piece of woods gotta get trimmed out or

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.190 
piece of woods gotta get trimmed out or
just<00:02:37.970> ground<00:02:38.300> out<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.510> little<00:02:38.720> bit<00:02:38.900> for<00:02:39.080> it<00:02:39.110> to

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
just ground out a little bit for it to

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.520 
just ground out a little bit for it to
fit<00:02:39.440> in<00:02:39.530> there<00:02:39.709> but<00:02:40.550> nice<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:41.450> sturdy<00:02:41.870> got<00:02:42.410> the

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
fit in there but nice and sturdy got the

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.830 
fit in there but nice and sturdy got the
factory<00:02:42.860> wiring<00:02:43.100> loom<00:02:43.459> all<00:02:43.640> here<00:02:43.940> screw<00:02:44.750> it

got<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:14.750> four<00:03:14.959> channel<00:03:15.410> mounted<00:03:16.040> there<00:03:16.370> and

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
got the four channel mounted there and

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.789 
got the four channel mounted there and
now<00:03:17.060> we're<00:03:17.209> working<00:03:17.360> on<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.930> sub<00:03:18.200> amp<00:03:18.470> here

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
now we're working on the sub amp here

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.069 
now we're working on the sub amp here
which<00:03:19.459> is<00:03:19.670> just<00:03:19.700> a<00:03:19.910> piece<00:03:20.090> of<00:03:20.120> MDF<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:20.900> then<00:03:20.989> we

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
which is just a piece of MDF and then we

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:22.690 
which is just a piece of MDF and then we
got<00:03:21.230> some<00:03:21.260> foam<00:03:21.709> behind<00:03:21.950> it<00:03:22.280> to<00:03:22.370> keep<00:03:22.549> it<00:03:22.670> from

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
got some foam behind it to keep it from

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.830 
got some foam behind it to keep it from
flexing<00:03:23.390> and<00:03:23.739> we're<00:03:24.739> going<00:03:24.859> to<00:03:24.920> mount<00:03:25.010> the

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
flexing and we're going to mount the

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.690 
flexing and we're going to mount the
kicker<00:03:26.840> amplifier<00:03:27.440> for<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.010> sub<00:03:28.280> just<00:03:28.489> like

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
kicker amplifier for the sub just like

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.849 
kicker amplifier for the sub just like
that<00:03:29.079> yes<00:03:30.079> sir

connections are going to go into there

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.729 
connections are going to go into there
and<00:03:41.810> it's<00:03:41.930> going<00:03:42.049> to<00:03:42.140> look<00:03:42.200> really<00:03:42.260> pretty<00:03:42.620> and

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
and it's going to look really pretty and

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.380 
and it's going to look really pretty and
nice<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:43.400> zoomy<00:03:43.640> all<00:03:43.730> nice<00:03:43.910> and<00:03:44.090> tip<00:03:44.180> tight

nice and zoomy all nice and tip tight

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.650 
nice and zoomy all nice and tip tight
and<00:03:44.540> looking<00:03:44.720> beautiful<00:03:45.070> amp<00:03:46.070> rack<00:03:46.420> not<00:03:47.420> quite

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
and looking beautiful amp rack not quite

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.569 
and looking beautiful amp rack not quite
straight<00:03:47.959> and<00:03:48.230> that's<00:03:48.829> because<00:03:49.250> there's<00:03:49.519> a

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
straight and that's because there's a

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.009 
straight and that's because there's a
seat<00:03:49.760> belt<00:03:49.940> retractor<00:03:50.359> right<00:03:50.510> here<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:50.959> it

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
seat belt retractor right here and it

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.599 
seat belt retractor right here and it
kind<00:03:51.200> of<00:03:51.230> goes<00:03:51.320> right<00:03:51.530> here<00:03:51.739> once<00:03:52.130> it's<00:03:52.280> all<00:03:52.400> in

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
kind of goes right here once it's all in

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.310 
kind of goes right here once it's all in
this<00:03:52.790> will<00:03:53.030> look<00:03:53.269> straight<00:03:53.600> to<00:03:53.630> space<00:03:53.959> because

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
this will look straight to space because

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.860 
this will look straight to space because
of<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.500> geometry<00:03:54.829> and<00:03:55.579> you<00:03:55.760> know<00:03:55.870> anyway

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
of the geometry and you know anyway

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.390 
of the geometry and you know anyway
and<00:03:57.049> rows<00:03:57.170> up<00:03:57.290> there's<00:03:57.500> galvez<00:03:57.859> cables<00:03:58.220> ran

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
and rows up there's galvez cables ran

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.949 
and rows up there's galvez cables ran
and<00:03:58.609> start<00:03:58.880> time<00:03:59.180> to<00:03:59.329> start<00:03:59.540> wiring<00:03:59.720> this

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
and start time to start wiring this

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.309 
and start time to start wiring this
biatch<00:04:00.340> all<00:04:01.340> right<00:04:01.519> so<00:04:01.819> I<00:04:01.850> got<00:04:02.359> the<00:04:02.540> RCA's<00:04:03.049> all

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
biatch all right so I got the RCA's all

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.059 
biatch all right so I got the RCA's all
hooked<00:04:03.530> up<00:04:03.680> here<00:04:03.980> and<00:04:04.190> nicely<00:04:04.400> ran<00:04:04.819> down<00:04:06.069> now

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
hooked up here and nicely ran down now

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.020 
hooked up here and nicely ran down now

this part of the amp there got my

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.090 
this part of the amp there got my
battery<00:04:36.960> here<00:04:37.260> like<00:04:37.500> I<00:04:37.620> said<00:04:37.650> they're<00:04:38.010> gonna

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
battery here like I said they're gonna

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.240 
battery here like I said they're gonna
be<00:04:38.250> really<00:04:38.460> short<00:04:38.820> runs<00:04:39.650> to<00:04:40.650> the<00:04:40.740> amplifiers

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
be really short runs to the amplifiers

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.680 
be really short runs to the amplifiers
there<00:04:41.669> as<00:04:41.820> you<00:04:41.970> can<00:04:42.000> see<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:42.510> we're<00:04:42.600> gonna

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
there as you can see and we're gonna

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.420 
there as you can see and we're gonna
ground<00:04:42.960> it<00:04:43.230> right<00:04:43.410> there<00:04:43.620> using<00:04:43.919> the<00:04:44.010> factory

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
ground it right there using the factory

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.670 
ground it right there using the factory
ground<00:04:44.760> should<00:04:45.600> be<00:04:45.630> nice<00:04:45.870> and<00:04:45.900> solid<00:04:46.290> and

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
ground should be nice and solid and

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.390 
ground should be nice and solid and
we'll<00:04:47.550> see<00:04:47.700> how<00:04:47.760> she<00:04:47.820> goes<00:04:49.010> andrew<00:04:50.010> is<00:04:50.040> still

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
we'll see how she goes andrew is still

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.530 
we'll see how she goes andrew is still
working<00:04:50.760> on<00:04:50.880> the<00:04:50.970> back<00:04:52.760> still<00:04:53.760> like<00:04:54.090> yeah
