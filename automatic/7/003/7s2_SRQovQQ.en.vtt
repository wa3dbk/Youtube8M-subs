00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.439
 or beautiful people good today I bring you a 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:08.620
 makeup hall cosmetic little things 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:10.570
 I have a little bit of everything and see 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.250
 what does it offer I'm going to start with a couple of 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.010
 little things that I bought online and after 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.449
 I'm going to give the store the first thing I'm going to 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.829
 teach and even though it's not a new purchase 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.019
 that came to me a little bit because the 

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:23.519
 package has come super delayed are 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.519
 these two permanent lipsticks 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.060
 in case you do not know this, the skins 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.860
 permanents in super famous were given to 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.300
 To know about wine coins, it seems to me that 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.070
 they also have them level in a lot 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.450
 of pages and in fact the last time the 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.850
 I bought Paul James because by bank and 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.989
 although I keep buying in when I've 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.150
 had enough problems then 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.680
 while you can avoid it and have another 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.480
 where to take the product then 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.890
 normally the shoulders already have two or 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.220
 three more of these these are both 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.750
 last ones that I bought and are a pass 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.000
 they are less hard euros but they are like 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.800
 not 24 cents to change and do not leave with 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.379
 nothing is valid or is it a barbarity 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.280
 Fixed fixed are the ones I like the most 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.200
 I believe all that I have 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.310
 it's just this one 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.610
 it's like a very dark burgundy pulling 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.100
 Brown 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.650
 I explain the colors but good is 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.420
 super cool that I like the only one 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.360
 prize to what these lipsticks come 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.190
 although they do not leave with anything 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.680
 in the line of good water line no 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.450
 she is the part of the lip inside in 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.160
 which is a little bit wet has not 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.860
 grab well and when you paint out there 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.660
 like skinning a bit then 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.580
 the problem seems to have the darkest 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.830
 is that the line of 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.780
 change between how far it goes well and 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.010
 then you always have to paint with 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.780
 the bar a little more inside 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.480
 because it looks and with this it does not leave you 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.340
 because as it is in the wet so to speak 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.920
 in the wet part it does not look good and 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.380
 note too much with dark line 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.790
 but good to me I love the truth for 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.280
 example this one is also very cool 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.810
 it's a barbie plus chewing gum color but 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.370
 well, I recommend you leave 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.050
 do it the down because they are super 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.729
 cheap and the truth is that it's great 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.680
 second thing that I bought online 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.310
 yes it is from Vallin Coins and it is to this 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.310
 nail polish 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.530
 as you can see it's super funny that the face 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.959
 of a special live remember the 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.030
 guys gave us the pins with which 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.560
 they remind princes of a lot each 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.330
 color has a different face and one 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.630
 different doll 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.580
 now in the head because I have 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.470
 put and do not paint anything stays 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.500
 totally transparent you have to give 20 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.850
 layers so like as nail polish leaves 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.060
 Much to wish for the truth is worth one euro 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.340
 and you can not ask for more 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.870
 but they are very funny and I will leave you 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.550
 the link if he still wanted to buy 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.780
 some since I'm with the paintings of 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.620
 I'm going to continue because I have some 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.970
 accounts I guess you'll already know the 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.000
 Astor paintings are those of space 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.000
 in the studio they are very cheap and were 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.750
 two for one when I went to fine is the 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.670
 I found first in a super good 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.170
 I clearly do not have any I did not have 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.730
 no painting of a gray I have 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.440
 black silver of all kinds that does not 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.030
 I had no click and I like a lot 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.910
 number carry that is already of tests me 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.950
 like a lot and then in punch 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.240
 one two for one of them 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.240
 I bought this blue 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.700
 what do I wear my nails right now? 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.890
 in fact 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.730
 and this one is like that 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.830
 Malaga 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.780
 and I liked the two reforms both 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.360
 together a euro and a half something if there was a 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.830
 promotion offer are very good me 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.110
 have you seen in the defects expenses me 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.810
 they like it a lot because the song has two 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.730
 layers and it's quite dark they do not fall 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.680
 too much for what they are worth to see what 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.989
 there are much better but they do not fall 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.310
 a lot and they do not make us so and now I'm going 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.230
 to analyze the yellow like others that 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.080
 they are very bad here you have me like that 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.209
 that I follow that factor of some color are 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.099
 very cheap, I'm going with you 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.049
 to teach a couple of little things I bought myself 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:53.200
 another of finding dry trees 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:56.660
 this time I bought the tone 020 of the rolls 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.660
 royce and I teach you closely 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.280
 and I bought this because I went to buy the 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.560
 that I bought the mind of that is the 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.170
 orange peach color that I like and 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.690
 it was nowhere to be found and well this one 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.040
 It looked a little bit like not much because 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.960
 the thousand oranges the truth this has 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.630
 good brown but good was one more color 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.740
 natural that what I wanted and how with 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.560
 those of fine English the truth is that 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.090
 they never come bad they are always very 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.400
 good and I like them all and it lasts me a 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.620
 pile but buy and another thing too 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.200
 I bought in fine and that I already taught in 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.550
 the indispensable video is this 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.550
 guaje lipstick back 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.020
 well I'm wearing it so you can see 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.020
 how is it 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.970
 A) Yes 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.830
 and I taught it but as I had not taught 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.020
 well how was it put on anything because what 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.070
 I take it again as I told you it cost 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.140
 a euro and a half little more 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.390
 and me is that I do not have eta once 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.060
 love and this is my favorite to 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.230
 Daily already leaving makeup aside 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.730
 then to the last two little things 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.380
 The first thing I want to teach you is the 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.370
 sunscreen that is already using all this 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.370
 summer and it's this 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.889
 Garnier Delial and is the cream for 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:11.700
 light skins sensitive in integral to 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:14.970
 Sun or 50 protection 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.860
 is very well and gene pallets and perfumes 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.560
 that I like whenever they do not fly 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.530
 to nothing is not very sticky is very 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.750
 ligerita the truth itself has very well 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.280
 I use it every day to go out to the 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.230
 street nothing else that is going to leave always 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.320
 in the face in every visible part of my 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.270
 body and it goes great still throwing the 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.750
 I'm not burned or given the sun goes 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.340
 to realize no time is veneers 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.850
 but it costs about 15 euros but the boat 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.290
 It is very large and is very good so 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.850
 really to take care of the skin on 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.040
 all of the sun is worth it because the 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.230
 money so if you have the same skin 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.270
 that I recommend it to you and the last thing 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:56.220
 between dehydrates the heat itself 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.220
 is this blues shower gel 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:07.100
 pina colada smell is that smell is 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:08.690
 that smells like candy pineapple 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.790
 of pineapple or if you have ever taken a 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.660
 malibu with pineapple, then malibu with pineapple 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:16.289
 it smells me worth a euro and a half and it was 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:20.590
 love at first 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:27.570
 I want first exit first sniffed 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:31.000
 but you work for me and the first one is 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:33.540
 worrying and general motors to the 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.540
 second I saw it 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:44.620
 at school and if he also loved it 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:47.890
 I said good to buy because I'm not what 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.810
 worse and nothing a euro and a half very cheap 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.250
 it attracts a lot and I guess it's one of 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.290
 these special summer editions like this 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.570
 that if you like and it interests me that you 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.770
 would suffer running for it and is up 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:58.720
 here the video today I hope you have 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.770
 liked the little things that you have but 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.120
 some things to say in the 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.550
 comments if you have interest in 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.360
