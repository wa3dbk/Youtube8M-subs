00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.379
 Complex Lenka Vanye characters the one who 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.260
 already tried linking 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.710
 characters probably managed to face 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.130
 one fucking problem they can not 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.350
 animate full preved 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:23.220
 the problem is solved damn just 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.430
 control alt n make a proxy skeleton to you 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.820
 but before that happens you need Lenka 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.279
 character by the process itself we 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.210
 met in the last lesson and you 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.090
 of course 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.820
 go to the blend file and start linking 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.690
 objects and it is as if correct and as if 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.960
 no group new concept which 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.200
 reveals a whole universe of possibilities 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.890
 if an object is a union of several 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.850
 date blocks that group is a union 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.460
 several objects of some special 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.629
 merge does not occur but when lenka Vani 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.129
 and it will make a huge difference 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.939
 let's take a look at the character in 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.060
 the original file is just 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.240
 Lego-man 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.409
 and the character for our happiness consists of everything 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.369
 two parts 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.790
 Misha and skeleton although the number of components 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.900
 parts does not particularly affect the process 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.460
 select the character and 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.119
 peak ryk is mandatory in object mode 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:34.040
 for clarity, open the toolbar and 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:38.100
 group mouse and rick hotkey kontrol g 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:41.400
 g group association in the toolbar ask 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.329
 new sintered band name person 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.040
 character name can be any 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:50.130
 grouped objects 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:53.600
 turn green by the way it would be necessary to save a 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.729
 object properties panel in the group tab 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.719
 mean in which group or in which 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.960
 groups 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.189
 there is an object and it can be in 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.570
 several groups 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:09.690
 as well as out line group mode 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.500
 further explore the container well here 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.760
 Now 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.920
 Lenka him link in 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:21.430
 they open an empty file next menu 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:25.120
 file link find the file with 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.900
 the character here is daddy objects 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.040
 where a heap of everything is piled up but we already have 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.150
 not interested 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.400
 go to the group folder and here we are already 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.299
 that group is waiting 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.269
 character glimpse down left along 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:48.579
 the default is a tick relative 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:51.220
 ways we link perfectly the character appeared in 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:54.370
 As a group, there are no modes except 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.650
 the object it does not have and do it 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.799
 allocated with one single object 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.389
 what to do with it further however still 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.349
 a little longing 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:06.480
 you won't hurt by the way save two in 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.790
 one 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.970
 character in different scenes can be in 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.389
 different clothes and with different items on 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.609
 body or hands you can create this 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:22.209
 case different blend files 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:25.870
 but why when there are groups come back to 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:30.010
 source file and create a cube right on 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:33.160
 character's head and screw this cube 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.970
 as head bone so that everything is already 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.889
 to mind 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:40.000
 well what's next let's say that 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.940
 some scenes 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.049
 we have a character with a cube on the head 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:51.329
 some without him one group without 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:55.919
 cube we already have create the second 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:04:00.069
 I select the mouse rick and the cube I press kontrol g 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:00.669
 ask the name of person 2 see what 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.750
 happened 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:09.459
 the cube is now one group and the character itself 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:13.359
 in two groups now circle in the viewer 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:16.289
 here is a group without a cube and we Lenka Wali 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:20.109
 and here is a group with a cube 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:22.690
 person 2 for those scenes where the character will be 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.300
 Dice on Lenka head is such 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.080
 the group is also no difference 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.780
 but 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.349
 show only the cursor set aside 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.449
 the side 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:37.000
 menu file link person 2 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:39.819
 By the way about the cursor is important that during 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.030
 The time was in the center 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:47.370
 coordinates you can send it there though 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:50.819
 Kay shift with the cursor here the center until I delete 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:54.550
 new lenko bathroom group and finally 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:57.969
 proxy animation is a concept used 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:01.509
 quite often in essence this use 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:04.870
 analogue for example video editor if 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:07.810
 you computer does not pull instead of tracks 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:11.050
 full permission to use proxy 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.270
 Quarter- resolution tracks that 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.229
 much easier for the computer to work and 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.259
 on render 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:21.039
 full size is automatically displayed 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:24.400
 the source here we have a character 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:26.740
 Lenko bathroom group I want him 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.279
 ruled by an analogue of that 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:34.419
 a rig that is sewn into a hotkey group 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:38.500
 control alt pi in the dropdown list 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:41.830
 we choose rick perfectly now 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.650
 Rick goes into animation mode and on it 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:48.789
 reacting character I will abandon 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:51.370
 still from the native file here is the animation there 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:55.599
 I have a blank file 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:06:00.550
 in the action folder walk then choose 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:02.949
 Rick and assign him this very walk 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.020
 When you start the animation, it becomes clear that 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:08.289
 it was not for nothing 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.870
 and by the way right on the go I can 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:13.740
 switch between two for thrown 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:17.379
 here in groups and it's pretty funny 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:20.770
 instant and go to another layer and 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:23.969
 create some cubes last about 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:28.000
 than I can tell a great thing 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:30.729
 instant and often some kind of model consists 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 from several objects and how to evil 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:37.209
 you need this model to propagate normal 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.350
 duplication in this case through shift d 

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:43.370
 heavily weighted project 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:47.570
 so here you can combine objects in our 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:50.720
 case cubes into a group and embed them into 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:53.500
 instant af as it turns out 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.630
 damn convenient in certain cases 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:07:00.410
 move the rotation and scale on the instant 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:02.770
 they work and by the way on the character lin 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:06.290
 forged into the band scene also 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:09.740
 this miracle also spreads 

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:12.770
 You can produce a whole army of people walking 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.930
 men minus only that 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:18.040
 they will have one animation 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:22.100
 Well, there is not without a fly in the ointment 

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:24.620
 link the same group and hang on 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:28.400
 her another animation can only 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:33.380
 Lenca vaniem from another file so 

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:36.020
 relationship is built all though not all 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:39.350
 I can tell but I understand that 

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:42.220
 the amount of information and so much within 

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:46.130
 the initial course is already quite a lot 

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:48.440
 Good luck to you in Lynn and not for locations 

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:51.500
 create simple managers 

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:54.050
 bones often walk in the fresh air 

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:57.700
 tell my mother that you love her do 

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.700
 bye bye
