00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
good pointers on how to do it if you

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:28.310 
good pointers on how to do it if you
can't<00:00:19.890> do<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:23.689> okay<00:00:24.859> so<00:00:26.449> pretty<00:00:27.449> sure<00:00:27.720> all<00:00:28.050> of

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
part and then to do it you have to to do

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.049 
part and then to do it you have to to do
like<00:00:35.850> finish<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.840> bridge<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.260> have<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.559> send

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
at the middle of the cards here and then

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.029 
at the middle of the cards here and then
never<00:00:50.690> really<00:00:51.690> liked<00:00:52.199> stop<00:00:52.530> putting<00:00:52.860> pressure

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
never really liked stop putting pressure

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.680 
never really liked stop putting pressure
on<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.489> also<00:00:54.120> won't<00:00:54.239> work<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.989> then<00:00:56.539> when<00:00:57.539> you

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
on it also won't work and then when you

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.799 
on it also won't work and then when you
have<00:00:57.719> crush<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.320> Alec<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.390> slowly<00:01:00.390> release

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
have crush on Alec on you slowly release

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.319 
have crush on Alec on you slowly release
the<00:01:01.050> car<00:01:01.579> that<00:01:02.579> one<00:01:02.730> didn't<00:01:03.000> turn<00:01:03.030> out<00:01:03.270> very

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
the car that one didn't turn out very

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:11.480 
the car that one didn't turn out very
well

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.580 

not<00:01:12.390> one<00:01:12.570> not<00:01:12.900> good

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.940 

so

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
so

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:31.280 
so
go<00:01:21.610> through<00:01:21.820> the<00:01:21.939> steps<00:01:22.180> again

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.730 

right<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.240> seen<00:01:33.240> some<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.660> the<00:01:33.690> video<00:01:34.230> that<00:01:34.710> I

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
right I seen some of the video that I

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.940 
right I seen some of the video that I
think<00:01:37.580> they<00:01:38.580> don't<00:01:38.760> stress<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:40.350> importance

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
think they don't stress the importance

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.100 
think they don't stress the importance
of<00:01:41.130> putting<00:01:41.370> it<00:01:41.550> like<00:01:42.330> always<00:01:42.570> putting

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
of putting it like always putting

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.930 
of putting it like always putting
pressure<00:01:43.320> with<00:01:43.920> your<00:01:43.950> thumbs<00:01:44.340> on<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.760> top

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
pressure with your thumbs on the top

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.870 
pressure with your thumbs on the top
because<00:01:45.690> if<00:01:45.870> you<00:01:46.020> like<00:01:46.580> don't<00:01:47.580> put<00:01:47.730> any

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
because if you like don't put any

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.960 
because if you like don't put any
pressure<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.330> it<00:01:48.510> go<00:01:49.020> like<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.290> it's<00:01:49.500> happy

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
pressure on it go like this it's happy

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.110 
pressure on it go like this it's happy
so<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.060> always<00:01:51.360> have<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.960> put<00:01:52.140> pressure<00:01:52.350> on<00:01:52.590> it

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
so you always have to put pressure on it

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:09.139 
so you always have to put pressure on it
so<00:01:55.790> pressure<00:01:56.790> then<00:02:07.429> hope<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.640> video<00:02:08.940> how<00:02:09.119> to
