guinea pig carnism is the reason that

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.080 
guinea pig carnism is the reason that
we're<00:01:30.960> typically<00:01:31.409> disgusted<00:01:32.220> by<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.400> idea<00:01:32.520> of

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
we're typically disgusted by the idea of

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
them and it's also the reason we don't

them and it's also the reason we don't
stop<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.680> think<00:01:41.070> about<00:01:41.310> why<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.119> case

when<00:02:26.040> we<00:02:26.159> eat<00:02:26.370> meat<00:02:26.579> we<00:02:26.819> have<00:02:26.849> to<00:02:27.299> disconnect

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
when we eat meat we have to disconnect

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.199 
when we eat meat we have to disconnect

ourselves from the reality that we're

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
eating a dead animal

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.509 
eating a dead animal
carnism<00:02:36.750> blocks<00:02:37.230> our<00:02:37.530> awareness<00:02:37.859> and<00:02:38.400> it

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
blocks our empathy toward the animal

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.649 
blocks our empathy toward the animal
that<00:02:40.859> we're<00:02:41.010> eating<00:02:41.219> an<00:02:41.549> awareness<00:02:42.540> and

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
that we're eating an awareness and

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.479 
that we're eating an awareness and
empathy<00:02:43.019> are<00:02:43.049> integral<00:02:43.769> to<00:02:43.799> our<00:02:43.980> sense<00:02:44.340> of

empathy are integral to our sense of
self<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.230> eating<00:02:46.230> meat<00:02:46.470> requires<00:02:46.980> us<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.280> be

internal<00:04:06.569> moral<00:04:07.459> often<00:04:08.459> unconscious

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379

internal moral often unconscious
discomfort<00:04:10.409> I<00:04:10.970> had<00:04:11.970> to<00:04:12.180> maintain<00:04:12.659> a<00:04:12.689> gap<00:04:13.229> in<00:04:13.530> my

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
discomfort I had to maintain a gap in my

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.110 
discomfort I had to maintain a gap in my
consciousness<00:04:14.220> when<00:04:14.609> it<00:04:14.729> came<00:04:14.879> to<00:04:15.090> eating

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
consciousness when it came to eating

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.039 
consciousness when it came to eating
meat<00:04:15.540> as<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:16.430> young<00:04:17.430> adult<00:04:17.579> I<00:04:18.120> learned<00:04:18.150> a<00:04:18.780> lot

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
meat as a young adult I learned a lot

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.709 
meat as a young adult I learned a lot
about<00:04:19.320> meat<00:04:19.739> production<00:04:20.070> and<00:04:20.519> I<00:04:21.239> came<00:04:21.539> to

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:21.719 
about meat production and I came to

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:24.019 
about meat production and I came to
realize<00:04:22.169> that<00:04:22.200> I<00:04:22.650> was<00:04:22.950> unable<00:04:23.130> to<00:04:23.310> maintain

realize that I was unable to maintain

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:25.480 
realize that I was unable to maintain
the<00:04:24.210> psychic<00:04:24.599> numbing<00:04:24.930> necessary

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
the psychic numbing necessary

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.270 
the psychic numbing necessary
to<00:04:25.699> continue<00:04:26.000> eating<00:04:26.270> animals<00:04:26.960> I<00:04:27.280> experienced

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
to continue eating animals I experienced

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.059 
to continue eating animals I experienced
a<00:04:28.370> profound<00:04:28.720> paradigm<00:04:29.720> shift<00:04:30.110> shift<00:04:30.889> of

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:31.069 
a profound paradigm shift shift of

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.580 
a profound paradigm shift shift of
consciousness<00:04:31.599> what<00:04:32.599> I<00:04:32.630> had<00:04:32.870> once<00:04:33.110> seen<00:04:33.380> as

consciousness what I had once seen as
food<00:04:33.919> I<00:04:34.310> now<00:04:34.639> saw<00:04:34.940> as<00:04:35.270> a<00:04:35.330> dead<00:04:35.660> animal<00:04:35.840> while<00:04:36.800> I

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
food I now saw as a dead animal while I

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.700 
food I now saw as a dead animal while I

now came to become conscious of the

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.589 
now came to become conscious of the

awareness<00:05:48.680> gave<00:05:49.550> birth<00:05:49.940> to<00:05:49.969> my<00:05:50.449> understanding

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
awareness gave birth to my understanding

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
of the invisible system that I've come

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.080 
of the invisible system that I've come
to<00:05:53.570> call<00:05:53.719> carnism<00:05:54.229> my<00:05:55.219> hope<00:05:55.490> is<00:05:55.789> that<00:05:55.819> by

to call carnism my hope is that by

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.480 
to call carnism my hope is that by
understanding<00:05:56.270> the<00:05:57.259> invisible<00:05:57.830> system<00:05:58.370> of

understanding the invisible system of
carnism<00:05:58.969> people<00:05:59.870> will<00:05:59.990> be<00:06:00.139> able<00:06:00.259> to<00:06:00.500> step

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
carnism people will be able to step

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.830 
carnism people will be able to step
outside<00:06:00.979> of<00:06:01.340> that<00:06:01.580> system<00:06:02.210> to<00:06:02.419> make<00:06:02.630> their

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
outside of that system to make their

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.080 
outside of that system to make their
