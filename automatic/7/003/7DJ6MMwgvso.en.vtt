00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 For Zombies, you will have to make your way through a huge number of zombies. 

00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:44.000
 . But by doing so, you also stain the screen with a splash of blood 

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:48.000
 The bowels spread in you place. 

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:53.000
 And yet, feel no guilt. 

00:00:53.001 --> 00:01:01.000
 On the contrary, submerged in a quasi-comic sensation. 

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:04.000
 There is a general idea of ​​a zombie walking with heaviness and outstretched hands. 

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:08.000
 We wanted to keep that feeling. We did not want to make them rational. 

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:15.000
 At the same time, there is humor and absolute pleasure in making them very, very stupid. 

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:25.000
 Ah ... Haha. 

00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:34.000
 We have types of zombies leaking out of specific elements. Some of which spit yellow material, or some of which are planted with fire or electricity. 

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:45.000
 In the Ninja scenario against zombie. We planned at first 

00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:52.000
 . Typical zooms are like what we normally understand 

00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:57.000
 This alone made the game and its story very simple, 

00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:01.000
 So we have to come up with many innovative ideas. 

00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:04.000
 How can we surprise players? 

00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:09.000
 How can we display zombies, attacks and strikes that have not been shown before? 

00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:13.000
 What types of zombies can be created in different situations? 

00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:18.000
 We have experienced countless mistakes at this stage 

00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:21.000
 To create a unique enormous zombies 

00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:34.000
 I was very careful in inventing the zombie. I had my own ideas about them, 

00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:41.000
 Like their ignorance or being stupid - that was my own concept - 

00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:47.000
 But in Yayba, I have lost this image. 

00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:52.000
 I did this because in the world of graphic magazines, the presence of zombies is interesting and interesting 

00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:58.000
 It was more important than reality 

00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:02.000
 This is why the zombies remain as they are, but in different types 

00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:07.000
 They have different qualities such as electromagnetism, fire, or the like. 

00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:11.001
 That's what I decided to do with them, but what I consider the most important thing 

00:03:11.001 --> 00:03:14.000
 With regard to zombies is a component of humor. 

00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:19.000
 The funny thing about the zombies is that although they are very serious, 

00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:23.000
 They are somewhat stupid, and this is something that is attractive to them, 

00:03:23.001 --> 00:03:28.000
 This time, these elements of humor have been developed over the entire game. 

00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:31.000
 Put these funny elements in the game, 

00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:35.000
 It is a unique imprint of the Infovian Zombies. 

00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:45.000
 We have thought about how they act as groups, and on their own. 

00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:51.000
 We decided to separate the zombies by giving them different characters and features. 

00:03:57.001 --> 00:04:02.000
 They will have glimpses of their past lives from time to time. 

00:04:02.001 --> 00:04:09.000
 Sometimes, the zombies will be the guards of the base machine in the street, and they stop to smoke a cigarette. 

00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:14.000
 They know they were smokers, but they do not know how to smoke a cigarette, and the scene is very funny. 

00:04:14.001 --> 00:04:19.000
 The zombies are serpents, and they are average-level villains, whose personality appears more markedly. 

00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:24.000
 We try to develop a complete background for them and where they came from.
