from each corner of the blanket side of

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.250 
from each corner of the blanket side of
the<00:03:16.209> blanket<00:03:16.390> up<00:03:17.489> so<00:03:18.489> that<00:03:18.819> the<00:03:19.269> patterns<00:03:19.810> and

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
the blanket up so that the patterns and

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.320 
the blanket up so that the patterns and
you<00:03:20.860> want<00:03:21.010> to<00:03:21.099> cut<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:21.459> little<00:03:21.610> piece<00:03:21.730> of<00:03:22.090> square

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
you want to cut a little piece of square

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.949 
you want to cut a little piece of square
this<00:03:23.110> helps<00:03:25.290> for<00:03:26.290> when<00:03:26.590> you<00:03:26.799> tie<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:28.510> corners

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
this helps for when you tie the corners

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.149 
this helps for when you tie the corners
which<00:03:29.200> I<00:03:29.319> will<00:03:29.500> show<00:03:29.530> you<00:03:29.739> just<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.610> second

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
which I will show you just a second

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.759 
which I will show you just a second
after<00:03:33.159> you<00:03:34.030> cut<00:03:34.269> four<00:03:34.810> squares<00:03:35.349> in<00:03:35.620> each

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
after you cut four squares in each

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.479 
after you cut four squares in each
corner<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:37.090> then<00:03:37.650> want<00:03:38.650> to<00:03:38.769> take<00:03:39.129> your

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
corner you then want to take your

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.990 
corner you then want to take your
scissors<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:39.940> make<00:03:40.900> about<00:03:41.140> an<00:03:41.319> inch<00:03:43.200> slit<00:03:44.200> in

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
scissors and make about an inch slit in

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.630 
scissors and make about an inch slit in
a<00:03:46.000> blanket<00:03:46.390> then<00:03:47.379> you<00:03:47.890> want<00:03:48.069> to<00:03:48.220> tie<00:03:48.760> in<00:03:49.410> a<00:03:50.410> knot

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
a blanket then you want to tie in a knot

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.569 
a blanket then you want to tie in a knot
you<00:03:51.640> want<00:03:51.790> to<00:03:51.879> tie<00:03:52.000> it<00:03:52.060> twice<00:03:52.390> in<00:03:52.690> a<00:03:52.840> knot<00:03:53.019> and

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
you want to tie it twice in a knot and

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.240 
you want to tie it twice in a knot and
this<00:03:54.579> is<00:03:54.790> how<00:03:55.030> your<00:03:55.840> blanket<00:03:56.349> will<00:03:56.829> be<00:03:56.950> tied

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
this is how your blanket will be tied

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.809 
this is how your blanket will be tied
all<00:03:57.609> the<00:03:57.909> way<00:03:58.030> around<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:59.799> reason<00:04:00.400> for

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
all the way around the reason for

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.970 
all the way around the reason for
cutting<00:04:01.420> these<00:04:01.569> squares<00:04:01.959> in<00:04:02.140> the<00:04:02.230> corners<00:04:02.650> is

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
cutting these squares in the corners is

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.220 
cutting these squares in the corners is
so<00:04:03.579> that<00:04:03.819> when<00:04:04.090> you<00:04:04.239> could<00:04:04.540> go<00:04:04.750> all<00:04:05.049> the<00:04:05.200> way

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
so that when you could go all the way

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.039 
so that when you could go all the way
around<00:04:05.349> they<00:04:06.190> actually<00:04:06.400> will<00:04:07.299> connect<00:04:07.810> and

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
around they actually will connect and

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.940 
around they actually will connect and
i'll<00:04:08.109> show<00:04:08.140> you<00:04:08.349> how<00:04:10.560> it<00:04:11.560> will<00:04:11.769> actually

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
i'll show you how it will actually

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.879 
i'll show you how it will actually
connect<00:04:12.549> here<00:04:15.239> and<00:04:16.239> when<00:04:16.690> it's<00:04:16.870> finished<00:04:17.169> it

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
connect here and when it's finished it

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.699 
connect here and when it's finished it
will<00:04:17.919> look<00:04:18.459> more<00:04:18.729> rounded<00:04:19.660> instead<00:04:20.109> of<00:04:20.260> having

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
will look more rounded instead of having

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.779 
will look more rounded instead of having
spaces<00:04:21.780> at<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:23.139> ends<00:04:23.760> so<00:04:24.760> you<00:04:24.820> want<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.240> just

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
spaces at the ends so you want to just

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.990 
spaces at the ends so you want to just
tie<00:04:27.789> it<00:04:27.820> all<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:28.300> way<00:04:28.389> around<00:04:29.639> don't<00:04:30.639> forget

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
tie it all the way around don't forget

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.490 
tie it all the way around don't forget
to<00:04:31.210> do<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:31.360> four<00:04:31.720> corners<00:04:32.110> because<00:04:32.260> that

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
to do the four corners because that

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.560 
to do the four corners because that
really<00:04:32.680> makes<00:04:32.979> a<00:04:33.130> difference<00:04:33.160> in<00:04:33.729> the<00:04:33.820> blanket

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.330 

when<00:04:37.570> i<00:04:37.599> first<00:04:37.990> started<00:04:38.440> doing<00:04:38.590> this<00:04:38.830> blanket

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
when i first started doing this blanket

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.960 
when i first started doing this blanket
i<00:04:39.520> actually<00:04:40.380> learned<00:04:41.380> about<00:04:42.070> how<00:04:42.340> to<00:04:42.400> do<00:04:42.789> this

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
i actually learned about how to do this

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.020 
i actually learned about how to do this
by<00:04:43.330> working<00:04:43.900> at<00:04:44.169> jo-ann<00:04:44.349> fabrics<00:04:44.949> one<00:04:45.729> of<00:04:45.849> my

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
by working at jo-ann fabrics one of my

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.260 
by working at jo-ann fabrics one of my
co-workers<00:04:46.270> Lisa<00:04:47.190> actually<00:04:48.190> is<00:04:48.820> the<00:04:48.970> one<00:04:49.090> who

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
co-workers Lisa actually is the one who

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.839 
co-workers Lisa actually is the one who
taught<00:04:49.510> me<00:04:49.570> how<00:04:50.530> to<00:04:50.590> make<00:04:50.770> the<00:04:51.010> blanket<00:04:51.550> and

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849

because she lives in missouri which is

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.600 
because she lives in missouri which is
really<00:05:15.520> cold<00:05:16.200> but<00:05:17.200> as<00:05:17.410> you<00:05:17.590> can<00:05:17.710> see<00:05:17.950> that's

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
really cold but as you can see that's

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.760 
really cold but as you can see that's
just<00:05:18.790> how<00:05:19.720> you<00:05:19.780> do<00:05:20.020> it<00:05:20.140> you<00:05:20.170> just<00:05:20.230> tie<00:05:20.530> it<00:05:20.560> all

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
just how you do it you just tie it all

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.070 
just how you do it you just tie it all
the<00:05:20.890> way<00:05:21.040> down<00:05:21.250> and<00:05:21.640> as<00:05:22.270> you<00:05:22.450> go<00:05:22.630> you<00:05:22.660> can

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
the way down and as you go you can

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:29.880 
the way down and as you go you can
remove<00:05:23.350> the<00:05:23.530> pens<00:05:24.360> so<00:05:26.880> and<00:05:27.880> then<00:05:28.770> after<00:05:29.770> you're
