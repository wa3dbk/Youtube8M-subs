00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.809
 Hello, my name is Alexey Zavyalov 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.309
 today choose walking stick at 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.290
 I have here three representatives of this 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.199
 subspecies 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.449
 Chinese 3000 English rubles 5000 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.460
 rubles the same English have 10,000 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.800
 rubles and so is a Chinese company 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.480
 geoby first material is synthetic and 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.910
 if you use it in the summer 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.710
 baby shorts can rub feet and 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.630
 get some kind of back allergy 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.760
 rises very strange for such 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.370
 strollers way we pull out here 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.340
 Here is such a strap and it rises 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.050
 even sellers in stores say that 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.300
 it's not long because she can 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.570
 just tear or stretch because 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.219
 bumper does not save from falling out 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.930
 you have to fasten it but how are you 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.570
 see here it is a strap she too 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.379
 strongly not to protect the child the movie is correct 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.510
 main disadvantage 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.359
 the stroller is very difficult to fold we 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.090
 should lower the hood raise this one 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.650
 Detail click here 2 buttons seems to me 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.350
 easily pressed into action a lot 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:14.220
 and finally try to fold it 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:19.439
 the first time she gets me like this 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:24.630
 so I folded them this way she can 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.210
 be sure and easily portable but very 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.470
 unreliable as it seems to me 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.240
 further I want to say low words about 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.369
 wheels note this is plastic 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.470
 and the mount is here to 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.119
 to fix it went well, I just 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.310
 not very reliable and it seems to me 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.460
 break in two weeks through three so 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.439
 that be careful when buying such 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.149
 the stroller is well literally a few 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.729
 months maybe go somewhere south 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.729
 this is my throw the next stroller 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.290
 English company silver cross 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.329
 the material is also synthetic though in my 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.759
 glance fed on general on more 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.860
 some kind of reliable and less brand 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.899
 fastening which the child will be 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.000
 tied here so as not to fall out they already 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.880
 capture and hangers that is more 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.090
 reliably and finally the moment of lifting and back 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.530
 in order to lower 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.239
 there will have to try because 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.220
 I think the manufacturer does not 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.440
 thought out this moment you need right here 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.220
 pushing these semi zig and somehow not 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.470
 first time we get to drop here 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.500
 This is now back that of course very 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.790
 uncomfortable if the child you have Sirius well 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.370
 here it should be enough 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.670
 just literally two foot motions on 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.700
 pedal and pulled the handle all 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.620
 the stroller has taken shape here there is a handle for 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.390
 which can take and pay attention 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.370
 special fixative i.e. it is no longer 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.040
 I want to say the last one 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:47.209
 wheel is foam rubber that is the course 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.150
 softer and so 3 stroller maclaren 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.000
 English is also worth 10 thousand rubles 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.440
 I immediately want to say the material is breathable 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.970
 that is, the child will not have such glasses 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.310
 mom knows what i'm talking about 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.819
 special straps on his shoulders he is not 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.709
 will fall out 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:04.160
 therefore , that is why there is no 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.660
 bumper that all parents love 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.510
 because it seems safer 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.459
 no bumper but there is a special lock 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.680
 note you need to click here 2 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.510
 buttons on both sides of the manufacturer 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.150
 assures that the child himself will not guess 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.049
 will not upset this lock accordingly 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.430
 the street from the stroller as we lower the back 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.880
 very simple there are two keys 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.620
 behind the departure push 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.620
 the back goes down rises in any 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.359
 the position that is, if the child fell asleep no 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.639
 no problem to omit and 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:37.160
 put him to bed is of course big 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:40.959
 plus further we will try to fold this to me 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.819
 most favorite activity is click and 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.709
 we pull up all easier than even 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.180
 the previous model does not need to bend down and 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.419
 pull any lever here there 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.150
 already familiar to us retainer to the stroller not 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:55.290
 will unfold 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.810
 as for the wheels, it is 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.269
 my favorite foam rubber move is very 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.659
 soft stroller manoeuvrable dec and 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:06.000
 summarize the Chinese stroller 3000 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:10.109
 rubles will break in three months four 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.670
 the wheelchair doesn't suit me completely 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.220
 only 2 thousand rubles but she already 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.720
 more reliable manufacturers claim that 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.239
 the child from all rides in it 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.910
 he is two and a half years old but I would choose 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.370
 still the magician lara is firstly breathable 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.770
 material secondly lock u good in 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:31.229
 the third is very very convenient 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:33.900
 I 'll tell you one more time, it seems to me 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:37.250
 because there is a pen here 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.250
 hang on your shoulder 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.030
 well then I compare you remove before 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.900
 what to buy 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.900
 see test
