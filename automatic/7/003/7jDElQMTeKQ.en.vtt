00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
one of the great things about the 70 is

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.160 
one of the great things about the 70 is
it<00:00:03.959> has<00:00:04.440> a<00:00:04.470> really<00:00:05.130> versatile<00:00:06.049> amount<00:00:07.049> of

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
it has a really versatile amount of

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.610 
it has a really versatile amount of
output<00:00:07.500> options<00:00:08.370> for<00:00:08.639> monitoring<00:00:09.300> live<00:00:09.660> so

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
output options for monitoring live so

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.700 
output options for monitoring live so
right<00:00:10.860> now<00:00:10.889> I'm<00:00:11.929> sending<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.019> composite

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
right now I'm sending the composite

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.349 
right now I'm sending the composite
video<00:00:13.830> out<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.900> the<00:00:15.900> 70<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:17.060> putting<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.210> into

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
video out of the 70 and putting it into

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.689 
video out of the 70 and putting it into
a<00:00:18.600> portable<00:00:19.170> DVD<00:00:19.410> player<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.070> it's<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.460> cheap

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
a portable DVD player and it's a cheap

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.500 
a portable DVD player and it's a cheap
choice<00:00:21.060> for<00:00:21.449> taking<00:00:22.260> on<00:00:22.410> set<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.330> right<00:00:24.330> there

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
choice for taking on set and right there

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.179 
choice for taking on set and right there
you<00:00:24.600> see<00:00:24.779> what<00:00:24.930> happens<00:00:25.260> if<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.619> 70s<00:00:26.099> in

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
you see what happens if the 70s in

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.700 
you see what happens if the 70s in
standby<00:00:26.699> mode<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.359> turns<00:00:28.080> off<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.560> live

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
standby mode and it turns off the live

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.510 
standby mode and it turns off the live
view<00:00:29.010> every<00:00:29.340> few<00:00:29.550> minutes<00:00:31.219> it's<00:00:32.219> actually<00:00:32.309> a

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
view every few minutes it's actually a

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.000 
view every few minutes it's actually a
good<00:00:32.669> thing<00:00:32.730> because<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.300> 7d<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:34.110> overheat

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
good thing because the 7d can overheat

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.119 
good thing because the 7d can overheat
so<00:00:35.489> you're<00:00:36.420> not<00:00:36.570> recording<00:00:36.930> live<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.770> should

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
so you're not recording live you should

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.479 
so you're not recording live you should
probably<00:00:38.340> be<00:00:38.820> off<00:00:39.020> but<00:00:40.020> as<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:40.950> see<00:00:41.190> it

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
probably be off but as you can see it

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.819 
probably be off but as you can see it
gives<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.820> really<00:00:42.210> nice<00:00:42.450> output<00:00:42.960> there<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.800> a

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
gives a really nice output there is a

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.310 
gives a really nice output there is a
box<00:00:44.340> for<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.879> autofocus<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.809> does<00:00:45.960> come<00:00:46.200> on

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
box for the autofocus that does come on

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
box for the autofocus that does come on
screen<00:00:46.730> that<00:00:47.730> can<00:00:48.000> be<00:00:48.270> turned<00:00:48.480> off<00:00:48.890> if<00:00:49.890> you

have an autofocus lens that supports

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.840 
have an autofocus lens that supports
focusing<00:00:54.719> manually<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.440> can<00:00:55.500> turn<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.610> into

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
focusing manually you can turn that into

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.639 
focusing manually you can turn that into
autofocus<00:00:57.449> mode<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:58.170> turn<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.469> off

now this is a full laptop a lot of

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.440 
now this is a full laptop a lot of
people<00:01:35.400> haven't<00:01:35.640> seen<00:01:35.790> these<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.329> an

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
people haven't seen these this is an

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.899 
people haven't seen these this is an
ASIS<00:01:37.100> r2h<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.549> it's<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.820> full<00:01:39.409> UMPC

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
ASIS r2h and it's a full UMPC

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.289 
ASIS r2h and it's a full UMPC
subnotebook<00:01:41.909> as<00:01:42.689> touchscreen<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:44.030> it's<00:01:45.030> fast

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
subnotebook as touchscreen and it's fast

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.020 
subnotebook as touchscreen and it's fast
enough<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.869> run<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.140> application<00:01:46.229> now<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
enough to run the application now the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.969 
enough to run the application now the
eos<00:01:48.390> utility<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.560> actually<00:01:49.740> control<00:01:50.340> the

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
eos utility you can actually control the

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.139 
eos utility you can actually control the
focus<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:53.909> shoot<00:01:56.000> straight<00:01:57.000> from

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
focus and you can shoot straight from

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.109 
focus and you can shoot straight from
the<00:01:57.270> application<00:01:57.950> but<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.070> only<00:01:59.189> displays<00:01:59.640> at

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
the application but it only displays at

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.810 
the application but it only displays at
around<00:02:00.329> 15<00:02:00.930> frames<00:02:01.320> per<00:02:01.560> seconds

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.139 

and<00:02:05.270> it<00:02:05.570> is<00:02:05.900> not<00:02:06.260> much<00:02:06.560> heavier<00:02:06.979> than<00:02:07.250> the

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
and it is not much heavier than the

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.630 
and it is not much heavier than the
field<00:02:08.509> monitor<00:02:08.990> so<00:02:09.800> you<00:02:09.890> could<00:02:10.429> actually

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
field monitor so you could actually

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.190 
field monitor so you could actually
mount<00:02:11.060> this<00:02:11.300> where<00:02:11.660> you<00:02:11.810> would<00:02:11.930> mount<00:02:12.080> a

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
mount this where you would mount a

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.710 
mount this where you would mount a
monitor<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:12.830> have<00:02:13.610> full<00:02:13.940> control<00:02:14.090> over<00:02:14.360> the

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
monitor and have full control over the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.050 
monitor and have full control over the
camera<00:02:15.050> at<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.290> same<00:02:15.500> time<00:02:15.740> it<00:02:16.580> is<00:02:16.760> really

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
camera at the same time it is really

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.370 
camera at the same time it is really
cool<00:02:17.209> to<00:02:17.270> be<00:02:17.420> able<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.660> do<00:02:17.780> this<00:02:17.930> in<00:02:17.990> would<00:02:18.260> be

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
cool to be able to do this in would be
