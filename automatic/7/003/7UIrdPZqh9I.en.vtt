00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.900
 speaks again of guys here and now 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.960
 People in this video will bring a tip 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.820
 from attack to war for you to 67 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.460
 for this you will need to have 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.920
 busy your wizard your balloon and your 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.189
 daughter to level four in addition to having already 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.869
 released the hall in the barracks he 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.060
 can be on level 1 that was a level 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.670
 which I used and worked quietly 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.180
 felt level 2 even better training 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.570
 creative wore next 27 runners 11 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.370
 archers 6 magicians 6 balloons 10 servants 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.110
 What are you going to order at your clan castle? 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.940
 the barbarian king if you have not 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.250
 deburring you will have a little more 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.350
 difficulty but can not use this 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.860
 Tip too but it's better that you have 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.649
 he 13 healing spells level 4 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.629
 if you are recent and 17 and do not have these 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.010
 troops that I mentioned this tip did not 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.440
 It will suit you. 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.809
 beauty is right there for the attack then 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.969
 this breaks that the attack can 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.820
 you notice that her layout looks like a 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.369
 layout before runners is because 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.670
 this ditch here where you can fill up with 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.740
 springs or those smaller pumps 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.210
 or maybe that's not even the guy 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.820
 you have done only to create a 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.830
 greater difficulty for the giant by 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.900
 giant example will waste time here 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.340
 coming from this defenses through this 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.960
 and then have to go through this 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.670
 wall after passing through it to 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.479
 get to where the mortars are here 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.090
 huh 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.520
 but it's a layout that can also bring 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.530
 a greater difficulty for runners 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.990
 a tip when you go to the house of 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.210
 runner you have to analyze more or 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.780
 where they can be 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.630
 times the traps a trap that 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.250
 The more you bring injury is the mega bomb and 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.899
 where is the mega bomb 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.329
 already the mega bomb the first space 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.290
 so if you look here, these 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.750
 larger spaces this is where 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.810
 the e and mega keys are positioned 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.290
 pump is usually in this space 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.149
 on here 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.770
 she explains that it can simply be a 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.270
 bluff the face can be with the mega bomb 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.670
 right here 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.709
 facing the sea ​​here and you when 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.220
 take place a bullet in the middle of force 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:17.460
 but usually in theory she 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.510
 are in this space so it is then that I 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.920
 I'll do it here 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.100
 as the magician's towers are already very 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.800
 exposed here and they hit area then 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.550
 I'm going to get in here and 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.040
 you will see 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.950
 before that I'm going to kill the troops of the 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.740
 castle it is imperative that you do 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.840
 This is crucial if you have to kill the 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.040
 Castle troops in this case here the guy 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.080
 had 5 higher level 5 than it would be and the worst 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.840
 still for this type of attack then 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.840
 always kill the troops before 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:59.519
 Look, I've already disposed of the troops there and now. 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:02.250
 police attack the country and there 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:07.050
 already on top of the magicians already torreira two 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.670
 curves opera day there are some 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.640
 corridors they went because they had a 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.470
 ball underneath is calm passing it 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.470
 through the ditch we already arrived here in the middle 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.040
 I'm already here, this is where I thought 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:24.269
 that would have a mega bomb in reality 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:28.170
 I had the ball but we already carried it there a lot. 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:30.360
 face defense has a greater amount 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.299
 of corridors up here so 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.670
 I put the acura there what will be the 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.829
 function here two balloons 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.260
 the balloons exert exactly the same 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.810
 function of the corridors, which is to 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.549
 defenses first then when you see 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.900
 which is taking the side of the 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.200
 runners is doing a quantity 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.000
 reduced and they have evidently already 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.640
 eliminated air defenses 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.819
 Then you loose the balloons they are going to 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.180
 to aid in the destruction of these defenses 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:04.200
 is now the one who has eliminated all 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.450
 I let the servants loose the 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.019
 My ribarock up there has nothing to 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.019
 hit him 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.680
 Now from a home the servants have all come 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.720
 here in that direction was a bomb 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.300
 took all 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.180
 this is a pretty big risk in the castle I 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.510
 I took servants that the following servants are 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.710
 how they fly right and do not have the walls here 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.860
 as inpecuation then they bring more 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.530
 agility 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.010
 only you saw what happened there is 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.440
 the bomb they took a lot together né 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.200
 this can detract from the attack if you 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.270
 I want to take care of you, you can even take 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.580
 your wallet also has the same problem 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.950
 since lines have little ht 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.470
 they die so much for mega bomb after 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.690
 take a good amount joins by 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.330
 example, they step on those pumps 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.580
 Smaller had two more together one 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.160
 do not kill but if you have two already kill 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.260
 so then I'd rather take the servants 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.810
 but in this case if you want 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.810
 replacing this can lead to 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:15.410
 balloons as midwives carry more 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.270
 Wizards also beauty guys so I hope 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.640
 that you have liked this is a tip that 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.020
 can be useful to you for you 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.050
 with difficulty to attack 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.090
 the cd is 7 with level 4 troops 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.580
 there're a very strong hint the use of 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:32.270
 corridors is very strong even level or 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.430
 underneath you know how to use the 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.320
 healing spells and know how to analyze more 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.810
 or less where it can be 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.880
 conditioning the opponent's traps 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.039
 said people so liked the 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.410
