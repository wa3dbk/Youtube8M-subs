00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.870

 is that sony pictures will be taken to the cinema 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.779

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.670
 sega and nintendo one of the battles a 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.109
 of the most mythical consoles wars 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.840

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.070

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.410
 comes from sega beach and we discover that 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.750
 there is this project a project for 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.070
 to film a big screen 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.820
 largest console war that has 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.860
 existed not only to the cinema but also to the 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.350
 editorial world with a book that has been 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.270

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.790
 and kohlberg must be said that from the 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.770
 editorial atlantic books hope to have 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.110
 this book published for August this 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.320
 same year both the book and the 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.450
 movie will tell how he developed and how 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.549
 is how it developed better 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.189
 the rivalry between the company of mario 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.659
 and the sonic company that has to be said 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.219
 they had their big shock in the 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.710
 period of time in which I a driver 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:20.439
 super nintendo were in the market 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.360
 for me that I have lived it has been 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:26.560
 one of the most beautiful wars of the 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.590
 videogames I in his day then I had in the 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.520
 megadrive in the middle drive two and then 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.069
 I had the mega cd and the 32 x and well I lived 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.840
 all that kind of shared maelstrom 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:42.250
 with the super nintendo that really was 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.810
 a golden age a golden age of the 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.149
 video games without any doubts was 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.799
 a pretty beautiful time to live it for 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.220
 for everything not for the games that 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:54.010
 they developed so good 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.700
 Now the good question that divides the 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.800
 fans who wonder on the street is 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.720
 right now it's who you are, not if it's 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.100
 of xbox or playstation a war 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.560
 absurd that I always say on the channel 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.320
 that seems silly but in 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.130
 that era was or were you were or were you 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.710
 of really good nintendo in their 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.900
 good rockin personal accounts of 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.790
 seth rogen and evan goldberg as they have 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.370
 been asking his followers of 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.280
 which of the two Japanese companies were 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.780
 your favorites and since throughout 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.390
 these months go to depth to 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.680
 deepen a lot on this topic and it 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.780
 will give a lot to talk about so 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.050
 attention to this movie the war of 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.459
