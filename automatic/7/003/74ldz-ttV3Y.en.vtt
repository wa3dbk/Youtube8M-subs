00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.230
 this looks like the solo mode of 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.580
 gt5 is online 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.719
 and do not worry we do not have that 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.550
 light off we just have 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.929
 only the same mission recorded twice 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.670
 and just show you who is going to 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.340
 each daytime explains some games 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.539
 we're doing another guy here 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.060
 Just sitting on my bike and 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.000
 I think I try to deliver coke 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.859
 somewhere at the harbor and my job was 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.720
 to fly it with the jet and 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.710
 to chase him 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.359
 So in this open game world can 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.920
 you start such activities, so to speak 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.520
 the other player in any form 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.260
 How does it work? 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.430
 stuff matchmaking things i'm looking for 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.110
 a mission out of it is reasonably 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.540
 comfortable or still has a lot of idleness 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.860
 So it's easily has at the moment 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.809
 still many server problems but im 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.430
 principle, I can start my mission 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.750
 and then I can all the people on the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.149
 invite server or own crew 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.680
 members 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.059
 then get an invitation to 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.309
 sent on your phone and can the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.539
 accept or just do not know how 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.070
 many people at the same time on one 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.170
 game world in open can run around 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.960
 a maximum of 16 if you are lucky 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.189
 currently at 16 however as it said 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.640
 does not look so good at the moment 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.960
 but maximum are 16 players and here 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.000
 Are you on the road and getting injured 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.830
 Everything is a bit like that 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.960
 illegal substances in multiplayer mode 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.030
 yes okay that is of course if it is 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.560
 are also clearly other things , well 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.810
 I just went there you drove 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.939
 were tried by your own man yes here 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.490
 one almost drove ki 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.630
 lame opponents what are you looking at clearly 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.049
 and then deliver it 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.250
 that he has such a commission precisely because of it 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.720
 yes, too bad that you look to others 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.479
 players must leave such as for example 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.579
 this horst of the road the car 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.170
 Falling into a barrier somewhere 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.060
 has indeed at the moment there is still a 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.560
 a bit of problems with the ping too 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.600
 It can happen to you 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.520
 suddenly 20 meters elsewhere to one 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.390
 second 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.880
 it is still a bit problematic 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.329
 but most are not that stupid 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.290
 okay in the video now okay i was there 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.719
 again unfair that she think so 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.390
 only in free mode, I have the bulls 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.409
 on the neck so it is still similar 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.549
 comparable perhaps with red dead 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.079
 redemption indeed still open 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.099
 in which one also alone so one 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.899
 can be a little bit on the way 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.550
 exactly but it probably makes you see 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.040
 to duel with other players 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.900
 or any mission condition 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.730
 yes, of course, there are many 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.290
 missions but the free mode is in the 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.069
 principle still with all buildings and 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.599
 everything included 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.310
 there are also the shops the murderers 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.230
 You can do it all down 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.599
 in principle singleplayer mode only 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.980
 there's just multiplayer mio and the im 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.299
 singleplayer now the shooting 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.090
 Now you can play two games 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.049
 like to be against each other 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.079
 this is a very interesting one 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.329
 mode it in principle mario kart or blur 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.950
 that made me very much a blogger of the 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.450
 optics as well as more in an adult 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.239
 version of mario kart where you look 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.950
 race supplies and power-ups 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.599
 yes and the music I had no idea 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.349
 how to use it I was a little bit 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.239
 perplexed 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.519
 but basically so that you get power ups 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.230
 rockets and things like that or man 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.829
 can also repair himself and 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.930
 then you have to be first here too 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.639
 due to the year online problems still 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.079
 not with the full numbers of players though 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.439
 I think that could be really funny 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.060
 become 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.859
 yes, I've been with me for a while now 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.310
 a guy on the way because of not from 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:11.659
 but my side should give way 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.819
 can be up to eight i believe in 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.870
 to run 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.669
 what does the weather mean canceled? 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.199
 you can bet on his victory exactly 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:19.090
 I know that, too 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:21.229
 red dead redemption 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.699
 you can bet on is conclusively 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:24.139
 However, this only works if 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:26.500
 opponents are also waiting so it has to 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:28.579
 given a counter bet 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.049
 In that case, I think it was back 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.060
 the same type of small bike race 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.799
 you probably will not go downhill 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.750
 because I pulled him off relatively 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:41.650
 yes, I believe that is already here 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.650
 finishline alike 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.730
 yes here again something similar 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:55.409
 task you have to coke clown shows it 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.939
 she goes on the coke michelle got 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:59.730
 you're probably in the game as well 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:00.359
 Something in pc to me, I enter into the 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.730
 sea 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.620
 I'm waiting for the lawyer letter so 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.909
 Two groups have to go to the job 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.890
 arrive and then deliver 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.599
 in this case it is actually in 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.329
 synchronous mode is not asynchronous around 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.129
 the week here too I will be 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.380
 tables capture the flag capture the 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.410
 kooks yes in principle, just stop with 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.209
 a very long stretch to the harbor 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.830
 So something that happens in solo mode 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.360
 with sometimes very large distances 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.070
 must go back with the car comes too 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.810
 in the online mode before that happens 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.550
 relatively on because so much above all 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.680
 These coke affairs outside of the 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.300
 City happen or on the edges and 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.610
 Often you have to go to it often 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.440
 Projects bring yes the drug dealers 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.110
 we will be able to hear from you 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.400
 Know that you have to drive a lot of car 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.240
 bring back a lot of distance and to 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.800
 Port comes you learn so much 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.020
 yes I have no experience with coke 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.639
 Here we are at the moment 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.440
 On the other side of the mission we are on 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.479
 So at the beginning I have now 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.880
 the guy on the motorcycle tries to 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:02.310
 to come to the docks and somewhere behind 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.659
 I have a jet that follows me 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.460
 somewhat somehow the feeling 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:08.849
 to be followed by someone 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.990
 who is smarter than you will become 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:11.150
 Seeing is not much now 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:16.650
 smarter 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:18.419
 because he brings it to an abrupt end but 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.060
 fair in the case I was just too 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.139
 a guy together 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.610
 as you can see that he committed suicide 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:24.330
 So he crashed into something 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.130
 his jet a 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.750
 but if there are several then it comes 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.180
 rather than just one 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.039
 mitspieler 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.289
 that's basically a story 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:36.780
 mission you get from their steam 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:39.599
 from the singleplayer of this this 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.889
 has a dealership and I have to do just that 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.570
 do what I open in the story 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.360
 Car back to his garage 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.340
 so i can help him in the docks too 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.509
 gti online easy for myself for 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.009
 my own progress things 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:51.419
 do without a great with one 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:52.710
 people also interact with the chambers 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.970
 you can do it alone in the 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.440
 Group doing that is on such a job 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.080
 There's not much left to do with a car 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.569
 make sense 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.099
 but there is later you can see it 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:01.479
 I believe a mission in the car 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:04.780
 first has to steal at a property 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:06.099
 and there you meet opponent is even 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.840
 two cars which alone, of course 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:10.449
 it is difficult so you have to later 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.939
 come back if you can without friends too 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:14.500
 that's also on the way 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.939
 interesting feature and indeed everything 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.889
 money you have earned as one 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:19.330
 cash can do that 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:20.469
 deducted from other players 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.129
 if they kill a can a 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:22.810
 rob 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:25.090
 that means it makes sense money 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.289
 Deposit regularly into the bank and 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.930
 money also plays a big overall 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:30.250
 role in online mode absolutely so without 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.930
 money is no good you do not have one 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.629
 weapons without money you can not 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.099
 cars do not buy anything so it goes in the 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:37.919
 principle, therefore, its reputation 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:40.449
 increase and lose money 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:41.680
 ok back to the shown here you are with 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:43.419
 the said mission you have to open it 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.669
 Break this estate and two cars 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:47.110
 extract exactly I was in the case 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:49.029
 I'm also on my own 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.159
 have one delivered and then I am 

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:52.900
 come back for the second what 

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:56.110
 Of course it is unfavorable and but 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.759
 also a little stretch in between there 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.110
 it's the other side too 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:00.009
 players can play that's the way it is 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.990
 a cooperative thing 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:03.819
 in that case it is purely cooperative 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.009
 I think so you meet the 

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:08.289
 ki opponents you can also do it in strong 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:09.759
 make course and twosome threesome 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:11.589
 Four, it is much easier 

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:12.819
 the houses even if it still is 

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:14.529
 things did not run smoothly 

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:17.229
 in my opinion it's already potential 

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:20.199
 is that gt5 play only with others 

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:22.060
 women or stupid with players and them 

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:25.529
 are also can add things 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.529
 yes, curious
