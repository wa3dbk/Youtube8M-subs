00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.160
 hello the locals just let's go 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.530
 move forward in the news test 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.660
 plastic cat balls or not 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.690
 first thing I hope it is 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.910
 precisely already compared the balls so 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.650
 here I have a classic ball given that 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.300
 three stars to the guide 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:33.660
 so I do not know if you see her here 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.690
 I have a dawn on the radio how balls 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.070
 plastic trail is there so I 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.640
 my new walks warm up 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.140
 what I mean to chase them so we 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.670
 used to put cimino values 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.580
 the guy so say the new valve 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.780
 zicha on the ground and seems enormously 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.370
 agree to the palio ball which was a 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.190
 little rough that hangs a little bit at 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.519
 level at the fingers there we have 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.769
 really feel like we're getting dirty and 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:05.900
 it looks much more global 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.900
 current at the waist level 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.870
 as you will be able to see there is 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:16.740
 still a difference in size 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:19.590
 look at gold from the god part 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.630
 Trafficking a little difference, however 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.700
 I have the impression that the ball 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.680
 fabio is a little bigger 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.399
 but really it's very light but 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.820
 really compared to a base 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.369
 classical 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.900
 there's no photo the plastic ball with 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.770
 him 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.930
 so in conclusion at first the 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.780
 general aspe ball she looks like 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.040
 enormously a bullet in celluloid the 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.110
 difference and who were going bigger 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.630
 and especially it's the first bullets 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.130
 they were seamless we had 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.310
 the usual on a ball also loides 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:56.180
 one precisely there were seams 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:59.120
 so to bring together just the two 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.040
 ball games while there the ball 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.970
 is designed in one block 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.490
 so here he's going to have a big 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.250
 difference is especially in the game 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.100
 as we will see it all here 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.220
 so we continue this drop from 10 to more 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.220
 late
