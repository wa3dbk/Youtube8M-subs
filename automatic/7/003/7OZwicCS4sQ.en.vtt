00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:15.330
 good hello everyone again I have now 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.590
 the figure of sharon borsalino admiral 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.590
 of the marina 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.539
 how can I start big figure really 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.470
 I think that 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.400
 pretty well detailed 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.190
 an excellent painting job 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.030
 can see the coat 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.030
 in the yellow it seems to me rather golden 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.030
 Justice 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.790
 great detail of painting on the suit 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.790
 Excellent 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.739
 details of the face 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.739
 same 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.250
 great great figure 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.339
 I am very pleased to have it 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.339
 acquired 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.320
 until a yellow base indeed from 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.650
 that is my first my first figure of a 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.650
 Marine 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.010
 I believe that the one that follows would be here and not 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.430
 with card I do not know when we 're going to 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.430
 buy first 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:31.150
 maybe a borsalino marÃ­n 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.080
 justice martins 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.950
 is 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.950
 is to put me up 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.320
 there you can see it in its pose when 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.160
 appeared first in the 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.500
 archipelago trying to contact with 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.760
 seny took with the tend and black 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.760
 danced with him 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.050
 great excellent detail 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.070
 this 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.070
 the head turns 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.080
 in union of ball the lenses are already part 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.640
 mold yes indeed I think so 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.730
 comes in the box I think you can not 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.730
 remove 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.050
 bring 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.090
 a considerable number of accessories 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.130
 Really 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.000
 in fact some repeated only 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.000
 they change the color 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.159
 well here we have a hat 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.790
 that he uses in fact I think the first time 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.310
 that I saw it like that in the animal was when 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.720
 they were passing the flash backs of the 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.360
 saga of 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.520
 I say of the history of fischer tiger already 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.740
 they know on triton island everything that happened 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.410
 with arlon with ying 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.840
 and with the girl who was trying to return to 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.370
 his koala people 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.370
 it seems to me that this is how it appeared 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.160
 with his hat 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.410
 good they took us 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.700
 let's put other poses 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.700
 also with denmark 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.650
 Thank you 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.650
 we are 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.129
 the black mayor's hand is removed and 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.129
 it is placed in the other 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:40.460
 this is the pose of his attack I think 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.250
 that is called and they take out and not mom 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.960
 that he used against the submarine of or to 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.700
 end of the mind ford saga for 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.100
 try to stop it good without destroying it 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.560
 underwater fortunately not 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.710
 it worked yes and could continue the 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.710
 history 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.890
 if the hands turn really I do not know if 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.130
 they won record saying the pose to 5 towards 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.130
 down 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.390
 I think if it's up good 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.390
 no matter 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.159
 to see another pose 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.700
 They are a bit hard to get their arms out 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.380
 for this 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.380
 we can just put this 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.100
 which is from his sword of light 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.480
 and it seems that 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.009
 is called 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.240
 loves nomura like 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:55.669
 or opening the clouds of the equipment and 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.909
 there's what he used against the rail and a 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.909
 archipelago 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.759
 how can you see 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.760
 the extremities the ends of the 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:08.610
 arms are trans translucent 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.760
 to simulate that that part is made of 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.760
 light 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:19.090
 great detail like the accessories 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:21.280
 remaining the same no more than yes 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:25.510
 the translucent at the ends of the 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.100
 arms as you can see is equal 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.480
 I do not think it makes sense that 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.110
 put 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.110
 but good 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.640
 and so it is 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.689
 I think he has no more lung here 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:44.699
 can more or less 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:44.699
 create a pose that I think is not part 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.250
 of the original but the same is very good 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:58.029
 is the arm that comes in the box 

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:58.029
 originally 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.010
 the hand is removed 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.430
 this one is placed 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.470
 Y 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.070
 he puts on his back 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.120
 a small problem list 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.120
 and that 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.960
 Y 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:32.029
 let's put them 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.810
 on the list 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.810
 let's leave it a little 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.030
 It's another pose 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:51.889
 in fact it is a very good thing the 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.889
 I prefer over others is 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:07:00.470
 and so tonight I want hupond and when 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.860
 appears for the first time 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:05.449
 well I think it's all 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.729
 excellent book of great detail in the 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:11.409
 paint job I loved in the face 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:11.409
 of really little symbol 

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:17.840
 great great figure 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:20.889
 it came out quite expensive in fact it's very 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.889
 rare to get and right now 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.009
 if you ever see it and have the 

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:27.110
 opportunity to buy it do not doubt 

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:28.930
 really regret not going to have 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.490
 an excellent detail 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:33.250
 and he is also one of the admirals of the 

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:36.460
 next marina that I will try to get 

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:38.229
 be here and not and well I think it's 

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:41.750
 everything you already know in the 

00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:45.970
 comments I hope you liked it and 

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:45.970
 if it's all thanks until test
