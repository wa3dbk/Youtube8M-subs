00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.250
 hi girls new victims is required 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.900
 the one that paralyzes and smoothes the seeds 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.940
 you have me permanently in so many 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.779
 I finally managed to register the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.250
 all a gelich premise is sold 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.470
 currently in Italy only those who have the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.420
 VAT number from beauticians this is a 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.029
 very big limit because I started vat 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.650
 I'm not a beautician, I'm the only technique 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.660
 there is no law in lombardy that 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.059
 expect this thing so I don't see 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.140
 because I must be belittled 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.180
 so this thing really is me 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.850
 antipatico gelli share I bought it 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.200
 a little bit to the cosmoprof years ago why 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.239
 I had not been asked for the VAT number 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.280
 now I know for sure that they ask her to 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.010
 all and must also be beauticians 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.989
 girls are the alternative though 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.219
 are so many sites in England that 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.270
 sell them you can do very well 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.789
 to arrive in Italy 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.920
 this thing is obviously a limit 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.649
 always in Italy it goes well notice to 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.239
 let's talk about the video itself 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.700
 purchased the mini kit and in the kits and medium 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.830
 composed of the ph bond which is nothing but 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.619
 a moisturizer 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.390
 then the fondation that it would be 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.520
 practically their base 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.820
 then there are the colored ones and then the top 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.470
 it off which is the sealant as before 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.140
 what we have however removed the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.640
 previous semipermanent made there 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.049
 preparation that I refer you to another 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.330
 video of the preparation that is always the 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.640
 same and now we place moisturizers on 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.100
 all nails the rotating grid serves 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.320
 to make the seeds anyway 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.570
 permanent clings more to the nail 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.729
 because the entry and will succeed in 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.920
 hold on long to last much longer 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.420
 sorry now take the fondation ne 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.220
 need very little 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.049
 place it on the nail in the usual way 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.360
 system in the sense little product does not 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.710
 touch the cuticles but please 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.049
 cover the tip well because a 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.450
 the passage really important the 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.430
 put catalyze lamp if you have the 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.009
 normal lamp two minutes if you have the 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.509
 led lamp say 10 seconds however vi 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.369
 I assure you that now you make a finger 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.439
 passed the other hand because I make a 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.180
 finger at a time you don't even notice 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.190
 that the latter pass and among others 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.080
 things I tell you here too maybe I already have you 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.120
 said the led lamp makes me last the 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.200
 semi permanent very much more 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.849
 that is, I had 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.950
 after a week a week and a half 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.170
 every so often some nail splinters go 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.480
 now with the LED lamp up to two 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.489
 weeks the nails remain intact 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.680
 then of course some corner a little 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.580
 exists it rises small small starts to 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.920
 play 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.480
 in fact I used the LED lamp a 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.739
 you create a very important trick 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.390
 who taught me that he did it to you 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.000
 see several times to take a 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.950
 brush and remove it was dispersive 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.110
 because with the brush the right is taken away 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.299
 dispersive state quantity without 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.690
 however use the pad there 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.430
 I do not recommend this because it helps but helps 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.450
 really very much then the drafting 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.660
 hotel 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.340
 sorry for the permanent semi colored among 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.829
 the other things I remind you that already there 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.930
 it melts is removed from God and is 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.790
 really a great product the three and is 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.890
 among my favorites beyond fanciful 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.920
 so I use a lot of jellici 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.780
 whimsical now we always take a color 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.849
 I'm using everything gelli and clean well 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.489
 the brush because you have to do sight 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.099
 very very subtle states too 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.690
 here you do well the cuticle round you do well 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.150
 cover the surface well but me 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.829
 I recommend very very thin states 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.940
 because they really do a lot of it 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.440
 difference 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.569
 and I recommend covering also here 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.130
 tip but eye in this case too not 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.130
 put too much product on the tip 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.350
 because otherwise he sided more easily 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.970
 today there are many small tricks that 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.489
 as I started doing it 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.380
 you will be able to take better stretches 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.049
 really easily has beautiful ones 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.319
 I really like jellic colors 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.930
 put led led lamp 30 seconds 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.819
 normal lamp two minutes now do the 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.250
 second pass always very very much 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:53.400
 very very thin you see lamp 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.739
 same thing finally I to beautify a 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.019
 because then I will make a nail art I take 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.079
 the white france and I do on the ring finger 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.329
 a very single color and very white 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.040
 mangy to lay down because you know that 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.900
 are extended very well you see 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.359
 all the rules nor therefore admits 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.430
 camp rognoso same procedure e 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.079
 same things I told you before with the 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.910
 unlike white is very much 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.769
 more mushy and much more suitable 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.750
 obviously to make the French I have it 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.579
 used as a single color as seen in vi 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.019
 I repeat I find myself really very well with 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.849
 these products are tough they do n't 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.160
 really their effect 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:27.630
 then place the catalyzing lamp 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.700
 take the top that would be 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.740
 simply the sealant also in 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.380
 this case you have to put it not too much 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.930
 nail polish cover the tip well do not touch 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.000
 Obviously sometimes skin tends 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.760
 especially if you have not catalyzed 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.170
 who knows what is above the red 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.060
 dirty the brush a little 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.350
 worried is nothing serious 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.440
 also in this case when you have finished 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.990
 put lamp to catalyze e 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.390
 catalyzes normal lamp two minutes 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.580
 will learn led 30 seconds but I tell you 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.410
 it seems to me just because I do all 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.520
 these passages one finger at a time then 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.290
 puts a finger 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.480
 I make the other hand I put the other finger is 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:07.380
 that is, the seconds have already passed 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.360
 so I don't go much with the time 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.340
 LED lamp and it's really beautiful 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.200
 because it takes you away 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.940
 that is, it saves you a lot a lot 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.840
 of minutes brodetto two really has it 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.440
 much more 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.490
 I don't know if the led lamp is good or 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.950
 indicated but I saw a net 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.530
 difference as I told you what you do 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.090
 take a standard matte klien ser 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.950
 it is cleaned well degrease the 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.730
 surface put the oil cuticles and 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.280
 have you finished 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:35.250
 that 's all of course now 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.960
 I'm going to take off and I'll do it for you 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.520
 see this in another video anyway 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.530
 I wanted more than anything to make you 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.419
 see the jalisco product you have me 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.250
 asked in many and obviously the 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:47.810
 my opinion that I told you next 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.810
 video a big adult kiss
