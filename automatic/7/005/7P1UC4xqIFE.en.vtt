00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.930
 hi everyone today in kitchen for one 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.820
 let's make a hamburger style 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.609
 American first thing we're going to do 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.500
 is to fry the onion a little bit and to 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.910
 we have put a pan fire gale 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.820
 on strong fire 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.520
 we will throw like a couple of tablespoons of 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.559
 oil if it can be olive oil 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.650
 better and we wait for it to warm up a 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:41.320
 we'll throw the onion 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.750
 we have cut as you see in juliana as 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.850
 half onion if it is small if it is large 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.580
 well, a little less we move it 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.070
 constantly so that we do not burn 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.620
 and at this point we are going to pay and the 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.930
 let's take out next we'll put 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.900
 in a bowl as you can see a few 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.580
 of spinach leaves and let's line it up 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.580
 with a little salt 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.800
 a little pepper 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.460
 and a little olive oil 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.460
 and we'll move it a little bit and we're going to 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.670
 leave here 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.799
 and then put it in the hamburger 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.190
 Now let's add salt to the meat 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:29.380
 that are about 180 grams or so 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.619
 you can make more chubby or less beautiful 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:36.369
 as you want and we move it well so that 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.470
 take the salt the whole layer this is not a 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.020
 necessary step but if you have a mold 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.950
 circular like this you can take the 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.960
 meat and so it does not come out round but 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.869
 come on, you can make a ball 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.729
 put it in here in your hand and crush it 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.460
 what can be done wonderfully 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.470
 we have already done the following 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.970
 step will be to make the hamburger and to 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.030
 we are going to take advantage of the same pan 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.250
 where we have done the onion that already 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.380
 has a little oil and here the 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.600
 let's do let's hope that the 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.000
 pan is very hot because the 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.430
 we are going to make a strong fire so that 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.800
 we got well on the outside and we stayed 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.100
 juicy inside once it's already 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.680
 well warm we put the hamburger 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.430
 and we leave it like that on a very strong fire 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.530
 let's see how it is on this side 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.480
 and as you can see that it is already good we have 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.519
 turned around when you see that it is already 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.219
 well browned on both sides we are going to 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.560
 put the fire to the minimum of everything and the 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:37.689
 we are going to leave a good time so that 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.090
 make us a little bit more inside they have 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:42.489
 last about 15 minutes and we already have 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.409
 the meat ready and we're going to take it out 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.329
 dish once we have removed it from the 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.819
 We are going to put the cheese 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.620
 over so that it goes repeating itself 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.139
 last we are going to assemble our 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.900
 hamburger we put bread on the plate 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:59.470
 over we put the meat and now we're going 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.319
 to put the onion that we already have fried 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.889
 then we put the spinach 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:10.739
 that we already have aligned we know the 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:10.739
 mustard on the crispy onion 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.840
 and the other bread on top and we're going to put it 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.790
 a stick so that we do not fall and not 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.520
 there is better accompaniment for a 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.170
 hamburger that a few chips and 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.569
 as you see we have our list ready 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.569
 delicious American style burger
