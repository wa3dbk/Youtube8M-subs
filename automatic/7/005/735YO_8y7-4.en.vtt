00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
look between these two bolts so go up to

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.910 
look between these two bolts so go up to
it<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.690> keep<00:00:12.929> jumping<00:00:13.320> until<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:13.740> get<00:00:13.889> on

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
it and keep jumping until you get on

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.300 
it and keep jumping until you get on
this<00:00:14.400> invisible<00:00:15.120> ledge<00:00:15.920> so<00:00:16.920> once<00:00:17.100> you're<00:00:17.279> on

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
this invisible ledge so once you're on

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.040 
this invisible ledge so once you're on
top<00:00:17.550> of<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:17.760> invisible<00:00:18.270> ledge<00:00:18.480> what<00:00:18.960> you

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
top of this invisible ledge what you

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.870 
top of this invisible ledge what you
don't<00:00:19.230> want<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.500> do<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.830> look<00:00:20.039> under<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:20.580> F

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
don't want to do is look under this F

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.000 
don't want to do is look under this F
then<00:00:21.539> jump<00:00:21.869> back<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.140> then<00:00:22.410> jump<00:00:22.619> straight<00:00:22.949> to

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
then jump back and then jump straight to

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.710 
then jump back and then jump straight to
the<00:00:23.220> left<00:00:23.430> until<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.850> can<00:00:24.000> get<00:00:24.119> onto<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.510> door

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
the left until you can get onto the door

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.839 
the left until you can get onto the door
this<00:00:25.199> actually<00:00:25.410> takes<00:00:25.830> me<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.039> few<00:00:26.070> tries<00:00:26.580> but<00:00:26.609> I

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
this actually takes me a few tries but I

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.240 
this actually takes me a few tries but I
do<00:00:26.939> eventually<00:00:27.300> get<00:00:27.689> on<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:28.859> once<00:00:29.070> you're

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
do eventually get on it so once you're

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.560 
do eventually get on it so once you're
on<00:00:29.279> top<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:29.730> door<00:00:29.970> what<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.210> don't<00:00:30.390> want

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
on top of this door what you don't want

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.479 
on top of this door what you don't want
to<00:00:30.660> do<00:00:30.779> was<00:00:30.929> look<00:00:31.109> roughly<00:00:31.500> here<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:31.980> keep

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
to do was look roughly here and keep

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.010 
to do was look roughly here and keep
jumping<00:00:32.880> until<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.270> can<00:00:33.420> actually<00:00:33.570> get<00:00:33.870> on

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
jumping until you can actually get on

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.190 
jumping until you can actually get on
top<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.950> base<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.430> plate<00:00:35.809> it<00:00:36.809> may<00:00:36.989> take

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
top of the base of the plate it may take

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.660 
top of the base of the plate it may take
a<00:00:37.230> few<00:00:37.350> tries<00:00:37.800> but<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:38.129> will<00:00:38.370> get<00:00:38.550> on

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
a few tries but you will get on

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.549 
a few tries but you will get on
eventually<00:00:38.969> once<00:00:39.719> you're<00:00:39.899> on<00:00:39.930> put<00:00:40.230> down<00:00:40.379> your

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
eventually once you're on put down your

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.260 
eventually once you're on put down your
tactical<00:00:40.980> insertion<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.969> can<00:00:42.120> do

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
tactical insertion and you can do

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.910 
tactical insertion and you can do
whatever<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.719> want<00:00:42.899> from<00:00:43.140> here<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.559> can<00:00:43.590> see

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
whatever you want from here you can see

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.279 
whatever you want from here you can see
roughly<00:00:44.309> about<00:00:44.879> sixty<00:00:45.480> percent<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.989> them<00:00:46.110> up

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
roughly about sixty percent of them up

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.619 
roughly about sixty percent of them up
and<00:00:46.469> it's<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.649> really<00:00:46.860> good<00:00:46.980> spot<00:00:47.370> for<00:00:47.670> snipers

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
and it's a really good spot for snipers

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.330 
and it's a really good spot for snipers
who<00:00:48.870> want<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.170> shoot<00:00:49.350> at<00:00:49.559> long<00:00:49.739> distances

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
who want to shoot at long distances

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.450 
who want to shoot at long distances
taking<00:00:50.789> out<00:00:50.879> lots<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.420> different<00:00:51.780> people<00:00:52.460> so

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
taking out lots of different people so

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.790 
taking out lots of different people so
yeah<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.760> can<00:00:54.000> go<00:00:54.149> roughly<00:00:54.870> anywhere<00:00:55.110> on<00:00:55.620> this

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
yeah you can go roughly anywhere on this

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.439 
yeah you can go roughly anywhere on this
plane<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.219> can<00:00:56.340> get<00:00:56.520> on<00:00:56.670> top<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.059> area

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
plane you can get on top of this area

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.709 
plane you can get on top of this area
and<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.260> can<00:00:58.410> take<00:00:58.590> down<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.800> few<00:00:59.129> people<00:00:59.719> some

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
and you can take down a few people some

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.599 
and you can take down a few people some
good<00:01:00.960> spots<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.530> can't<00:01:01.739> actually<00:01:01.920> get<00:01:02.250> on<00:01:02.399> top

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
good spots you can't actually get on top

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.549 
good spots you can't actually get on top
of<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.820> main<00:01:03.030> building<00:01:03.059> for<00:01:03.629> terminal<00:01:04.049> that

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
of the main building for terminal that

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.810 
of the main building for terminal that
would<00:01:04.710> be<00:01:04.830> awesome<00:01:05.010> about<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.790> know

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
would be awesome about that you know

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.120 
would be awesome about that you know
that<00:01:06.180> I'd<00:01:06.270> probably<00:01:06.630> make<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:06.960> too<00:01:07.229> easy<00:01:07.260> so

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
that I'd probably make it too easy so

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.500 
that I'd probably make it too easy so
you<00:01:08.189> can<00:01:08.430> get<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.760> here<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.270> loop

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
you can get on here and you can loop

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.510 
you can get on here and you can loop
down<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.960> front<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> plane<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.340> can

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
down the front of the plane and you can

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.770 
down the front of the plane and you can
see<00:01:11.700> who's<00:01:11.939> coming<00:01:12.119> there<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.659> can

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
see who's coming there and you can

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.539 
see who's coming there and you can
hopefully<00:01:12.960> take<00:01:13.409> some<00:01:14.130> people<00:01:14.400> out<00:01:14.490> there

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
hopefully take some people out there

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.550 
hopefully take some people out there
without<00:01:14.880> them<00:01:15.240> spotting<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.409> is

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
without them spotting you and this is

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.980 
without them spotting you and this is
just<00:01:16.740> really<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.189> good<00:01:17.520> place<00:01:17.820> now<00:01:18.659> what<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.900> am

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
just really a good place now what I am

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.390 
just really a good place now what I am
going<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.320> show<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.680> another<00:01:19.979> way<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.159> get

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
going to show you is another way to get

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.340 
going to show you is another way to get
on<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:21.180> probably<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.570> bit<00:01:21.780> harder<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:22.229> if

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
on it it's probably a bit harder but if

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.690 
on it it's probably a bit harder but if
you're<00:01:22.500> struggling<00:01:22.799> going<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.310> top<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
you're struggling going on top of the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.100 
you're struggling going on top of the
plane<00:01:23.909> base<00:01:24.119> then<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.600> know<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:24.869> going<00:01:25.049> to
