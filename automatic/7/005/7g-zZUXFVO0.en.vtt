 when it decided to give a useful

 he usually passes on to those who acquire 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.640
 the end result of his work was 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.460
 a big challenge for us to get the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.160
 tire that is the ugly duckling of recycling 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.070
 become a beautiful raw material

 his job in jail like this. 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.430
 it took only two hours to be 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.210
 finished 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.409
 screwdrivers pole cuts knives and

 screwdrivers are some of the 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.950
 tools of the artisan and the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.159
 raw material 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.470
 are motorcycle tires , trucks and 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.590
 to tractors which become 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.710
 art real estate at low cost scattered 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.130
 all over the world besides putting the mark 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.409
 we put the avenue to the street 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.900
 where we found this tire and the 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.720
 amount needed to make 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.049
 have an idea our pool are 15 tires 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.000
 are two tires on top of the other and 13 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.579
 tires for cutting and then for playing 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.490
 Little does it put the validity 900 years there. 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.790
 the rest of the material left over from each 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:54.649
 parts is reused by the craftsman 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.860
 the works that make us do panels and 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.420
 keychains 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.540

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.610
 cost 45 thousand to make slippers because 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.290
 hours and cleto nothing is lost we have one 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.509
 saying here we do not understand why 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.920
 that people put a tire in the car 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.920
 the tire is for making art
