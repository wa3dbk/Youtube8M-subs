00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.350 
today we're gonna do an unboxing for the
PT<00:00:04.470> platinum<00:00:05.009> iPhone<00:00:05.879> 6<00:00:06.799> case<00:00:08.030> this<00:00:09.030> will

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
PT platinum iPhone 6 case this will

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.190 
PT platinum iPhone 6 case this will
state<00:00:10.019> that<00:00:10.440> is<00:00:10.590> genuine<00:00:11.370> wood<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.240> this

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
state that is genuine wood and this

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.680 
state that is genuine wood and this
would<00:00:13.380> be<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.710> black<00:00:14.160> walnut<00:00:14.759> case<00:00:15.089> so<00:00:15.540> it

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
would be the black walnut case so it

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.680 
would be the black walnut case so it
looks<00:00:15.870> pretty<00:00:16.199> fancy<00:00:16.940> pretty<00:00:17.940> legit<00:00:18.480> I

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
looks pretty fancy pretty legit I

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.510 
looks pretty fancy pretty legit I
haven't<00:00:19.109> seen<00:00:19.260> anything<00:00:19.650> like<00:00:19.680> this<00:00:20.130> out

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
haven't seen anything like this out

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.970 
haven't seen anything like this out
there<00:00:20.750> so<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.080> one<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.410> main<00:00:22.590> reasons

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
there so this is one of the main reasons

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.740 
there so this is one of the main reasons
I<00:00:23.070> got<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.400> case<00:00:23.670> he<00:00:24.029> looked<00:00:24.269> at<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.449> part

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
I got this case he looked at the part

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.990 
I got this case he looked at the part
from<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.560> rest<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.949> cases<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.789> have

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
from the rest of the cases that I have

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.540 
from the rest of the cases that I have
unboxed<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.080> reviewed<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:29.220> let's<00:00:29.400> actually

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
unboxed and reviewed so let's actually

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.749 
unboxed and reviewed so let's actually
go<00:00:29.760> ahead<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.769> see<00:00:31.769> how<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.070> looks<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.399> how<00:00:32.610> it

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
go ahead and see how it looks on how it

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.090 
go ahead and see how it looks on how it
fits<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.300> iPhone<00:00:33.570> 6<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.989> if<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.770> provides

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
fits on the iPhone 6 and if it provides

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.010 
fits on the iPhone 6 and if it provides
some<00:00:35.760> sort<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.030> protection<00:00:36.390> which<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.719> very

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
some sort of protection which is very

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.840 
some sort of protection which is very
important<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.620> want<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.860> take<00:00:38.100> care<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.309> fn6

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
important you want to take care of fn6

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.270 
important you want to take care of fn6
so<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.690> doesn't<00:00:39.960> get<00:00:40.050> scratched<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.800> before

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
so it doesn't get scratched so before

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.709 
so it doesn't get scratched so before
actually<00:00:41.370> going<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.120> buying<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.480> case

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
no planning on the inside it which is

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.520 
no planning on the inside it which is
weird<00:01:29.070> but<00:01:29.549> that's<00:01:29.759> pretty<00:01:29.939> critical<00:01:30.530> only

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
weird but that's pretty critical only

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.410

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
I do recommend it the lip there's a

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.289 
I do recommend it the lip there's a
little<00:02:15.230> bit<00:02:15.319> of<00:02:15.409> lip<00:02:15.560> on<00:02:16.099> this<00:02:16.400> actual<00:02:16.879> case<00:02:17.090> so

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
little bit of lip on this actual case so

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.390 
little bit of lip on this actual case so
when<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:17.540> put<00:02:17.720> a<00:02:17.750> face<00:02:17.810> down<00:02:18.340> shouldn't<00:02:19.340> be

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
when you put a face down shouldn't be

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.740 
when you put a face down shouldn't be
that<00:02:19.549> much<00:02:19.640> of<00:02:19.700> a<00:02:19.849> problem<00:02:20.000> but<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.450> wouldn't

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
that much of a problem but I wouldn't

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.360 
that much of a problem but I wouldn't
suggest<00:02:20.930> it<00:02:21.310> now<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.760> camera<00:02:23.120> port<00:02:24.370> camera

protected let me tell you that this is

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.140 
protected let me tell you that this is
one<00:02:29.780> of<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.959> best<00:02:30.140> cases<00:02:30.379> that<00:02:30.799> I've<00:02:30.950> seen

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
one of the best cases that I've seen

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.119 
one of the best cases that I've seen
that<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.299> actual<00:02:32.629> color<00:02:32.989> is<00:02:33.290> very<00:02:33.500> deep<00:02:33.920> and

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
that the actual color is very deep and

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.580 
that the actual color is very deep and
it<00:02:35.000> will<00:02:35.090> protect<00:02:35.269> the<00:02:35.660> camera<00:02:35.870> lens<00:02:36.170> when<00:02:36.500> you

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
it will protect the camera lens when you

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.130 
it will protect the camera lens when you
put<00:02:36.799> it<00:02:36.920> like<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:37.310> so<00:02:38.060> that<00:02:38.690> should<00:02:38.930> be<00:02:39.110> a

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
put it like that so that should be a

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.990 
put it like that so that should be a
problem<00:02:39.620> do<00:02:39.829> I<00:02:39.860> recommend<00:02:40.400> this<00:02:40.489> case<00:02:40.790> if

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000
