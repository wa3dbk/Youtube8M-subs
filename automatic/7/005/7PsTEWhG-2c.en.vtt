00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.120 

alright<00:00:08.320> today<00:00:08.559> we<00:00:08.740> are<00:00:08.799> going<00:00:08.889> to<00:00:08.950> take<00:00:09.100> a

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.130 
alright today we are going to take a

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.049 
alright today we are going to take a
quick<00:00:09.309> look<00:00:09.520> at<00:00:09.670> the<00:00:09.760> GF<00:00:10.210> 93<00:00:10.990> 8e<00:00:11.860> from<00:00:12.610> zotac

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.059 
quick look at the GF 93 8e from zotac

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.060 
quick look at the GF 93 8e from zotac
and<00:00:13.240> this<00:00:13.330> is<00:00:13.420> a<00:00:13.450> really<00:00:13.780> nice<00:00:13.870> board<00:00:14.170> on<00:00:14.349> board

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070 
and this is a really nice board on board

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.010 
and this is a really nice board on board
geforce<00:00:15.639> 9300<00:00:16.059> so<00:00:16.480> if<00:00:16.630> you<00:00:16.720> don't<00:00:16.840> know<00:00:16.900> that

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 
geforce 9300 so if you don't know that

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.780 
geforce 9300 so if you don't know that
any<00:00:17.140> 300<00:00:17.470> geforce<00:00:17.770> chipset<00:00:18.189> what's<00:00:18.640> really

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:18.790 
any 300 geforce chipset what's really

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.490 
any 300 geforce chipset what's really
good<00:00:19.000> about<00:00:19.029> it<00:00:19.360> is<00:00:19.420> it<00:00:19.570> lets<00:00:19.720> you<00:00:19.810> do<00:00:19.930> 1080p

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
good about it is it lets you do 1080p

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.010 
good about it is it lets you do 1080p
it'll<00:00:21.160> actually<00:00:21.279> let<00:00:21.520> you<00:00:21.609> do<00:00:21.699> about<00:00:21.940> 2<00:00:22.359> 1080p

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.020 
it'll actually let you do about 2 1080p

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.679 
it'll actually let you do about 2 1080p
blu<00:00:23.320> rays<00:00:23.470> at<00:00:23.650> the<00:00:24.010> same<00:00:24.220> time<00:00:24.510> decoding<00:00:25.510> wise

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
blu rays at the same time decoding wise

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:26.970 
blu rays at the same time decoding wise
so<00:00:26.020> it's<00:00:26.170> all<00:00:26.260> right<00:00:26.350> amount<00:00:26.500> of<00:00:26.529> CPU<00:00:26.680> you

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
so it's all right amount of CPU you

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.310 
so it's all right amount of CPU you
don't<00:00:27.130> have<00:00:27.250> a<00:00:27.310> graphics<00:00:27.699> card<00:00:27.760> but<00:00:28.420> if<00:00:29.019> you<00:00:29.170> so

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
don't have a graphics card but if you so

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.960 
don't have a graphics card but if you so
desire<00:00:29.619> you<00:00:29.830> can<00:00:29.980> definitely<00:00:30.279> add<00:00:30.699> once

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
desire you can definitely add once

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.390 
desire you can definitely add once
that's<00:00:31.180> really<00:00:31.660> cool<00:00:31.840> on<00:00:31.990> top<00:00:32.230> of<00:00:32.379> that<00:00:32.529> it's<00:00:33.190> a

desired now what's really cool is also
is<00:00:52.899> they<00:00:52.960> have<00:00:53.079> four<00:00:53.410> dims<00:00:53.739> on<00:00:53.920> this<00:00:54.010> micro<00:00:54.280> ATX

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
is they have four dims on this micro ATX

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.100 
is they have four dims on this micro ATX
board<00:00:54.760> so<00:00:54.879> you<00:00:54.969> can't<00:00:55.180> put<00:00:55.300> up<00:00:55.390> to<00:00:55.480> 16

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110

want<00:00:59.860> a<00:00:59.949> pie<00:01:00.129> want<00:01:00.280> to<00:01:00.340> stick<00:01:00.460> to<00:01:00.579> the<00:01:00.640> two

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
want a pie want to stick to the two

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.910 
want a pie want to stick to the two
gigabyte<00:01:01.329> dims<00:01:01.600> and<00:01:01.870> put<00:01:02.020> four<00:01:02.320> in<00:01:02.350> here<00:01:02.739> or

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
gigabyte dims and put four in here or

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.189 
gigabyte dims and put four in here or
maybe<00:01:03.550> just<00:01:03.699> even<00:01:03.969> two<00:01:04.239> and<00:01:04.360> run<00:01:04.449> some<00:01:04.600> XP<00:01:05.080> on

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
maybe just even two and run some XP on

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.800 
maybe just even two and run some XP on
here<00:01:05.500> with<00:01:06.130> that<00:01:06.280> 9300<00:01:06.880> mobile<00:01:07.119> chipset<00:01:07.450> also

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
here with that 9300 mobile chipset also

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.880 
here with that 9300 mobile chipset also
what's<00:01:07.960> really<00:01:08.140> cool<00:01:08.289> to<00:01:08.440> knows<00:01:08.590> that<00:01:08.710> you<00:01:08.799> do

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
what's really cool to knows that you do

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.250 
what's really cool to knows that you do
have<00:01:09.010> an<00:01:09.070> HDMI<00:01:09.490> in<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.700> back<00:01:09.850> right<00:01:10.780> there<00:01:11.049> so

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
have an HDMI in the back right there so

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.600 
have an HDMI in the back right there so
that's<00:01:11.320> really<00:01:11.500> cool<00:01:11.770> and<00:01:12.010> because<00:01:12.220> the<00:01:12.400> nine

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
that's really cool and because the nine

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.340 
that's really cool and because the nine
series<00:01:12.939> chipset<00:01:13.630> instead<00:01:14.080> of<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.229> eighth

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
series chipset instead of the eighth

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.630 
series chipset instead of the eighth
series<00:01:14.560> you<00:01:14.710> actually<00:01:14.920> didn't<00:01:15.070> get<00:01:15.189> audio

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
series you actually didn't get audio

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.399 
series you actually didn't get audio
through<00:01:15.939> here<00:01:16.150> which<00:01:16.299> is<00:01:16.390> incredible<00:01:16.869> that's

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
through here which is incredible that's

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.219 
through here which is incredible that's
going<00:01:17.500> to<00:01:17.590> be<00:01:17.700> 7.1<00:01:18.700> channels<00:01:19.119> of<00:01:19.240> HD<00:01:19.750> audio<00:01:20.140> are
