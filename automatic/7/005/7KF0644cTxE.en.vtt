out now one of the first brand new

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.520 
out now one of the first brand new
mechanics<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> game<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.320> have

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
mechanics in the game is that you have

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.760 
mechanics in the game is that you have
the<00:00:52.739> ability<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.280> have<00:00:54.059> access<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:55.230> both

actual usable ultra 18 ultra 2 comma in
a<00:01:02.010> single<00:01:02.309> metro<00:01:02.699> now<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.539> trade-off<00:01:04.199> of

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
a single metro now the trade-off of

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.469 
a single metro now the trade-off of
using<00:01:05.010> both<00:01:05.220> ultras<00:01:05.729> now<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.150> time<00:01:06.360> around

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
using both ultras now this time around

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.440 
using both ultras now this time around
with<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.350> option<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.580> fact<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.000> it

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
with this option is the fact that it

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.219 
with this option is the fact that it
will<00:01:09.689> not<00:01:09.869> do<00:01:10.200> as<00:01:10.350> much<00:01:10.740> damage<00:01:10.770> as<00:01:11.659> know<00:01:12.659> they

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
will not do as much damage as know they

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.899 
will not do as much damage as know they
originally<00:01:13.710> intended<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.130> if<00:01:14.430> you're<00:01:14.700> using

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
originally intended to if you're using

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.050 
originally intended to if you're using
the<00:01:15.150> whole<00:01:15.450> trough<00:01:16.130> however<00:01:17.130> some<00:01:17.460> characters

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
the whole trough however some characters

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.510 
the whole trough however some characters
can<00:01:18.360> benefit<00:01:18.930> from<00:01:18.960> having<00:01:19.290> both<00:01:19.680> ultra<00:01:20.310> and

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
can benefit from having both ultra and

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.630 
can benefit from having both ultra and
you<00:01:20.970> know<00:01:21.090> not<00:01:21.720> all<00:01:22.020> ultras<00:01:22.710> are<00:01:22.890> there<00:01:23.189> for

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
you know not all ultras are there for

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.179 
you know not all ultras are there for
damage<00:01:24.119> most<00:01:24.540> all<00:01:24.840> tools<00:01:25.140> are<00:01:25.500> used<00:01:25.890> for

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
damage most all tools are used for

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.899 
damage most all tools are used for
positioning<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.619> course<00:01:28.950> creating<00:01:29.700> you

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
positioning and of course creating you

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.719 
positioning and of course creating you
know<00:01:29.970> situations<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.590> know<00:01:31.740> control

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
know situations and you know control

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.710 
know situations and you know control
things<00:01:33.420> like<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:35.060> having<00:01:36.060> pope<00:01:36.270> ultras

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
things like that so having pope ultras

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.420 
things like that so having pope ultras
is<00:01:36.810> gonna<00:01:36.990> have<00:01:37.200> set<00:01:37.470> up<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.710> lot<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.950> mind<00:01:38.280> games

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
is gonna have set up a lot of mind games

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.850 
is gonna have set up a lot of mind games
because<00:01:38.970> there's<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.360> much<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.869> them<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.740> know

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
because there's so much of them you know

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.560 
because there's so much of them you know
there<00:01:41.040> are<00:01:41.070> fairly<00:01:41.430> good<00:01:41.790> but<00:01:42.119> we<00:01:42.270> rarely

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
there are fairly good but we rarely

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.420 
there are fairly good but we rarely
don't<00:01:43.020> see<00:01:43.320> them<00:01:43.530> just<00:01:43.799> because<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.310> know

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
don't see them just because of you know

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.450 
don't see them just because of you know
the<00:01:44.520> situation<00:01:45.560> but<00:01:46.560> having<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:46.979> option<00:01:47.340> now

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
the situation but having this option now

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.999 
the situation but having this option now
makes<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.970> situation<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.540> lot<00:01:48.659> more<00:01:48.950> let's<00:01:49.950> say

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
makes the situation a lot more let's say

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.940 
makes the situation a lot more let's say
i<00:01:50.100> think<00:01:50.549> possible<00:01:51.090> does<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.479> term<00:01:51.860> some<00:01:52.860> of

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
i think possible does the term some of

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.830 
i think possible does the term some of
the<00:01:53.040> characters<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.119> roster<00:01:54.630> will

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
the characters in the in the roster will

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.929 
the characters in the in the roster will
benefit<00:01:55.350> from<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.560> for<00:01:55.950> example<00:01:56.219> Zangief

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
benefit from this for example Zangief

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.539 
benefit from this for example Zangief
could<00:01:57.180> benefit<00:01:57.570> from<00:01:57.630> both<00:01:58.020> ultras<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.829> you

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
could benefit from both ultras and you

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.640 
could benefit from both ultras and you
don't<00:01:59.700> like<00:01:59.909> i<00:01:59.939> said<00:02:00.180> doesn't<00:02:00.509> do<00:02:00.600> much<00:02:00.780> damage

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
don't like i said doesn't do much damage

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.390 
don't like i said doesn't do much damage
situation<00:02:03.550> Phil<00:02:04.180> control<00:02:04.690> a<00:02:04.720> lot<00:02:05.380> more<00:02:05.830> better

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
situation Phil control a lot more better

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.020 
situation Phil control a lot more better
than<00:02:06.760> you<00:02:06.880> used<00:02:07.150> to<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.950> they're<00:02:09.610> probably<00:02:09.640> see

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
than you used to so they're probably see

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.670 
than you used to so they're probably see
more<00:02:10.270> keeps<00:02:10.660> this<00:02:10.840> time<00:02:11.080> around<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:11.560> I

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
more keeps this time around and I

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.100 
more keeps this time around and I
believe<00:02:12.490> that<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.790> lot<00:02:13.000> of<00:02:13.120> rapper<00:02:13.570> characters

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
believe that a lot of rapper characters

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.760 
believe that a lot of rapper characters
will<00:02:14.680> go<00:02:14.890> up<00:02:15.070> in<00:02:15.250> tears<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:16.630> when<00:02:17.110> ultra<00:02:17.530> comes

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
will go up in tears and when ultra comes

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.640 
will go up in tears and when ultra comes
out<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:19.390> that's<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:19.660> very<00:02:19.690> unique<00:02:20.110> thing<00:02:20.380> and<00:02:20.590> I

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
out so that's a very unique thing and I

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.200 
out so that's a very unique thing and I
think<00:02:20.860> some<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.310> characters<00:02:21.760> might<00:02:22.030> be

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
think some of the characters might be

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.990 
think some of the characters might be
done<00:02:22.510> deadlier<00:02:23.170> than<00:02:23.290> before<00:02:23.910> even<00:02:24.910> though

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
done deadlier than before even though

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000 
done deadlier than before even though
they<00:02:25.180> think<00:02:25.450> they<00:02:25.660> might<00:02:25.840> get<00:02:26.050> nerve<00:02:26.290> I<00:02:26.620> feel

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
they think they might get nerve I feel

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.500 
they think they might get nerve I feel
like<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.280> make<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.460> deleter<00:02:27.940> before<00:02:28.390> the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
like to make a deleter before the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.470 
like to make a deleter before the
characters<00:02:28.930> like<00:02:29.580> Fei<00:02:30.580> Long<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.210> kami

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
characters like Fei Long and kami

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.930 
characters like Fei Long and kami
because<00:02:31.840> they<00:02:31.990> both<00:02:32.170> have<00:02:32.440> similar<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.910> know

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
because they both have similar you know

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.440 
because they both have similar you know
rush<00:02:34.270> down<00:02:35.430> mechanics<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.670> they<00:02:37.000> both<00:02:37.209> have

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
rush down mechanics and they both have

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.000 
rush down mechanics and they both have
similar<00:02:37.660> ultras<00:02:38.290> if<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:38.500> think<00:02:38.709> about<00:02:38.800> it

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
similar ultras if you think about it

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.280 
similar ultras if you think about it
they<00:02:39.220> both<00:02:39.430> have<00:02:39.700> an<00:02:39.970> ultra<00:02:40.570> that<00:02:40.750> advances

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
they both have an ultra that advances

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.130 
they both have an ultra that advances
forward<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:42.010> it<00:02:42.340> does<00:02:42.550> get<00:02:42.940> damaged<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.660> they

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
forward and it does get damaged and they

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.080 
forward and it does get damaged and they
both<00:02:44.350> have<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.590> counter<00:02:45.040> ultra<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.640> most<00:02:45.940> the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
both have a counter ultra and most the

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.090 
both have a counter ultra and most the
time<00:02:46.270> that<00:02:46.480> counter<00:02:46.810> ultras<00:02:47.200> use<00:02:47.470> for<00:02:47.830> like

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
time that counter ultras use for like

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.510 
time that counter ultras use for like
you<00:02:48.310> know<00:02:49.200> people<00:02:50.200> that<00:02:50.320> are<00:02:50.440> trying<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.920> you

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
you know people that are trying to you

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.330 
you know people that are trying to you
know<00:02:51.750> uppercut<00:02:52.750> all<00:02:52.930> of<00:02:53.050> a<00:02:53.140> son<00:02:53.380> or<00:02:53.680> you<00:02:54.220> know

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
know uppercut all of a son or you know

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.330 
know uppercut all of a son or you know
dive<00:02:54.610> kicks<00:02:55.030> you<00:02:55.630> know<00:02:55.660> you<00:02:55.870> rarely<00:02:56.470> see<00:02:56.890> it<00:02:57.070> so

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
dive kicks you know you rarely see it so

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.340 
dive kicks you know you rarely see it so
it's<00:02:58.120> going<00:02:58.330> to<00:02:58.420> create<00:02:58.600> a<00:02:58.720> lot<00:02:58.990> of<00:02:59.020> situations

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
it's going to create a lot of situations

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.440 
it's going to create a lot of situations
on<00:03:00.130> a<00:03:00.160> lot<00:03:00.370> of<00:03:00.520> mind<00:03:00.760> games<00:03:00.850> so<00:03:01.120> that's<00:03:01.270> going

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
on a lot of mind games so that's going

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.840 
on a lot of mind games so that's going
to<00:03:01.510> be<00:03:01.630> very<00:03:01.660> very<00:03:02.380> interesting<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:03.130> it's<00:03:03.340> if

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
to be very very interesting and it's if

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.699 
to be very very interesting and it's if
that<00:03:04.120> will<00:03:04.300> play<00:03:04.510> out<00:03:04.540> very<00:03:04.870> differently<00:03:04.930> than

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
that will play out very differently than

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.680 
that will play out very differently than
the<00:03:06.220> current<00:03:06.459> status<00:03:06.820> through<00:03:07.120> fire<00:03:07.330> for<00:03:07.360> it

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
the current status through fire for it

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.460 
the current status through fire for it
is<00:03:07.810> in<00:03:08.019> right<00:03:08.200> now<00:03:09.780> now<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.900> other<00:03:11.200> new

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
is in right now now the other new

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.380 
is in right now now the other new
mechanic<00:03:12.010> that<00:03:12.040> has<00:03:12.340> been<00:03:12.550> announced<00:03:12.940> as<00:03:13.090> red

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
mechanic that has been announced as red

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.630 
mechanic that has been announced as red
focus<00:03:13.690> basically<00:03:14.680> this<00:03:14.860> is<00:03:14.920> a<00:03:15.310> beefed-up

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
focus basically this is a beefed-up

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.750 
focus basically this is a beefed-up
version<00:03:15.940> of<00:03:16.600> focus<00:03:17.200> attack<00:03:17.500> which<00:03:18.310> means<00:03:18.550> is

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
version of focus attack which means is

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.330 
version of focus attack which means is
that<00:03:18.790> it<00:03:19.120> could<00:03:19.239> absorb<00:03:19.860> multiple<00:03:20.860> hits<00:03:21.100> I'm

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
that it could absorb multiple hits I'm

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.390 
that it could absorb multiple hits I'm
assuming<00:03:21.790> it's<00:03:21.880> three<00:03:22.360> hits<00:03:22.690> so<00:03:23.110> far<00:03:23.440> three<00:03:24.250> or

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
assuming it's three hits so far three or

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.400 
assuming it's three hits so far three or
four<00:03:24.640> hits<00:03:24.910> but<00:03:25.300> however<00:03:25.450> it<00:03:25.810> does<00:03:26.019> have<00:03:26.050> the

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
four hits but however it does have the

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.490 
four hits but however it does have the
same<00:03:26.650> weaknesses<00:03:27.370> as<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:28.570> regular<00:03:29.080> focus

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
same weaknesses as the regular focus

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.080 
same weaknesses as the regular focus
meaning<00:03:29.860> that<00:03:30.040> it's<00:03:30.340> you're<00:03:30.790> still

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
meaning that it's you're still

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.199 
meaning that it's you're still
vulnerable<00:03:31.300> to<00:03:31.840> throws<00:03:32.519> command<00:03:33.519> grabs<00:03:33.820> and

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
vulnerable to throws command grabs and

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.920 
vulnerable to throws command grabs and
armor<00:03:35.170> breaking<00:03:35.860> attacks<00:03:36.550> for<00:03:37.330> example<00:03:37.780> if

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
armor breaking attacks for example if

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.500 
armor breaking attacks for example if
you<00:03:38.080> do<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.260> red<00:03:38.680> focus<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.640> let's<00:03:39.880> say<00:03:40.060> a<00:03:40.090> girls

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
you do a red focus and let's say a girls

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.310 
you do a red focus and let's say a girls
day<00:03:40.810> for<00:03:41.140> you<00:03:42.150> let's<00:03:43.150> say<00:03:43.269> the<00:03:43.420> reef<00:03:43.690> spots<00:03:44.050> it

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
day for you let's say the reef spots it

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.550 
day for you let's say the reef spots it
the<00:03:44.560> red<00:03:44.739> focus<00:03:45.190> he<00:03:45.340> can<00:03:45.519> still<00:03:45.760> do<00:03:45.940> a<00:03:45.970> a<00:03:46.810> ground

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
the red focus he can still do a a ground

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.100 
the red focus he can still do a a ground
a<00:03:47.980> hurricane<00:03:48.610> kick<00:03:48.910> and<00:03:49.390> we'll<00:03:49.720> be<00:03:49.870> able<00:03:49.989> to

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
a hurricane kick and we'll be able to

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.470 
a hurricane kick and we'll be able to
knock<00:03:50.320> you<00:03:50.530> out<00:03:50.680> of<00:03:50.799> that<00:03:51.160> focus<00:03:51.700> so<00:03:51.910> it's

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
knock you out of that focus so it's

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.840
