00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.120
 What do you need a last minute idea for your halloween team 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.360
 you need normal white paper 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.500
 any type of cardboard 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.660
 pencil 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.580
 Tigers 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.020
 ruler and meter 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.380
 paint or colored paper for your design! 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.680
 let's start 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.460
 Use a tape measure to measure the area on the face that you would like the mask to cover 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.240
 width, length 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.620
 Take fot notes for the width and height of the mask according to how you would like it to look on your face 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.100
 and draw the square that has been measured on the sheet of paper 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.700
 It should look like this 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.580
 and then cut the square ... 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.820
 ... And then fold in half! 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.040
 With the open side to the right you can now draw the star from the middle of your mask! 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.240
 keep drawing until you're satisfied with the way it looks 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.440
 Do not forget to draw your eyes! I should be in this area like here! 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.080
 then everything is cut! 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.900
 After that track your pattern on the colored paper or skip this step if you want to use the paint instead! 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.240
 cut it out as well and trace it onto your cardboard 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.640
 and cut again 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.320
 Now you can paste on the paper or you can start painting your mask 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.540
 If you paste on the paper, leave these parts without glue ... you will see why! 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:10.720
 then put the mask on the edge of the table and roll it around the corner like this ... you should get a more round shape 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.880
 You can paint on the mask with golden color and use brightness if you want! for the edges I used sequins 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.520
 (If you have a little more time left ...) 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.500
 you will need glue magic art by Rico design 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.800
 glue with glitter 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.600
 magic art transfer film in gold 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.220
 and you will need decorative elements for the edges 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.440
 first star drawing a design on the mask using any bright colored pencil (I'm using bright orange) 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.960
 this external line will be my frame where I will stick in the back seat 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.380
 Keep drawing until you are satisfied with the design 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:11.160
 adhesive is applied on the lines of the design 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.040
 Allow the glue to dry until it is completely clear 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.780
 and it should look like this 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:42.620
 Now that you can finally use the role of magic 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:58.060
 then you can fill in the spaces with the glitter glue 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.260
 Now let's dry and it's almost finished 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.480
 After the glue dries, it's time to paste in the trim to the edges 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:33.020
 we open the holes on the sides, we put the tape on both sides 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:44.300
 and we finished our mask
