00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.290
 good evening welcome to the plus 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.150
 conference after the competition 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.240
 Almere City FC 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.080
 no nec nijmegen on Friday 18 October 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.420
 next to both both trainers and first 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.550
 I want to give the floor to ruud and bread 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.470
 and also congratulate the certain van 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.000
 this period title 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.990
 thank you yes nothing pagan beautiful without 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.970
 blow 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.990
 that is the van almere city regardless of their 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.000
 position that yes they are also pretty good 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.620
 have a game concept 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.260
 combination of playing football and of course 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.440
 also in the cup last week 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.730
 so have thrown out ado the hague 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.890
 our optics 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.530
 much seriously picked up when you are the first 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.570
 helps then look at tactics 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.860
 I did not find ourselves defensively good 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.300
 stand 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.610
 had some quicker to remember 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.110
 a certain side that gives you it 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.090
 from there 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.129
 easier football is already 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.730
 that for us the space on the sides 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.149
 lay it upon our wingers or 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.549
 emerging backs 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.979
 he thought the if was quite full 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.810
 that we create little and also little 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.580
 and had out of nowhere 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.409
 we could score fantastic I could with 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.330
 alireza 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.800
 but of course we were not satisfied 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.040
 of course we also have one 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.030
 had time to discuss that with it 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.020
 delay 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.990
 and then of course you get the 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.400
 0 2 we also understand 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.280
 gunshot 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.370
 tom dame already had a yellow card in his pocket 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.020
 but i didn't want any 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.720
 risk minus 1 because we do not always have the 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.240
 control the match you had and 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.880
 we also found a lot with a point of contact 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.070
 as a christian a nielson 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.420
 well that together sjoerd ars wants something 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.070
 thrust 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.100
 could put in the session after that you saw 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.650
 I think in the combinations 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.570
 when we made the 0 2 but it gave us 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.810
 not yet feel like it's spelled 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.810
 used to be 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.890
 yes you will see that you do not neither the 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.420
 ruthlessness of 0 3 possibly 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.040
 and finally you give a free one 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.690
 kick the stairs and they are used to shooting 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.510
 of course we can get in well there 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.690
 internal to already have that not 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.100
 well I would have a branch that we would 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.630
 win two one you don't want too much 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.700
 you take a period title 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.280
 that indicates something about that period that 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.980
 is three months I think we as nse 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.900
 are the organization of oneself to one 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.830
 piece of rewards we've had on 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.530
 being away 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.760
 it provides a means of promotion 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.800
 the playoffs 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.480
 Everyone knows that our goal is that 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.160
 and preferably immediately yes we can now 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.050
 just sit back and enjoy there 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.420
 to celebrate the party tonight 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.310
 so that also means endangered calling number 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.930
 who were there with the supporters in the 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.190
 sponsors 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.510
 so we are very happy about that 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.520
 everyone could see that too 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.380
 a lot of work on it 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.560
 to the store but let's the 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.270
 Give compliments to all those people who 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.610
 nse warm heart and the name 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.020
 thank you my pilot 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.390
 thank you now give the floor to it 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.570
 greasy yes our story is natural 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.640
 otherwise we yearn for a victory 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.000
 we make good football every week 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.880
 see well-groomed football and we pull 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.130
 only then at the longest end 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.440
 tonight you know that nec is visiting 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:33.010
 is simply the best team at the moment 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.330
 in my eyes the mortgage and shifts 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.760
 that is well balanced 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.680
 who is physically strong and yet a number 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.960
 Players have those immediately a 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.850
 have experienced another that is very 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.190
 definitely a surplus 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.260
 but when you look at the how we are there 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.150
 against football and what we show 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.980
 then I have to say that honestly 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.670
 it is 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.160
 as we like as I want 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:00.160
 only the code we get 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.680
 is out again and a dead game moment and 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.280
 that's been happening a number of times 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.290
 season 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.930
 and I think that's the subtlety 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.600
 where we lose matches then goes 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.920
 it often blocking balls duel 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.050
 play 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.389
 have knife between the teeth at that 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.530
 type of situations such as corners and free 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.060
 kick 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.010
 yes we just have to look there 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.990
 work together because that is something 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.419
 repeated again and again 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.830
 yes and at times we also have real opportunities 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.510
 then we also need some more 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.720
 have thrust than that tree must also 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:36.100
 really about the tool line of course one 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.750
 delays had was just after the first 0 or I 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.340
 or should I say that one 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.710
 advantage was over disadvantage 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.050
 I had the idea that my team is losing 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.520
 at that moment just by we could 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.990
 play football and the head with it 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.500
 so for that matter it is then one 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:53.080
 disadvantage that we therefore very quickly after rest 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.669
 the 0 2 come yes this is very difficult 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.190
 and we still show resilience 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:00.340
 continue to make a good free kick 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.020
 eventually the 1 2 and then it is think 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.590
 I regret for us that we are not the two 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:09.220
 make two and that yes that was in terms of commitment 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.780
 and in terms of playing experience in any case 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.910
 yes well deserved if I want 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.740
 say that in ec also regiment also the 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.020
 pull the trigger and if you do 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.400
 done then and show what is much in the 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.560
 decided on this one 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.880
 blood congratulations and good luck 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:28.180

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.710

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.430

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.800

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:37.239
 here I sit we go for each side
