a boat or on the land in a burning
building<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.630> i<00:01:25.350> think<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.100> i<00:01:26.130> would

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340

building and i think that i would
definitely<00:01:26.850> definitely<00:01:27.390> burn<00:01:27.960> him<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.350> a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.410 
definitely definitely burn him in a
building<00:01:28.890> because<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:30.119> know<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.360> just

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
building because you know it's just

building because you know it's just
faster<00:01:30.750> but<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.229> oh<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:32.159> understand<00:01:32.729> it's<00:01:32.939> gonna

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
faster but I oh I understand it's gonna

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.830 
faster but I oh I understand it's gonna
hurt<00:01:33.329> like<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.630> bitch<00:01:33.930> but<00:01:34.530> then<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:35.009> know<00:01:35.840> kind

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
of suffering on a sinking boat and

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.690 
of suffering on a sinking boat and
suffocating<00:01:40.140> doesn't<00:01:40.590> really<00:01:40.680> seem<00:01:41.100> like<00:01:41.490> a

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
suffocating doesn't really seem like a
