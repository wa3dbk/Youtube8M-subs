00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.240 
get to the point where like not you
somewhere<00:05:11.169> so<00:05:12.169> I<00:05:12.290> figured<00:05:12.620> that<00:05:12.650> these<00:05:12.979> things

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
somewhere so I figured that these things

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.190 
somewhere so I figured that these things
right<00:05:13.580> here<00:05:13.850> this<00:05:14.060> is<00:05:14.210> like<00:05:14.360> this<00:05:14.780> is<00:05:14.900> the<00:05:14.990> same

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
right here this is like this is the same

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.540 
right here this is like this is the same
tunnel<00:05:15.910> yeah<00:05:16.910> I<00:05:17.180> think<00:05:17.919> it<00:05:18.919> looks<00:05:19.100> like<00:05:19.280> it's

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
tunnel yeah I think it looks like it's

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.760 
tunnel yeah I think it looks like it's
not<00:05:19.610> a<00:05:19.669> bear<00:05:20.000> I<00:05:20.470> don't<00:05:21.470> know

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
there's an enemy out there and some kind
