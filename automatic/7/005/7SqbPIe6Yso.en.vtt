00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.660
 good kids, how are you going? 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.600
 you welcome to the new battlefield 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.400
 at battlefield 2.0 there are many ways to 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.780
 call it in fact I read by some 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.760
 site that the year that we have spent in 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.080
 battlefield 4 we were really in the 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.209
 beta and now we start to try the 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.099
 true what in fact does not seem like a 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.449
 explanation too impossible but 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.400
 well and I really do not come to tell you about 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.079
 patch but what you will all be 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.939
 asking after having seen the title 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.560
 that I have put the video and if he sees me 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.509
 forced to leave youtube one thing that 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.039
 I hope I do not have to ever do 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.720
 I knew it was likely to happen from 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.190
 that I started with what I'm going to tell you 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.410
 now but good for now not you 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.640
 alarmÃ©is although I will leave it during 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.140
 enough time I tell you that I 'm going to 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.940
 back probably a few weeks before 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.500
 leave time in if I'm lucky enough 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.120
 with the problem that forces me to stop what 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.920
 that I am going to explain to you now a problem 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.170
 that could really limit me to 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.460
 summarize as family problems as 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.930
 I have already said on twitter that I 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.370
 you have asked and of course not 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.260
 you have been few and in fact I was 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.850
 commenting the other day and is that I know that a 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.500
 almost any youtuber would tell you what 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.790
 typical of do not go and all that but 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.590
 there are some things that you have written to me 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.940
 that we really criticize that they have 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.260
 arrived and I have been very happy 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.030
 that I did not know that my videos could 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.319
 have come to influence so much in some 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.579
 people with which as I told you 

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.480
 I have to thank all the support that 

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:10.540
 you have given 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.220
 those messages of truth from the heart I 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.690
 I thank you very much but you have to 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.160
 everything decays everything has something 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.870
 positive and that will be that if I'm lucky 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.550
 He managed to solve what I have 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.110
 commented I would love to go back for the 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.090
 start of battle fix line with what 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.830
 we would start all over again and with the 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.660
 accessory guides with guides 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.700
 weapons with the ups with new series that 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.140
 I had thought that is if you do not arrive 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.060
 to do I would stay with the desire in 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.440
 general if you could go back between that I'll have 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.780
 rested a little bit and that I'm going to have 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.370
 a tremendous desire I think we can 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.870
 real inaugurate the channel and return it to 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.400
 a golden age as me going to 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.600
 call it something else that I could tell you 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.400
 so that you remain attentive is that 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.990
 hardly there will be no video 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.570
 but if something important happens in plan 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.860
 get in the n 94 put the m16 as they are 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.930
 saying that they are going to do now in fact 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.850
 or the knife with pipo of the famous arch 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.500
 of end they will try to do something very 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.150
 very quick and simple to keep 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.680
 informed so I do not expect 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.910
 irregularity nor much less can 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.290
 that the following months you do not have 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.240
 as many videos as fingers in a hand 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.250
 but it is something very important what 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.570
 you will undoubtedly have and all this what 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.770
 means is that although you are in everything 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.180
 your right and since then 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.130
 I understand I would ask you even more well 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.300
 I would recommend that if it seems good to you 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.860
 to subscribe to the channel because 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.530
 I will try to resurface as soon as possible 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.000
 I would like to have there again 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.830
 you some of the best 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.230
 subscribers than any youtuber 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.610
 I could ask in order free you are to do 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.620
 whatever you want here I leave my 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.270
 recommendation apart from that as already 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.040
 many of you will be waiting we arrived at the 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.480
 second part of the video the part with that 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.160
 longed for image of my face that you have 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.959
 been asking since I had a couple 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.400
 of thousands of suvs in the truth is that I 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.080
 It is quite embarrassing but anyway 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.360
 I'm going a few more months I'd better leave you 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.860
 with me it exists in face to answer 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.209
 a little bit but this photo will not be 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.370
 in this video since it actually makes a few 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.170
 days I got the yolo in the body and 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.850
 I went up to a mine and self and twitter with what 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.050
 that I leave a direct link to this 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.580
 tweet and I also recommend that you 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.080
 follow if you want to have updates 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.910
 about the channel since probably 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.500
 when I return I will announce it a few weeks 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.180
 before out there other than that I'll also go 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.860
 commenting my stories and also 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.019
 we can continue talking a little about 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.519
 once in a while and well that would be all for 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.170
 today's video and I certainly hope that 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.209
 it has not seemed too negative 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.680
 I'll miss you guys if I do not 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.510
 I like farewells and less if not 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.810
 are fired with what we go to the 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.500
 so nothing said this I say goodbye 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.500
 then kids
