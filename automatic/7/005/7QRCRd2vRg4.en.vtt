he's<00:02:06.149> actually<00:02:06.390> it's<00:02:06.780> not<00:02:06.929> like<00:02:07.110> shaklee<00:02:07.560> you

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
he's actually it's not like shaklee you

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.499 
he's actually it's not like shaklee you
know<00:02:08.220> shaklee<00:02:08.580> never<00:02:08.850> played<00:02:09.090> off<00:02:09.239> his<00:02:09.390> his

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
know shaklee never played off his his

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.500 
know shaklee never played off his his
line<00:02:10.459> rod<00:02:11.459> has<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:12.150> he's<00:02:12.269> got<00:02:12.420> an

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
line rod has so he's got an

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.100 
line rod has so he's got an
understanding<00:02:12.630> and<00:02:13.400> if<00:02:14.400> it's<00:02:14.640> just<00:02:15.239> i<00:02:15.510> mean

the<00:03:45.909> quarterback<00:03:46.359> he<00:03:46.569> would<00:03:46.750> be<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:47.169> one<00:03:47.560> that

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
the quarterback he would be the one that

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.369 
the quarterback he would be the one that
wanted<00:03:48.819> to<00:03:48.879> sling<00:03:49.209> around<00:03:49.359> a<00:03:49.569> little<00:03:49.689> bit<00:03:49.840> and
