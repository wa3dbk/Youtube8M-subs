00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.390
 [music] 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.360
 hello with you again programs 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.119
 bombed and I her permanent leading 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.980
 spacey as always we discuss nonsense 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.470
 which feeds us on 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.050
 and today we'll talk about what the rules are 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.419
 the game does not share the types of saved throws 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.529
 simple example impenetrable saved throw 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:31.979
 edit as a proud source did not give it 5 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.440
 the prize 

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:35.640
 head of dark greatness or three plus for 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.340
 assault shield 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.410
 sent no difference it 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.600
 begets funny cases for example 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.449
 our hero gets a spell 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.850
 sudden ignition it breaks down 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.489
 it is clear from the inside as in this case 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.800
 acts aura gods removes damage from 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.749
 his champion and that's where the terminator 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.859
 the service shield applies so as not to 

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:58.890
 explode from the inside 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.870
 I will not think so simple comedy 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.089
 case of trouble happens then such 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.120
 generalization start to affect gameplay 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.170
 example detachment spawn uhnulo join to 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.140
 well lord 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.960
 on the tank corrected 6 editions all wounds 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.480
 should go to the nearest one in this way 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.310
 the lord traveling ahead can defend his 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.170
 armor 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.240
 totally naked mutants set 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.400
 revision there is another rule if 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.830
 the detachment is not entirely in shelter you can 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.450
 vyselivat less protected parts of it 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.039
 it was made with good intentions 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.920
 about not picking on 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.869
 the ruins of the tomboy and from bathing them less 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.090
 against comrades standing nearby 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.420
 yes that's just the game does not share what 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.570
 kind of limit shelter who dawn creature 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.909
 at the speed of the same year cartoon 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.220
 he has a jack if he moves it 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.110
 he always has shelter for movement 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.020
 type is moving so fast that you 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.479
 you will go to hell fauna they are bitch slow in 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.310
 They get a piece of cake as in 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.950
 In this they are overtaking a motorcycle fuck him 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.890
 He knows any fashion some kind of movement is 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.890
 completely not so that the shooter could always 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.560
 do focus fire aux ignore 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.269
 in front of the riding lord fact in logic 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.730
 But if you take Lorda Jumpa Ki too 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.690
 unbearably slow you can say 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.819
 im so 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.130
 roll over before spawning them and 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:24.250
 calmly take to the chest all the shooting 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.860
 so stupid we fixed stay 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.870
 we have 40 thousand more reasons with us 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.870
 hate warhammer 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.230
 information sponsor strictly 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:44.409
