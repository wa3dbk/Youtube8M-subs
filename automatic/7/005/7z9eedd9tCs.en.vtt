00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.770 

hey<00:01:48.890> critic<00:01:49.890> are<00:01:50.040> natural<00:01:50.610> natural<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.630> would

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
hey critic are natural natural I would

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.569 
hey critic are natural natural I would
say<00:01:51.960> even<00:01:52.170> though<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.409> had<00:01:52.590> done<00:01:52.770> acrylics<00:01:53.280> and

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
say even though I had done acrylics and

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.429 
say even though I had done acrylics and
they<00:01:54.240> can<00:01:54.420> look<00:01:54.570> really<00:01:54.810> good<00:01:55.079> if<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.290> get

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
they can look really good if you get

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.810 
they can look really good if you get
them<00:01:55.590> done<00:01:55.740> right<00:01:55.920> they<00:01:56.189> can<00:01:56.340> look<00:01:56.430> really<00:01:56.610> bad

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
them done right they can look really bad

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.399 
them done right they can look really bad
if<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.090> don't<00:01:57.210> get<00:01:57.390> them<00:01:57.540> done<00:01:57.719> right<00:01:57.930> but<00:01:58.200> I

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
if you don't get them done right but I

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.870 
if you don't get them done right but I
think<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.040> they<00:01:59.130> can<00:01:59.310> look<00:01:59.460> really<00:01:59.610> pretty

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
think that they can look really pretty

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.730 
think that they can look really pretty
especially<00:02:00.630> if<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.079> have<00:02:01.259> like<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.439> special

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
especially if you have like a special

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.679 
especially if you have like a special
event<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.280> go<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.430> or<00:02:02.610> if<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.030> always<00:02:03.360> look<00:02:03.540> put

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
event to go to or if you always look put

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.300 
event to go to or if you always look put
together<00:02:03.840> but<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.320> think<00:02:04.409> natural<00:02:04.950> nails<00:02:05.130> are

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
together but I think natural nails are

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.080 
together but I think natural nails are
nice<00:02:05.460> as<00:02:05.670> well

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
nice as well

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.270 
nice as well

brights are darks

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.750

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
I'm probably more of neutrals

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.240 
I'm probably more of neutrals
so<00:02:12.060> maybe<00:02:12.390> brights<00:02:12.810> cuz<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.319> would<00:02:13.740> do<00:02:13.920> like

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
so maybe brights cuz I would do like

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.090 
so maybe brights cuz I would do like
reds<00:02:15.030> or<00:02:15.330> Pink's<00:02:15.870> or<00:02:15.990> neutral<00:02:16.350> colors<00:02:16.620> over
