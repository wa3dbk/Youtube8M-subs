Wow patio this is Shannon here to show
you<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.470> difference<00:00:07.770> between<00:00:07.830> two<00:00:08.370> of<00:00:08.490> these

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
you the difference between two of these

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.299 
you the difference between two of these
yo-yo<00:00:09.179> pebbles<00:00:09.630> or<00:00:09.840> joy<00:00:10.110> or<00:00:10.170> pebbles<00:00:10.650> sweet

yo-yo pebbles or joy or pebbles sweet
baby<00:00:11.580> overdrive<00:00:12.179> on<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.450> right<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:12.960> the

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
baby overdrive on the right and the

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.410 
baby overdrive on the right and the
deluxe<00:00:13.290> crunch<00:00:13.740> on<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.160> left<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.610> if<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.210> see

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
deluxe crunch on the left and if you see

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.200 
deluxe crunch on the left and if you see
my<00:00:15.570> previous<00:00:15.809> video<00:00:16.199> this<00:00:17.160> control<00:00:17.640> here<00:00:17.970> is

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
my previous video this control here is

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.109 
my previous video this control here is
actually<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.690> presence<00:00:19.350> control<00:00:19.770> not<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.340> preamp

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
actually a presence control not a preamp

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.120 
actually a presence control not a preamp
gain<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.720> sounds<00:00:22.230> like<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.470> adds<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.769> little<00:00:22.890> bit

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
gain it sounds like it adds a little bit

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.890 
gain it sounds like it adds a little bit
of<00:00:23.220> gain<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:23.789> that's<00:00:23.970> why<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.119> got<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.420> confuse

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
of gain so that's why I got to confuse

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.300 
of gain so that's why I got to confuse
that<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.170> between<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.439> instructions<00:00:26.039> but

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
that in between the instructions but

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.890 
that in between the instructions but
it's<00:00:26.789> still<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.939> great<00:00:27.060> pedal<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.720> main

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
it's still a great pedal so the main

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.140 
it's still a great pedal so the main
drive<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.230> here<00:00:28.650> I've<00:00:29.160> got<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.429> volume<00:00:29.849> up<00:00:30.060> a

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
drive is here I've got this volume up a

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.299 
drive is here I've got this volume up a
little<00:00:30.179> higher<00:00:30.570> than<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:30.869> one<00:00:31.050> because

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
little higher than this one because

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.490 
little higher than this one because
that's<00:00:32.309> comparable<00:00:32.969> volume<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.780> my<00:00:33.899> ear<00:00:34.170> so

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
that's comparable volume to my ear so

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:45.770 
that's comparable volume to my ear so
this<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.739> my<00:00:34.860> clean<00:00:35.100> time<00:00:44.180> sweet<00:00:45.180> baby<00:00:45.390> out<00:00:45.570> go

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
this is my clean time sweet baby out go

00:00:45.780 --> 00:01:09.289 
this is my clean time sweet baby out go
the<00:00:57.109> lights<00:00:58.109> crunch<00:01:07.790> this<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:08.939> has<00:01:09.119> more

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
the lights crunch this one has more

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.609 
the lights crunch this one has more
presence<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:09.930> I'm<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.200> going<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.409> go<00:01:10.500> ahead

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
presence so I'm just going to go ahead

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:41.120 
presence so I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:01:10.860> turn<00:01:11.010> up<00:01:11.220> both<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.490> these

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.320 

now<00:01:42.130> as<00:01:42.340> you<00:01:42.520> may<00:01:42.640> or<00:01:42.790> may<00:01:42.880> not<00:01:42.909> be<00:01:43.150> able<00:01:43.210> to

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
now as you may or may not be able to

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.000 
now as you may or may not be able to
tell<00:01:43.540> this<00:01:43.690> one<00:01:43.750> is<00:01:43.990> a<00:01:44.020> lot<00:01:44.320> cleaner<00:01:44.590> with<00:01:44.890> the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
tell this one is a lot cleaner with the

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.890 
tell this one is a lot cleaner with the
drive<00:01:45.640> all<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.240> way<00:01:46.330> down<00:01:46.510> so<00:01:46.630> I'm<00:01:46.690> going<00:01:46.840> to

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
drive all the way down so I'm going to

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.359 
drive all the way down so I'm going to
turn<00:01:47.020> this<00:01:47.170> up<00:01:47.350> a<00:01:47.440> little<00:01:47.590> bit<00:01:47.800> and<00:01:47.979> you'll

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
turn this up a little bit and you'll

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:58.460 
turn this up a little bit and you'll
hear<00:01:48.640> that<00:01:48.759> you<00:01:49.119> hear<00:01:49.300> the<00:01:49.450> clarity<00:01:49.660> come<00:01:50.080> out

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.800 

as<00:01:58.670> opposed<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.760> this<00:02:02.450> basically<00:02:03.450> that's<00:02:03.659> just

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
as opposed to this basically that's just

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.150 
as opposed to this basically that's just
like<00:02:03.930> an<00:02:04.080> amp<00:02:04.490> tone<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:06.650> let's<00:02:07.650> go<00:02:07.770> back<00:02:07.800> to<00:02:07.979> the

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
like an amp tone so let's go back to the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.150 
like an amp tone so let's go back to the
baby<00:02:08.429> overdrive<00:02:09.530> turn<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.619> gain<00:02:10.770> up<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:11.009> little

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
baby overdrive turn the gain up a little

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:31.790 
baby overdrive turn the gain up a little
bit

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:56.740 

very<00:02:32.800> nice<00:02:33.010> for<00:02:33.310> cool

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.020 

me

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.309 

so<00:03:01.030> they're<00:03:01.180> very<00:03:01.209> different<00:03:01.629> pedals<00:03:02.110> this

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
so they're very different pedals this

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.009 
so they're very different pedals this
one's<00:03:02.530> obviously<00:03:02.680> AM<00:03:03.280> towards<00:03:03.879> more<00:03:04.120> that<00:03:04.420> you

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
one's obviously AM towards more that you

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:22.760 
one's obviously AM towards more that you
know<00:03:05.140> heavier<00:03:05.500> sort<00:03:05.860> of<00:03:05.920> rock

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:38.000 

you

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.259 

so<00:03:39.010> I'm<00:03:39.099> going<00:03:39.190> to<00:03:39.250> turn<00:03:39.400> this<00:03:39.549> all<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.970> way<00:03:40.150> up

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
so I'm going to turn this all the way up

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.390 
so I'm going to turn this all the way up
now<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.840> drive<00:03:41.140> is<00:03:41.379> all<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.620> way<00:03:41.709> up<00:03:41.860> and<00:03:42.069> back

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
now the drive is all the way up and back

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.430 
now the drive is all the way up and back
to<00:03:42.549> volume<00:03:42.849> off<00:03:42.970> so<00:03:43.720> this<00:03:43.780> is<00:03:43.900> my<00:03:43.989> clean<00:03:44.230> turn

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
to volume off so this is my clean turn

00:03:44.440 --> 00:04:08.780 
to volume off so this is my clean turn
it<00:03:44.530> again

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.160 

these<00:04:09.790> are<00:04:09.940> both<00:04:10.090> very<00:04:10.120> very<00:04:10.840> different

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
these are both very very different

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.920 
these are both very very different
petals<00:04:11.350> and<00:04:11.710> both<00:04:12.670> will<00:04:13.030> appeal<00:04:13.330> to<00:04:13.420> people

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
petals and both will appeal to people

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.930 
petals and both will appeal to people
playing<00:04:14.140> different<00:04:14.620> kinds<00:04:14.890> of<00:04:14.920> music<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.760> one

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
playing different kinds of music the one

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.970 
playing different kinds of music the one
on<00:04:16.060> the<00:04:16.150> right<00:04:16.360> the<00:04:16.690> sweet<00:04:16.930> baby<00:04:17.200> is<00:04:17.500> more<00:04:17.860> of

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
on the right the sweet baby is more of

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.990 
on the right the sweet baby is more of
your<00:04:18.130> subtle<00:04:18.900> amplifier<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:21.160> break<00:04:21.519> up<00:04:21.700> kind

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
your subtle amplifier to break up kind

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.420 
your subtle amplifier to break up kind
of<00:04:22.090> tone<00:04:22.330> whereas<00:04:22.870> this<00:04:23.050> one<00:04:23.260> kind<00:04:24.220> of<00:04:24.310> gets

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
of tone whereas this one kind of gets

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.160 
of tone whereas this one kind of gets
there<00:04:24.730> at<00:04:24.850> lower<00:04:25.000> volumes<00:04:25.360> and<00:04:25.600> then<00:04:25.750> goes

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
there at lower volumes and then goes

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.260 
there at lower volumes and then goes
balls-to-the-wall<00:04:26.800> right<00:04:27.550> at<00:04:27.640> the<00:04:27.730> end<00:04:27.910> both

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
balls-to-the-wall right at the end both

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.550 
balls-to-the-wall right at the end both
are<00:04:28.420> cool<00:04:28.600> it<00:04:28.720> just<00:04:28.780> depends<00:04:29.140> on<00:04:29.200> what<00:04:29.350> sound

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
are cool it just depends on what sound

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.200 
are cool it just depends on what sound
you're<00:04:29.710> looking<00:04:29.950> for<00:04:30.190> I'm<00:04:30.700> doing<00:04:31.000> something
