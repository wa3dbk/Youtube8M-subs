00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:08.020
 in bq we want to help understand the 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:10.599
 animal technology to use it and be 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.639
 able to create it because it is so 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:14.710
 important for us to help 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.080
 understand use and create technology 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:20.230
 technology is a tool 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.730
 transversal and much needed in the 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.619
 society today and society 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.890
 future and that's why we 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.869
 we support the educational world to understand 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.880
 that technology to be able to use 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.449
 that technology in the classroom and be able 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.790
 to create by adapting in each age what 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:39.580
 they can create in the experiment 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.449
 today what we have done is to introduce 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.790
 0 1 12 and 23 a tablet and a smartphone 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.010
 in the educational project that they 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.930
 they had assembled was to work 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.210
 who was van gogh who painted van gogh 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.430
 and what he liked to do they have 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.830
 disguised have been painting and have 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.330
 worked with different tools 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.339
 our tablet and our phone is a 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.530
 tool more within your ecosystem 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.150
 mobiles and tablets have to 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.070
 enter the classroom because it's something that 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.289
 is in society in the day to day 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.000
 they then good after a lot 

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.880
 reflection 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.430
 in the cloisters and with the 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.190
 advice also from our the 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.170
 counselor and the company in this case 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.210
 bq that is the one that has bet us 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.640
 we come to the conclusion that 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.460
 they have to show us their world to 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.590
 through tablets and mobile phones 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.510
 importance of being producers of 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.400
 your world with the images of what 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.560
 they want not what count 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.740
 we want you to count and the 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.600
 freedom to be able to experience when and 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.210
 as they want but also the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.000
 accompaniment of the friends of the 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.930
 teachers and the process by which 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.930
 they are counting 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.900
 it is the ideal 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.900
 I already told you 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.539
 I was surprised that I knew where 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:08.830
 there was the camera icon and also 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:11.209
 they gave to the button and passed perfectly 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.459
 the photos and they knew what it was 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.260
 that make a very good tool for 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.290
 use in class because it is a new 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.880
 technology that they are going to have at 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.069
 scope within a short time has been 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.349
 instant him and the one they have caught 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.880
 the phone and directly for pasta 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.410
 they already knew exactly what they had 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.120
 what to do could be a start to 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.739
 give a different use to these new 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.830
 technologies that are within reach of their 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.830
 hands
