I<00:00:00.089> decided<00:00:00.630> to<00:00:00.810> add<00:00:00.960> a<00:00:01.290> third<00:00:01.560> part<00:00:01.890> to<00:00:02.399> my

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
I decided to add a third part to my

the<00:00:13.290> user<00:00:13.530> might<00:00:13.830> think<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.250> it's<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.610> 2d

to<00:00:50.700> add<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.300> make<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> red<00:00:51.750> cube<00:00:52.020> spin<00:00:52.969> we<00:00:53.969> look

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
to add to make the red cube spin we look

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.010 
to add to make the red cube spin we look
at<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> beginning<00:00:54.660> part<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.559> ex<00:00:55.890> 3d<00:00:56.399> data

at the beginning part of the ex 3d data

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.889 
at the beginning part of the ex 3d data
we've<00:00:58.020> added<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.820> transform<00:00:59.820> tag<00:01:00.120> wrapped

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
we've added a transform tag wrapped

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.080 
we've added a transform tag wrapped
around<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.739> shape<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.399> say<00:01:02.640> we're<00:01:02.850> going<00:01:03.000> to

around the shape to say we're going to

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.469 
around the shape to say we're going to
transform<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.750> shape<00:01:04.080> ie<00:01:04.409> rotated<00:01:05.479> the

much detail in this tutorial I've done a

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.790 
much detail in this tutorial I've done a
separate<00:01:31.150> tutorial<00:01:31.300> where<00:01:31.840> I<00:01:31.870> go<00:01:32.080> into<00:01:32.320> detail

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
separate tutorial where I go into detail

separate tutorial where I go into detail
about<00:01:33.010> these<00:01:33.370> lines<00:01:33.730> I<00:01:34.060> just<00:01:34.960> point<00:01:35.200> out<00:01:35.350> two

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
about these lines I just point out two

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.110 
about these lines I just point out two
things<00:01:35.920> that<00:01:36.310> you<00:01:36.490> need<00:01:36.610> to<00:01:36.790> change<00:01:37.830> this<00:01:39.120> in

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
things that you need to change this in

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.600 
things that you need to change this in
the<00:01:40.240> time<00:01:40.450> sensor<00:01:40.840> tag<00:01:41.080> is<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.770> duration<00:01:42.130> of

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
the time sensor tag is the duration of

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.840 
the time sensor tag is the duration of
the<00:01:43.390> rotation<00:01:43.840> so<00:01:44.320> one<00:01:44.560> rotation<00:01:44.980> at<00:01:45.790> the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
the rotation so one rotation at the

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.790 
the rotation so one rotation at the
moment<00:01:46.180> takes<00:01:46.330> five<00:01:46.570> seconds<00:01:47.080> so<00:01:47.290> you<00:01:47.350> alter

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
moment takes five seconds so you alter

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.219 
moment takes five seconds so you alter
that<00:01:47.950> value<00:01:48.400> for<00:01:49.060> how<00:01:49.210> fast<00:01:49.510> you<00:01:49.690> want<00:01:49.870> to<00:01:49.990> spin

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
that value for how fast you want to spin

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.770 
that value for how fast you want to spin
your<00:01:50.890> 3d<00:01:51.490> model<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:55.030> other<00:01:55.150> thing<00:01:55.420> you<00:01:55.570> must

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
your 3d model the other thing you must

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.830 
your 3d model the other thing you must
change<00:01:56.140> is<00:01:56.530> whatever<00:01:57.190> ID<00:01:57.610> you<00:01:58.090> gave<00:01:58.120> your

change is whatever ID you gave your

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.030 
change is whatever ID you gave your
shape<00:02:00.300> matches<00:02:01.300> the<00:02:01.690> two<00:02:01.930> node<00:02:02.260> attribute

and<00:02:34.350> in<00:02:35.350> here<00:02:35.980> we<00:02:36.100> have<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.459> shape<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:38.070> here

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
and in here we have the shape and here

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.820 
and in here we have the shape and here
we<00:02:39.250> have<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.700> geometry<00:02:40.330> it's<00:02:40.570> an<00:02:40.830> indexed

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
we have the geometry it's an indexed

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.600 
we have the geometry it's an indexed
face<00:02:42.100> set<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:42.700> we<00:02:43.540> have<00:02:43.780> all<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.860> faces<00:02:45.370> that

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
face set and we have all the faces that

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.949 
face set and we have all the faces that
make<00:02:45.640> up<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.060> monkey<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:47.760> coordinates

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
make up the monkey and the coordinates

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.050 
make up the monkey and the coordinates
all<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.260> vertices<00:02:50.440> that<00:02:51.130> make<00:02:51.310> up<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:51.640> monkey

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
all the vertices that make up the monkey

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.530 
all the vertices that make up the monkey
mesh<00:02:54.780> if<00:02:55.780> you<00:02:56.290> look<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.980> blender<00:02:57.910> exporter

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
mesh if you look the blender exporter

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.020 
mesh if you look the blender exporter
has<00:02:58.780> already<00:02:58.959> given<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.650> shape<00:02:59.920> a<00:03:00.160> transform

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
has already given the shape a transform

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.820 
has already given the shape a transform
tag<00:03:01.360> with<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.530> ID<00:03:03.300> monkey<00:03:04.300> so<00:03:05.140> all<00:03:05.380> we<00:03:05.530> have<00:03:05.560> to

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
tag with the ID monkey so all we have to

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.729 
tag with the ID monkey so all we have to
do<00:03:06.010> is<00:03:06.280> add<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.790> four<00:03:07.239> lines<00:03:07.480> of<00:03:07.690> code<00:03:07.959> to<00:03:08.709> make

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
do is add the four lines of code to make

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.070 
do is add the four lines of code to make
the<00:03:09.100> monkey<00:03:09.459> spin

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.230 

if<00:03:13.230> we<00:03:13.800> look<00:03:13.920> at<00:03:14.040> where<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.490> four<00:03:14.760> lines<00:03:15.000> are

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
if we look at where the four lines are

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.450 
if we look at where the four lines are
there<00:03:15.450> just<00:03:15.660> before<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.230> closing<00:03:16.560> scene<00:03:17.040> tag

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
there just before the closing scene tag

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.620 
there just before the closing scene tag
so<00:03:18.030> I'm<00:03:18.240> going<00:03:18.270> to<00:03:18.510> copy<00:03:18.720> this<00:03:20.030> go<00:03:21.030> into<00:03:21.420> my

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
so I'm going to copy this go into my

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.770 
so I'm going to copy this go into my
group<00:03:21.990> green<00:03:22.590> monkey<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.390> find<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.540> scene

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
group green monkey and find the scene

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.430 
group green monkey and find the scene
tag<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:26.480> open<00:03:27.480> that<00:03:27.510> up<00:03:27.810> with<00:03:27.960> the<00:03:28.050> enter

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
tag and open that up with the enter

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.690 
tag and open that up with the enter
pressing<00:03:28.980> enter<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:29.670> paste<00:03:30.570> in<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:30.900> lines

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
pressing enter and paste in the lines

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.290 
pressing enter and paste in the lines
and<00:03:33.290> we<00:03:34.290> could<00:03:34.530> change<00:03:34.890> how<00:03:35.550> fast<00:03:35.850> we<00:03:36.000> want<00:03:36.180> to

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
and we could change how fast we want to

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.570 
and we could change how fast we want to
spin<00:03:36.570> it<00:03:36.600> I'm<00:03:37.380> going<00:03:37.770> to<00:03:37.860> leave<00:03:38.040> it<00:03:38.160> at<00:03:38.280> five

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
spin it I'm going to leave it at five

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.810 
spin it I'm going to leave it at five
but<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.120> one<00:03:39.270> we<00:03:39.420> must<00:03:39.630> change<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:41.100> transform

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
but the one we must change the transform

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.080 
but the one we must change the transform
is<00:03:42.090> called<00:03:42.540> monkey<00:03:43.610> so<00:03:44.610> if<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:44.760> copy<00:03:45.000> that

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
is called monkey so if I copy that

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.530 
is called monkey so if I copy that
control<00:03:45.450> C<00:03:46.020> and<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.980> two<00:03:47.220> node<00:03:47.490> here<00:03:47.790> must<00:03:48.390> be

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
control C and the two node here must be

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.730 
control C and the two node here must be
changed<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:49.710> monkey<00:03:50.250> control<00:03:50.790> V<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.740> that's

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
changed to monkey control V and that's

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.720 
changed to monkey control V and that's
ready<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.580> spin<00:03:55.040> remember<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.160> save<00:03:56.370> if<00:03:56.580> you're

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
ready to spin remember to save if you're

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.600 
ready to spin remember to save if you're
using<00:03:57.030> notepad<00:03:57.600> plus<00:03:57.810> plus<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.500> then<00:03:59.400> when<00:03:59.580> we

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
using notepad plus plus and then when we

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.380 
using notepad plus plus and then when we
open<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.060> page<00:04:00.450> in<00:04:00.930> Google<00:04:01.440> Chrome<00:04:02.150> we<00:04:03.150> get<00:04:03.360> a

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
open that page in Google Chrome we get a

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:14.270 
open that page in Google Chrome we get a
spinny<00:04:06.390> monkey

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.000 

for<00:04:15.280> this<00:04:15.400> more<00:04:15.730> complex<00:04:16.269> model<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:17.500> data

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
for this more complex model the data

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.210 
for this more complex model the data
that<00:04:19.000> was<00:04:19.120> exported<00:04:19.840> consisted<00:04:20.500> of<00:04:20.650> multiple

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
that was exported consisted of multiple

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.250 
that was exported consisted of multiple
shapes<00:04:21.519> and<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:24.070> did<00:04:24.400> have<00:04:24.639> to<00:04:24.850> add<00:04:25.030> a<00:04:25.360> new

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
shapes and I did have to add a new

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.129 
shapes and I did have to add a new
transform<00:04:26.919> tag<00:04:27.250> which<00:04:28.090> acts<00:04:28.360> as<00:04:28.510> a<00:04:28.570> grouping

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
transform tag which acts as a grouping

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.580 
transform tag which acts as a grouping
tag<00:04:29.889> as<00:04:30.160> well<00:04:30.990> and<00:04:31.990> I<00:04:32.139> gave<00:04:32.350> it<00:04:32.470> the<00:04:32.560> name

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
tag as well and I gave it the name

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.110 
tag as well and I gave it the name
monkey<00:04:33.190> and<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:34.960> transform<00:04:35.590> the<00:04:36.580> closing

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
monkey and the transform the closing

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.670 
monkey and the transform the closing
transform<00:04:37.660> tag<00:04:39.690> had<00:04:40.690> to<00:04:40.840> enclose<00:04:41.139> all<00:04:41.470> the

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
transform tag had to enclose all the

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.820 
transform tag had to enclose all the
shapes<00:04:42.389> so<00:04:43.389> I<00:04:43.449> had<00:04:43.600> to<00:04:43.630> add<00:04:43.840> that<00:04:43.870> tag<00:04:44.440> but

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
shapes so I had to add that tag but

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.800 
shapes so I had to add that tag but
besides<00:04:45.190> that<00:04:45.340> it<00:04:45.700> was<00:04:45.820> the<00:04:45.940> same<00:04:46.180> four<00:04:46.540> lines

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
besides that it was the same four lines

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.890 
besides that it was the same four lines
of<00:04:47.020> code<00:04:47.320> and<00:04:47.669> the<00:04:48.669> same<00:04:48.940> link<00:04:49.270> to<00:04:49.600> the<00:04:49.720> two

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
of code and the same link to the two

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.450 
of code and the same link to the two
node<00:04:50.169> monkey<00:04:50.650> and<00:04:50.910> that<00:04:51.910> gave<00:04:52.150> me<00:04:53.280> the<00:04:54.280> more

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
node monkey and that gave me the more

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.469 
node monkey and that gave me the more
complex<00:04:54.850> model<00:04:57.000> that's<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.180> end<00:04:58.330> of<00:04:58.389> this
