00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
the two-step process I was talking about

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.500 
the two-step process I was talking about
goes<00:01:58.650> something<00:01:59.159> like<00:01:59.190> this

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
goes something like this

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.750 
goes something like this
first<00:02:00.960> we're<00:02:01.140> going<00:02:01.260> to<00:02:01.320> sear<00:02:01.830> our<00:02:02.100> pork<00:02:02.700> loin

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
first we're going to sear our pork loin

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.670 
first we're going to sear our pork loin
on<00:02:03.060> all<00:02:03.330> sides<00:02:03.720> that's<00:02:04.080> going<00:02:04.260> to<00:02:04.320> get<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.500> nice

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
on all sides that's going to get it nice

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.590 
on all sides that's going to get it nice
and<00:02:04.710> crusty<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.369> outside<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.940> keep<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
and crusty on the outside and keep the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.990 
and crusty on the outside and keep the
juices<00:02:07.050> in<00:02:07.259> then<00:02:08.160> we're<00:02:08.399> going<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.580> transfer

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
juices in then we're going to transfer

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
this very purpose for the guy in there

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.120 
this very purpose for the guy in there
just<00:02:59.880> like<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.590> we'll<00:03:01.590> turn<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.860> heat<00:03:02.100> down

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
just like that we'll turn the heat down

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.920 
just like that we'll turn the heat down
on<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.519> burners<00:03:02.850> to<00:03:02.880> about<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.180> medium<00:03:03.600> or<00:03:03.720> so

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
on the burners to about a medium or so

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.190 
on the burners to about a medium or so
and<00:03:04.670> then<00:03:05.670> we're<00:03:06.239> going<00:03:06.360> to<00:03:06.450> shut<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.780> door

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
and then we're going to shut the door

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.660 
and then we're going to shut the door
we'll<00:03:07.470> let<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.709> pork<00:03:07.950> loin<00:03:07.980> roast<00:03:08.130> in<00:03:08.549> there

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
we'll let the pork loin roast in there

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.060 
we'll let the pork loin roast in there
now<00:03:08.790> for<00:03:08.850> about<00:03:09.060> two<00:03:09.239> 15<00:03:09.870> 20<00:03:10.230> minutes<00:03:10.530> or<00:03:10.680> so<00:03:10.829> it

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
now for about two 15 20 minutes or so it

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.050 
now for about two 15 20 minutes or so it
could<00:03:11.220> be<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.310> little<00:03:11.400> bit<00:03:11.549> longer<00:03:11.700> could<00:03:11.970> be<00:03:12.030> a

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
could be a little bit longer could be a

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.580 
could be a little bit longer could be a
little<00:03:12.150> bit<00:03:12.299> shorter<00:03:12.600> just<00:03:12.900> depends<00:03:13.380> on<00:03:13.470> the

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
little bit shorter just depends on the

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.319 
little bit shorter just depends on the
temperature<00:03:13.860> that<00:03:14.100> your<00:03:14.220> grill<00:03:14.549> gets<00:03:14.880> up<00:03:15.120> to

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
temperature that your grill gets up to
