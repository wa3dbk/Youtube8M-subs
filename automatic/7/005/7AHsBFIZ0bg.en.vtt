and<00:02:19.040> here's<00:02:20.040> what<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.940> bobbin<00:02:21.390> looks<00:02:21.630> like

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
and here's what the bobbin looks like

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.040 
and here's what the bobbin looks like
and<00:02:22.500> that's<00:02:23.160> full<00:02:23.490> of<00:02:23.520> thread<00:02:24.000> because<00:02:24.360> in

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
and that's full of thread because in

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.200 
and that's full of thread because in

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
flush and that's another option so

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.360 
flush and that's another option so
here's<00:03:33.570> a<00:03:33.660> little<00:03:33.870> peek<00:03:34.320> at<00:03:34.680> what<00:03:35.010> the

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
here's a little peek at what the

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.670 
here's a little peek at what the
machines<00:03:35.820> look<00:03:36.300> like<00:03:36.660> so<00:03:37.140> that<00:03:37.350> when<00:03:37.560> you

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
machines look like so that when you

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.740 
machines look like so that when you
start<00:03:37.980> talking<00:03:38.220> about<00:03:38.580> finding<00:03:39.180> machine<00:03:39.540> and

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
start talking about finding machine and

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.120 
start talking about finding machine and
talking<00:03:39.989> to<00:03:40.050> your<00:03:40.140> friends<00:03:40.530> family<00:03:40.739> whatever

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
talking to your friends family whatever

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.790 
talking to your friends family whatever
you<00:03:41.970> know<00:03:42.150> what's<00:03:42.390> going<00:03:43.050> to<00:03:43.080> happen<00:03:43.140> when<00:03:43.620> one

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
you know what's going to happen when one

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.400 
you know what's going to happen when one
shows<00:03:44.130> up<00:03:44.600> next<00:03:45.600> thing<00:03:45.720> I'm<00:03:45.840> going<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:46.050> do<00:03:46.230> is

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
shows up next thing I'm going to do is

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.620 
shows up next thing I'm going to do is
tell<00:03:46.680> you<00:03:46.860> about<00:03:47.100> threading<00:03:47.670> tell<00:03:48.300> you<00:03:48.390> how<00:03:48.570> to

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
tell you about threading tell you how to

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.810 
tell you about threading tell you how to
check<00:03:49.200> that<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.590> machine<00:03:49.890> sounds<00:03:50.430> okay

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
check that the machine sounds okay

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.110 
check that the machine sounds okay
needles<00:03:51.600> so<00:03:52.470> we'll<00:03:53.070> do<00:03:53.250> that<00:03:53.430> in<00:03:53.489> a<00:03:53.700> second

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
needles so we'll do that in a second
