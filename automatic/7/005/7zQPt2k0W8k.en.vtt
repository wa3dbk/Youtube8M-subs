 remove the seeds from is optional to 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.509
 Sometimes the seed has very tender and 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:26.530
 it can be eaten sometimes that comes very 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.990
 thick is not nice then that 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.380
 It depends on you if you like it or not 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.380
 like 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.810
 ah 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:42.960
 let's start in small pieces 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.000
 and we're going to put it in a container and 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.220
 also what is tomato onion and 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.490
 the coriander and I'll put it in the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.490
 container 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.729
 now let's go we need to chop the sausage 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.509
 good 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.929
 to 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.849
 let's start in the same way the 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.849
 sausage in small seats 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.910
 try to get small pieces out 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.150
 because a ceviche with the pieces the 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:27.550
 as big as you do not crave ceviche 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.550
 takes the tiny pieces 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.690
 since we have all chopped up we are going to 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.870
 I hope you do not throw it away because 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.560
 If I get too full the tray 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.560
 but nothing happens 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.330
 let's mix 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.660
 let's perfectly mix all the 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.660
 ingredients 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.080
 Now I'm going to put the clamato 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.110
 and a little of the sauces 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.740
 and the sauces are to taste 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.099
 these seven more than things I'm going to put 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:31.769
 more little 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:35.040
 and these sauces are already optional if 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.970
 they like to wear it if they do not like it 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.640
 there is a need 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.490
 they like it and they have it they can put it on 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.410
 I like my children with these sauces and 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.630
 you can make them ambition but it's a 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:51.150
 little nothing more 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.150
 Not so long ago, the little one 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.110
 Now I'm going to eat 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.040
 Now I'm going to put the humor 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.970
 let's stir 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:34.709
 I'll put some salt here there 

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:37.829
 it is to everyone's taste are the time 

00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:40.109
 in the test they are passed since they can not 

00:04:37.829 --> 00:04:42.329
 remove it is better that you go putting little 

00:04:40.109 --> 00:04:44.719
 but I'm also going to put a little bit of 

00:04:42.329 --> 00:04:44.719
 Pepper 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.509
 we can put it in a cup or we can 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.849
 serve it on toast if 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:59.190
 you like that is very juicy you 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:03.630
 we can add a little more clamato 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:06.720
 here and we accompany it with a rich 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.910
 beer this is how we have the ceviche 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.000
 of sausages I hope you have them 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:15.500
