00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.249 

probably<00:00:02.580> the<00:00:02.790> hardest<00:00:03.240> thing<00:00:03.540> in<00:00:03.810> guitar

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
probably the hardest thing in guitar

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.740 
probably the hardest thing in guitar
playing<00:00:04.850> for<00:00:05.850> me<00:00:06.060> is<00:00:07.670> probably<00:00:08.670> sweet<00:00:09.300> picking

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
playing for me is probably sweet picking

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:17.920 
playing for me is probably sweet picking
because<00:00:11.929> for<00:00:12.929> all<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:14.210> trying<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:16.160> shred<00:00:17.160> it's

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
because for all of trying to shred it's

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:28.970 
because for all of trying to shred it's
said<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.699> keep<00:00:20.699> alternate<00:00:21.359> picking<00:00:27.560> so<00:00:28.560> sweet

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
said to keep alternate picking so sweet

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.320 
said to keep alternate picking so sweet
picking<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.429> really<00:00:29.670> hard<00:00:29.849> for<00:00:29.939> me<00:00:30.090> because

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
picking is really hard for me because

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:38.780 
picking is really hard for me because
you<00:00:30.660> have<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:31.430> keep<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.640> constant<00:00:33.149> motion<00:00:37.790> and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
you have to keep a constant motion and

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.459 
you have to keep a constant motion and
it's<00:00:39.090> just<00:00:39.300> really<00:00:39.480> hard<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.110> have<00:00:40.290> to

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
it's just really hard and you have to

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.369 
it's just really hard and you have to
hold<00:00:41.070> your<00:00:41.250> pick<00:00:41.670> at<00:00:41.879> an<00:00:42.000> awkward<00:00:42.180> angle<00:00:42.570> that

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
hold your pick at an awkward angle that

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.490 
hold your pick at an awkward angle that
you<00:00:43.680> normally<00:00:43.950> wouldn't<00:00:44.190> do<00:00:44.840> so<00:00:45.840> here<00:00:46.320> this

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
you normally wouldn't do so here this

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.690 
you normally wouldn't do so here this
video<00:00:46.829> I'm<00:00:47.340> going<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.210> try<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.840> show<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:50.489> a

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
video I'm going to try to show you a

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.270 
video I'm going to try to show you a
great<00:00:51.329> process<00:00:52.640> for<00:00:53.640> me<00:00:53.870> on<00:00:54.870> how<00:00:55.129> to<00:00:56.129> sweet<00:00:57.090> pic

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
great process for me on how to sweet pic

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.820 
great process for me on how to sweet pic
okay<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.640> first<00:00:59.969> step<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:01.250> knowing<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.609> notes

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
okay the first step is knowing the notes

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.460 
okay the first step is knowing the notes
it's<00:01:04.830> based<00:01:05.460> off<00:01:05.729> an<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.180> minor<00:01:06.450> chord<00:01:07.640> and<00:01:09.470> it's

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
it's based off an a minor chord and it's

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.330 
it's based off an a minor chord and it's
in<00:01:10.830> Paganini's<00:01:11.640> 24th<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.780> actually<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:14.040> found

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
in Paganini's 24th and actually I found

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.010 
in Paganini's 24th and actually I found
the<00:01:15.740> note<00:01:16.740> pattern<00:01:17.689> somewhere<00:01:18.689> else<00:01:18.840> on

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the note pattern somewhere else on

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.890 
the note pattern somewhere else on
YouTube<00:01:19.530> but<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.890> was<00:01:20.009> an<00:01:20.130> octave<00:01:20.460> higher<00:01:23.900> so

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
YouTube but it was an octave higher so

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.470 
YouTube but it was an octave higher so
here's<00:01:25.500> notes<00:01:26.600> hey

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.130 

then<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.170> hammer<00:01:31.500> out<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.740> C<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:34.040> then<00:01:35.040> you

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
then you hammer out a C and then you

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.070 
then you hammer out a C and then you
down<00:01:37.140> stroke<00:01:37.590> Annie<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.720> then<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.870> down

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
down stroke Annie and then you down

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.600 
down stroke Annie and then you down
stroke<00:01:40.470> an<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:41.780> but<00:01:42.780> try<00:01:43.620> to<00:01:43.680> bar<00:01:43.980> your<00:01:44.190> fingers

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
stroke an a but try to bar your fingers

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.050 
stroke an a but try to bar your fingers
that's<00:01:44.910> what<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.240> find<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.750> easiest<00:01:46.110> for<00:01:46.440> me<00:01:46.500> and

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
that's what I find is easiest for me and

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.510 
that's what I find is easiest for me and
then<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:48.660> a<00:01:48.690> sea<00:01:49.640> with<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> Down<00:01:50.910> stroke

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
then you have a sea with a Down stroke

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.580 
then you have a sea with a Down stroke
looking<00:01:53.520> with<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.760> Down<00:01:53.880> stroke<00:01:54.290> and<00:01:55.290> then<00:01:55.470> in

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
looking with a Down stroke and then in

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.310 
looking with a Down stroke and then in
pay<00:01:55.830> with<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.160> Down<00:01:56.310> stroke<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:57.000> then<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.110> go

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
pay with a Down stroke and then you go

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.240 
pay with a Down stroke and then you go
back<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.040> e<00:01:59.340> to<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:02.250> C<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.480> a<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:04.950> e

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
back to the e to the C to the a to the e

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.100 
back to the e to the C to the a to the e
to<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:06.270> C<00:02:06.720> and<00:02:07.790> then<00:02:08.790> to<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.000> ACE<00:02:09.240> you<00:02:09.810> get

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
to the C and then to the ACE you get

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:19.070 
to the C and then to the ACE you get
this

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.130 

ok<00:02:20.080> now<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:21.640> method<00:02:22.150> I<00:02:22.270> used<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.720> build<00:02:22.930> up

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
ok now the method I used to build up

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:30.270 
ok now the method I used to build up
speed<00:02:23.350> for<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.100> is<00:02:25.020> using<00:02:26.020> a<00:02:26.110> metronome<00:02:29.280> right

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
speed for it is using a metronome right

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.780 
speed for it is using a metronome right
now<00:02:30.460> it's<00:02:30.670> at<00:02:30.850> 60<00:02:31.360> bpm<00:02:31.840> now<00:02:32.830> that<00:02:33.100> I<00:02:33.280> do<00:02:33.340> is

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
now it's at 60 bpm now that I do is

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.210 
now it's at 60 bpm now that I do is
every<00:02:34.300> time<00:02:34.570> a<00:02:35.020> beat<00:02:35.890> goes<00:02:37.800> that's<00:02:38.800> when<00:02:39.100> I

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
every time a beat goes that's when I

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:58.470 
every time a beat goes that's when I
strike<00:02:39.490> enough

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.839 

then<00:02:59.480> if<00:03:00.080> you<00:03:00.230> do<00:03:00.500> that<00:03:00.769> like<00:03:00.980> I<00:03:01.190> did<00:03:01.400> with<00:03:01.580> no

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
then if you do that like I did with no

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.539 
then if you do that like I did with no
mistakes<00:03:01.909> you<00:03:02.510> can<00:03:03.500> take<00:03:04.040> it<00:03:04.190> up<00:03:04.250> an<00:03:04.430> octave

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
mistakes you can take it up an octave

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:22.250 
mistakes you can take it up an octave
higher

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.950 

and<00:03:23.260> then<00:03:23.470> what<00:03:23.740> you<00:03:23.890> do<00:03:24.100> is<00:03:24.430> you<00:03:25.420> crank<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:25.870> up

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
and then what you do is you crank it up

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:32.520 
and then what you do is you crank it up
20<00:03:26.380> more<00:03:26.560> BPM<00:03:27.090> up<00:03:28.090> to<00:03:28.300> a<00:03:28.330> TV<00:03:28.690> to<00:03:28.990> a<00:03:31.380> little<00:03:32.380> bit

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
20 more BPM up to a TV to a little bit

00:03:32.530 --> 00:04:12.280 
20 more BPM up to a TV to a little bit
faster

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:24.260 

and<00:04:13.290> crank<00:04:13.650> it<00:04:13.770> up<00:04:13.830> for<00:04:14.100> team<00:04:14.160> or<00:04:14.340> give<00:04:14.490> you

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:53.460 

you

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:05:00.730 

and<00:04:54.470> then<00:04:54.770> I<00:04:56.440> would<00:04:57.440> basically<00:04:57.850> suggest<00:04:59.740> going

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
and then I would basically suggest going

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.940 
and then I would basically suggest going
up<00:05:01.840> 20<00:05:02.840> BPM<00:05:03.970> just<00:05:04.970> keep<00:05:05.150> on<00:05:05.300> going<00:05:05.330> up<00:05:05.840> to<00:05:06.830> the

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
up 20 BPM just keep on going up to the

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.810 
up 20 BPM just keep on going up to the
max<00:05:07.280> of<00:05:07.550> your<00:05:07.790> metronome<00:05:08.180> like<00:05:09.110> with<00:05:09.350> mine

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
max of your metronome like with mine

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.800 
max of your metronome like with mine
it's<00:05:11.170> 250<00:05:12.170> with<00:05:12.950> yours<00:05:13.220> it<00:05:13.520> can<00:05:13.640> be<00:05:13.730> like<00:05:13.880> 240

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
it's 250 with yours it can be like 240

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.680 
it's 250 with yours it can be like 240
just<00:05:15.590> whatever<00:05:15.890> try<00:05:16.760> to<00:05:16.820> keep<00:05:17.090> it<00:05:17.300> up<00:05:17.420> to<00:05:17.570> the
