00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:11.679
 Removing the lid is not very difficult 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.369
 you can do with your hand sometimes need a little screwdriver like them 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:16.490
 that there is no stopping 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.589
 maybe something is tight 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:22.189
 there are two seats that must be removed, however, it is not like with 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.469
 other do models that you for example with a but the click system also searched 

00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:28.349
 at the preses in line that you brake 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.109
 slide you can convert but suddenly comes off through the lid 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.040
 you have to get started with debts 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.680
 there is a bit of a shame 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.680
 anyway that's the choice 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.130
 and if the ek will remove gets there 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.130
 in the back of the press he himself will sample the room 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.210
 actually you could say and enriched simple builds standard 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.510
 Structure 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.110
 not so many components it is clearly one 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.150
 yes it was easier line than for example the servers or the pressure 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.110
 always us from dell 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.660
 a detail 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.090
 the processor with the cooling 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.470
 today, that means that the cooling is loose as food but is just a bit sharper 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.300
 mounted 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.350
 on this side this is still a big fan 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.900
 the thing to keep fresh the air flow who can actually have a nice mac here 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.979
 from the back 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.320
 walk through the pcm but the front 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.320
 we're all good at it 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.880
 I've just taken the standard options on the back of behind websites 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.350
 that means those people 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.380
 worth piglets 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.700
 fortunately, two benches of a gigabyte and two benches of 5 and 12 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.670
 megabyte the bring together 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.360
 is 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.360
 great choice 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.610
 You look at the expansion of Citi's slots that are present on the motherboard 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.070
 to be 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.520
 three times standard is included with that you can 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.940
 what an audi and extra audio cards in November there was card with what you 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.640
 want 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.130
 two small this year is that one once 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.420
 eight times this year 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.820
 closed in it are the ones from the graphics card 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.329
 and a radius of action has been chosen 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.379
 the earthquake 36 50 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.899
 and I do have a comment about that 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:17.899
 as can be seen here at the back 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:23.739
 has this once and via reports and v 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.069
 furthermore an hdmi port and one 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.229
 a display port 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:31.229
 that is a choice that actually do not understand so well 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:33.669
 in the business market you have anyway 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:36.200
 it soon that people with several men will then work 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.059
 and then it's easy if you have 2 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:41.539
 tyron who has to connect via airport to call someone 

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:44.539
 hdmi is more for displaying hd video 

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:49.799
 I don't see that happening so quickly in the business market 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.979
 newest the labor position the newest way of like that of monitors 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:56.759
 but there are still very few because if you are prepared for that 

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:59.650
 so I actually think they made the wrong choices here 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.650
 they should have chosen a free card 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:06.449
 twice those four years 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:11.729
 that is also the actors' positions so he could be seen at the bottom is a fixed one 

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:12.700
 disc inserted 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.580
 my models standard 71 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.759
 50 gigabyte hard disk the three occupants 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:20.839
 his age does not look like deskstar 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:23.159
 yes that's not all 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.159
 all most reliable brands but will undoubtedly do well 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:29.439
 I think they are a bit better for the business market, for example 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:33.049
 to keep choosing you can unfortunately not indicate on the dell website so you 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.999
 the top will have to do no 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:36.950
 and further up is take one 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.950
 DVD and CD burner 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:45.039
 what struck me is that actually everything via the 

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:47.150
 syria is also connected her task 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.349
 there are no more positions on the motherboard for a good idea 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.039
 write 

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:55.109
 something I don't fully understand for a business computer 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.199
 because they applauded the business market need of not having 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:02.749
 that they all dense the very latest connection 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:06.579
 what I find practical, for example, some of my already busy with 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.979
 250 and 300 diegem 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:13.199
 nokia it a user here for its former purple it sees the cities for 

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:16.669
 but that his idea everyone seems a lot 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.779
 and I just wasn't on the motherboard anymore 

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.309
 so i'm sorry they are having that here now 

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:24.309
 extra new but the appearance of having to buy 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.919
 but then completely cooked I think you can not see the cables but that is 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.000
 or again a connection on the motherboard for one for that diskette 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:36.139
 well those are I believe as insight into 98 extinct the city that choice I understand 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.990
 not entirely 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.069
 bunch of criticism 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:43.719
 also read anywhere, anytime 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:47.309
 eviction is a campaign in which it is completely unjustified 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.470
 into the cell 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.949
 front position of it 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.499
 of the system cabinet you have seen 

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:57.190
 but it is no further killings there were three 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.979
 if wilders also need an additional cards both places 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.960
 well that is also something i do not understand well 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.050
 actually in all modern preses, as far as I'm concerned, becoming a standard sailing 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.560
 were connected just think of the external hard drive of it 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.069
 work with video 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:16.590
 things like that for which it is very important from the exhibition 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.559
 that mission now completely 

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:22.699
 okay so summarizing about the dell vostro I have to work even more 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:25.699
 will see how animals prove themselves in practice 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:31.379
 with the scp it costs 549 euros excluding VAT in this standard equipment i have all 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:34.580
 standard options of the perpetrators had been taken over so were taken 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:38.639
 additional options selected 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.819
 what do you think is a figure 2 for then 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:45.499
 it is a brunette building the dog owners they should not be with 

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:47.409
 may be a competition 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:48.680
 it looks neat 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.240
 components are huge 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.099
 I think the equipment is scanty 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:56.099
 for the standard conditions it should not be missing 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.749
 the components that 

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:00.330
 are all with one of them 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.180
 a little less 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.639
 damn because i am for the business market actually 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:04.419
 honestly 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:05.809
 expected 

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:08.610
 business market often does not take precedence 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.930
 the newest of the newest but wants stable and robust 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:12.770
 components 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.500
 He thinks of a hard drive to the brands 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.800
 think of the minus but because that is the video card to the exclusion that this 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.059
 agree 

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:22.909
 with the wishes of the market 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:25.410
 so I think that certainly seems like a nice press 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:26.460
 to work with 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.600
 but I also have some reservations about it
