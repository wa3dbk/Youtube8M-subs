okay<00:00:01.050> welcome<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.620> this<00:00:01.740> video<00:00:01.920> we're<00:00:02.879> going

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
okay welcome to this video we're going

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.430 
okay welcome to this video we're going
to<00:00:03.030> be<00:00:03.149> looking<00:00:03.360> at<00:00:03.480> input/output<00:00:04.290> and

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
to be looking at input/output and

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.330 
to be looking at input/output and
storage<00:00:04.799> devices<00:00:05.690> so<00:00:06.770> this<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:07.950> computer

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
storage devices so this is a computer

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.480 
storage devices so this is a computer
I'm<00:00:08.790> sure<00:00:09.030> you<00:00:09.240> know<00:00:09.389> that<00:00:10.070> now<00:00:11.070> what<00:00:11.309> does<00:00:11.460> a

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
I'm sure you know that now what does a

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.240 
I'm sure you know that now what does a
computer<00:00:11.790> have<00:00:12.150> in<00:00:12.480> common<00:00:12.929> with<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.410> laptop<00:00:13.950> a

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
computer have in common with a laptop a

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.179 
computer have in common with a laptop a
bone<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> tablet<00:00:16.640> tick<00:00:17.640> tick<00:00:17.910> tick<00:00:18.180> tick

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
bone and a tablet tick tick tick tick

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.840 
bone and a tablet tick tick tick tick
well<00:00:20.189> they<00:00:20.820> all<00:00:20.970> need<00:00:21.119> data<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:22.850> hopefully

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
well they all need data and hopefully

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.609 
well they all need data and hopefully
from<00:00:24.029> previous<00:00:24.390> lessons<00:00:24.689> or<00:00:24.900> lessons<00:00:25.350> coming

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
from previous lessons or lessons coming

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.170 
from previous lessons or lessons coming
up<00:00:25.710> you'll<00:00:26.160> know<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.310> data<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.970> represented

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
up you'll know that data is represented

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.580 
up you'll know that data is represented
in<00:00:27.689> binary<00:00:29.599> but<00:00:30.599> unless<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.289> different

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
in binary but unless in a different

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.590 
in binary but unless in a different
video<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:33.739> what<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.010> about<00:00:35.100> data<00:00:35.600> and

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
video so what is it about data and

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.950 
video so what is it about data and
computers<00:00:37.380> that's<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:37.710> important<00:00:38.250> well

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
computers that's so important well

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.310 
computers that's so important well
computers<00:00:39.960> need<00:00:40.170> data<00:00:40.850> if<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.270> had<00:00:42.629> no<00:00:43.050> data

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
computers need data if you had no data

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.020 
computers need data if you had no data
the<00:00:43.649> computer<00:00:43.739> would<00:00:44.129> be<00:00:44.370> able<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.850> do

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
the computer would be able to do

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.910 
the computer would be able to do
anything<00:00:45.239> or<00:00:45.539> basically<00:00:45.899> become<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> brick<00:00:46.620> it

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
anything or basically become a brick it

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.250 
anything or basically become a brick it
would<00:00:47.460> not<00:00:47.879> be<00:00:48.030> able<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.329> actually<00:00:48.510> output

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
would not be able to actually output

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.100 
would not be able to actually output
anything<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.700> if<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.539> need<00:00:51.690> data<00:00:51.960> to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
anything to you so if you need data to

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.680 
anything to you so if you need data to
come<00:00:52.350> out<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> computer<00:00:53.370> really<00:00:54.300> what<00:00:54.570> has

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
come out of the computer really what has

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.900 
come out of the computer really what has
to<00:00:54.840> happen<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.320> has<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.590> go<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.860> first<00:00:56.160> so

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
to happen is it has to go in first so

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.389 
to happen is it has to go in first so
let's<00:00:57.270> take<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> look<00:00:57.719> at<00:00:57.840> how<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.170> happens<00:00:58.590> so

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
let's take a look at how that happens so

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.720 
let's take a look at how that happens so
here<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> mouse<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.750> very<00:01:01.320> familiar<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.340> many

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
here is a mouse is very familiar to many

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.289 
here is a mouse is very familiar to many
people<00:01:04.010> it's<00:01:05.010> probably<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.640> most<00:01:05.760> common

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
people it's probably the most common

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.120 
people it's probably the most common
input<00:01:07.110> device<00:01:07.439> along<00:01:07.710> with<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> keyboard<00:01:08.780> and

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
input device along with a keyboard and

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.640 
input device along with a keyboard and
essentially<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.280> mouse<00:01:11.520> allows<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.299> to

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
essentially this mouse allows you to

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.870 
essentially this mouse allows you to
click<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:13.970> icons<00:01:14.970> select<00:01:15.689> buttons<00:01:16.229> and

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
click on icons select buttons and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.039 
click on icons select buttons and
highlight<00:01:17.880> texts<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.540> all<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.780> sort<00:01:19.020> of

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
highlight texts and all that sort of

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.539 
highlight texts and all that sort of
thing<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.290> it's<00:01:19.409> actually<00:01:19.530> really<00:01:19.890> important

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
thing so it's actually really important

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.460 
thing so it's actually really important
input<00:01:20.970> device<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.689> there<00:01:22.140> are<00:01:22.229> different

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
input device and there are different

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.249 
input device and there are different
kinds<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.100> one<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.400> your<00:01:23.520> screen<00:01:23.640> right<00:01:23.939> now

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
kinds the one on your screen right now

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.570 
kinds the one on your screen right now
it's<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.439> kind<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.950> mouse<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.430> would

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
it's the kind of mouse that you would

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.140 
it's the kind of mouse that you would
most<00:01:27.470> commonly<00:01:28.470> find<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.979> house<00:01:29.250> or<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.670> a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
most commonly find in a house or in a

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.359 
most commonly find in a house or in a
workplace<00:01:30.689> or<00:01:30.990> at<00:01:31.049> school<00:01:31.409> or<00:01:31.740> something<00:01:31.799> like

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
workplace or at school or something like

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.030 
workplace or at school or something like
that<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.990> there<00:01:33.990> are<00:01:34.140> other<00:01:34.380> types<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.860> mice

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
that and there are other types of mice

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.770 
that and there are other types of mice
so<00:01:35.280> let's<00:01:35.430> take<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.579> look<00:01:35.820> at<00:01:36.000> one<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.750> a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
so let's take a look at one this is a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.630 
so let's take a look at one this is a
specialized<00:01:37.500> gaming<00:01:37.950> mouse<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.400> as<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.549> can

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
specialized gaming mouse and as you can

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.760 
specialized gaming mouse and as you can
see<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.850> looks<00:01:38.939> quite<00:01:39.210> different<00:01:39.650> there<00:01:40.650> are

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
see it looks quite different there are

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.249 
see it looks quite different there are
added<00:01:41.100> buttons<00:01:41.579> there<00:01:42.420> are<00:01:42.540> weights<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.110> it

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
added buttons there are weights to it

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.920 
added buttons there are weights to it
the<00:01:43.770> players<00:01:44.070> can<00:01:44.689> adjust<00:01:45.689> like<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
the players can adjust like the this the

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.679 
the players can adjust like the this the
DPI<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.649> basically<00:01:50.520> how<00:01:50.729> sensitive<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.509> mouse

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
DPI so basically how sensitive the mouse

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.690 
DPI so basically how sensitive the mouse
is<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.500> when<00:01:52.680> you're<00:01:52.770> sniping<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.490> game

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
is so like when you're sniping in a game

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.219 
is so like when you're sniping in a game
if<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:53.939> don't<00:01:54.090> want<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.270> move<00:01:54.420> too<00:01:54.630> much<00:01:54.659> you

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
if you don't want to move too much you

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.780 
if you don't want to move too much you
low<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.560> DPI<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.369> move<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.610> mouse<00:01:56.759> a

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
low the DPI and you can move the mouse a

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.370 
low the DPI and you can move the mouse a
lot<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.479> screen<00:01:57.659> it'll<00:01:57.960> only<00:01:58.049> change

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
lot but on the screen it'll only change

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.080 
lot but on the screen it'll only change
a<00:01:58.500> little<00:01:58.619> bit<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.549> mouse<00:01:59.729> is

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
a little bit so this mouse is

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.319 
a little bit so this mouse is
specialized<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:01.350> comparison<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.850> normal

Mouse<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.689> we'd<00:02:03.840> usually<00:02:04.110> use<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:05.700> of

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
Mouse that we'd usually use and of

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.100 
Mouse that we'd usually use and of
course<00:02:05.969> there<00:02:06.090> are<00:02:06.180> other<00:02:06.329> devices<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:07.020> have

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
course there are other devices that have

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.830 
course there are other devices that have
got<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.259> keyboard<00:02:07.500> got<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.340> scanner<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.479> we've

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
got a keyboard got a scanner and we've

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.550 
got a keyboard got a scanner and we've
got<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> microphone<00:02:10.440> now<00:02:11.220> this

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
got a microphone now this

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.490 
got a microphone now this
set<00:02:12.890> here<00:02:13.239> is<00:02:14.239> kind<00:02:14.660> of<00:02:14.690> like<00:02:14.840> a<00:02:14.870> special<00:02:15.319> thing

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
set here is kind of like a special thing

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.600 
set here is kind of like a special thing
because<00:02:15.650> it's<00:02:15.920> kind<00:02:16.099> of<00:02:16.130> like<00:02:16.250> a<00:02:16.280> hybrid

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
because it's kind of like a hybrid

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.780 
because it's kind of like a hybrid
really<00:02:17.180> so<00:02:17.810> we've<00:02:18.380> got<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.890> microphone<00:02:19.489> which

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
really so we've got the microphone which

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.339 
really so we've got the microphone which
is<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.060> input<00:02:20.330> device<00:02:20.630> but<00:02:20.900> we<00:02:20.989> also<00:02:21.140> have

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
is the input device but we also have

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.510 
is the input device but we also have
output<00:02:21.800> devices<00:02:22.069> on<00:02:22.340> here<00:02:22.520> which<00:02:22.780> include<00:02:23.780> the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
output devices on here which include the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.740 
output devices on here which include the
headphone<00:02:25.520> sometimes<00:02:26.360> it's<00:02:26.510> called<00:02:26.630> the

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
headphone sometimes it's called the

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.960 
headphone sometimes it's called the
speaker<00:02:27.640> okay

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
speaker okay

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.759 
speaker okay
and<00:02:29.300> I<00:02:29.330> know<00:02:29.510> some<00:02:29.810> headsets<00:02:30.349> you<00:02:30.440> can<00:02:30.590> buy

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
and I know some headsets you can buy

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.890 
and I know some headsets you can buy
also<00:02:31.130> include<00:02:31.760> some<00:02:32.030> sort<00:02:32.150> of<00:02:32.269> vibration

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
also include some sort of vibration

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.930 
also include some sort of vibration
control<00:02:33.260> as<00:02:33.380> well<00:02:33.560> so<00:02:33.800> if<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:33.980> get<00:02:34.160> if<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:34.790> get

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
control as well so if you get if you get

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.420 
control as well so if you get if you get
shot<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.720> actual<00:02:36.319> headset<00:02:36.709> vibrates<00:02:37.069> as<00:02:37.250> well

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
shot the actual headset vibrates as well

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.940 
shot the actual headset vibrates as well
it's<00:02:37.700> just<00:02:37.730> kind<00:02:38.060> of<00:02:38.150> cool<00:02:38.500> so<00:02:39.500> that's<00:02:39.620> that's

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
it's just kind of cool so that's that's

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.410 
it's just kind of cool so that's that's
an<00:02:40.160> input<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.580> an<00:02:40.670> output<00:02:40.790> device<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:41.330> we'll

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
an input and an output device and we'll

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.670 
an input and an output device and we'll
look<00:02:41.510> at<00:02:41.630> another<00:02:41.780> example<00:02:42.319> of<00:02:42.349> one<00:02:42.500> of<00:02:42.590> those

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
look at another example of one of those

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.890 
look at another example of one of those
in<00:02:42.860> a<00:02:42.950> moment

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
in a moment

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.840 
in a moment
so<00:02:44.900> getting<00:02:45.410> data<00:02:45.709> out<00:02:45.920> of<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.190> computer<00:02:46.700> is

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
so getting data out of the computer is

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.910 
so getting data out of the computer is
also<00:02:47.120> important<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:48.049> most<00:02:48.230> common<00:02:48.560> here<00:02:48.769> is

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
also important the most common here is

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.640 
also important the most common here is
the<00:02:49.430> monitor<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:50.360> monitor<00:02:50.540> allows<00:02:51.110> us<00:02:51.319> to<00:02:51.470> see

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
the monitor the monitor allows us to see

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.070 
the monitor the monitor allows us to see
what<00:02:51.860> the<00:02:51.890> computer<00:02:52.160> is<00:02:52.430> doing<00:02:53.080> really

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
what the computer is doing really

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.020 
what the computer is doing really
important

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
important

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.300 
important
output<00:02:56.030> device<00:02:56.299> for<00:02:56.630> us<00:02:56.660> without<00:02:57.560> it<00:02:57.920> without

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
output device for us without it without

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.800 
output device for us without it without
a<00:02:58.430> monitor<00:02:58.790> it's<00:02:59.120> really<00:02:59.360> hard<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.660> use<00:02:59.780> a

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
a monitor it's really hard to use a

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.630 
a monitor it's really hard to use a
computer<00:03:00.170> another<00:03:01.099> common<00:03:01.400> one<00:03:01.489> is<00:03:01.610> the

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
computer another common one is the

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.550 
computer another common one is the
speaker<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.360> speakers<00:03:02.780> often<00:03:02.989> provide<00:03:03.440> us

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
speaker the speakers often provide us

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.350 
speaker the speakers often provide us
with<00:03:03.650> either<00:03:04.099> well<00:03:04.430> usually<00:03:04.730> it's<00:03:05.000> probably

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
with either well usually it's probably

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.120 
with either well usually it's probably
your<00:03:05.599> music<00:03:06.019> coming<00:03:06.290> out<00:03:06.410> of<00:03:06.500> your<00:03:06.620> computer

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
your music coming out of your computer

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.660 
your music coming out of your computer
but<00:03:07.640> there<00:03:07.940> are<00:03:08.090> sometimes<00:03:08.480> little<00:03:08.989> auditory

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
but there are sometimes little auditory

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.979 
but there are sometimes little auditory
warnings<00:03:10.670> that<00:03:10.819> the<00:03:10.880> computer<00:03:11.269> gives<00:03:11.510> like<00:03:11.959> a

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
warnings that the computer gives like a

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.110 
warnings that the computer gives like a
little<00:03:12.260> ding<00:03:12.500> if<00:03:12.890> there's<00:03:13.880> a<00:03:13.970> problem<00:03:14.890> or<00:03:16.120> like

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
little ding if there's a problem or like

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.759 
little ding if there's a problem or like
there's<00:03:17.299> some<00:03:17.450> sort<00:03:17.660> of<00:03:17.690> really<00:03:18.260> harsh<00:03:18.560> noise

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
there's some sort of really harsh noise

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.949 
there's some sort of really harsh noise
if<00:03:18.980> there's<00:03:19.130> a<00:03:19.190> massive<00:03:19.459> problem<00:03:20.030> sometimes

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
if there's a massive problem sometimes

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.420 
if there's a massive problem sometimes
it's<00:03:21.079> a<00:03:21.109> happy<00:03:21.350> noises<00:03:21.530> I<00:03:21.769> yes<00:03:21.980> everything's

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
it's a happy noises I yes everything's

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.460 
it's a happy noises I yes everything's
being<00:03:22.609> saved<00:03:22.880> it's<00:03:23.180> all<00:03:23.299> good<00:03:23.540> we've<00:03:24.320> got<00:03:24.350> a

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
being saved it's all good we've got a

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.110 
being saved it's all good we've got a
projector<00:03:24.980> which<00:03:25.130> works<00:03:25.340> very<00:03:25.549> similarly<00:03:25.970> to

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
projector which works very similarly to

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.120 
projector which works very similarly to
the<00:03:26.450> monitor<00:03:26.840> another<00:03:27.530> common<00:03:27.799> one<00:03:27.890> is<00:03:28.010> of

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
the monitor another common one is of

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.030 
the monitor another common one is of
course<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.489> printer<00:03:29.030> now<00:03:29.660> in<00:03:29.870> in<00:03:30.230> tests<00:03:30.859> and

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
course the printer now in in tests and

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.740 
course the printer now in in tests and
exams<00:03:31.400> and<00:03:31.579> things<00:03:31.790> students<00:03:32.390> often<00:03:32.660> get

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
exams and things students often get

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:33.880 
exams and things students often get
confused<00:03:33.140> about<00:03:33.230> printers<00:03:33.769> because

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
confused about printers because

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.199 
confused about printers because
sometimes<00:03:34.370> they<00:03:34.459> say<00:03:34.640> it's<00:03:34.790> an<00:03:34.880> input<00:03:35.000> device

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
sometimes they say it's an input device

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.849 
sometimes they say it's an input device
and<00:03:35.569> the<00:03:35.930> reason<00:03:36.260> for<00:03:36.290> this<00:03:36.500> is<00:03:36.560> because

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
and the reason for this is because

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.099 
and the reason for this is because
they've<00:03:37.220> got<00:03:37.370> one<00:03:37.489> of<00:03:37.579> these<00:03:37.810> scanner<00:03:38.810> printer

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
they've got one of these scanner printer

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.710 
they've got one of these scanner printer
now<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.280> scanner<00:03:40.670> element<00:03:41.150> of<00:03:41.239> your<00:03:41.329> printer

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
now the scanner element of your printer

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.349 
now the scanner element of your printer
is<00:03:41.870> an<00:03:42.139> input<00:03:42.620> device<00:03:42.739> the<00:03:43.400> printer<00:03:43.940> part<00:03:44.209> of

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
is an input device the printer part of

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.590 
is an input device the printer part of
them<00:03:44.510> is<00:03:44.690> actually<00:03:45.350> a<00:03:45.709> print<00:03:46.280> is<00:03:46.519> an<00:03:46.700> output<00:03:47.269> so

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
them is actually a print is an output so

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.990 
them is actually a print is an output so
we've<00:03:47.959> got<00:03:48.109> the<00:03:48.200> input<00:03:48.380> scanner<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.549> output

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
we've got the input scanner the output

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.229 
we've got the input scanner the output
the<00:03:50.090> printer<00:03:50.510> don't<00:03:50.930> get<00:03:51.109> confused<00:03:51.620> between

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
the printer don't get confused between

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.979 
the printer don't get confused between
this<00:03:53.380> normal<00:03:54.380> printer<00:03:54.769> and<00:03:55.569> this<00:03:56.569> scanner

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
this normal printer and this scanner

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.729 
this normal printer and this scanner
printer<00:03:57.260> okay<00:03:58.030> so<00:03:59.030> we<00:03:59.660> know<00:03:59.870> how<00:04:00.049> data<00:04:00.410> gets

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
printer okay so we know how data gets

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.259 
printer okay so we know how data gets
into<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:01.280> computer<00:04:01.639> we<00:04:01.730> know<00:04:01.819> what<00:04:01.940> devices

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
into the computer we know what devices

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.379 
into the computer we know what devices
help<00:04:03.079> us<00:04:03.290> get<00:04:03.470> it<00:04:03.590> out<00:04:03.739> of<00:04:03.799> the<00:04:04.069> computer<00:04:04.389> so

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:05.389 
help us get it out of the computer so

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.960 
help us get it out of the computer so
what<00:04:05.840> about<00:04:05.900> storing<00:04:06.769> data<00:04:07.040> well<00:04:07.790> there<00:04:07.880> are

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
what about storing data well there are

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.599 
what about storing data well there are
different<00:04:08.060> types<00:04:08.389> of<00:04:08.480> storage<00:04:08.840> medium<00:04:09.609> the

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
different types of storage medium the

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.460 
different types of storage medium the
most<00:04:10.819> common<00:04:11.180> is<00:04:11.269> probably<00:04:11.660> like<00:04:11.930> the<00:04:11.959> USB

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
most common is probably like the USB

we've got the hard drive which is found
in<00:04:27.389> most<00:04:27.690> computers<00:04:28.910> that<00:04:29.910> you<00:04:30.030> come<00:04:30.180> across

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
in most computers that you come across

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.240 
in most computers that you come across
some<00:04:31.020> of<00:04:31.139> them<00:04:31.290> are<00:04:31.470> like<00:04:31.770> the<00:04:31.889> one<00:04:32.040> on<00:04:32.160> the

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
some of them are like the one on the

screen some of them are solid state

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.930 
screen some of them are solid state
which<00:04:34.200> means<00:04:34.350> they<00:04:34.500> are<00:04:34.740> really<00:04:35.100> fast<00:04:35.520> because

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
which means they are really fast because

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.490 
which means they are really fast because
they've<00:04:36.060> got<00:04:36.210> no<00:04:36.330> moving<00:04:36.660> bits

common<00:04:44.700> now<00:04:45.360> one<00:04:46.169> thing<00:04:46.440> that<00:04:47.160> students<00:04:47.550> get

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
common now one thing that students get

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:48.950 
common now one thing that students get
confused<00:04:48.030> with<00:04:48.150> sometimes<00:04:48.570> and<00:04:48.870> it's

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
confused with sometimes and it's

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.900 
confused with sometimes and it's
important<00:04:49.380> to<00:04:49.440> note<00:04:49.650> is<00:04:49.830> that<00:04:50.190> a<00:04:50.220> USB<00:04:50.669> pendrive

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
important to note is that a USB pendrive

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.120 
important to note is that a USB pendrive
is<00:04:51.270> not<00:04:51.510> an<00:04:51.630> input<00:04:51.930> device<00:04:52.020> just<00:04:52.650> because<00:04:53.010> you

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
is not an input device just because you

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.220 
is not an input device just because you
plug<00:04:53.340> it<00:04:53.490> into<00:04:53.700> a<00:04:53.880> computer<00:04:54.000> doesn't<00:04:54.960> make<00:04:55.080> it

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
plug it into a computer doesn't make it

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.340 
plug it into a computer doesn't make it
an<00:04:55.350> input<00:04:55.530> device<00:04:56.060> it<00:04:57.060> is<00:04:57.120> a<00:04:57.300> storage<00:04:57.990> device

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
an input device it is a storage device

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.550 
an input device it is a storage device
it's<00:04:58.800> where<00:04:59.070> you<00:04:59.220> save<00:04:59.610> your<00:04:59.640> files<00:05:00.270> and<00:05:00.660> while

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
it's where you save your files and while

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.500 
it's where you save your files and while
we're<00:05:01.740> on<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:01.919> topic<00:05:02.160> can<00:05:02.790> I<00:05:02.880> recommend<00:05:03.390> that

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
we're on the topic can I recommend that

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.570 
we're on the topic can I recommend that
you<00:05:03.570> don't<00:05:03.990> use<00:05:04.560> it<00:05:04.710> as<00:05:04.800> a<00:05:04.830> main<00:05:05.130> storage

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
you don't use it as a main storage

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.610 
you don't use it as a main storage
device<00:05:05.850> because<00:05:06.210> they're<00:05:06.360> very<00:05:06.780> easily<00:05:07.020> lost

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
device because they're very easily lost

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.290 
device because they're very easily lost
if<00:05:07.950> you<00:05:08.130> save<00:05:08.370> everything<00:05:08.790> on<00:05:08.940> to<00:05:09.090> that

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
if you save everything on to that

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.810 
if you save everything on to that
storage<00:05:09.990> device<00:05:10.380> onto<00:05:10.680> your<00:05:10.919> USB<00:05:11.550> pendrive

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
storage device onto your USB pendrive

storage device onto your USB pendrive
and<00:05:12.180> you<00:05:12.270> lose<00:05:12.510> it<00:05:12.540> you<00:05:13.200> lose<00:05:13.440> all<00:05:13.680> your<00:05:13.740> work

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
and you lose it you lose all your work

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.480 
and you lose it you lose all your work
make<00:05:15.090> sure<00:05:15.300> you<00:05:15.450> save<00:05:15.780> your<00:05:15.960> work<00:05:16.050> on<00:05:16.890> a<00:05:17.190> hard

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
make sure you save your work on a hard

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.879 
make sure you save your work on a hard
drive<00:05:17.690> or<00:05:18.690> in<00:05:18.780> the<00:05:18.870> cloud<00:05:19.200> or<00:05:19.560> something<00:05:19.800> like

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
drive or in the cloud or something like

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.590 
drive or in the cloud or something like
that<00:05:19.950> and<00:05:20.250> you<00:05:20.580> use<00:05:20.760> the<00:05:20.940> pendrive

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
that and you use the pendrive

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.750 
that and you use the pendrive
to<00:05:22.200> transfer<00:05:22.800> data<00:05:23.010> from<00:05:23.160> one<00:05:23.520> place<00:05:23.550> to

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
to transfer data from one place to

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.730 
to transfer data from one place to
another<00:05:23.970> or<00:05:24.950> use<00:05:25.950> it<00:05:26.100> as<00:05:26.160> a<00:05:26.220> backup<00:05:26.520> okay<00:05:27.740> right

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
another or use it as a backup okay right

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.370 
another or use it as a backup okay right
so<00:05:29.040> we've<00:05:29.550> looked<00:05:29.790> at<00:05:29.940> inputs<00:05:30.600> outputs<00:05:30.780> and

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
so we've looked at inputs outputs and

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.219 
so we've looked at inputs outputs and
storage<00:05:32.130> so<00:05:32.940> how<00:05:33.180> does<00:05:33.240> it<00:05:33.330> all<00:05:33.479> fit<00:05:33.540> in<00:05:33.870> well

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
storage so how does it all fit in well

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:35.960 
storage so how does it all fit in well
here<00:05:34.440> is<00:05:34.979> a<00:05:35.010> little<00:05:35.190> diagram<00:05:35.669> what<00:05:35.820> you're

going<00:05:36.120> to<00:05:36.180> need<00:05:36.390> to<00:05:36.539> learn<00:05:36.690> okay

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
going to need to learn okay

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.600 
going to need to learn okay
data<00:05:38.400> goes<00:05:38.970> into<00:05:39.539> our<00:05:39.780> input<00:05:40.350> section<00:05:41.070> okay

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
data goes into our input section okay

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.150 
data goes into our input section okay
and<00:05:41.789> that<00:05:41.880> happens<00:05:42.360> via<00:05:42.600> a<00:05:42.630> mouse<00:05:42.990> or<00:05:43.260> a<00:05:43.320> sensor

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
and that happens via a mouse or a sensor

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.540 
and that happens via a mouse or a sensor
or<00:05:44.190> any<00:05:45.120> kind<00:05:45.630> of<00:05:45.660> input<00:05:45.840> device<00:05:46.260> the<00:05:47.070> data<00:05:47.310> is

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
or any kind of input device the data is

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:53.180 
or any kind of input device the data is
then<00:05:47.700> processed<00:05:48.830> okay<00:05:49.830> and<00:05:52.010> from<00:05:53.010> that

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
then processed okay and from that

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.150 
then processed okay and from that
process<00:05:53.520> two<00:05:54.240> things<00:05:54.510> can<00:05:54.690> happen<00:05:54.720> either<00:05:55.590> the

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
process two things can happen either the

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.880 
process two things can happen either the
data<00:05:56.340> is<00:05:56.700> stored<00:05:57.330> or<00:05:57.660> it<00:05:58.289> is<00:05:58.470> output<00:05:59.330> okay<00:06:00.360> and

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:00.890 
data is stored or it is output okay and

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.040 
data is stored or it is output okay and
if<00:06:01.890> it's<00:06:02.550> stored<00:06:02.910> sometimes<00:06:03.390> it's<00:06:03.570> stored<00:06:03.840> and

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
if it's stored sometimes it's stored and

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.390 
if it's stored sometimes it's stored and
used<00:06:04.289> as<00:06:04.530> a<00:06:04.770> an<00:06:05.660> input<00:06:06.660> later<00:06:06.870> on<00:06:07.400> but

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
used as a an input later on but

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.080 
used as a an input later on but
sometimes<00:06:08.760> it's<00:06:08.880> just<00:06:08.940> stored<00:06:09.360> for<00:06:10.789> long<00:06:11.789> term

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
sometimes it's just stored for long term

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.580 
sometimes it's just stored for long term
usage<00:06:12.330> you<00:06:12.900> know<00:06:12.990> maybe<00:06:13.320> you're<00:06:13.500> just

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
usage you know maybe you're just

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.330 
usage you know maybe you're just
archiving<00:06:14.220> it<00:06:14.340> for<00:06:14.550> later<00:06:14.850> use<00:06:15.710> the<00:06:16.710> output<00:06:16.890> is

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
archiving it for later use the output is

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.300 
archiving it for later use the output is
sometimes<00:06:17.910> used<00:06:18.450> as<00:06:18.570> an<00:06:18.840> input<00:06:19.350> later<00:06:19.650> on<00:06:19.919> so

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
sometimes used as an input later on so

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.279 
sometimes used as an input later on so
if<00:06:20.340> you<00:06:20.490> think<00:06:20.729> of<00:06:20.820> it<00:06:20.970> like<00:06:21.000> a<00:06:21.289> central

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289 
if you think of it like a central

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:24.920 
if you think of it like a central
heating<00:06:22.650> system<00:06:22.729> you<00:06:23.729> input<00:06:23.970> the<00:06:24.180> temperature

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
heating system you input the temperature

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.100 
heating system you input the temperature
you<00:06:25.410> process<00:06:26.010> it<00:06:26.220> you<00:06:27.030> store<00:06:27.450> the<00:06:27.720> desired

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
you process it you store the desired

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.800 
you process it you store the desired
temperature<00:06:28.380> and<00:06:28.890> the<00:06:29.220> output<00:06:29.789> is<00:06:29.970> sometimes

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
temperature and the output is sometimes

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.170 
temperature and the output is sometimes
the<00:06:31.409> temperature<00:06:31.710> turning<00:06:32.159> on<00:06:32.310> or<00:06:32.550> turning<00:06:32.580> on

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
the temperature turning on or turning on

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.870 
the temperature turning on or turning on
the<00:06:34.180> output<00:06:34.870> is<00:06:34.990> also<00:06:35.170> sometimes<00:06:35.560> the<00:06:36.520> current

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
the output is also sometimes the current

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.420 
the output is also sometimes the current
temperature<00:06:37.420> based<00:06:37.900> on<00:06:38.080> a<00:06:38.110> process<00:06:38.410> of<00:06:38.710> the

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
temperature based on a process of the

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.870 
temperature based on a process of the
current<00:06:39.820> temperature<00:06:40.770> so<00:06:41.770> you<00:06:42.610> know<00:06:42.730> the

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 
current temperature so you know the

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.120 
current temperature so you know the
feedback<00:06:43.300> then<00:06:43.810> goes<00:06:44.080> back<00:06:44.110> as<00:06:44.440> an<00:06:44.560> input<00:06:44.860> like

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
feedback then goes back as an input like

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.830 
feedback then goes back as an input like
the<00:06:45.310> temperature<00:06:45.790> is<00:06:45.910> on<00:06:45.940> or<00:06:46.420> temperatures

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
the temperature is on or temperatures

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.840 
the temperature is on or temperatures
off<00:06:47.020> and<00:06:47.260> you<00:06:47.350> get<00:06:47.680> a<00:06:47.740> feedback<00:06:48.370> loop<00:06:48.520> that<00:06:48.550> way

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:48.850 
off and you get a feedback loop that way

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.370 
off and you get a feedback loop that way
so<00:06:49.450> those<00:06:50.260> are<00:06:50.470> the<00:06:50.530> two<00:06:51.060> sort<00:06:52.060> of

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380 
so those are the two sort of

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.540 
so those are the two sort of
possibilities<00:06:53.380> from<00:06:53.650> the<00:06:53.770> process<00:06:54.250> and

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:54.550 
possibilities from the process and

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.760 
possibilities from the process and
that's<00:06:55.090> it<00:06:55.270> that's<00:06:55.510> input<00:06:56.170> process<00:06:56.620> and

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770 
that's it that's input process and

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.070 
that's it that's input process and
output<00:06:57.280> and<00:06:57.430> storage<00:06:57.700> and<00:06:58.240> we'll<00:06:58.810> look<00:06:58.930> at

00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 
output and storage and we'll look at

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.990 
output and storage and we'll look at
process<00:06:59.440> in<00:06:59.560> another<00:06:59.800> video<00:07:00.070> later<00:07:00.520> on<00:07:00.790> to

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 
process in another video later on to

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.670 
process in another video later on to
look<00:07:01.150> at<00:07:01.270> more<00:07:01.450> detail<00:07:01.780> about<00:07:01.870> how<00:07:01.960> processing

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 
look at more detail about how processing

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.920 
look at more detail about how processing
works<00:07:02.890> when<00:07:03.100> we<00:07:03.130> look<00:07:03.310> at<00:07:03.400> the<00:07:03.520> CPU<00:07:03.810> all<00:07:04.810> right

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
works when we look at the CPU all right

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.530 
works when we look at the CPU all right
