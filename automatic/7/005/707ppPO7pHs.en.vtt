FXR I got the strc steering link and
servo<00:02:49.360> arm<00:02:50.099> I've<00:02:51.099> put<00:02:51.519> on<00:02:51.549> the<00:02:51.900> strc<00:02:53.310> front<00:02:54.310> and

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579

rear diff cover and I just put on the
energy<00:02:59.910> shocks<00:03:00.910> these<00:03:01.810> were<00:03:02.019> the<00:03:02.170> aluminum

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
energy shocks these were the aluminum

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.360 
energy shocks these were the aluminum
ones<00:03:02.980> they<00:03:03.849> came<00:03:04.360> with<00:03:04.569> the<00:03:04.750> shock<00:03:05.290> bodies<00:03:05.799> the

ones they came with the shock bodies the
little<00:03:07.019> adjustment<00:03:08.019> screw<00:03:08.500> here<00:03:08.829> the<00:03:09.340> shock

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
little adjustment screw here the shock

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.839 
little adjustment screw here the shock
caps<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:11.230> only<00:03:11.410> thing<00:03:11.590> I<00:03:11.680> needed<00:03:11.860> to<00:03:12.099> use<00:03:12.370> was

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
caps the only thing I needed to use was

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.470 
caps the only thing I needed to use was
my<00:03:13.709> shock<00:03:14.709> shaft<00:03:15.099> and<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.519> little<00:03:15.910> o-rings

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
my shock shaft and the little o-rings

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.129 
my shock shaft and the little o-rings
that<00:03:17.110> come<00:03:17.440> inside<00:03:18.329> so<00:03:19.329> those<00:03:19.630> are<00:03:19.780> just<00:03:19.840> a<00:03:20.109> few

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
that come inside so those are just a few

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.740 
that come inside so those are just a few
things<00:03:20.350> that<00:03:20.799> I've<00:03:20.920> done<00:03:20.950> to<00:03:21.459> it<00:03:21.670> and<00:03:21.940> I<00:03:22.630> have

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
things that I've done to it and I have

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.509 
things that I've done to it and I have
also<00:03:23.079> set<00:03:23.350> up<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.620> suspension<00:03:24.100> a<00:03:24.310> little

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
also set up the suspension a little

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.879 
also set up the suspension a little
different<00:03:24.970> if<00:03:25.120> you<00:03:25.540> noticed<00:03:25.959> it<00:03:26.109> it<00:03:26.380> does<00:03:26.560> sit

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
different if you noticed it it does sit

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:31.379 
different if you noticed it it does sit
a<00:03:26.920> lot<00:03:27.130> lower<00:03:29.250> I've<00:03:30.250> mounted<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.850> shocks<00:03:31.150> in

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
a lot lower I've mounted the shocks in

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:36.210 
a lot lower I've mounted the shocks in
the<00:03:31.420> lowest<00:03:31.810> position<00:03:32.019> and<00:03:32.819> on<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:36.040> bottom

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
the lowest position and on the bottom

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.240 
the lowest position and on the bottom
here<00:03:36.850> the<00:03:37.660> mounts<00:03:38.230> for<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:38.530> lower<00:03:38.709> links<00:03:39.100> and

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
here the mounts for the lower links and

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.490 
here the mounts for the lower links and
the<00:03:39.280> shocks<00:03:39.609> they<00:03:40.359> actually<00:03:40.840> face<00:03:41.109> the<00:03:41.380> other

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
the shocks they actually face the other

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.009 
the shocks they actually face the other
way<00:03:41.620> they<00:03:41.950> face<00:03:42.220> up<00:03:42.489> I've<00:03:42.970> turned<00:03:43.690> them<00:03:43.870> around

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
way they face up I've turned them around

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.300 
way they face up I've turned them around
all<00:03:44.560> four<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:45.209> it<00:03:46.209> gives<00:03:46.450> it<00:03:46.600> a<00:03:46.660> little<00:03:47.310> ittle

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
all four and it gives it a little ittle

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.050 
all four and it gives it a little ittle
bit<00:03:48.489> and<00:03:48.850> if<00:03:49.329> you<00:03:49.480> can<00:03:49.660> also<00:03:49.930> notice<00:03:50.380> here<00:03:51.060> if

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
bit and if you can also notice here if

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.979 
bit and if you can also notice here if
you<00:03:52.209> can<00:03:52.389> see<00:03:53.489> you<00:03:54.489> pick<00:03:54.730> this<00:03:54.910> camera<00:03:55.569> back<00:03:55.780> up

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
you can see you pick this camera back up

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.210 
you can see you pick this camera back up
here<00:03:56.200> if<00:03:56.350> you<00:03:56.950> can<00:03:57.160> see<00:03:57.190> it<00:03:57.670> also<00:03:59.220> helps

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
here if you can see it also helps

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.059 
here if you can see it also helps
straighten<00:04:00.790> out<00:04:00.910> the<00:04:01.120> drive<00:04:01.450> line<00:04:01.950> makes<00:04:02.950> the

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
straighten out the drive line makes the

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.280 
straighten out the drive line makes the
drive<00:04:03.370> line<00:04:03.579> real<00:04:03.849> nice<00:04:04.000> and<00:04:04.239> straight<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:05.680> uh

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
drive line real nice and straight so uh

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.080 
drive line real nice and straight so uh
that<00:04:08.290> helped<00:04:08.650> I<00:04:08.799> do<00:04:08.859> like<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.220> stance<00:04:09.700> of<00:04:09.910> it

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
that helped I do like the stance of it

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.710 
that helped I do like the stance of it
with<00:04:10.299> it<00:04:10.480> being<00:04:10.660> a<00:04:10.810> little<00:04:11.019> lower<00:04:11.260> um<00:04:12.450> it<00:04:13.450> seems

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
with it being a little lower um it seems

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.650 
with it being a little lower um it seems
to<00:04:13.959> crawl<00:04:14.260> a<00:04:14.290> lot<00:04:14.709> better<00:04:15.040> it<00:04:15.910> doesn't<00:04:16.389> flip

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
to crawl a lot better it doesn't flip

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.650 
to crawl a lot better it doesn't flip
over<00:04:16.989> as<00:04:17.109> much<00:04:17.320> I<00:04:17.889> will<00:04:18.459> grab<00:04:18.700> my<00:04:18.880> radio<00:04:19.329> here

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
over as much I will grab my radio here

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.360 
over as much I will grab my radio here
just<00:04:19.900> to<00:04:20.019> kind<00:04:20.260> of<00:04:20.320> give<00:04:20.380> you<00:04:20.560> a<00:04:20.590> comparison<00:04:21.010> of

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
just to kind of give you a comparison of

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.920 
just to kind of give you a comparison of
to<00:04:22.240> the<00:04:22.840> flex<00:04:23.229> of<00:04:23.500> it<00:04:23.650> here<00:04:24.539> so<00:04:25.539> that's<00:04:25.750> about

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
to the flex of it here so that's about

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.200 
to the flex of it here so that's about
as<00:04:26.260> at<00:04:26.560> its<00:04:26.919> highest<00:04:27.490> point

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
as at its highest point

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.159 
as at its highest point
they're<00:04:29.490> so<00:04:30.490> it's<00:04:30.850> I<00:04:31.060> think<00:04:31.180> that<00:04:31.660> the

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
they're so it's I think that the

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.800 
they're so it's I think that the
articulation<00:04:33.009> on<00:04:33.220> it<00:04:33.400> is<00:04:33.610> is<00:04:33.880> pretty<00:04:34.270> well<00:04:34.509> how

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
articulation on it is is pretty well how

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.800 
articulation on it is is pretty well how
it<00:04:34.990> is<00:04:35.460> anymore<00:04:36.460> and<00:04:36.880> I<00:04:36.940> just<00:04:37.330> think<00:04:37.569> it's<00:04:37.720> a

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
it is anymore and I just think it's a

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.600 
it is anymore and I just think it's a
little<00:04:37.960> overkill<00:04:38.590> I<00:04:38.770> think<00:04:39.009> it<00:04:39.130> would<00:04:39.280> be<00:04:39.310> too

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
little overkill I think it would be too

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.920 
little overkill I think it would be too
much<00:04:39.930> so<00:04:41.550> I'm<00:04:42.550> real<00:04:42.880> happy<00:04:43.060> with<00:04:43.419> this<00:04:43.599> thing

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
much so I'm real happy with this thing

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.450 
much so I'm real happy with this thing
I've<00:04:44.259> i<00:04:45.220> went<00:04:45.669> from<00:04:45.880> the<00:04:46.120> original<00:04:46.979> axial<00:04:47.979> ax10

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
I've i went from the original axial ax10

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.719 
I've i went from the original axial ax10
and<00:04:49.319> my<00:04:50.319> hobby<00:04:50.530> guy<00:04:50.740> told<00:04:51.009> me<00:04:51.099> that<00:04:51.340> this<00:04:51.460> was<00:04:51.520> a

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
and my hobby guy told me that this was a

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.170 
and my hobby guy told me that this was a
good<00:04:52.349> good<00:04:53.349> crawler<00:04:53.650> to<00:04:53.919> get<00:04:54.099> good<00:04:54.819> thing<00:04:55.060> to

good good crawler to get good thing to

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.659 
good good crawler to get good thing to
start<00:04:55.210> with<00:04:55.509> so<00:04:55.990> so<00:04:56.590> far<00:04:56.830> I'm<00:04:56.979> real<00:04:57.190> happy<00:04:57.340> with
