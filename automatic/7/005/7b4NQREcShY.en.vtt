00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
it just it doesn't actually close it

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.570 
it just it doesn't actually close it
just<00:02:42.640> closes<00:02:42.850> uh<00:02:43.060> that<00:02:43.750> thing<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:45.190> if<00:02:45.489> you

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.030 
unfortunately there's no pinch to zoom
yet<00:02:49.150> i'm<00:02:49.630> not<00:02:49.750> sure<00:02:49.930> why<00:02:50.110> that's<00:02:50.560> not<00:02:50.799> working

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040

yet i'm not sure why that's not working
but<00:02:51.850> there<00:02:52.030> is<00:02:52.060> double<00:02:52.420> tap<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:53.680> you<00:02:53.769> can

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
but there is double tap so you can

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.110 
but there is double tap so you can
double<00:02:54.100> tap<00:02:54.250> it<00:02:54.489> and<00:02:54.870> zoom<00:02:55.870> in<00:02:56.080> that<00:02:56.260> way

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
double tap it and zoom in that way

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.259 
double tap it and zoom in that way
pretty<00:02:58.120> sure<00:02:58.380> that<00:02:59.380> also<00:02:59.709> works<00:03:00.150> with<00:03:01.150> them

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
pretty sure that also works with them

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.870 
pretty sure that also works with them
the<00:03:04.269> browser

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.730 

let's<00:03:08.360> see

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
let's see

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.940 
let's see
no<00:03:10.730> that's<00:03:11.210> a<00:03:11.360> new<00:03:11.450> browser<00:03:11.690> or<00:03:12.440> add<00:03:12.590> some<00:03:12.800> new

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
no that's a new browser or add some new

no that's a new browser or add some new
oh<00:03:14.320> I<00:03:15.320> guess<00:03:15.560> I<00:03:15.680> clicked<00:03:15.950> on<00:03:16.120> at<00:03:18.250> all<00:03:19.250> right<00:03:19.400> so

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
oh I guess I clicked on at all right so

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.610 
oh I guess I clicked on at all right so
yeah<00:03:19.730> maybe<00:03:19.940> you<00:03:20.180> can<00:03:20.210> zoom<00:03:20.630> correctly<00:03:21.440> in

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
yeah maybe you can zoom correctly in

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.270 
yeah maybe you can zoom correctly in
that<00:03:22.580> but<00:03:23.030> then<00:03:23.360> you<00:03:23.420> can<00:03:23.570> also<00:03:23.770> can<00:03:24.770> also<00:03:24.950> use

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
that but then you can also can also use

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.670 
that but then you can also can also use
this<00:03:26.050> swipe<00:03:27.050> gesture<00:03:27.350> at<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.530> top<00:03:27.790> to<00:03:29.680> to

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
this swipe gesture at the top to to

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:38.350 
this swipe gesture at the top to to
bring<00:03:30.860> down<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.100> menu

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.270 

but<00:03:38.930> yeah<00:03:39.050> so<00:03:39.260> that's<00:03:39.410> a<00:03:39.470> remote<00:03:39.770> control<00:03:40.100> app

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
but yeah so that's a remote control app

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.150 
but yeah so that's a remote control app
you<00:03:40.520> can<00:03:41.290> you<00:03:42.290> can't<00:03:42.530> use<00:03:42.680> it<00:03:42.800> in<00:03:42.920> games

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
you can you can't use it in games

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.430 
you can you can't use it in games
unfortunately<00:03:44.120> we<00:03:44.240> already<00:03:44.600> tried<00:03:44.930> in<00:03:45.200> games

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
unfortunately we already tried in games

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.160 
unfortunately we already tried in games
unless<00:03:46.280> sure<00:03:46.550> why<00:03:46.700> that<00:03:46.730> doesn't<00:03:47.030> work<00:03:47.360> at<00:03:48.050> the

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
unless sure why that doesn't work at the

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.030 
unless sure why that doesn't work at the
moment<00:03:48.350> I<00:03:48.740> guess<00:03:49.550> just<00:03:49.700> because<00:03:50.800> the<00:03:51.800> games

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
moment I guess just because the games

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.520 
moment I guess just because the games
have<00:03:52.220> to<00:03:52.400> be<00:03:52.520> formatted<00:03:52.850> for<00:03:53.780> it<00:03:53.900> or<00:03:54.050> something

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
have to be formatted for it or something

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.370 
have to be formatted for it or something
