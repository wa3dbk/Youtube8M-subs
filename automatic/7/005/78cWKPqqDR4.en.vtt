00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
really breaking a lot of boundaries but

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.050 
really breaking a lot of boundaries but
yet<00:01:12.930> was<00:01:13.110> something<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.590> classical<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.520> love

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
yet was something so classical so I love

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.700 
yet was something so classical so I love
that<00:01:15.090> people<00:01:15.659> understand<00:01:16.229> Shakespeare's

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
that people understand Shakespeare's

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.990 
that people understand Shakespeare's
heart<00:01:16.920> for<00:01:17.100> me<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.460> English<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.850> my<00:01:17.970> first

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
heart for me and English is my first

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.550 
heart for me and English is my first
language<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.810> isn't<00:01:19.080> his<00:01:19.170> first<00:01:19.350> language

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
language this isn't his first language

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.410 
language this isn't his first language
what<00:01:19.920> he's<00:01:20.040> saying<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.210> his

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
what he's saying that it's like his

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.770 
what he's saying that it's like his
fourth<00:01:21.780> language<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.970> was<00:01:24.119> very<00:01:24.420> difficult

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
fourth language so it was very difficult

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.070 
fourth language so it was very difficult
and<00:01:26.180> Shakespeare<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.299> not<00:01:27.509> really<00:01:27.900> like

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
and Shakespeare is not really like

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.490 
and Shakespeare is not really like
you're<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:29.220> English<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:29.850> know<00:01:30.060> either

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
you're the English that we know either

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.140 
you're the English that we know either
so<00:01:31.500> it's<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.710> little<00:01:31.950> more<00:01:32.100> difficult<00:01:32.280> how

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
so it's a little more difficult how

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.630 
so it's a little more difficult how
about<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.540> we<00:01:34.079> got<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.829> reality<00:01:35.400> show
