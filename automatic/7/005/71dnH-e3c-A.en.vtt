00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
portholes actually have to hold down

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.660 
portholes actually have to hold down
clamps<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:07.110> only<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.500> one<00:01:07.770> which<00:01:08.130> works<00:01:08.460> out

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
clamps we only have one which works out

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.120 
clamps we only have one which works out
pretty<00:01:08.850> good<00:01:09.119> for<00:01:09.180> what<00:01:09.479> we're<00:01:09.630> doing<00:01:10.130> you

raise the bail of the bucket on top of

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.170 
raise the bail of the bucket on top of
the<00:01:17.610> clothespin<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.330> then<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.049> just<00:01:19.259> close

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
the clothespin and then you just close

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.399 
the clothespin and then you just close
your<00:01:21.180> portal<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.689> can<00:01:21.720> adjust<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.380> little

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
your portal you can adjust it a little

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.649 
your portal you can adjust it a little
bit<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:23.250> no<00:01:23.490> more<00:01:23.700> than<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.119> length<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
bit but no more than the length of the

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.990 
bit but no more than the length of the
clothespin<00:01:25.170> because<00:01:25.860> if<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.130> have<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.580> open

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
clothespin because if you have this open

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.170 
clothespin because if you have this open
the<00:01:27.630> water<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.259> going<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.799> blow<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.970> it's

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
the water is going to blow in and it's

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.399 
the water is going to blow in and it's
going<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.360> get<00:01:30.479> all<00:01:30.659> over<00:01:30.689> things<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.320> don't

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
going to get all over things you don't

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.530 
going to get all over things you don't
want<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.829> get<00:01:31.950> over<00:01:32.220> but<00:01:32.610> as<00:01:32.700> long<00:01:32.909> as<00:01:32.939> you

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
want it to get over but as long as you

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.469 
want it to get over but as long as you
keep<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.900> distance<00:01:34.880> no<00:01:35.880> greater<00:01:36.180> than<00:01:36.299> the

keep the distance no greater than the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.120 
keep the distance no greater than the
length<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.140> closed<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> water<00:01:37.950> will

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
length of that closed and the water will

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.280 
length of that closed and the water will
come<00:01:38.280> up<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.549> hit<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.000> window<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.780> then<00:01:40.020> fall

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
come up and hit the window and then fall

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.080 
come up and hit the window and then fall
down<00:01:40.320> into<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.040> bucket<00:01:41.250> which<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.700> exactly

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
down into the bucket which is exactly

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.850 
down into the bucket which is exactly
what<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.450> want<00:01:42.659> we've<00:01:43.170> been<00:01:43.380> using<00:01:43.590> this

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
what you want we've been using this

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.969 
what you want we've been using this
system<00:01:44.100> for<00:01:44.520> about<00:01:44.759> 12<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.420> 14<00:01:45.869> years<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.439> it's

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
system for about 12 to 14 years and it's

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.200 
system for about 12 to 14 years and it's
worked<00:01:47.159> real<00:01:47.369> good<00:01:47.399> for<00:01:47.790> us<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> whole<00:01:48.180> time

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
worked real good for us the whole time

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.289 
worked real good for us the whole time
any<00:01:51.210> bucket<00:01:51.630> will<00:01:51.780> do<00:01:51.960> for<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:53.270> piece<00:01:54.270> of

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
any bucket will do for this piece of

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.359 
any bucket will do for this piece of
work<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:55.470> happens<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.890> be<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.009> leftover

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
work this happens to be a leftover

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.060 
work this happens to be a leftover
bucket<00:01:56.820> from<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.090> drywall<00:01:57.479> wall<00:01:57.840> project<00:01:58.110> let

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
bucket from the drywall wall project let

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.940 
bucket from the drywall wall project let
me<00:01:59.159> show<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.790> little<00:02:00.479> bit<00:02:00.600> better<00:02:00.890> how<00:02:01.890> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
me show you a little bit better how the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.429 
me show you a little bit better how the
clothespin<00:02:02.520> interacts<00:02:02.969> with<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.450> window<00:02:03.780> or

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
clothespin interacts with the window or

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.050 
clothespin interacts with the window or
with<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.710> board<00:02:04.950> that's<00:02:05.189> that's<00:02:05.579> exactly

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
with the board that's that's exactly

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.340 
with the board that's that's exactly
what<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.329> want<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.570> have<00:02:06.750> there's<00:02:06.990> enough<00:02:07.229> of

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
what you want to have there's enough of

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.570 
what you want to have there's enough of
it<00:02:07.469> opening<00:02:07.710> there<00:02:07.890> for<00:02:08.069> air<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.369> flow<00:02:08.489> through

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
it opening there for air to flow through

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.339 
it opening there for air to flow through
and<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.119> does<00:02:09.330> especially<00:02:09.899> when<00:02:10.020> it's<00:02:10.170> windy

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
and it does especially when it's windy

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.209 
and it does especially when it's windy
but<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.190> does<00:02:11.370> keep<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.760> water<00:02:11.970> away
