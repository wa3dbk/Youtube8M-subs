00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
know if you can tell but i still have my

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.790 
know if you can tell but i still have my
red<00:00:39.270> highlights<00:00:39.660> from<00:00:39.809> before<00:00:40.200> they're<00:00:40.770> just

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
red highlights from before they're just

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.520 
red highlights from before they're just
look<00:00:41.219> more<00:00:41.399> vibrant<00:00:41.610> now<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.600> died<00:00:42.899> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.709 
look more vibrant now and I died the
whole<00:00:43.770> thing<00:00:44.129> red<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.730> think<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.239> color<00:00:45.480> was

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
whole thing red I think the color was

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.290 
whole thing red I think the color was
called<00:00:45.930> mahogany<00:00:46.530> um<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.059> can't<00:00:48.239> really

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300

and I was going to get this such or such
a<00:03:50.160> beat<00:03:50.519> one<00:03:50.730> but<00:03:51.000> that<00:03:51.150> one's<00:03:51.299> kind<00:03:51.540> of

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
a beat one but that one's kind of

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.420 
a beat one but that one's kind of
expensive<00:03:52.139> so<00:03:52.410> I<00:03:52.440> just<00:03:52.739> went<00:03:52.889> with<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.099> cheaper

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.580 
next I have the Revlon Colorstay liquid
I<00:04:13.739> pen<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:14.310> I<00:04:15.120> did<00:04:15.330> not<00:04:15.540> like<00:04:15.840> this<00:04:16.049> at<00:04:16.260> first

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
I pen and I did not like this at first

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.500 
I pen and I did not like this at first
because<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:17.130> applicator<00:04:17.639> was<00:04:17.940> really<00:04:18.239> hard

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
because the applicator was really hard

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.979 
because the applicator was really hard
to<00:04:18.600> use<00:04:19.079> um<00:04:20.000> it<00:04:21.000> looks<00:04:21.030> like<00:04:21.389> this<00:04:21.630> it's<00:04:21.930> like

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
to use um it looks like this it's like

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.290 
to use um it looks like this it's like
kind<00:04:22.320> of<00:04:22.410> like<00:04:22.470> a<00:04:22.710> marker<00:04:23.190> or<00:04:23.400> a<00:04:23.430> felt<00:04:23.820> tip<00:04:23.880> and

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
kind of like a marker or a felt tip and

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.860 
kind of like a marker or a felt tip and
I<00:04:25.050> find<00:04:25.320> that<00:04:25.470> this<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.850> lauriol<00:04:27.270> linear

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
I find that this the lauriol linear

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.310 
I find that this the lauriol linear
intense<00:04:28.230> one<00:04:28.530> is<00:04:28.770> easier<00:04:29.520> to<00:04:29.580> apply<00:04:30.050> but<00:04:31.050> I

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
intense one is easier to apply but I

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.629 
intense one is easier to apply but I
really<00:04:31.650> like<00:04:31.830> this<00:04:31.980> one<00:04:32.130> kind<00:04:32.370> of<00:04:32.460> better

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
really like this one kind of better

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.360 
really like this one kind of better
because<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:33.540> gives<00:04:34.020> a<00:04:34.260> matte<00:04:34.560> finish<00:04:34.590> unlike

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
because it gives a matte finish unlike

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.040 
because it gives a matte finish unlike
the<00:04:35.400> L'Oreal<00:04:35.910> one<00:04:36.090> which<00:04:36.240> is<00:04:36.270> a<00:04:36.600> glossy<00:04:36.870> finish

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
the L'Oreal one which is a glossy finish

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.320 
the L'Oreal one which is a glossy finish
and<00:04:37.680> I<00:04:38.520> don't<00:04:38.669> think<00:04:38.820> I<00:04:38.970> would<00:04:39.180> repurchase

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
and I don't think I would repurchase

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.659 
and I don't think I would repurchase
this<00:04:39.810> just<00:04:40.440> because<00:04:40.620> it<00:04:40.770> is<00:04:40.919> expensive<00:04:41.130> it's

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
this just because it is expensive it's

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.820 
this just because it is expensive it's
like<00:04:41.820> eight<00:04:42.030> or<00:04:42.060> nine<00:04:42.180> dollars<00:04:42.720> my<00:04:43.169> opinion<00:04:43.470> is

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
like eight or nine dollars my opinion is

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.920 
like eight or nine dollars my opinion is
expensive<00:04:44.340> for<00:04:44.520> a<00:04:44.550> drugstore<00:04:44.790> eyeliner<00:04:45.300> but<00:04:45.690> I

season and I've really been liking these
I<00:05:43.260> didn't<00:05:43.470> want<00:05:43.590> this<00:05:43.710> at<00:05:43.889> first<00:05:44.100> because<00:05:44.310> I

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
I didn't want this at first because I

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.860 
I didn't want this at first because I
didn't<00:05:44.700> think<00:05:44.789> it<00:05:44.940> was<00:05:45.000> that<00:05:45.060> pigmented<00:05:45.630> but

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
didn't think it was that pigmented but

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.210 
didn't think it was that pigmented but
um<00:05:46.710> when<00:05:47.639> I<00:05:47.669> bought<00:05:48.660> this<00:05:48.960> I<00:05:49.200> find<00:05:49.590> that<00:05:49.770> using

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
um when I bought this I find that using

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.310 
um when I bought this I find that using
your<00:05:50.490> fingers<00:05:50.789> to<00:05:51.000> apply<00:05:51.210> light<00:05:51.389> shadows<00:05:51.720> work

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
your fingers to apply light shadows work

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.960 
your fingers to apply light shadows work
a<00:05:52.470> lot<00:05:52.620> better<00:05:52.800> than<00:05:53.100> using<00:05:53.280> brushes<00:05:53.639> because

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
a lot better than using brushes because

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.920 
a lot better than using brushes because
um<00:05:54.600> I<00:05:55.440> think<00:05:55.620> I<00:05:56.070> don't<00:05:56.370> really<00:05:56.580> know<00:05:56.820> but<00:05:57.060> yeah

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
um I think I don't really know but yeah

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.750 
um I think I don't really know but yeah
if<00:05:58.139> you<00:05:58.530> do<00:05:59.010> find<00:05:59.190> that<00:05:59.310> these<00:05:59.520> aren't

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
if you do find that these aren't

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.250 
if you do find that these aren't
pigmented<00:06:00.180> then<00:06:00.450> try<00:06:00.630> using<00:06:00.780> your<00:06:00.900> fingers

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
pigmented then try using your fingers

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.920 
pigmented then try using your fingers
because<00:06:01.440> I<00:06:01.650> find<00:06:01.889> that<00:06:01.950> they<00:06:02.100> work<00:06:02.250> better<00:06:02.460> um

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
because I find that they work better um

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.840 
because I find that they work better um
um<00:06:03.930> that<00:06:04.289> using<00:06:04.889> that<00:06:04.979> technique<00:06:05.370> but<00:06:05.789> I've

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
um that using that technique but I've

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.909 
um that using that technique but I've
also<00:06:06.060> wanted<00:06:06.570> to<00:06:06.630> show<00:06:06.690> you<00:06:06.900> some<00:06:07.260> songs<00:06:07.530> I've

first two songs are by Wiz Khalifa which

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.969 
first two songs are by Wiz Khalifa which
I<00:06:12.510> really<00:06:12.720> didn't<00:06:13.020> like<00:06:13.050> him<00:06:13.289> at<00:06:13.350> first<00:06:13.410> I

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 
I really didn't like him at first I

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:16.010 
I really didn't like him at first I
wasn't<00:06:14.190> really<00:06:14.430> a<00:06:14.460> big<00:06:14.639> fan<00:06:14.669> especially<00:06:15.570> the

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
wasn't really a big fan especially the

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.110

song black and yellow I think that song

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.390 
song black and yellow I think that song
is<00:06:18.240> really<00:06:18.419> annoying

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400
