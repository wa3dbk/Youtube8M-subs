00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.350 
yeah yeah I think that's for everyone as
well<00:01:55.500> as<00:01:55.740> almost<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.070> scheming<00:01:56.460> about<00:01:56.939> season

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
well as almost a scheming about season

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.300 
well as almost a scheming about season
one<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:58.350> terms<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.619> vaccine<00:01:58.740> if<00:01:59.130> we're<00:01:59.219> gonna

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
one in terms of vaccine if we're gonna

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.130 
one in terms of vaccine if we're gonna
go<00:01:59.490> back<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.909> touch<00:02:00.299> upon<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.990> I'm<00:02:01.110> sure

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
go back and touch upon that and I'm sure

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.630 
go back and touch upon that and I'm sure
at<00:02:01.409> some<00:02:01.469> point<00:02:01.890> we<00:02:02.009> will<00:02:02.159> because<00:02:02.520> the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
at some point we will because the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.459 
at some point we will because the
episodes<00:02:03.060> are<00:02:03.210> still<00:02:03.420> being<00:02:03.570> written<00:02:03.659> but<00:02:04.439> I

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
episodes are still being written but I

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.390 
episodes are still being written but I
think<00:02:04.710> for<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.890> most<00:02:05.070> part<00:02:05.219> this

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
think for the most part this

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.230 
think for the most part this
season<00:02:06.880> two<00:02:07.030> is<00:02:07.210> moving<00:02:07.600> so<00:02:08.050> fast<00:02:08.080> so<00:02:09.090> yeah<00:02:10.090> so

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
season two is moving so fast so yeah so

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.160 
season two is moving so fast so yeah so
we<00:02:10.270> were<00:02:10.420> just<00:02:10.450> we're<00:02:10.780> just<00:02:10.899> gonna<00:02:10.990> go<00:02:11.140> in

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
we were just we're just gonna go in

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.050 
we were just we're just gonna go in
forward<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:11.620> again<00:02:11.920> with<00:02:12.130> Cassandra<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:12.880> I

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
forward and again with Cassandra and I

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.940 
forward and again with Cassandra and I
think<00:02:13.240> a<00:02:13.360> DS<00:02:13.540> character<00:02:14.020> we're<00:02:14.650> not<00:02:14.770> thinking

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
think a DS character we're not thinking

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.650 
think a DS character we're not thinking
so<00:02:15.190> much<00:02:15.280> of<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.520> past<00:02:15.760> as<00:02:16.090> much<00:02:16.420> as<00:02:16.540> we're

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
so much of the past as much as we're

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.970 
so much of the past as much as we're
just<00:02:16.690> trying<00:02:16.990> to<00:02:17.020> survive<00:02:17.350> and<00:02:17.620> think<00:02:17.770> about

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
just trying to survive and think about

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.770 
just trying to survive and think about
like<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.220> future<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.880> it<00:02:19.000> just<00:02:19.180> keep<00:02:19.450> going

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
like the future and it just keep going

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.970 
like the future and it just keep going
now

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
now

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.440
