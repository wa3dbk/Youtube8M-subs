of<00:02:03.960> your<00:02:04.229> low<00:02:04.890> end<00:02:05.100> grills<00:02:05.659> cooking<00:02:06.659> space<00:02:06.960> so

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
of your low end grills cooking space so

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.960 
of your low end grills cooking space so
magic<00:02:08.340> now<00:02:08.460> four<00:02:08.760> times<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:10.760> again<00:02:11.760> there's

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
magic now four times that again there's

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.560 
magic now four times that again there's
four<00:02:12.210> of<00:02:12.240> them

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
four of them

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.210 
four of them
there's<00:02:12.810> also<00:02:12.990> holes<00:02:13.380> here<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:13.710> you<00:02:13.980> can't

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
there's also holes here that you can't

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.090 
there's also holes here that you can't
probably<00:02:14.490> see<00:02:15.110> these<00:02:16.110> shelves<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.040> can

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
probably see these shelves you can

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.650 
probably see these shelves you can
basically<00:02:17.370> choose<00:02:17.880> where<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.240> want<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.510> put

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
basically choose where you want to put

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.430 
basically choose where you want to put
over<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.460> it's<00:02:20.460> great<00:02:21.000> for<00:02:21.320> compressing<00:02:22.320> the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
over so it's great for compressing the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.010 
over so it's great for compressing the
shelves<00:02:22.860> if<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:23.670> want<00:02:23.820> to<00:02:23.910> do<00:02:24.000> something<00:02:24.330> thin

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
shelves if you want to do something thin

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.340 
shelves if you want to do something thin
like<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.290> fish<00:02:25.620> or<00:02:25.920> or<00:02:26.670> sausage<00:02:27.300> things<00:02:28.170> like

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
like a fish or or sausage things like

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.590 
like a fish or or sausage things like
that<00:02:28.560> what<00:02:29.070> I've<00:02:29.190> been<00:02:29.340> contemplating<00:02:30.120> is

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
that what I've been contemplating is

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.840 
that what I've been contemplating is
buying<00:02:31.290> an<00:02:31.470> extra<00:02:31.770> set<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.010> shelves<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.700> then

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
buying an extra set of shelves and then

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.370 
buying an extra set of shelves and then
being<00:02:33.120> able<00:02:33.240> to<00:02:33.390> have<00:02:33.510> seven<00:02:33.900> shelves<00:02:34.230> in<00:02:34.350> here

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
being able to have seven shelves in here

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.930 
being able to have seven shelves in here
for<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.710> lot<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.010> sausage<00:02:35.550> there<00:02:35.700> are<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.790> lot<00:02:35.910> of

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
for a lot of sausage there are a lot of

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.380 
for a lot of sausage there are a lot of
fish<00:02:36.210> which<00:02:37.170> I<00:02:37.260> may<00:02:37.410> do<00:02:37.470> if<00:02:37.940> if<00:02:38.940> an<00:02:39.150> event

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
fish which I may do if if an event

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.190 
fish which I may do if if an event
requires<00:02:39.990> that<00:02:40.410> also<00:02:40.800> has<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.610> tray<00:02:42.600> here<00:02:42.870> a

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
requires that also has a tray here a

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.800 
requires that also has a tray here a
pretty<00:02:44.070> clever<00:02:44.310> idea<00:02:44.520> just<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.150> full<00:02:45.390> tells<00:02:45.690> a

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
pretty clever idea just a full tells a

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.290

water<00:02:49.140> trades<00:02:49.500> not<00:02:50.090> extremely<00:02:51.090> big<00:02:51.450> but<00:02:52.400> it

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
water trades not extremely big but it

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.310 
water trades not extremely big but it
does<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.000> job<00:02:54.030> I<00:02:54.330> mean<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.750> usually<00:02:54.900> have<00:02:55.170> to

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
does the job I mean you usually have to

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.470 
does the job I mean you usually have to
refill<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.800> few<00:02:56.010> times<00:02:56.190> which<00:02:56.820> is<00:02:57.000> not<00:02:57.180> the

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
refill it a few times which is not the

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.630 
refill it a few times which is not the
end<00:02:57.600> of<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.780> world<00:02:57.960> but<00:02:58.950> that's<00:02:59.250> something<00:02:59.550> to

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
end of the world but that's something to

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.900 
end of the world but that's something to
note<00:02:59.820> going<00:03:00.060> into<00:03:00.390> it

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
note going into it

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.810 
note going into it
the<00:03:03.470> excuse<00:03:04.470> me<00:03:04.590> Cody<00:03:04.830> can<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.340> move<00:03:05.520> please

what<00:03:07.130> okay<00:03:08.840> we<00:03:09.840> have<00:03:10.020> a<00:03:10.640> cast-iron<00:03:11.640> skillet

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
what okay we have a cast-iron skillet

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.850 
what okay we have a cast-iron skillet
here<00:03:12.510> does<00:03:12.720> not<00:03:12.750> come<00:03:13.140> with<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.440> but<00:03:13.590> this<00:03:13.710> is<00:03:13.830> a

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
here does not come with it but this is a

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.240 
here does not come with it but this is a
solution<00:03:14.280> for<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:15.630> chip<00:03:15.870> pan<00:03:17.720> this<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:19.250> what

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
solution for the chip pan this is what

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.510 
solution for the chip pan this is what
they<00:03:20.430> give<00:03:21.000> it's<00:03:21.810> fine<00:03:22.410> I<00:03:22.440> mean<00:03:22.710> there's<00:03:23.010> the

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
they give it's fine I mean there's the

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.010 
they give it's fine I mean there's the
real<00:03:23.670> problem<00:03:24.150> with<00:03:24.240> it<00:03:24.330> is<00:03:24.420> these<00:03:24.600> vents<00:03:24.900> on

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
real problem with it is these vents on

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.290 
real problem with it is these vents on
the<00:03:25.110> bottom<00:03:25.440> they<00:03:25.560> allow<00:03:25.710> too<00:03:25.770> much<00:03:25.920> oxygen<00:03:26.820> to

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
the bottom they allow too much oxygen to

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.960 
the bottom they allow too much oxygen to
get<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.660> wood<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.170> they<00:03:29.100> smolder<00:03:29.460> or<00:03:29.850> they

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
get to the wood so they smolder or they

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.270 
get to the wood so they smolder or they
smoke<00:03:30.510> for<00:03:30.750> about<00:03:30.780> maybe<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.500> minute<00:03:31.860> or<00:03:32.040> two

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
smoke for about maybe a minute or two

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.790 
smoke for about maybe a minute or two
and<00:03:32.490> then<00:03:32.700> they<00:03:32.820> just<00:03:33.030> burst<00:03:33.180> into<00:03:33.450> flames<00:03:33.800> and

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
and then they just burst into flames and

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.830 
and then they just burst into flames and
then<00:03:35.100> underneath<00:03:35.430> there<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:35.880> can<00:03:36.030> see<00:03:36.240> that's

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
then underneath there you can see that's

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.510 
then underneath there you can see that's
where<00:03:36.990> the<00:03:37.110> burner<00:03:37.320> is<00:03:39.770> really<00:03:40.770> the<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.340> best

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
where the burner is really the the best

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.040 
where the burner is really the the best
way<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.730> solve<00:03:42.030> that<00:03:42.240> just<00:03:42.420> put<00:03:42.570> a<00:03:42.600> cast<00:03:42.810> iron

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
way to solve that just put a cast iron

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.520 
way to solve that just put a cast iron
skillet<00:03:43.260> on<00:03:43.560> top<00:03:44.690> and<00:03:45.690> put<00:03:45.959> your<00:03:46.080> wood<00:03:46.230> chips

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
skillet on top and put your wood chips

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.190 
skillet on top and put your wood chips
or<00:03:46.740> chunks<00:03:47.100> inside<00:03:47.490> I<00:03:47.730> use<00:03:48.240> kind<00:03:48.900> of<00:03:48.959> thick

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
or chunks inside I use kind of thick

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.900 
or chunks inside I use kind of thick
chunks<00:03:49.650> in<00:03:49.770> the<00:03:49.860> night<00:03:50.010> I<00:03:50.250> split<00:03:50.670> them<00:03:50.760> with<00:03:50.790> a

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
chunks in the night I split them with a

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.420 
chunks in the night I split them with a
hatchet<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:52.050> that<00:03:52.230> they're<00:03:52.410> their<00:03:52.830> good<00:03:53.220> size

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
hatchet so that they're their good size

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.710 
hatchet so that they're their good size
I'm<00:03:53.670> not<00:03:53.790> a<00:03:53.820> big<00:03:53.970> fan<00:03:54.150> of<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.330> wood<00:03:54.480> chips

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
I'm not a big fan of the wood chips

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.030 
I'm not a big fan of the wood chips
they're<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:54.930> little<00:03:55.050> too<00:03:55.200> small<00:03:55.500> for<00:03:55.709> me<00:03:55.830> for

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
they're a little too small for me for

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.270 
they're a little too small for me for
anything<00:03:56.250> practical<00:03:57.470> so<00:03:58.470> that's<00:03:58.890> kind<00:03:59.130> of<00:03:59.160> how

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
anything practical so that's kind of how

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.400 
anything practical so that's kind of how
you<00:03:59.340> solve<00:03:59.640> that<00:03:59.700> problem<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.330> then<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.140> the

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
you solve that problem and then the the

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.320 
you solve that problem and then the the
push-button<00:04:01.650> ignition<00:04:02.130> is<00:04:02.940> a<00:04:03.000> little

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
push-button ignition is a little

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.330 
push-button ignition is a little
lackluster<00:04:03.540> to<00:04:04.080> me<00:04:04.230> it<00:04:04.980> worked<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.310> first

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
lackluster to me it worked the first

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.140 
lackluster to me it worked the first
time<00:04:05.760> I<00:04:05.790> used<00:04:06.120> it<00:04:06.300> but<00:04:07.260> when<00:04:07.980> I'm<00:04:08.130> pulling<00:04:09.060> out

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
time I used it but when I'm pulling out

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.510 
time I used it but when I'm pulling out
my<00:04:09.209> trains<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:10.290> mopping<00:04:10.709> stuff<00:04:11.010> some<00:04:11.370> of<00:04:11.459> the

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
my trains and mopping stuff some of the

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.640 
my trains and mopping stuff some of the
mop<00:04:11.700> sauce<00:04:11.910> falls<00:04:12.270> down<00:04:12.510> there<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:12.900> now<00:04:13.470> it's

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
mop sauce falls down there and now it's

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.240 
mop sauce falls down there and now it's
kind<00:04:13.860> of<00:04:13.890> sticky<00:04:14.510> so<00:04:15.510> that<00:04:16.080> is<00:04:16.590> not<00:04:16.830> a<00:04:16.890> big<00:04:17.070> deal

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
kind of sticky so that is not a big deal

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.830 
kind of sticky so that is not a big deal
they<00:04:17.460> have<00:04:17.580> a<00:04:17.609> little<00:04:17.910> one<00:04:18.540> of<00:04:18.600> those<00:04:18.720> little

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
they have a little one of those little

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.390 
they have a little one of those little
wands<00:04:19.320> that<00:04:19.410> you<00:04:19.500> put<00:04:19.650> a<00:04:19.680> match<00:04:19.919> in<00:04:20.190> and<00:04:20.340> you

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
wands that you put a match in and you

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.890 
wands that you put a match in and you
can<00:04:20.520> light<00:04:20.669> it<00:04:20.700> that<00:04:20.970> way<00:04:21.120> or<00:04:21.270> I<00:04:21.330> just<00:04:21.359> use<00:04:21.630> one

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
can light it that way or I just use one

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.820 
can light it that way or I just use one
those<00:04:22.160> extended<00:04:23.160> nozzle<00:04:23.699> lighters<00:04:24.259> and<00:04:25.259> then

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
those extended nozzle lighters and then

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.140 
those extended nozzle lighters and then
the<00:04:26.070> other<00:04:26.220> thing<00:04:26.400> we<00:04:26.550> know<00:04:26.699> there's<00:04:26.970> not

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
the other thing we know there's not

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.140 
the other thing we know there's not
really<00:04:27.360> a<00:04:28.110> way<00:04:28.380> to<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:29.370> say<00:04:29.550> I<00:04:29.580> want<00:04:29.880> it<00:04:29.940> to<00:04:30.030> be

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
really a way to to say I want it to be

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.820 
really a way to to say I want it to be
200<00:04:30.600> degrees<00:04:30.900> like<00:04:31.289> you<00:04:31.440> can<00:04:31.590> with<00:04:31.740> an

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
200 degrees like you can with an

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.870 
200 degrees like you can with an
electric<00:04:32.190> smoker<00:04:32.490> so<00:04:33.090> this<00:04:33.750> one<00:04:33.960> goes<00:04:34.110> from

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
electric smoker so this one goes from

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.960 
electric smoker so this one goes from
basically<00:04:35.880> high<00:04:36.270> to<00:04:36.330> low<00:04:37.100> what<00:04:38.100> I<00:04:38.130> what<00:04:38.880> I've

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
basically high to low what I what I've

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.390 
basically high to low what I what I've
done<00:04:39.150> is<00:04:39.330> basically<00:04:39.509> run<00:04:40.080> it<00:04:40.229> and<00:04:40.740> get<00:04:40.949> an<00:04:41.070> idea

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
done is basically run it and get an idea

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.510 
done is basically run it and get an idea
as<00:04:41.490> to<00:04:41.580> what<00:04:41.850> temperature's<00:04:42.330> what<00:04:42.600> so

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
as to what temperature's what so

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.550 
as to what temperature's what so
straight<00:04:44.520> down<00:04:44.550> for<00:04:45.090> me<00:04:45.240> on<00:04:45.419> this<00:04:45.900> unit<00:04:46.289> is

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
straight down for me on this unit is

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.360 
straight down for me on this unit is
pretty<00:04:47.340> close<00:04:47.580> to<00:04:47.610> 225<00:04:48.389> kind<00:04:49.080> of<00:04:49.169> fluctuates<00:04:49.710> a

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
pretty close to 225 kind of fluctuates a

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.550 
pretty close to 225 kind of fluctuates a
little<00:04:51.330> bit<00:04:51.600> depending<00:04:51.870> on<00:04:52.110> what<00:04:52.289> I've<00:04:52.410> opened

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
little bit depending on what I've opened

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.990 
little bit depending on what I've opened
the<00:04:52.770> doors<00:04:53.009> and<00:04:53.100> things<00:04:53.340> like<00:04:53.580> that<00:04:53.789> but

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
the doors and things like that but

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.420 
the doors and things like that but
overall<00:04:54.660> that's<00:04:54.930> pretty<00:04:55.199> consistent<00:04:55.410> I<00:04:55.979> feel

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
overall that's pretty consistent I feel

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.250 
overall that's pretty consistent I feel
like<00:04:56.580> things<00:04:56.760> are<00:04:56.970> going<00:04:57.120> a<00:04:57.240> little<00:04:57.360> slow<00:04:57.780> then

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
like things are going a little slow then

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.930 
like things are going a little slow then
I'll<00:04:58.350> just<00:04:58.530> twist<00:04:58.800> it<00:04:58.919> a<00:04:59.039> little<00:04:59.070> bit<00:04:59.280> to<00:04:59.789> up

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
I'll just twist it a little bit to up

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.360 
I'll just twist it a little bit to up
it's<00:05:00.240> kind<00:05:00.479> of<00:05:00.539> that<00:05:00.780> it<00:05:01.530> feels<00:05:01.770> it<00:05:02.039> seems<00:05:02.250> like

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
it's kind of that it feels it seems like

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.250 
it's kind of that it feels it seems like
it's<00:05:02.520> much<00:05:02.669> more<00:05:02.850> of<00:05:02.910> a<00:05:03.060> feeling<00:05:03.539> it<00:05:03.660> game<00:05:03.990> than

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
it's much more of a feeling it game than

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.800 
it's much more of a feeling it game than
it<00:05:04.380> is<00:05:04.560> precision<00:05:05.430> like<00:05:05.820> or<00:05:06.030> I<00:05:06.060> guess<00:05:06.360> you

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
it is precision like or I guess you

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.060 
it is precision like or I guess you
don't<00:05:06.930> really<00:05:07.199> know<00:05:07.320> if<00:05:07.440> the<00:05:07.530> electric<00:05:07.889> ones

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
don't really know if the electric ones

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.529 
don't really know if the electric ones
are<00:05:08.250> that<00:05:08.400> precise<00:05:08.789> to<00:05:09.000> be<00:05:09.090> honest<00:05:09.300> with<00:05:09.449> you

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
are that precise to be honest with you

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:10.490 
are that precise to be honest with you
you<00:05:09.660> just<00:05:09.720> don't<00:05:09.960> fiddle<00:05:10.229> with<00:05:10.350> the

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
you just don't fiddle with the

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.370 
you just don't fiddle with the
temperature<00:05:11.030> but<00:05:12.030> I<00:05:12.300> actually<00:05:12.870> don't<00:05:13.110> mind

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
temperature but I actually don't mind

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.129 
temperature but I actually don't mind
that<00:05:13.590> in<00:05:13.830> terms<00:05:14.370> of<00:05:14.490> results<00:05:14.810> I've<00:05:15.810> gotten

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
that in terms of results I've gotten

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:17.750 
that in terms of results I've gotten
really<00:05:16.320> good<00:05:16.560> results<00:05:16.949> out<00:05:17.010> of<00:05:17.070> this<00:05:17.250> thing<00:05:17.520> I

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
really good results out of this thing I

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.580 
really good results out of this thing I
feel<00:05:18.210> like<00:05:18.330> the<00:05:18.419> smoke<00:05:18.720> ring<00:05:18.960> is<00:05:19.169> a<00:05:19.199> lot<00:05:19.470> more

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
feel like the smoke ring is a lot more

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.740 
feel like the smoke ring is a lot more
prominent<00:05:20.190> so<00:05:20.340> the<00:05:20.940> food<00:05:21.150> that<00:05:21.300> you<00:05:21.419> pull<00:05:21.630> out

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
prominent so the food that you pull out

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.950 
prominent so the food that you pull out
of<00:05:21.780> it<00:05:21.930> looks<00:05:22.259> Moke<00:05:22.650> which<00:05:23.039> is<00:05:23.190> kind<00:05:23.460> of<00:05:23.520> nice

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
of it looks Moke which is kind of nice

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.920 
of it looks Moke which is kind of nice
flavor-wise<00:05:24.960> they're<00:05:25.410> both<00:05:25.560> fantastic<00:05:26.930> but

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
flavor-wise they're both fantastic but

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.500 
flavor-wise they're both fantastic but
one<00:05:28.080> thing<00:05:28.320> that<00:05:28.349> I<00:05:28.710> was<00:05:29.160> blown<00:05:29.400> away<00:05:29.430> with<00:05:29.789> by

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
one thing that I was blown away with by

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.740 
one thing that I was blown away with by
with<00:05:31.229> this<00:05:31.440> was<00:05:31.830> I<00:05:32.370> was<00:05:33.030> on<00:05:33.210> location

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
with this was I was on location

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.320 
with this was I was on location
somewhere<00:05:34.020> heat<00:05:34.320> and<00:05:34.470> stuff<00:05:34.680> up<00:05:34.889> and<00:05:35.130> I<00:05:36.000> needed

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
somewhere heat and stuff up and I needed

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.830 
somewhere heat and stuff up and I needed
to<00:05:36.449> heat<00:05:36.750> up<00:05:36.780> a<00:05:37.199> lot<00:05:37.860> of<00:05:38.039> it<00:05:38.159> quickly<00:05:38.760> but<00:05:39.690> also

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
to heat up a lot of it quickly but also

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.689 
to heat up a lot of it quickly but also
I<00:05:39.990> need<00:05:40.169> to<00:05:40.229> keep<00:05:40.470> stuff<00:05:40.830> warm<00:05:41.130> and<00:05:41.370> so<00:05:41.490> I

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699 
I need to keep stuff warm and so I

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:43.490 
I need to keep stuff warm and so I
started<00:05:42.389> heating<00:05:42.690> things<00:05:42.810> up<00:05:43.020> before<00:05:43.380> the

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
started heating things up before the

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.260 
started heating things up before the
event<00:05:43.770> started<00:05:44.159> and<00:05:44.340> then<00:05:44.430> I<00:05:44.520> used<00:05:44.789> this<00:05:45.030> is

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
event started and then I used this is

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.689 
event started and then I used this is
that<00:05:45.419> kind<00:05:45.599> of<00:05:45.720> a<00:05:45.889> warmer<00:05:46.889> to<00:05:47.220> keep<00:05:47.400> things

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 
that kind of a warmer to keep things

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:51.860 
that kind of a warmer to keep things
warm<00:05:47.970> so<00:05:48.750> I<00:05:49.199> was<00:05:49.680> able<00:05:49.770> to<00:05:49.919> get<00:05:50.070> 16<00:05:50.820> 1/2<00:05:51.210> chafing

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
warm so I was able to get 16 1/2 chafing

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.500 
warm so I was able to get 16 1/2 chafing
dishes<00:05:52.080> in<00:05:52.349> there<00:05:52.530> or<00:05:52.979> eight<00:05:53.430> full<00:05:54.030> shaking

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
dishes in there or eight full shaking

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.180 
dishes in there or eight full shaking
dishes<00:05:54.840> if<00:05:54.990> you<00:05:55.110> do<00:05:55.349> the<00:05:55.440> basic<00:05:55.740> math<00:05:55.770> there

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
dishes if you do the basic math there

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.920 
dishes if you do the basic math there
but<00:05:56.669> you<00:05:56.760> just<00:05:56.940> stack<00:05:57.180> them<00:05:57.360> on<00:05:57.419> top<00:05:57.479> of<00:05:57.690> each

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
but you just stack them on top of each

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.230 
but you just stack them on top of each
other<00:05:58.139> slide<00:05:58.949> them<00:05:59.130> in<00:05:59.280> there<00:05:59.460> and<00:05:59.669> it<00:06:00.030> worked

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
other slide them in there and it worked

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.899 
other slide them in there and it worked
like<00:06:00.510> a<00:06:00.750> charm<00:06:00.870> so<00:06:01.349> it<00:06:02.099> was<00:06:02.220> great<00:06:02.430> with<00:06:02.789> the

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:02.909 
like a charm so it was great with the

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:04.520 
like a charm so it was great with the
half<00:06:03.120> chafing<00:06:03.570> dishes<00:06:03.780> because<00:06:04.080> you<00:06:04.229> could<00:06:04.380> do

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
half chafing dishes because you could do

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.080 
half chafing dishes because you could do
half<00:06:05.130> of<00:06:05.340> it<00:06:05.460> at<00:06:05.610> a<00:06:05.699> time<00:06:05.940> so<00:06:07.729> yeah<00:06:08.729> it<00:06:08.909> worked

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
half of it at a time so yeah it worked

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.390 
half of it at a time so yeah it worked
real<00:06:09.419> well<00:06:09.449> for<00:06:09.810> that<00:06:09.990> so<00:06:10.289> it's<00:06:10.860> great<00:06:11.159> if<00:06:11.190> you

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
real well for that so it's great if you

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.640 
real well for that so it's great if you
want<00:06:11.610> some<00:06:11.900> versatility<00:06:12.900> in<00:06:12.990> terms<00:06:13.199> of<00:06:13.409> being

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
want some versatility in terms of being

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.620 
want some versatility in terms of being
able<00:06:13.740> to<00:06:13.889> take<00:06:14.070> it<00:06:14.220> places<00:06:14.610> if<00:06:15.330> you're<00:06:15.479> going

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
able to take it places if you're going

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.960 
able to take it places if you're going
camping<00:06:15.930> and<00:06:16.320> I<00:06:16.560> mean<00:06:17.250> you<00:06:17.460> can<00:06:17.610> essentially

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
camping and I mean you can essentially

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.990 
camping and I mean you can essentially
use<00:06:18.090> this<00:06:18.389> as<00:06:18.570> an<00:06:18.690> oven<00:06:18.840> I<00:06:19.740> I<00:06:20.430> would<00:06:20.849> be

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
use this as an oven I I would be

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.540 
use this as an oven I I would be
confident<00:06:21.659> you<00:06:21.840> could<00:06:21.990> get<00:06:22.169> it<00:06:22.289> up<00:06:22.409> over<00:06:22.770> 300

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
confident you could get it up over 300

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.600 
confident you could get it up over 300
350<00:06:24.449> ish<00:06:24.810> so<00:06:25.740> you<00:06:25.830> could<00:06:25.979> bake<00:06:26.130> something<00:06:26.370> if

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
350 ish so you could bake something if

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.879 
350 ish so you could bake something if
you<00:06:26.729> needed<00:06:26.909> to<00:06:27.150> but<00:06:27.389> it<00:06:28.199> is<00:06:28.260> a<00:06:28.380> little<00:06:28.650> large

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889 
you needed to but it is a little large

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.529 
you needed to but it is a little large
obviously<00:06:29.370> for<00:06:29.789> that<00:06:29.820> if<00:06:30.000> you<00:06:30.060> have<00:06:30.180> a<00:06:30.210> truck

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 
obviously for that if you have a truck

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:31.940 
obviously for that if you have a truck
or<00:06:30.719> something<00:06:30.900> it's<00:06:31.139> no<00:06:31.320> issue<00:06:31.500> whatsoever

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950
