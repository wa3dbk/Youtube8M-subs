00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.050
 a phantom company so there is no 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.300
 no kind of right advantage then 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.280
 come on will be in this for the model 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.899

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.589
 opened from outside and we also did not play with 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.360
 gopal and fantasy because there is no 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.140
 no kind of advantage 7 remembering that 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.420
 this circuit has 1,500 meters that 1,530 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.430
 meters in the mile and a half right there 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.770
 So give it to me, my best age. 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.290
 average and final start of any 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.780
 vehicle and that you can do one thing 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.020
 Nice may well get a session 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.820
 He dropped off at the airport there and did 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.189
 the stop but I prefer to do races 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.430
 the protection of the first ones that 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:36.479
 this kind of streak then ok let's cry 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:39.780

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.649
 right 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.180
 remembering that I'm not recording with 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.310
 felipe about the band right now 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.030
 again with choral because of 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.680
 time Felipe de BorbÃ³n and his fight 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.570
 morning and evening sometimes not 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.700
 Yesterday, I got there. I got more. 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.000
 I was dazzled and playing a little 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:07.880
 day until the dc was very fucking so the 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.679
 partial payments are 39 842 2010 41 0 48 of the 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.600
 different points then the difference was 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.069
 until the behind for not nearly two 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.720
 seconds then that's it saying it all 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.250
 here and the other with you that we 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.260
 we come back to the memory that 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.810
 enclosed spirited was the request for 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.970
 so acevedo so good it is good 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.650
 to observe if it says happy still requested of the 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.500
 So let's go there in the first half 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:34.040
 the deputy to the bathroom with some off and 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.310
 of the phoenix and now we'll see what 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.459
 dance for sex was your car rosinha 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.060
 charming penelope guy who is not my gay 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.370
 face 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.680
 remembering that we are playing as 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.930
 cars in any customization 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.730
 totally original factory 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.430
 And then you know better than anyone. 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.680
 but it's an airfoil type car 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.420
 accessory ends up having a little more 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.910
 performance does not admit that came out of 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.799
 factory original though it is now 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.930
 be taken so let's go 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.299
 the cry can stop the galley going 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.180
 accelerating here and that's exactly what the 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.970
 paulo phoenix was then azevedo 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.799
 heliton azevedo by ordering if you 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.049
 you also want your spiritist ratio 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.000
 done by me I need to let the 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.340
 comments noting that not a glance 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.290
 the category and also another thing not 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.390
 talk, you take a look to see if you already 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.880
 I did not because the guys were asking for the 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.200
 cars here and I had already done the school 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.090
 Thank you very much everyone 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.430
