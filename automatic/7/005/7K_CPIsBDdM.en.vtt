00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:15.280
 vegetable first step prepare the earth 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:18.579
 and planting is a compost table and 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:22.239
 greenhouse earth this mixture is 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:26.110
 deserves from a day before and is placed 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:29.890
 inside the trays it fills all 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.290
 the squares and the excess step is removed 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.940
 number 2 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.910
 you need to have the seed and in this 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.420
 cilantro seed case but you can 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:44.120
 have other seeds such as for example 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:48.110
 tomato carrot zucchini 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.960
 and also the earth so that when growing 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.050
 the plant comes complete to be 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.270
 transplanted you make a little boy in it from 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.970
 every little box 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:05.420

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:09.600
 little square you start with the first row 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.560
 one by one until you finish and you continue with 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.140
