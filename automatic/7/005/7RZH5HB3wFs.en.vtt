players an air flare is all about
momentum<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.379> your<00:00:43.559> swing<00:00:43.920> with<00:00:44.340> your<00:00:44.370> legs

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
momentum and your swing with your legs

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.459 
momentum and your swing with your legs
it's<00:00:45.329> all<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.050> legs

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
gonna have to swing over first you're

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.420 
gonna have to swing over first you're
gonna<00:00:54.570> start<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.590> any<00:00:55.710> sparks<00:00:56.190> you're<00:00:56.340> gonna

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.400 
have to start here and bring your leg
like<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.520> you<00:01:00.480> have<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.750> be<00:01:00.840> used<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.260> that

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
like that you have to be used to that

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.650 
like that you have to be used to that
motion<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.070> recommend<00:01:02.820> just<00:01:02.910> practicing

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
motion so I recommend just practicing

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.660 
motion so I recommend just practicing
over<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.110> over<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.409> over<00:01:04.439> again<00:01:04.680> only<00:01:05.519> using

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
over and over and over again only using

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.840 
over and over and over again only using
one

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
one

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.350 
one
in<00:01:06.970> one<00:01:07.210> leg<00:01:07.650> up<00:01:08.650> at<00:01:08.890> a<00:01:09.100> time<00:01:09.340> after<00:01:10.030> you<00:01:10.150> have<00:01:10.330> a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
in one leg up at a time after you have a

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.219 
in one leg up at a time after you have a
good<00:01:10.720> first<00:01:11.229> step<00:01:11.590> and<00:01:12.070> you<00:01:12.850> understand<00:01:13.720> the

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
good first step and you understand the

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.980 
good first step and you understand the
concept<00:01:14.830> of<00:01:14.979> swinging<00:01:15.370> kind<00:01:15.729> of<00:01:15.880> you<00:01:16.570> have<00:01:16.750> to

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
concept of swinging kind of you have to

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.290 
concept of swinging kind of you have to
learn<00:01:17.290> how<00:01:17.470> to<00:01:17.500> fully<00:01:17.890> swing<00:01:18.310> because<00:01:19.000> you

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
learn how to fully swing because you

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.750 
learn how to fully swing because you
want<00:01:19.479> to<00:01:19.570> swing<00:01:19.810> down<00:01:20.170> and<00:01:20.500> then<00:01:21.310> you<00:01:21.430> after

want to swing down and then you after

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.130 
want to swing down and then you after
you<00:01:21.850> swing<00:01:22.090> down<00:01:22.240> you<00:01:22.540> want<00:01:22.720> to<00:01:22.810> carry<00:01:23.050> a

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
you swing down you want to carry a

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.440 
you swing down you want to carry a
momentum<00:01:23.680> back<00:01:23.890> up<00:01:24.250> with<00:01:24.729> your<00:01:24.910> legs<00:01:25.119> and

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.840 
all that's left to an airplane now is
taking<00:02:03.770> your<00:02:03.830> momentum<00:02:04.040> and<00:02:04.460> throwing<00:02:04.729> it

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
taking your momentum and throwing it

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.000 
taking your momentum and throwing it
back<00:02:04.880> off<00:02:05.210> and<00:02:05.450> over<00:02:05.720> so

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
back off and over so

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.530 
back off and over so
let<00:02:07.220> me<00:02:07.310> demonstrate<00:02:07.430> that<00:02:07.940> talking<00:02:08.330> ball

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
let me demonstrate that talking ball

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.600 
let me demonstrate that talking ball
would<00:02:08.780> I<00:02:08.810> be<00:02:09.020> if<00:02:09.140> I<00:02:09.260> would<00:02:09.590> be<00:02:09.710> it<00:02:09.830> back<00:02:10.010> down

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
would I be if I would be it back down

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.300 
would I be if I would be it back down
and<00:02:10.910> over<00:02:14.470> one<00:02:15.470> thing<00:02:15.650> they<00:02:15.800> have<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.100> do<00:02:16.190> it

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
and over one thing they have to do it

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.400 
and over one thing they have to do it
air<00:02:16.460> players<00:02:16.760> he<00:02:17.000> always<00:02:17.150> have<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.510> commit<00:02:17.810> and

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
air players he always have to commit and

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.630 
air players he always have to commit and
you<00:02:18.560> have<00:02:18.740> to<00:02:18.860> have<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.070> mentality<00:02:19.250> that

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
you have to have the mentality that

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.430 
you have to have the mentality that
you're<00:02:19.940> gonna<00:02:20.060> go<00:02:20.270> through<00:02:20.510> with<00:02:20.630> it<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:21.050> that

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
you're gonna go through with it and that

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.870 
you're gonna go through with it and that
you're<00:02:21.590> not<00:02:21.680> gonna<00:02:21.830> stop<00:02:22.130> midair<00:02:22.550> because<00:02:22.790> if

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
you're not gonna stop midair because if

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.130 
you're not gonna stop midair because if
you<00:02:22.940> stopped<00:02:23.180> midair<00:02:23.480> you're<00:02:23.930> just<00:02:24.050> gonna

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
you stopped midair you're just gonna

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.540 
you stopped midair you're just gonna
fall<00:02:24.410> and<00:02:24.710> you're<00:02:24.800> never<00:02:24.980> gonna<00:02:25.160> get<00:02:25.430> it

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
fall and you're never gonna get it

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.130 
fall and you're never gonna get it
that's<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.120> following<00:02:26.420> learning<00:02:26.840> air

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
that's the following learning air

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.380 
that's the following learning air
players<00:02:27.410> you<00:02:28.340> have<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.670> remember<00:02:28.880> that<00:02:29.120> it<00:02:29.300> is

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
players you have to remember that it is

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.390 
players you have to remember that it is
just<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.750> swoop<00:02:30.080> so<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:30.710> put<00:02:30.920> three<00:02:31.040> legs<00:02:31.220> you

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
just a swoop so I put three legs you

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.100 
just a swoop so I put three legs you
have<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.730> swoop<00:02:32.000> down<00:02:32.030> with<00:02:32.510> your<00:02:32.660> feet<00:02:32.870> and

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
have to swoop down with your feet and

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.290 
have to swoop down with your feet and
bring<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:33.800> back<00:02:34.010> up<00:02:34.190> that's<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:35.120> whole

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
bring it back up that's the whole

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.210 
bring it back up that's the whole
momentum<00:02:35.540> of<00:02:35.870> a<00:02:35.960> swoop<00:02:36.230> because<00:02:36.440> all<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:37.070> is

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
momentum of a swoop because all it is

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.260 
momentum of a swoop because all it is
and<00:02:37.430> air<00:02:37.550> players<00:02:37.850> just<00:02:38.120> a<00:02:38.300> simple<00:02:39.140> momentum

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
and air players just a simple momentum

00:02:40.270 --> 00:03:07.260 
and air players just a simple momentum
so<00:02:41.270> you<00:02:41.330> have<00:02:41.600> to<00:02:41.980> with<00:02:42.980> your<00:02:43.160> legs<00:02:43.370> like<00:02:43.610> that

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.370 

that's<00:03:08.270> all<00:03:08.450> there<00:03:08.600> is<00:03:08.630> to<00:03:08.900> learning<00:03:09.170> in<00:03:09.260> air

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
that's all there is to learning in air

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.920 
that's all there is to learning in air
player<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:09.920> eventually<00:03:10.760> if<00:03:11.240> you<00:03:11.420> practice<00:03:11.810> it
