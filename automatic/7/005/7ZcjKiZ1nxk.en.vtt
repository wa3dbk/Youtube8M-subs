00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.460
 that good 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.060
 it is not the best map for safe harbor 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.500
 is not the best power but today is the 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.570
 best map for shotguns as was 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.079
 saying come let's give an attempt to 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.079
 see how it goes 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.460
 now we die 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.970
 in the last episode was the eighth no 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.650
 is fair or was not a little chaotic 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.650
 so to chaos land war 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.650
 no but yes vest time 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.000
 but if I want to take you with you 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.280
 this is the things of the live so that 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.770
 you see that the youtubers also 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.350
 it happens the same as all of you 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.680
 they are going to kill me and you will see that there are three 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.680
 sites 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.680
 we go 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.100
 today the 24 for you 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.420
 Well, what are you doing behind me? 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.409
 but nothing happens nothing happens this we 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.850
 we will focus 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.390
 I have not seen my mother for my mother 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.800
 the noise that does not come 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.800
 they are hands 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.830
 uy 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.100
 In addition, we are going to move, but not 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.100
 Man no 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.340
 let's see how many Down by 11 February 1 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.840
 perfect start today I have heated up a 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.220
 little bit more so that I did not miss what 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.530
 same from the other days 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.890
 so let's go for another little spin 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.890
 over here 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.689
 uy 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.780
 but where I'm going because I think 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.020
 much more fun to see this the 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.020
 shotguns 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.200
 to see not be a lie a mastery 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.000
 let's think with the medium you never could and 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.520
 with the shotguns so we make another 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.470
 Police time even though we have a 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.960
 spy we are going to take advantage of 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.550
 our partner in front of us 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.370
 to bait I do not know if what 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.260
 will carry ghost not but good 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.730
 that's another thing that you have to have in 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.530
 account has arrived four years ago have 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.370
 come sealed and garcÃ­a 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.370
 no no no no 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.150
 Where are you 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.140
 come now 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.140
 my mother now taking a blinding 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.590
 good as I was saying you have to 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.660
 keep in mind many times that there 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.230
 people who do not carry ghost like me in 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.970
 this case and colleagues or you who do 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.270
 you come ghost then you have to have 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.270
 account 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.140
 that even though you do not carry ghosts 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.150
 many times you can see them on the radar 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.900
 because because your colleagues do not 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.900
 they carry ghost 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.870
 this time in measuring for them good I'll 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.950
 by them of equal means that 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.950
 the hopes in that situation 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.970
 and then that situation if you have 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.250
 ghost and your companions do not have 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.200
 ghost you have to take into account 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.280
 that they will catch anyway 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.280
 badges to see 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.460
 come let's catch 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.060
 the route of the campero 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.439
 We come not are going to go go go 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.500
 activate this a little bit we are going to 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:02.140
 concentrate 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.440
 that if we do not concentrate more will not touch 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.440
 the world 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:12.310
 If I frame please do not give me arts 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:19.150
 let's come 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:19.150
 there were others there was another in a 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.150
 courageous claim we risk then 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.479
 we make the fool we risk and 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.479
 we die 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.780
 I've seen one on the left I think yes 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:43.590
 the one above I think glass machine 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:43.590
 death as we checked it myself 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:53.910
 once 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:55.290
 Rest assured that we will pull this a 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.710
 second although we have discovered the 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.710
 position 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:03.899
 voucher voucher 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.889
 do not give me signs at those distances 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.740
 with both videos 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:14.200
 arias and hope I'll recover from 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.100
 be in red 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.100
 I like love 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:25.050
 there are seven casualties this episode goes to 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.490
 be short, but there has been a 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.150
 good advice so 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.569
 it is compensated so to speak so 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.569
 let's do 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.910
 vale vale vale5 15 losses for 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.910
 that changing with the same 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.590
 a story has seen me more seen 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.880
 God 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.330
 well we have entered a game 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.910
 started that has finished first so 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.789
 nothing a good episode seems to me 33 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.650
 to 9 with a great advice that I have given to you 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:05.180
 Although you carry a ghost, you have to 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.550
 take into account other people not 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.910
 they carry ghost like happened to me in this 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:13.430
 case so you know no missteps of the 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.650
 people never trust yours 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.460
 ghosts and you put it on so nothing 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.990
 let's see how this episode has gone 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:24.139
 perhaps another hour to take advantage of the 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:29.509
 pull so let's see 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:30.499
 create class the committed 223 casualties 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:32.779
 let's enter that in the next 

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:35.029
 episode even though this action very 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:37.639
 quickie then let the 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:39.710
 camouflage this tipton iphone script 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:42.969
 the stands but that has enjoyed a 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.969
 greeting you later and this personality
