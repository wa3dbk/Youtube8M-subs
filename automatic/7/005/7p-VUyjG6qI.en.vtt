miked with a sennheiser 906 and here is

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:32.460 
miked with a sennheiser 906 and here is
my<00:00:21.270> clean<00:00:21.570> tone

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.430 

you

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:01:10.260 

and<00:00:36.440> here<00:00:37.370> is<00:00:37.550> the<00:00:37.880> sand<00:00:38.270> B<00:00:38.780> overdrive

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.690 

so<00:01:11.270> as<00:01:11.479> you<00:01:11.840> can<00:01:11.990> hear<00:01:12.200> a<00:01:12.320> really<00:01:12.590> great<00:01:13.130> medium

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
so as you can hear a really great medium

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.789 
so as you can hear a really great medium
gain<00:01:13.939> overdrive<00:01:14.570> pedal<00:01:14.930> it<00:01:15.140> also<00:01:15.500> works

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
gain overdrive pedal it also works

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.280 
gain overdrive pedal it also works
incredibly<00:01:16.280> well<00:01:16.369> as<00:01:16.610> a<00:01:16.640> boost<00:01:17.049> there<00:01:18.049> is<00:01:18.259> a

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
incredibly well as a boost there is a

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.460 
incredibly well as a boost there is a
high<00:01:18.770> gain<00:01:19.070> option<00:01:19.640> you<00:01:19.820> can<00:01:19.940> order<00:01:20.330> from<00:01:21.170> push

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
high gain option you can order from push

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.039 
high gain option you can order from push
and<00:01:21.619> pull<00:01:21.710> pedals<00:01:22.070> as<00:01:22.190> well<00:01:22.369> a<00:01:23.119> little<00:01:23.840> bit<00:01:23.930> of

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
and pull pedals as well a little bit of

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.609 
and pull pedals as well a little bit of
the<00:01:24.110> features<00:01:25.000> standard<00:01:26.000> a<00:01:26.180> volume<00:01:26.720> and<00:01:26.960> gain

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
the features standard a volume and gain

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.430 
the features standard a volume and gain
control<00:01:28.180> then<00:01:29.180> we<00:01:29.270> have<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.450> tone<00:01:29.750> control<00:01:29.780> here

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
control then we have a tone control here

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.550 
control then we have a tone control here
it<00:01:31.009> kind<00:01:31.250> of<00:01:31.280> works<00:01:31.490> as<00:01:31.670> a<00:01:31.700> cut<00:01:32.200> tone<00:01:33.200> control

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
it kind of works as a cut tone control

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.029 
it kind of works as a cut tone control
so<00:01:33.830> I<00:01:34.100> had<00:01:34.250> it<00:01:34.280> in<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.610> bright<00:01:34.820> mode<00:01:35.149> which

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
so I had it in the bright mode which

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:38.740 
so I had it in the bright mode which
when<00:01:37.039> you're<00:01:37.220> at<00:01:37.369> unity<00:01:37.850> which<00:01:38.090> is<00:01:38.240> actually

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
when you're at unity which is actually

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.410 
when you're at unity which is actually
fully<00:01:39.080> clockwise<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:40.369> all<00:01:40.520> your<00:01:40.850> guitar

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
fully clockwise so all your guitar

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.630 
fully clockwise so all your guitar
signal<00:01:41.600> that's<00:01:41.960> coming<00:01:42.350> into<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.710> effect<00:01:43.429> is

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
signal that's coming into the effect is

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.669 
signal that's coming into the effect is
coming<00:01:44.270> out<00:01:44.390> of<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.539> fact<00:01:44.780> when<00:01:45.080> your<00:01:45.229> tone

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
coming out of the fact when your tone

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:47.590 
coming out of the fact when your tone
knob<00:01:45.890> is<00:01:46.039> cranked<00:01:46.340> all<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.490> way<00:01:46.610> as<00:01:46.880> you<00:01:47.360> back

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
knob is cranked all the way as you back

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.330 
knob is cranked all the way as you back
it<00:01:47.780> off<00:01:47.929> it<00:01:48.170> gets<00:01:48.350> a<00:01:48.470> little<00:01:48.560> bit<00:01:48.800> smoother

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
it off it gets a little bit smoother

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.580 
it off it gets a little bit smoother
typically<00:01:50.060> with<00:01:50.240> an<00:01:50.360> overdrive<00:01:50.690> pedal<00:01:50.780> a<00:01:51.200> lot

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
typically with an overdrive pedal a lot

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.809 
typically with an overdrive pedal a lot
of<00:01:51.679> the<00:01:51.770> high<00:01:51.950> end<00:01:52.130> of<00:01:52.250> your<00:01:52.310> guitar<00:01:52.670> signal

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
of the high end of your guitar signal

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:55.600 
of the high end of your guitar signal
gets<00:01:53.539> cut<00:01:53.899> or<00:01:54.110> brought<00:01:54.740> down<00:01:55.009> a<00:01:55.039> bit<00:01:55.340> so<00:01:55.580> you

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
gets cut or brought down a bit so you

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.919 
gets cut or brought down a bit so you
get<00:01:55.819> a<00:01:55.850> great<00:01:56.090> smooth<00:01:56.479> overdrive<00:01:56.960> sound<00:01:57.759> this

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
get a great smooth overdrive sound this

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.419 
get a great smooth overdrive sound this
switch<00:01:59.929> here<00:02:00.229> is<00:02:00.259> a<00:02:00.409> bright<00:02:00.710> position

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
switch here is a bright position

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.190 
switch here is a bright position
when<00:02:01.909> you<00:02:02.030> have<00:02:02.210> it<00:02:02.360> in<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:02.600> standard

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
when you have it in the standard

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.289 
when you have it in the standard
position<00:02:03.640> there's<00:02:04.640> a<00:02:04.700> lot<00:02:04.909> more<00:02:05.030> low<00:02:05.270> end

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
position there's a lot more low end

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.059 
position there's a lot more low end
present<00:02:05.929> in<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.170> guitar<00:02:06.470> signal<00:02:06.649> coming

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
present in the guitar signal coming

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.279 
present in the guitar signal coming
through<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.280> pedal<00:02:07.580> and<00:02:07.759> it<00:02:08.569> sounds<00:02:08.810> really

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
through the pedal and it sounds really

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.759 
through the pedal and it sounds really
full<00:02:09.530> and<00:02:09.799> so<00:02:10.789> then<00:02:11.209> you<00:02:11.480> often<00:02:11.780> want<00:02:12.410> to<00:02:12.530> make

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
full and so then you often want to make

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.539 
full and so then you often want to make
sure<00:02:13.010> that<00:02:13.610> your<00:02:13.850> tone<00:02:14.360> knob<00:02:14.690> is<00:02:14.959> more<00:02:15.549> closer

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
sure that your tone knob is more closer

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.170 
sure that your tone knob is more closer
to<00:02:17.140> unity<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.190> tone<00:02:19.400> coming<00:02:19.700> through<00:02:19.970> and

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
to unity of the tone coming through and

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.030 
to unity of the tone coming through and
by<00:02:20.390> unity<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:20.870> mean<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:21.350> Tony<00:02:21.860> you're

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
by unity I mean the the Tony you're

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.569 
by unity I mean the the Tony you're
putting<00:02:22.280> into<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.489> is<00:02:22.700> coming<00:02:22.910> out<00:02:23.090> of<00:02:23.209> it<00:02:23.329> and

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:24.579 
putting into it is coming out of it and

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:27.009 
putting into it is coming out of it and
so<00:02:25.579> let's<00:02:26.180> just<00:02:26.239> go<00:02:26.480> through<00:02:26.690> some<00:02:26.840> of<00:02:26.959> these

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
so let's just go through some of these

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.080 
so let's just go through some of these
features<00:02:27.260> for<00:02:27.470> you<00:02:27.829> I'll<00:02:28.519> put<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:28.790> back<00:02:28.880> to

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
features for you I'll put it back to

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.940 
features for you I'll put it back to
where<00:02:29.209> it<00:02:29.359> was<00:02:29.390> I'll<00:02:30.140> just<00:02:30.380> play<00:02:30.560> a<00:02:30.590> little<00:02:30.709> bit

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
where it was I'll just play a little bit

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.039 
where it was I'll just play a little bit
clean<00:02:31.250> here<00:02:31.609> give<00:02:32.120> you<00:02:32.209> a<00:02:32.239> bit<00:02:32.359> of<00:02:32.450> an<00:02:32.540> idea<00:02:32.810> and

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
clean here give you a bit of an idea and

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.449 
clean here give you a bit of an idea and
then<00:02:33.260> we<00:02:33.290> will<00:02:33.650> roll<00:02:33.859> through<00:02:33.890> some<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.370> these

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
then we will roll through some of these

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:50.910 
then we will roll through some of these
features<00:02:34.700> so

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:03:11.060 

you

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.280 

so<00:03:12.070> now<00:03:12.850> I'm<00:03:13.030> gonna<00:03:13.180> change<00:03:13.510> things<00:03:13.780> up<00:03:14.020> a

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
so now I'm gonna change things up a

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.030 
so now I'm gonna change things up a
little<00:03:14.470> bit<00:03:14.650> I'm<00:03:14.980> gonna<00:03:15.460> flip<00:03:16.590> actually<00:03:17.590> just

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
little bit I'm gonna flip actually just

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.920 
little bit I'm gonna flip actually just
let<00:03:18.280> me<00:03:18.400> play<00:03:19.030> a<00:03:19.090> chord<00:03:19.390> for<00:03:19.630> you<00:03:19.720> really

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
let me play a chord for you really

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.620 
let me play a chord for you really
quickly

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:37.690 

you

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.850 

so<00:03:38.700> as<00:03:38.970> you<00:03:39.180> can<00:03:39.300> see<00:03:39.360> when<00:03:39.900> i<00:03:39.930> add<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.410> low<00:03:40.590> end

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
so as you can see when i add the low end

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.930 
so as you can see when i add the low end
there's<00:03:41.730> a<00:03:41.820> lot<00:03:42.030> more<00:03:43.310> when<00:03:44.310> i<00:03:44.340> sorry<00:03:44.730> when<00:03:44.910> i

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
there's a lot more when i sorry when i

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.340 
there's a lot more when i sorry when i
switch<00:03:45.210> away<00:03:45.390> from<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.750> bright<00:03:45.960> mode<00:03:46.140> there's

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
switch away from the bright mode there's

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.810 
switch away from the bright mode there's
a<00:03:46.410> lot<00:03:46.530> more<00:03:46.710> low<00:03:46.860> end<00:03:46.890> guitar<00:03:47.400> signal<00:03:47.700> is

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
a lot more low end guitar signal is

00:03:47.820 --> 00:04:17.689 
a lot more low end guitar signal is
present<00:03:48.210> so<00:03:48.660> let's<00:03:48.690> just<00:03:48.990> listen<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.320> that<00:03:49.350> now

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:21.990 

so<00:04:18.699> incredible<00:04:19.690> amount<00:04:20.019> of<00:04:20.789> overdrive<00:04:21.789> coming

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
so incredible amount of overdrive coming

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.969 
so incredible amount of overdrive coming
through<00:04:22.330> lots<00:04:22.810> of<00:04:22.990> low-end<00:04:23.379> nice<00:04:23.590> and<00:04:23.830> full

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
through lots of low-end nice and full

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.450 
through lots of low-end nice and full
nice<00:04:24.909> and<00:04:25.120> rich<00:04:25.270> sounding<00:04:25.750> nice<00:04:26.710> harmonics<00:04:27.310> as

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
nice and rich sounding nice harmonics as

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.290 
nice and rich sounding nice harmonics as
well<00:04:28.020> now<00:04:29.020> very<00:04:29.889> quickly<00:04:30.099> I'm<00:04:30.580> going<00:04:30.849> to<00:04:31.120> bring

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
well now very quickly I'm going to bring

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.379 
well now very quickly I'm going to bring
back<00:04:31.539> the<00:04:31.599> tone<00:04:32.080> up<00:04:32.319> just<00:04:32.620> so<00:04:32.710> you<00:04:32.800> can<00:04:32.949> see<00:04:33.389> how

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
back the tone up just so you can see how

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.619 
back the tone up just so you can see how
I<00:04:34.990> guess<00:04:35.349> smooth<00:04:35.740> or<00:04:36.039> dark<00:04:36.370> it<00:04:36.610> can<00:04:36.669> get<00:04:37.000> so

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:37.629 
I guess smooth or dark it can get so

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:50.090 
I guess smooth or dark it can get so
I'll<00:04:37.870> just<00:04:38.020> play<00:04:38.169> a<00:04:38.199> chord<00:04:38.530> again<00:04:38.680> for<00:04:39.039> that

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:05:00.980 

you

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.720 

some<00:05:01.990> great<00:05:02.200> feedback<00:05:02.710> with<00:05:03.160> a<00:05:03.190> semi-hollow

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
some great feedback with a semi-hollow

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.860 
some great feedback with a semi-hollow
guitar<00:05:04.950> now<00:05:05.950> if<00:05:06.250> you<00:05:06.520> have<00:05:06.790> the<00:05:07.000> the<00:05:07.330> tone<00:05:07.690> knob

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
guitar now if you have the the tone knob

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.180 
guitar now if you have the the tone knob
cranked<00:05:08.260> all<00:05:08.380> the<00:05:08.410> way<00:05:08.500> like<00:05:08.740> that<00:05:08.890> and<00:05:09.100> you

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
cranked all the way like that and you

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.650 
cranked all the way like that and you
find<00:05:09.460> it's<00:05:09.640> not<00:05:09.760> bright<00:05:10.090> enough<00:05:10.120> for<00:05:10.570> your

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
find it's not bright enough for your

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.450 
find it's not bright enough for your
instrument<00:05:10.930> that's<00:05:11.560> really<00:05:11.980> what<00:05:12.130> the<00:05:12.250> bright

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
instrument that's really what the bright

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.970 
instrument that's really what the bright
switch<00:05:12.760> is<00:05:13.000> for<00:05:13.330> and<00:05:13.600> so<00:05:14.140> now<00:05:14.350> when<00:05:14.560> we<00:05:14.590> engage

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
switch is for and so now when we engage

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.240 
switch is for and so now when we engage
that<00:05:15.010> you<00:05:15.610> will<00:05:15.730> hear<00:05:15.970> the<00:05:16.090> chords<00:05:17.040> not<00:05:18.040> as

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
that you will hear the chords not as

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.370 
that you will hear the chords not as
much<00:05:18.610> low<00:05:18.910> end<00:05:18.940> but<00:05:19.330> a<00:05:19.360> lot<00:05:19.630> of<00:05:19.750> clarity<00:05:20.050> and

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
much low end but a lot of clarity and

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:40.229 
much low end but a lot of clarity and
probably<00:05:20.710> a<00:05:20.770> little<00:05:20.920> bit<00:05:21.100> too<00:05:21.310> bright

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:40.239 

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:43.199 

so<00:05:40.899> as<00:05:41.199> you<00:05:41.559> could<00:05:41.739> hear<00:05:41.949> the<00:05:42.580> brights<00:05:42.939> which

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:43.209 
so as you could hear the brights which

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:45.539 
so as you could hear the brights which
really<00:05:43.599> really<00:05:43.899> adds<00:05:44.889> a<00:05:45.159> lot

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:45.549 
really really adds a lot

00:05:45.549 --> 00:05:47.759 
really really adds a lot
if<00:05:45.610> the<00:05:45.969> giton<00:05:46.389> is<00:05:46.689> not<00:05:46.929> bright<00:05:47.139> enough<00:05:47.379> in<00:05:47.589> the

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:47.769 
if the giton is not bright enough in the

00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:49.949 
if the giton is not bright enough in the
full<00:05:47.949> clockwise<00:05:48.369> position<00:05:48.879> and<00:05:49.689> there's<00:05:49.899> a

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:49.959 
full clockwise position and there's a

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:51.479 
full clockwise position and there's a
lot<00:05:50.139> of<00:05:50.259> boosts<00:05:50.529> in<00:05:50.619> this<00:05:50.739> pedal<00:05:51.009> as<00:05:51.129> well<00:05:51.279> I'm

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:51.489 
lot of boosts in this pedal as well I'm

00:05:51.489 --> 00:05:52.499 
lot of boosts in this pedal as well I'm
actually<00:05:51.610> going<00:05:51.879> to<00:05:51.969> turn<00:05:52.119> the<00:05:52.269> gain<00:05:52.479> down

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:52.509 
actually going to turn the gain down

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:54.749 
actually going to turn the gain down
significantly<00:05:53.049> and<00:05:53.739> I'm<00:05:54.309> going<00:05:54.429> to<00:05:54.489> turn<00:05:54.579> the

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:54.759 
significantly and I'm going to turn the

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:58.139 
significantly and I'm going to turn the
boost<00:05:54.969> up<00:05:55.179> and<00:05:56.459> leave<00:05:57.459> the<00:05:57.579> tone<00:05:57.789> controls

00:05:58.139 --> 00:05:58.149 
boost up and leave the tone controls

00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:59.819 
boost up and leave the tone controls
where<00:05:58.360> they're<00:05:58.479> at<00:05:58.599> now<00:05:58.629> and<00:05:59.019> let<00:05:59.499> you<00:05:59.649> listen

00:05:59.819 --> 00:05:59.829 
where they're at now and let you listen

00:05:59.829 --> 00:06:24.240 
where they're at now and let you listen
so<00:06:00.129> here's<00:06:00.159> clean

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.279 

so<00:06:25.250> as<00:06:26.060> you<00:06:26.240> can<00:06:26.330> see<00:06:26.389> there's<00:06:26.750> a<00:06:26.810> lot<00:06:26.930> of<00:06:27.080> boost

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:27.289 
so as you can see there's a lot of boost

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:29.950 
so as you can see there's a lot of boost
available<00:06:28.039> in<00:06:28.129> this<00:06:28.250> pedal<00:06:28.610> really<00:06:29.569> really

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
available in this pedal really really

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.219 
available in this pedal really really
great<00:06:30.169> medium<00:06:30.740> low<00:06:30.979> gain<00:06:31.220> boost<00:06:31.460> overdrive

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:32.229 
great medium low gain boost overdrive

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:34.689 
great medium low gain boost overdrive
one<00:06:33.229> more<00:06:33.409> feature<00:06:33.650> that<00:06:33.800> I<00:06:34.159> just<00:06:34.430> want<00:06:34.639> to

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:34.699 
one more feature that I just want to

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:35.920 
one more feature that I just want to
make<00:06:34.789> sure<00:06:34.819> you<00:06:35.030> understand<00:06:35.479> this<00:06:35.720> is<00:06:35.900> a

make sure you understand this is a

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.770 
make sure you understand this is a
buffer<00:06:36.349> switch<00:06:36.590> up<00:06:36.800> here<00:06:37.009> and<00:06:37.220> it<00:06:37.879> adds<00:06:38.090> so

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
buffer switch up here and it adds so

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.710 
buffer switch up here and it adds so
much<00:06:38.960> to<00:06:39.800> to<00:06:40.520> effect<00:06:40.909> sometimes<00:06:41.389> we<00:06:41.539> think

board if you have eight or ten paddles

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.450 
board if you have eight or ten paddles
in<00:06:50.870> a<00:06:50.960> row<00:06:51.110> and<00:06:51.319> you<00:06:51.740> don't<00:06:51.949> have<00:06:52.069> a<00:06:52.129> buffer

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:52.460 
in a row and you don't have a buffer

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.890 
in a row and you don't have a buffer
you're<00:06:52.669> gonna<00:06:52.759> have<00:06:52.940> tone<00:06:53.180> loss<00:06:53.419> and<00:06:53.690> this

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900 
you're gonna have tone loss and this

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.409 
you're gonna have tone loss and this
switch<00:06:54.199> right<00:06:54.259> here<00:06:54.800> when<00:06:55.310> it's<00:06:55.460> down<00:06:55.729> it<00:06:56.150> is

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:56.419 
switch right here when it's down it is

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:58.390 
switch right here when it's down it is
true<00:06:56.719> bypass<00:06:57.110> so<00:06:57.379> if<00:06:57.469> you<00:06:57.650> want<00:06:57.919> that<00:06:58.129> that

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 
true bypass so if you want that that

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.459 
true bypass so if you want that that
option<00:06:58.639> is<00:06:58.969> available<00:06:59.090> but<00:06:59.870> when<00:07:00.050> it's<00:07:00.229> up

00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:00.469 
option is available but when it's up

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:03.459 
option is available but when it's up
there's<00:07:00.770> a<00:07:00.800> buffer<00:07:01.219> in<00:07:01.400> this<00:07:01.969> pedal<00:07:02.840> in<00:07:03.020> it<00:07:03.199> and

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:03.469 
there's a buffer in this pedal in it and

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:06.249 
there's a buffer in this pedal in it and
it<00:07:03.590> keeps<00:07:03.860> your<00:07:04.490> signal<00:07:05.090> going<00:07:05.870> through<00:07:06.139> the

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:06.259 
it keeps your signal going through the

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.529 
it keeps your signal going through the
pedal<00:07:06.560> strong<00:07:06.979> so<00:07:07.310> there's<00:07:07.490> no<00:07:07.669> tone<00:07:07.909> loss<00:07:08.210> and

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:08.539 
pedal strong so there's no tone loss and

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:11.110 
pedal strong so there's no tone loss and
it's<00:07:09.530> a<00:07:09.590> really<00:07:09.860> unique<00:07:10.009> feature<00:07:10.310> and<00:07:10.550> I<00:07:10.909> think

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 
it's a really unique feature and I think

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.459 
it's a really unique feature and I think
it's<00:07:11.210> really<00:07:11.479> cool<00:07:11.750> to<00:07:11.900> have<00:07:12.050> that<00:07:12.199> on<00:07:12.319> your

00:07:12.459 --> 00:07:12.469
