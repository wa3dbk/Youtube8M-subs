making his own cars but what about the
the<00:02:07.770> car<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.190> average<00:02:08.369> millionaire<00:02:08.670> can

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
the car that the average millionaire can

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.449 
the car that the average millionaire can
go<00:02:09.300> out<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.629> actually<00:02:09.780> buy<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.649> 918<00:02:11.250> for

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
go out and actually buy the 918 for

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.100 
go out and actually buy the 918 for
example<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.000> Porsche<00:02:12.300> it's

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
example the Porsche it's

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.930 
example the Porsche it's
amazing<00:02:13.680> feat<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.460> they're<00:02:14.580> actually<00:02:14.850> gonna

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
amazing feat and they're actually gonna

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.580 
amazing feat and they're actually gonna
make<00:02:15.090> 900<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.630> them<00:02:15.720> exactly<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.530> the

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
make 900 of them exactly and the

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.630 
make 900 of them exactly and the
interesting<00:02:16.950> thing<00:02:16.980> about<00:02:17.100> this<00:02:17.370> car<00:02:17.430> is

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
interesting thing about this car is

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.640 
interesting thing about this car is
again<00:02:18.090> it's<00:02:18.270> a<00:02:18.330> hybrid<00:02:18.660> car<00:02:18.690> so<00:02:19.260> we're<00:02:19.560> gonna

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
again it's a hybrid car so we're gonna

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.200 
again it's a hybrid car so we're gonna
see<00:02:19.890> some<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:20.100> this<00:02:20.280> technology<00:02:20.490> used<00:02:21.090> in

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
see some of this technology used in

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.540 
see some of this technology used in
other<00:02:21.360> Porsche<00:02:21.720> cars<00:02:21.930> later<00:02:22.230> on<00:02:22.410> but<00:02:23.190> also<00:02:23.370> to

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
other Porsche cars later on but also to

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.730 
other Porsche cars later on but also to
that<00:02:23.940> car<00:02:24.210> actually<00:02:24.570> starts<00:02:25.290> at<00:02:25.410> under<00:02:25.710> a

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
that car actually starts at under a

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.410 
that car actually starts at under a
million<00:02:26.010> I'm<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.730> thing<00:02:26.880> about<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.210> car

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
million I'm the thing about that car

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.390 
million I'm the thing about that car
though<00:02:27.750> is<00:02:27.900> once<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.320> add<00:02:28.470> upgrades<00:02:29.130> and

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
though is once you add upgrades and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.430 
though is once you add upgrades and
options<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.150> bespoke<00:02:30.540> all<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.290> it

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
options and bespoke all of that it

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.800 
options and bespoke all of that it
pushes<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.830> price<00:02:32.070> it's<00:02:32.400> like<00:02:32.520> 850<00:02:33.150> exactly

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
pushes a price it's like 850 exactly

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.080 
pushes a price it's like 850 exactly
just<00:02:34.050> directly<00:02:34.500> but<00:02:35.130> again<00:02:35.520> like<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.940> know

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
just directly but again like you know

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.150 
just directly but again like you know
the<00:02:36.390> average<00:02:36.600> billionaire<00:02:37.440> he's<00:02:37.830> gonna<00:02:37.980> add

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
the average billionaire he's gonna add

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.710 
the average billionaire he's gonna add
on<00:02:38.310> his<00:02:38.520> own<00:02:38.640> things<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.300> pushes<00:02:39.510> the

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
on his own things and that pushes the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.360 
on his own things and that pushes the
price<00:02:39.930> way<00:02:40.110> as<00:02:40.290> soon<00:02:40.440> as<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.680> put<00:02:40.890> in<00:02:41.100> the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
price way as soon as you put in the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.000 
price way as soon as you put in the
stereo<00:02:41.850> system<00:02:42.390> probably<00:02:42.660> get<00:02:42.840> dollars<00:02:43.740> I

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
stereo system probably get dollars I

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.250 
stereo system probably get dollars I
actually<00:02:44.459> remember<00:02:44.910> one<00:02:45.330> of<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.450> stories<00:02:46.020> you

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
actually remember one of the stories you

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260 
actually remember one of the stories you
wrote<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:46.470> think<00:02:46.770> out<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:46.920> Geneva<00:02:47.240> about<00:02:48.240> a

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
wrote I think out of Geneva about a

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.020 
wrote I think out of Geneva about a
Lamborghini<00:02:48.900> hybrid<00:02:49.440> where<00:02:49.680> car<00:02:50.520> makers<00:02:50.850> are

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
Lamborghini hybrid where car makers are

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.930 
Lamborghini hybrid where car makers are
finally<00:02:51.450> realizing<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:52.640> hybrid<00:02:53.640> doesn't

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
finally realizing that hybrid doesn't

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.640 
finally realizing that hybrid doesn't
just<00:02:54.060> mean<00:02:54.180> green<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.810> also<00:02:55.080> means<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.440> hell<00:02:55.590> of

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
just mean green it also means a hell of

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.690 
just mean green it also means a hell of
a<00:02:55.830> lot<00:02:55.920> more<00:02:55.980> power<00:02:56.340> because<00:02:56.520> you're

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
a lot more power because you're

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.979 
a lot more power because you're
combining<00:02:56.850> two<00:02:57.180> different<00:02:57.510> drive<00:02:57.690> trains

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
combining two different drive trains

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.050 
combining two different drive trains
exactly<00:02:58.620> they<00:02:58.739> kind<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.040> discovered<00:02:59.730> this<00:02:59.880> in

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
exactly they kind of discovered this in

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.150 
exactly they kind of discovered this in
racing<00:03:00.570> because<00:03:01.110> when<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.350> have<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.590> hybrid

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
racing because when you have a hybrid

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.979 
racing because when you have a hybrid
car<00:03:02.820> you<00:03:02.970> don't<00:03:03.030> have<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.239> stop<00:03:03.480> as<00:03:03.660> much<00:03:03.810> to

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
car you don't have to stop as much to

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.570 
car you don't have to stop as much to
refuel<00:03:04.380> they<00:03:04.800> realize<00:03:05.040> wait<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.250> second<00:03:05.520> this

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
refuel they realize wait a second this

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.520 
refuel they realize wait a second this
is<00:03:05.730> way<00:03:06.030> more<00:03:06.060> efficient<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:06.780> also<00:03:07.290> quicker

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
is way more efficient and also quicker

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.350 
is way more efficient and also quicker
in<00:03:07.830> general<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:08.670> are<00:03:08.790> all<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.209> mean

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
in general so are all that mean

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.910 
in general so are all that mean
laferrari<00:03:09.720> I<00:03:10.050> think<00:03:10.410> we<00:03:10.470> have<00:03:10.560> pictures<00:03:10.800> of

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
laferrari I think we have pictures of

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.800 
laferrari I think we have pictures of
that<00:03:11.010> as<00:03:11.220> well<00:03:11.400> it's<00:03:12.030> also<00:03:12.270> a<00:03:12.420> hybrid

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
that as well it's also a hybrid

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.770 
that as well it's also a hybrid
drivetrain<00:03:13.440> right<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.850> P<00:03:15.030> is<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.330> p1<00:03:15.630> a

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
drivetrain right and the P is the p1 a

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.509 
drivetrain right and the P is the p1 a
hybrid<00:03:16.140> drivetrain<00:03:16.500> as<00:03:16.590> well<00:03:16.739> exactly<00:03:17.340> and

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
hybrid drivetrain as well exactly and

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.479 
hybrid drivetrain as well exactly and
the<00:03:17.700> 918<00:03:18.060> so<00:03:18.360> they<00:03:18.480> all<00:03:18.630> have<00:03:19.070> electric<00:03:20.070> motors

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
the 918 so they all have electric motors

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.910 
the 918 so they all have electric motors
and<00:03:20.820> then<00:03:21.180> good<00:03:21.510> old-fashioned<00:03:22.290> internal

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
and then good old-fashioned internal

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.220 
and then good old-fashioned internal
combustion<00:03:23.400> engines<00:03:23.790> exactly<00:03:24.390> exactly<00:03:24.630> and

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
combustion engines exactly exactly and

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.380 
combustion engines exactly exactly and
you<00:03:25.410> know<00:03:25.530> this<00:03:25.680> is<00:03:25.709> that<00:03:26.220> makes<00:03:27.000> people<00:03:27.269> feel

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
you know this is that makes people feel

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.240 
you know this is that makes people feel
