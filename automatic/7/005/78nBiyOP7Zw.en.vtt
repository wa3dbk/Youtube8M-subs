 collaboration designers lose

 living columbia river 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.390
 automatic knives as they are made 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.130
 very high quality equipped with blades of 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.509
 popular stainless steel with topsi 47 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.610
 ordered such blades for fifty 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.150
 seven fifty nine days tailoring by 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.400
 cryogenic fatal scale 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.979
 the handle is made of thermoplastic 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.530
 frank as we need we also need 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.350
 glass textolite g10 and brand 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.290
 PCB than mascus is used on 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.329
 live castle loaf block with manual 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.140
 fuse if I show how he 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.240
 functioning well and tangentially means 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.399
 blade this case here used 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.610
 tactical such coating at the blade 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:54.390
 which hides its highlights in general and 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.290
 the whole form of the blade drop point though 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.590
 not listed here 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.920
 steel but precisely with topsi 470 are used 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.170
 There is also a number that's it as a whole 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.110
 Of course the country to make 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.140
 making this about notches 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.670
 here on the butt they are made very 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.170
 competently nothing here they are not trying 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.459
 disassemble and break but on the other 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.819
 hand provides certain 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.640
 value as well as principle and on the very 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:27.810
 the plastic part of the handle means 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:32.550
 regarding the castle the castle loaf could you 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:35.099
 demonstrate it is blocking the blade in 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:44.129
 unfolded state and also blocks 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:46.970
 Blade difficult position here so here 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:50.430
 way that is this way 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.819
 clutch is great way to lock 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.620
 for such a button opening knife and 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.409
 there is also a mechanical interlock 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.000
 which blocks 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:02.430
 this button and this lock as in 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.099
 unfolded state can also 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.430
 block and complex condition 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.810
 It is very comfortable look and safe then 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.390
 have you can use such 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.489
 mechanical fuse but quite 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.610
 really serve with one hand 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.330
 although the spring is confident enough 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.580
 opens the knife seriously enough 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.250
 shoot so let's say blade means by 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.299
 the thickness of the blade did not measure 38 millimeters 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.110
 on note from 0 4 somewhere in the area 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:35.580
 handle donok 5 to the tip 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.950
 directly wants the clip itself 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.840
 extremely comfortable drop shaped 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.420
 form does not break anything here 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.750
 pocket and sits quite qualitatively 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.810
 clip is rearranged for wearing 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.060
 tips both up and down but for 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.340
 left-handed option no hole provided 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.920
 under the lanyard here there is to exclude 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.900
 formally really no paracord in 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.790
 he can not prolazit of course 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.120
 you can come up with something in general 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.530
 rather specific option 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.860
 regarding the broken glass declared here 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.830
 but he seems to be as it is made of 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.379
 plastic I did not check but not sure 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.940
 that he is effective in his work 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.280
 although of course in the absence of 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.290
 any broken glass so on the frame 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.930
 you can also use it and you think that 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.850
 is a sufficient safety margin for 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.660
 there is absolutely no build quality 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:30.780
 there are no more complaints about our socks 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.729
 how different mirror for. cutting 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.770
 edges that is better and 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.639
 compared to other brands 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.860
 which is also very pleased very nice 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:44.340
 so it is also worth noting 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.960
 regarding the weight of the knife painting knife 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.030
 somewhere is fifty fifty then 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.120
 there is in the castle area here it turns out 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.639
 balance and so as toe-shaped notch and 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.430
 general ergonomics done this way 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.560
 what we keep a little closer to the top 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.450
 the handle than here is a wedge somewhere 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.130
 move a little bit here 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.100
 it turns out that the impression that the 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.440
 the blade would slightly outweigh the hilt 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.450
 it is not just an impression 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.200
 there is no steel handle 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.650
 liners 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:17.660
 with this, the handle is light enough 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:20.490
 by weight and the knife itself is quite 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:23.370
 light 119 grams 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:26.630
 its total weight the knife is not cold 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.970
 that is, here is just the length of the blade 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.710
 literally there almost 90 millimeters 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.810
 that is, it is made as if you are under our 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.810
 legislation and is not cold 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:39.090
 a weapon that is him and a certificate 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.820
 and it can be completely legal 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.190
 without any trouble to carry around 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:48.000
 for an automatic knife this too 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.160
 huge my view + design here with here 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.010
 so here 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.870
 skull bones skeleton 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.610
 skeletons this is exactly extreme 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.219
 series 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.069
 But, on the whole, of course, I have a very knife 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:03.020
 I liked drawing him quite good and first 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:06.139
 queue of course this one is automatic 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.719
 which you can play that you can 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:11.319
 effectively open the knife well and actually it 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:13.969
 of course makes a special impression 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:15.620
 ergonomics everything is quite good i would 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:18.169
 wanted maybe a little bit longer length 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.210
 stick but my know some 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:22.219
 small niggles in general pay 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.180
 focus fully utilized all 

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:26.449
 stick length 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:29.120
 which is also very competent in my opinion 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:33.199
 worthy of a certain certain 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.289
 Looks like the knife was purchased in Russia because 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:37.879
 borders are now harder to get 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:42.129
 At home, a reference is required if to someone 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:42.129
 interesting thanks for watching bye
