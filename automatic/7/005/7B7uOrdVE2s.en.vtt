00:00:00.016 --> 00:00:04.044
 DESIGN With good planning you will get the most out of your kitchen. 

00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:06.094
 Here are some simple things to think about. 

00:00:07.064 --> 00:00:10.068
 You must be able to move easily and quickly between the cooking zone, 

00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:15.078
 refrigerator and sink. This is the so-called working triangle. 

00:00:16.012 --> 00:00:20.012
 The shape of the kitchen is usually determined by the shape of the room, 

00:00:20.028 --> 00:00:25.072
 but that does not mean that your new kitchen must necessarily be the same shape. 

00:00:25.088 --> 00:00:26.176
 Here are a few options for placement: 

00:00:27.092 --> 00:00:31.160
 Ordering in a straight line is good for small kitchens, but for larger rooms - no. 

00:00:32.076 --> 00:00:36.120
 You can add an island that will not only provide you with more storage space, 

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:41.060
 but can also be used for serving, meeting and instead of a room divider. 

00:00:41.076 --> 00:00:44.104
 L-shaped kitchens have a convenient working triangle 

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:47.046
 and plenty of storage space. 

00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:50.080
 U-shaped kitchens give you plenty of storage space and work space, 

00:00:51.068 --> 00:00:53.068
 but they need a large room. 

00:00:53.084 --> 00:00:57.088
 With a two-row kitchen you will have two workstations on opposite walls. 

00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:03.028
 Such a kitchen does not need much space. Suitable for room with door or window at the end. 

00:01:03.044 --> 00:01:08.048
 Leave space on both sides of the cooktop to have the place to put hot pots. 

00:01:08.064 --> 00:01:12.076
 If you do not have much space, give priority to the space between the sink and the cooktop. 

00:01:12.092 --> 00:01:16.098
 For kitchens in two rows it is important to have enough space for two people. 

00:01:17.068 --> 00:01:22.160
 A distance of 120 cm allows you to open the doors on both sides at the same time. 

00:01:23.076 --> 00:01:26.148
 Make sure wall cabinets do not prevent you from seeing the desktop. 

00:01:27.064 --> 00:01:29.132
 Follow the manufacturer's recommendations 

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:32.104
 about the height of the hood. 

00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:37.078
 Oven at the eye level means less bending, and children will not get it. 

00:01:38.012 --> 00:01:41.096
 The oven top is a place where you can put hot trays. 

00:01:42.012 --> 00:01:47.076
 Keep cookware and accessories near the oven to keep them at your fingertips. 

00:01:47.092 --> 00:01:51.100
 Keep your glasses, dishes and utensils near the sink and the dishwasher - 

00:01:52.016 --> 00:01:54.104
 this will facilitate washing. 

00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:58.046
 Leave space for the aperture between the last cabinet and the wall, 

00:01:58.008 --> 00:02:00.052
 so that the door can be fully opened. 

00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:04.072
 This is especially important if you have wire baskets. 

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:09.052
 Avoid the following: An oven or dishwasher in the corner - 

00:02:09.068 --> 00:02:11.144
 it will interfere with the adjacent drawers and cabinets. 

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:16.012
 A sink next to the wall will interrupt the work process. 

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:21.132
 Oven to the wall - will expose the wall to heat and fat. 

00:02:22.048 --> 00:02:25.084
 The drawers in the corner interfere with the neighboring cabinets 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.004
 and can damage their handles or doors. 

00:02:28.056 --> 00:02:30.058
 Is it very complicated? Do not worry.
