00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
today I'd like to talk to you about how

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.129 
today I'd like to talk to you about how
sprinting<00:00:14.130> could<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:14.759> fact<00:00:14.790> be<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.269> secret<00:00:15.750> to

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
sprinting could in fact be the secret to

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.290 
sprinting could in fact be the secret to
getting<00:00:16.379> six<00:00:16.740> pack<00:00:16.949> abs<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.490> one<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.240> the

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
getting six pack abs and one of the

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.750 
getting six pack abs and one of the
reasons<00:00:18.630> for<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.560> high<00:00:20.189> intensity

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
reasons for this is that high intensity

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.390 
reasons for this is that high intensity
sprinting<00:00:21.240> helps<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.990> create<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.529> metabolic

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
sprinting helps to create a metabolic

change<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:24.090> our<00:00:24.359> bodies<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.900> if<00:00:25.230> you're

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
change in our bodies and if you're

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.320 
change in our bodies and if you're
trying<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.769> get<00:00:25.890> six-pack<00:00:26.430> abs<00:00:26.730> you're<00:00:27.210> almost

way to create a metabolic change in your

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.650 
way to create a metabolic change in your
body<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.640> sort<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.000> fancy<00:00:33.450> way<00:00:33.540> of

body and this is sort of a fancy way of

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.420 
body and this is sort of a fancy way of
me<00:00:33.780> saying<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:34.230> you're<00:00:34.620> gonna<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.219> find

me saying that you're gonna have to find
a<00:00:35.520> way<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.880> speed<00:00:36.480> up<00:00:36.630> your<00:00:36.660> metabolism<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.710> we

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
a way to speed up your metabolism and we

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.190 
a way to speed up your metabolism and we
know<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.670> one<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.210> best<00:00:39.480> ways<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.989> speed

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
know that one of the best ways to speed

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.830 
know that one of the best ways to speed
up<00:00:40.230> our<00:00:40.469> metabolism<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:42.120> do<00:00:42.540> high

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
up our metabolism is to do high

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.410 
up our metabolism is to do high
intensity<00:00:43.500> exercises<00:00:44.070> like<00:00:44.730> sprinting<00:00:45.239> and

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
intensity exercises like sprinting and

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.920 
intensity exercises like sprinting and
once<00:00:45.660> our<00:00:45.899> metabolism<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:47.340> sped<00:00:48.059> up<00:00:48.090> then<00:00:48.780> we

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
once our metabolism is sped up then we

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.330 
once our metabolism is sped up then we
can<00:00:49.079> start<00:00:49.289> burning<00:00:49.469> off<00:00:49.710> more<00:00:49.980> body<00:00:50.219> fat

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
can start burning off more body fat

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.250 
can start burning off more body fat
throughout<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.969> day<00:00:51.120> we<00:00:51.600> start<00:00:51.870> burning<00:00:52.140> off

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
throughout the day we start burning off

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.350 
throughout the day we start burning off
more<00:00:52.500> fat<00:00:52.739> even<00:00:53.039> while<00:00:53.219> we're<00:00:53.399> at<00:00:53.610> rest<00:00:54.059> and

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
more fat even while we're at rest and

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.840 
more fat even while we're at rest and
while<00:00:54.449> we're<00:00:54.660> sleeping<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.320> again<00:00:56.039> if<00:00:56.730> you

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
while we're sleeping so again if you

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
have to find a way to create a metabolic

change in your body one of the great
ways<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.480> do<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.080> through<00:01:04.260> high

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
ways to do this is through high

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.490 
ways to do this is through high
intensity<00:01:05.010> sprinting<00:01:05.750> now<00:01:06.750> spring<00:01:07.140> also

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
intensity sprinting now spring also

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.840 
intensity sprinting now spring also
increases<00:01:08.040> something<00:01:08.369> called<00:01:08.549> growth

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
increases something called growth

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.390 
increases something called growth
hormone<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.600> our<00:01:09.720> body<00:01:09.780> which<00:01:10.619> further<00:01:11.040> helps

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
hormone in our body which further helps

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.450 
hormone in our body which further helps
us<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.640> burn<00:01:11.820> fat<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.299> retain<00:01:13.170> muscle<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:14.130> lot

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
us to burn fat and retain muscle a lot

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.249 
us to burn fat and retain muscle a lot
of<00:01:14.610> people<00:01:14.820> don't<00:01:15.030> know<00:01:15.180> actually<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.780> human

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
of people don't know actually that human

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.030 
of people don't know actually that human
growth<00:01:16.439> hormone

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
growth hormone

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.370 
growth hormone
it's<00:01:17.369> sort<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.670> Peaks<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.360> most<00:01:18.720> people<00:01:19.110> around

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
it's sort of Peaks in most people around

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.679 
it's sort of Peaks in most people around
the<00:01:19.500> age<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.799> 21<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.400> if<00:01:20.909> you're<00:01:21.360> older<00:01:21.659> than

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
the age of 21 so if you're older than

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.260 
the age of 21 so if you're older than
the<00:01:22.080> age<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.259> 21<00:01:22.799> like<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.220> am<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.850> would<00:01:23.970> be<00:01:24.060> wise

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
the age of 21 like I am it would be wise

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.670 
the age of 21 like I am it would be wise
for<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.659> incorporate<00:01:25.200> some

for you to incorporate some

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.109 
for you to incorporate some
high-intensity<00:01:26.250> sprinting<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:26.939> your

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
hormone levels elevated also you know I

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.730 
hormone levels elevated also you know I
recommend<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.020> do<00:01:34.170> sprints<00:01:34.530> and

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
recommend that you do sprints and

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.890 
recommend that you do sprints and
intervals<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.460> sprinting<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.270> usually<00:01:36.720> done

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
intervals and sprinting is usually done

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.539 
intervals and sprinting is usually done
in<00:01:37.049> intervals<00:01:37.470> but<00:01:38.070> we<00:01:38.220> now<00:01:38.310> know<00:01:38.520> that

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
in intervals but we now know that

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.429 
in intervals but we now know that
interval<00:01:39.060> training<00:01:39.479> helps<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.020> burn<00:01:40.200> more

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
interval training helps to burn more
