though<00:00:32.730> he's<00:00:33.450> still<00:00:33.750> kind<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:33.989> new<00:00:34.110> he's<00:00:34.230> still

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.589 
unfortunate because well as soon as he
sees<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.579> he's<00:03:15.000> going<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.180> know<00:03:15.389> that

there's<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:15.989> large<00:03:16.229> distance<00:03:16.739> so<00:03:16.889> we'll<00:03:16.979> see

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
there's that large distance so we'll see

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.520 
there's that large distance so we'll see
if<00:03:17.190> he<00:03:17.489> decides<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:18.060> drop<00:03:18.269> hit<00:03:18.690> kind<00:03:19.139> of<00:03:19.199> switch

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
if he decides to drop hit kind of switch

if he decides to drop hit kind of switch
strategies<00:03:20.099> really<00:03:20.430> what<00:03:20.579> we'll<00:03:20.699> be<00:03:20.819> able<00:03:20.909> to

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
strategies really what we'll be able to

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.649 
strategies really what we'll be able to
see<00:03:21.590> if<00:03:22.590> if<00:03:22.889> i<00:03:23.340> was<00:03:23.459> expecting<00:03:23.760> something<00:03:23.909> one

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659

player<00:03:24.870> might<00:03:25.079> decide<00:03:25.319> to<00:03:25.379> go<00:03:25.530> raids<00:03:25.769> early

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
player might decide to go raids early

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.189 
player might decide to go raids early
but<00:03:26.819> really<00:03:27.150> i<00:03:27.180> would<00:03:27.359> just<00:03:27.479> expect<00:03:27.810> them<00:03:28.019> both

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:28.199 
but really i would just expect them both

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:30.140 
but really i would just expect them both
to<00:03:28.560> just<00:03:28.739> go<00:03:28.859> straight<00:03:29.189> into<00:03:29.459> drop<00:03:29.790> ships<00:03:30.030> as

to just go straight into drop ships as

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.360 
to just go straight into drop ships as
quickly<00:03:30.419> as<00:03:30.720> possible<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.379> it'll<00:03:31.919> be<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.040> race

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
quickly as possible and it'll be a race

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.830 
quickly as possible and it'll be a race
to<00:03:32.669> see<00:03:32.819> who<00:03:33.000> can<00:03:33.030> get<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.329> drop<00:03:33.359> ship<00:03:33.689> out

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
to see who can get the drop ship out

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.780 
to see who can get the drop ship out
looks<00:03:34.349> like<00:03:34.470> kannada<00:03:34.739> already<00:03:35.099> has<00:03:35.250> that<00:03:35.370> SUV

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
looks like kannada already has that SUV

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.849 
looks like kannada already has that SUV
in<00:03:35.879> position<00:03:36.299> to<00:03:37.169> put<00:03:37.349> up<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.530> secondary

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
in position to put up a secondary

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.500 
in position to put up a secondary
instead<00:03:38.189> of<00:03:38.310> opting<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.639> kind<00:03:38.939> of<00:03:38.970> go<00:03:39.120> out<00:03:39.299> to

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
instead of opting to kind of go out to

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.009 
instead of opting to kind of go out to
marines<00:03:39.810> out<00:03:39.930> for<00:03:40.169> Zelos<00:03:41.810> kannada<00:03:42.810> not

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
marines out for Zelos kannada not

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.039 
marines out for Zelos kannada not
producing<00:03:43.409> any<00:03:43.590> marines<00:03:43.829> deciding<00:03:44.280> just<00:03:44.549> to

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
producing any marines deciding just to

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.289 
producing any marines deciding just to
go<00:03:46.049> for<00:03:46.229> that<00:03:46.319> early<00:03:46.560> expansion<00:03:46.859> and<00:03:47.299> really

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
go for that early expansion and really

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.240 
go for that early expansion and really
that's<00:03:48.989> a<00:03:49.139> good<00:03:49.290> maneuver<00:03:49.590> on<00:03:49.620> conatus<00:03:50.009> part

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
that's a good maneuver on conatus part

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.339 
that's a good maneuver on conatus part
hehe<00:03:50.699> he<00:03:51.239> knows<00:03:51.419> that<00:03:51.689> he<00:03:51.750> has<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:51.900> distance

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
hehe he knows that he has that distance

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:53.539 
hehe he knows that he has that distance
there<00:03:52.500> I'm<00:03:52.680> pretty<00:03:52.859> sure<00:03:53.159> he's<00:03:53.340> going<00:03:53.459> to

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
there I'm pretty sure he's going to

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.520 
there I'm pretty sure he's going to
expect<00:03:53.939> that<00:03:54.810> zealous<00:03:55.109> is<00:03:55.259> going<00:03:55.409> to<00:03:55.470> be

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
expect that zealous is going to be

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.099 
expect that zealous is going to be
producing<00:03:55.949> dropships<00:03:56.400> fairly<00:03:56.729> quickly<00:03:57.109> looks

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
producing dropships fairly quickly looks

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.059 
producing dropships fairly quickly looks
like<00:03:58.259> he's<00:03:58.409> going<00:03:58.560> to<00:03:58.620> produce<00:03:58.739> a<00:03:58.949> single

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
like he's going to produce a single

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.270 
like he's going to produce a single
vulture<00:03:59.459> and<00:03:59.780> push<00:04:00.780> down<00:04:01.019> into<00:04:01.859> zealous<00:04:02.159> of

vulture and push down into zealous of

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.699 
vulture and push down into zealous of
space<00:04:02.459> one<00:04:02.879> to<00:04:03.120> deny<00:04:03.359> the<00:04:03.419> scout<00:04:03.780> to<00:04:04.349> to<00:04:04.530> keep

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
space one to deny the scout to to keep

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:05.780 
space one to deny the scout to to keep
zealous<00:04:05.040> count<00:04:05.189> on<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.370> defensive<00:04:05.729> and

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
zealous count on the defensive and

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.210 
zealous count on the defensive and
zealous<00:04:06.180> has<00:04:06.359> also<00:04:06.659> gone<00:04:07.019> an<00:04:07.319> expansion<00:04:08.129> in

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
zealous has also gone an expansion in

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.099 
zealous has also gone an expansion in
just<00:04:08.729> a<00:04:08.849> few<00:04:09.030> seconds<00:04:09.359> behind<00:04:09.509> because<00:04:09.989> of

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
just a few seconds behind because of

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.140 
just a few seconds behind because of
those<00:04:10.229> two<00:04:10.290> marines<00:04:10.859> though<00:04:11.099> so<00:04:11.699> that'll

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
those two marines though so that'll

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.789 
those two marines though so that'll
we'll<00:04:12.509> see<00:04:12.659> how<00:04:12.780> that<00:04:12.840> kind<00:04:13.229> of<00:04:13.259> plays<00:04:13.560> out<00:04:13.739> in

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
we'll see how that kind of plays out in

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.020 
we'll see how that kind of plays out in
the<00:04:13.859> long<00:04:14.009> term<00:04:14.159> whether<00:04:14.370> that<00:04:14.579> is<00:04:14.729> a<00:04:14.759> large

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
the long term whether that is a large

that<00:06:25.199> barracks<00:06:25.560> I<00:06:25.740> think<00:06:26.159> he's<00:06:26.250> trying<00:06:26.280> to

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
that barracks I think he's trying to

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.269 
that barracks I think he's trying to
force<00:06:26.729> kannada<00:06:27.120> to<00:06:27.690> basically<00:06:28.469> go<00:06:28.800> put<00:06:29.130> down

00:06:29.269 --> 00:06:29.279 
force kannada to basically go put down

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:31.730 
force kannada to basically go put down
to<00:06:29.460> early<00:06:29.669> factories<00:06:30.120> so<00:06:30.479> he<00:06:30.719> will<00:06:30.870> be<00:06:30.900> way

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
to early factories so he will be way

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.550 
to early factories so he will be way
ahead<00:06:31.770> and<00:06:32.190> he'll<00:06:32.279> be<00:06:32.370> able

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
ahead and he'll be able

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.560 
ahead and he'll be able
get<00:06:32.680> that<00:06:32.800> drop<00:06:33.010> and<00:06:33.190> hunt<00:06:33.340> that<00:06:33.460> dropship<00:06:33.940> and

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:34.570 
get that drop and hunt that dropship and

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.120 
get that drop and hunt that dropship and
really<00:06:34.750> kind<00:06:34.900> of<00:06:35.020> get<00:06:35.139> the<00:06:35.169> aggressive

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.130 
really kind of get the aggressive

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.260 
really kind of get the aggressive
advantage<00:06:36.520> he's<00:06:36.669> going<00:06:36.820> to<00:06:36.880> be<00:06:36.940> able<00:06:37.000> to<00:06:37.120> push

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.270 
advantage he's going to be able to push

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.610 
advantage he's going to be able to push
into<00:06:37.450> kannada<00:06:37.750> where<00:06:37.900> kannada<00:06:38.139> will<00:06:38.290> have<00:06:38.440> to

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:38.620 
into kannada where kannada will have to

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.920 
into kannada where kannada will have to
fall<00:06:39.100> back<00:06:39.130> and<00:06:39.460> keep<00:06:39.580> his<00:06:39.730> base<00:06:39.910> defended<00:06:40.360> but

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
fall back and keep his base defended but

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.150 
fall back and keep his base defended but
that<00:06:41.169> that<00:06:41.380> barracks<00:06:41.710> doesn't<00:06:41.950> look<00:06:42.040> like

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 
that that barracks doesn't look like

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.450 
that that barracks doesn't look like
it's<00:06:42.310> burning<00:06:43.139> and<00:06:44.139> it<00:06:44.710> has<00:06:44.980> managed<00:06:45.280> to<00:06:45.400> get

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
it's burning and it has managed to get

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.190 
it's burning and it has managed to get
over<00:06:45.639> that<00:06:45.730> map<00:06:46.240> artifact<00:06:46.720> so<00:06:46.810> I<00:06:46.870> don't<00:06:47.050> think

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.200 
over that map artifact so I don't think

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.990 
over that map artifact so I don't think
a<00:06:47.290> knot<00:06:47.410> is<00:06:47.560> going<00:06:47.710> to<00:06:47.770> put<00:06:47.980> down<00:06:48.160> he<00:06:48.610> has<00:06:48.790> put

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 
a knot is going to put down he has put

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.909 
a knot is going to put down he has put
down<00:06:49.180> one<00:06:49.570> factory<00:06:50.080> kind<00:06:50.290> of<00:06:50.380> a<00:06:50.440> little<00:06:50.560> bit<00:06:50.740> of

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:50.919 
down one factory kind of a little bit of

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:52.140 
down one factory kind of a little bit of
panic<00:06:51.070> he<00:06:51.250> is<00:06:51.370> putting<00:06:51.550> down<00:06:51.760> that<00:06:51.790> second

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.150 
panic he is putting down that second

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.700 
panic he is putting down that second
factory<00:06:52.510> that's<00:06:52.990> going<00:06:53.169> to<00:06:53.230> slow<00:06:53.410> him<00:06:53.500> down<00:06:53.530> a

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710 
factory that's going to slow him down a

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.250 
factory that's going to slow him down a
little<00:06:53.830> bit<00:06:54.100> against<00:06:54.669> this<00:06:54.760> drop<00:06:55.060> while<00:06:55.810> he's

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.260 
little bit against this drop while he's

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.210 
little bit against this drop while he's
increasing<00:06:56.860> while<00:06:57.610> okay<00:06:58.090> yeah
