00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
I high end it on there um and yeah and

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.309 
I high end it on there um and yeah and
they've<00:02:17.400> risen<00:02:17.879> up<00:02:18.120> at<00:02:18.659> this<00:02:18.930> point<00:02:19.200> that

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
they've risen up at this point that

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.770 
they've risen up at this point that
almost<00:02:19.650> all<00:02:19.860> worth<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.189> black<00:02:20.400> long<00:02:20.720> even<00:02:21.720> the

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
almost all worth a black long even the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.210 
almost all worth a black long even the
dark<00:02:22.019> pink<00:02:22.260> ones<00:02:22.500> are<00:02:22.680> going<00:02:22.799> up<00:02:23.040> really

quickly and yeah I guess that's why they
we're<00:02:33.750> not<00:02:33.870> really<00:02:34.140> fasten<00:02:34.859> um<00:02:35.069> and<00:02:36.319> they<00:02:37.319> will

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
we're not really fasten um and they will

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.270 
we're not really fasten um and they will
keep<00:02:37.799> going<00:02:38.159> up<00:02:38.540> they<00:02:39.540> will<00:02:39.780> keep<00:02:40.530> rising<00:02:40.829> up<00:02:41.159> a

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280

different they wouldn't be the same as
well<00:03:12.599> before<00:03:12.930> because<00:03:13.170> as<00:03:13.319> I<00:03:13.500> said<00:03:14.030> I'm<00:03:15.030> Adam

would<00:03:20.160> look<00:03:20.280> different<00:03:20.489> on<00:03:20.940> my<00:03:21.599> doubt<00:03:21.870> even

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199 
would look different on my doubt even

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:26.689 
would look different on my doubt even
like<00:03:23.069> a<00:03:24.260> new<00:03:25.260> model<00:03:25.949> of<00:03:26.069> them<00:03:26.250> will<00:03:26.400> come<00:03:26.489> out

like a new model of them will come out
because<00:03:26.940> as<00:03:27.389> I<00:03:27.540> said<00:03:27.599> they<00:03:28.049> I<00:03:28.290> didn't<00:03:28.919> not<00:03:29.250> sure

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
because as I said they I didn't not sure

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.920 
because as I said they I didn't not sure
what<00:03:29.459> I<00:03:29.549> said<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:29.970> but<00:03:30.239> they<00:03:31.019> um<00:03:31.319> they

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
what I said this but they um they

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.559 
what I said this but they um they
discontinued<00:03:33.930> them<00:03:34.079> because<00:03:35.000> they<00:03:36.000> offended

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
discontinued them because they offended

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.949

native<00:03:37.129> offended<00:03:38.129> Native<00:03:38.549> Americans<00:03:39.090> like<00:03:39.720> to

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
native offended Native Americans like to

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.710 
native offended Native Americans like to
try<00:03:40.290> bet<00:03:40.530> way<00:03:40.650> as<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.859> headdresses<00:03:41.190> um<00:03:41.720> so

try bet way as the headdresses um so

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.129 
try bet way as the headdresses um so
yeah<00:03:43.199> that's<00:03:43.379> why<00:03:43.560> didn't<00:03:43.829> continue<00:03:44.129> them<00:03:44.430> um

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
so there's no possibility of the same

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.449 
so there's no possibility of the same
exact<00:03:49.500> hair<00:03:49.680> dressers<00:03:49.949> coming<00:03:50.069> out<00:03:50.310> well

exact hair dressers coming out well

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.449 
exact hair dressers coming out well
there<00:03:50.579> is<00:03:50.699> a<00:03:50.729> possibility<00:03:51.150> that<00:03:51.389> a<00:03:51.919> new<00:03:52.919> type

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
there is a possibility that a new type

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:54.680 
there is a possibility that a new type
of<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:53.699> hedges<00:03:53.970> will<00:03:54.090> come<00:03:54.239> up<00:03:54.359> they<00:03:54.449> look

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
of the hedges will come up they look

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.149 
of the hedges will come up they look
different<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:55.229> have<00:03:55.470> different<00:03:55.500> colors<00:03:56.129> but
