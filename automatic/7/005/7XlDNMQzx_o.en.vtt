 I simply wanted to thank and have 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.340
 I think about it a lot 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.390
 play games with it for everyone 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.039
 Of course you can do it at all 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.699
 It was time to win 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.199
 with me still only one way 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.329
 but you can participate in a lottery 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.680

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.629

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.920

 now just what you have to do and 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.010
 Although the first one is still a thumb 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.500
 surround 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.700

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.990
 win or I join in the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.009
 We write comments two times now 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:27.270
 purely in the box was then just as 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:34.710
 should I say yes below is a link 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:36.689
 lead was short facebook gone and our 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.189
 firmly just say slowly to the box 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.049
 come in volt and I still link 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.840
 Just everything and what you have to do 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.710
 so that you can read that too and who 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.409
 the things do not comply so I will 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.820
 but to win again from mine 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.030
 pull 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.829
 and the winner will then stop first 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.630
 checked and yes if if it stops well 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.850
 should happen that he all of the 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.310
 three or four things anyway 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.840
 I did not do the video then 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.729
 guaranteed to upload but just one 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.509
 make a new one 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.450
 that's why it makes everyone happy 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.239
 as you can see here with my manager 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.760
 this is 60 comments 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.829
 but are only 50 like that sooo different 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.180
 I have 70 comments and 60 easy 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.310
 So I do not remember 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.840
 that means in any case I do not know 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.890
 It may be that one 2 comments 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.629
 wrote there we have 2 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.890
 I will then write comments 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.440
 this will qualify the enrollment 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.629
 why why or you write me 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.099
 not again by pn why you 2 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.060
 wrote comments I know it 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.709
 with some it is like that 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.450
 I do not know any two of them 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.090
 in case it should happen please 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.359
 for explanation because otherwise it is unfair 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.260
 therefore unlike others and 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:53.049
 maybe also the sweepstakes 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.230
 do resolutions differently with that way 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:58.389
 For example, believe in a random walk 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.889
 I give it yes and yes I'll see 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:01.540
 I show now first the first map 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.760
 as all cards are off and they want 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.639
 all pulled by myself except for one 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.940
 and that is a very good card 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:11.769
 I exchanged those with 2 lp 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.879
 and of course that will be 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.440
 yes I just wanted to stop 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:20.019
 make cool contests for you 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.129
 That's why the caves get their fruit 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.069
 you could already see a little bit 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:26.590
 Of course, we also had to do that 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.889
 Here we are a former ex in English 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:33.160
 unfortunately, but nevertheless I have exactly 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.879
 I bought that from ebay 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.709
 so to speak 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:39.340
 here you can see one more time everything 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:43.419
 One should know as a collector with the 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.139
 number 46 of 146 and me with that 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.030
 asterisk 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.859
 and yes it is the first card 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.760
 So could all win together 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.900
 win 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.760
 Of course I will too 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.260
 Shipping costs Our take over the 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.180
 only thing to do and stop that 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.769
 condition and me, of course, if you 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.109
 win a tm with your address 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:03.299
 so to speak, I have written exactly there 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:05.500
 already two the card and is a viridax 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.419
 Exactly I just wanted it then 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.310
 not exchange with certain people because 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:10.720
 I did not even think that me 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.810
 maybe a few at some point 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.639
 will make games and time 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.169
 does not really collect pokemon anymore 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.310
 That's why I just thought about it 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.450
 a few games of chance 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.720
 but of course I still collect pokémon 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.910
 but all my precious ones 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.010
 so had the old ones and so on 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.050
 I have in my folder and that will be 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.370
 also not get away exactly and 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.520
 Of course, the card could still be here 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.500
 Win number 9 of 101 I do not know 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.400
 From such active there is that would have to 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.500
 plasma blaster and that's from xy 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.650
 I know that in any case first 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.660
 blaster and xy a little they are so 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.740
 I pulled that myself that's great 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.540
 means so top mint and then came too 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.630
 already to last did it actually are 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:59.600
 the best card is one in the pool 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.210
 e on seem exactly the home of this 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.600
 Because that's just me 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:08.060
 not as much as it used to 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:13.280
 then, so to speak, and yes I believe it 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:15.650
 I know from the sap plasma frost 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.280
 Do not you think it's nice too 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.620
 English number 111 of 160 I can 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.360
 had just one pick out from the 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.450
 Then you can still see machines 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.180
 this water drop effect and this 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.510
 Gold effect with the skills on 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.860
 every case a very nice card 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.200
 exactly 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:39.110
 and yes, I know what I'm doing to you 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:42.229
 I should definitely betrayed 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.600
 that not all cards double soon 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:47.330
 because I bought something 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.130
 again a folder where many cards 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.690
 are in there and I 've seen too 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.780
 These three cards stop also there with bye 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:57.140
 and that's why I thought about it 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.820
 I give away which one if I double 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.140
 Of course I have to do that by the way 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.550
 I also had to say otherwise 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.870
 I probably would not do that 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.460
 so I really could give away 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.060
 Of course they also have double and 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.540
 exchange 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.430
 but I wanted to keep thank you 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.440
 Contest for the 1000 subscribers 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.919
 Those are the three cards you can do 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.919
 can win 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.100
 they are not that many now 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:23.690
 cards but I guess it's up 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:25.180
