00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
with a prepaid package that you send the

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.270 
with a prepaid package that you send the
molds<00:02:41.730> back<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.300> so<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.200> take<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.800> blue<00:02:44.040> pace

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
molds back to so you take the blue pace

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.190 
molds back to so you take the blue pace
and<00:02:44.489> you<00:02:44.670> take<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.060> white<00:02:45.390> paste<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.020> you're

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
and you take the white paste and you're

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.350 
and you take the white paste and you're
going<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.380> want<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.620> mix<00:02:46.830> these<00:02:47.040> together<00:02:47.360> now

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
going to want to mix these together now

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.530 
going to want to mix these together now
you<00:02:48.750> do<00:02:48.900> this<00:02:49.019> by<00:02:49.260> just<00:02:49.290> folding<00:02:50.070> it<00:02:50.220> in<00:02:50.340> half

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
you do this by just folding it in half

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.210 
you do this by just folding it in half
so<00:02:51.540> this<00:02:51.930> shouldn't<00:02:52.140> take<00:02:52.260> more<00:02:52.590> than<00:02:52.650> 60

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
so this shouldn't take more than 60

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.370 
so this shouldn't take more than 60
seconds<00:02:53.670> but<00:02:53.850> you<00:02:54.000> just<00:02:54.239> literally<00:02:54.570> fold<00:02:55.080> it

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
seconds but you just literally fold it

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.840 
seconds but you just literally fold it
and<00:02:55.470> keep<00:02:55.739> folding<00:02:55.980> until<00:02:56.519> it<00:02:56.610> turns

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
and keep folding until it turns

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.630 
and keep folding until it turns
completely<00:02:57.060> blue<00:03:01.070> so<00:03:02.070> once<00:03:02.310> this<00:03:02.430> is

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
completely blue so once this is

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.420 
completely blue so once this is
completely<00:03:03.090> blew<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:03.959> just<00:03:03.989> mold<00:03:04.650> this<00:03:04.920> into

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
completely blew you just mold this into

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.000 
completely blew you just mold this into
the<00:03:05.610> trays<00:03:05.910> for<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.330> top<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.780> bottom<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.620> you

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
the trays for the top and bottom and you

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.850 
the trays for the top and bottom and you
just<00:03:08.160> kind<00:03:08.370> of<00:03:08.430> squish<00:03:08.670> it<00:03:08.790> together<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.450> then

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
just kind of squish it together and then

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.350 
just kind of squish it together and then
put<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:10.950> in<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.190> trays<00:03:11.459> it's<00:03:11.820> okay<00:03:12.090> if<00:03:12.120> it

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
put it in the trays it's okay if it

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.630 
put it in the trays it's okay if it
overflows<00:03:13.019> but<00:03:13.920> after<00:03:14.070> you<00:03:14.340> take<00:03:14.610> your
