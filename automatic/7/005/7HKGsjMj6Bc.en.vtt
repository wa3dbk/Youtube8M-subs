00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.460
 here we have a sum of fractions with mixed numbers 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:11.949
 hurtful unequal nominators 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:15.859
 our king problem does not come being the numbers 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.890
 whole 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.189
 if not the fractions 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.960
 with different denominator 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.960
 so I could proceed here to add 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:30.229
 4 I say 3 +1 are four 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.970
 but here I will have to look 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.350
 a denominator for one third and six eighths 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.800
 that the number 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.130
 it can be divisible by 8 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.550
 and between 3 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.550
 It is 24 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.740
 since we find is the number that is divisible whole denominators 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.840
 we proceed 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.190
 to find our numerator above 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.890
 how we do it we already know what 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.140
 we divide 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.610
 24th 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.560
 between the collisions the other denominator 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.300
 that will give us three 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.020
 s3 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.560
 we will multiply it by the numerator 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.030
 three by six 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.460
 They are 18 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.640
 24 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.190
 between three that voice 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.660
 by one 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.250
 they are eight 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.280
 we have already 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.770
 our 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.290
 common denominator 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.950
 for these two fractions 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.650
 we already know what the denominator peace automatically 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.820
 i only add 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.000
 8 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.280
 and 18 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.280
 They are 26 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.800
 we check our result 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.770
 it is an improper fraction 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.770
 therefore we can get him out 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.450
 there were several integers 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.450
 how many times does 24 fit in 26 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.000
 It fits one 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 how much is missing 24 to 26 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:12.019
 he is missing two 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.400
 and the 24 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.230
 follow 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.429
 acting as 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:17.959
 the so-called 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.129
 but I had four here 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.129
 then it means that these four 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.209
 +1 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.389
 is going to be 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:29.829
 5 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.939
 with two 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.869
 24 years 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:38.119
 we have to check again 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:41.519
 this own fraction can be simplified 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.519
 because we can take halves 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:48.249
 We run the 5 that does not happen to him 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.989
 we take half to 2 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.579
 it's one we take out half 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.179
 a24 are two 

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:58.859
 and there it was in its minimal expression 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.089
 what is it that we have here the result 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:03.329
 of our 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.499
 sum of fractions with mixed and different numbers called
