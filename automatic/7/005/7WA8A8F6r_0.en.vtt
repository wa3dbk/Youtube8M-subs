same cut heart like that under the
arcanine<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.590> from<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.890> promo<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.630> believe

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
arcanine is from the promo I believe

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.690 
arcanine is from the promo I believe
that's<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.990> dark<00:01:34.350> Charmeleon<00:01:35.070> there's<00:01:35.579> a

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
that's the dark Charmeleon there's a

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.810 
that's the dark Charmeleon there's a
different<00:01:36.150> type<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.329> rapidash<00:01:36.900> right<00:01:37.140> there

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
different type of rapidash right there

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.210 
different type of rapidash right there
and<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.060> these<00:01:39.390> were<00:01:39.600> all<00:01:40.020> used<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.799> think<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:41.189> a

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
and so these were all used I think on a

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.530 
and so these were all used I think on a
card<00:01:41.490> somewhere<00:01:43.700> but<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:45.000> can<00:01:45.149> see<00:01:45.329> them<00:01:45.450> all

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
card somewhere but you can see them all

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.469 
card somewhere but you can see them all
there<00:01:45.780> when<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.229> can<00:01:46.380> see<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.649> different

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
there when you can see the different

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.050 
there when you can see the different
color<00:01:48.479> schemes<00:01:48.659> for<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.110> new<00:01:49.530> torino<00:01:50.060> nenita

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
color schemes for the new torino nenita

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.740 
color schemes for the new torino nenita
marina<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.320> then<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.560> got<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.860> different

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
marina and then you got the different

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.300 
marina and then you got the different
position<00:01:54.750> for<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.320> men<00:01:55.470> arena<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.979> think<00:01:56.250> that

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
position for the men arena I think that

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.940 
position for the men arena I think that
one<00:01:56.640> was<00:01:56.790> may<00:01:57.210> be<00:01:57.270> used<00:01:57.540> in<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.810> game<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.350> then

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
one was may be used in the game and then

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.980 
one was may be used in the game and then
now<00:01:59.130> he<00:01:59.189> was<00:01:59.490> used<00:01:59.729> on<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.149> card<00:02:00.509> itself

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
now he was used on the card itself

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.800 
now he was used on the card itself
believe<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.200> was<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:06.360> promo<00:02:06.930> mouth<00:02:07.550> now

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
believe that was the promo mouth now

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.290 
believe that was the promo mouth now
was<00:02:08.989> the<00:02:09.259> jungle<00:02:09.649> me<00:02:09.770> off<00:02:09.910> that<00:02:10.910> completely

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
was the jungle me off that completely

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.059 
was the jungle me off that completely
sure<00:02:11.569> all<00:02:11.810> that<00:02:11.989> haven't<00:02:12.380> looked<00:02:12.590> into<00:02:12.739> it<00:02:12.920> too

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
sure all that haven't looked into it too

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.370 
sure all that haven't looked into it too
much<00:02:13.099> but<00:02:13.640> it's<00:02:14.360> still<00:02:14.540> pretty<00:02:14.599> cool<00:02:14.930> see<00:02:15.200> and

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
much but it's still pretty cool see and

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.460 
much but it's still pretty cool see and
I<00:02:15.440> think<00:02:15.620> it'll<00:02:15.739> look<00:02:15.890> good<00:02:16.330> friend<00:02:20.470> alright

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
I think it'll look good friend alright

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.839 
I think it'll look good friend alright
the<00:02:21.650> next<00:02:21.860> one<00:02:22.780> this<00:02:23.780> is<00:02:23.959> an<00:02:24.080> ancient<00:02:24.260> new<00:02:24.860> play

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
the next one this is an ancient new play

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.640 
the next one this is an ancient new play
mat<00:02:26.060> these<00:02:26.480> did<00:02:26.690> come<00:02:26.870> out<00:02:26.989> I<00:02:27.230> don't<00:02:27.560> think

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
mat these did come out I don't think

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.710 
mat these did come out I don't think
they<00:02:27.890> looked<00:02:28.099> exactly<00:02:28.220> like<00:02:28.760> this<00:02:30.310> but

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
they looked exactly like this but

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.180 
they looked exactly like this but
they're<00:02:32.720> pretty<00:02:33.110> close<00:02:33.230> but<00:02:33.950> it<00:02:34.099> was

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
they're pretty close but it was

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.400 
they're pretty close but it was
definitely<00:02:34.480> other<00:02:35.480> stuff<00:02:35.750> added<00:02:35.959> to<00:02:36.170> it<00:02:36.260> like

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
definitely other stuff added to it like

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.890 
definitely other stuff added to it like
leave<00:02:37.160> you<00:02:37.310> had<00:02:37.430> your<00:02:37.580> five<00:02:37.760> zones<00:02:38.360> sounding

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
leave you had your five zones sounding

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.660 
leave you had your five zones sounding
here<00:02:39.019> in<00:02:39.110> your<00:02:39.230> deck<00:02:39.410> zone<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:40.010> don't<00:02:40.459> think

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
here in your deck zone I don't think

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.100 
here in your deck zone I don't think
they<00:02:40.760> had<00:02:40.940> an<00:02:41.030> ancient<00:02:41.390> me<00:02:41.480> off<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.720> side<00:02:41.930> but

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110
