we're actually a man about we're here
about<00:01:19.080> one<00:01:19.350> mile<00:01:19.530> thousand<00:01:19.920> views<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> day

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
about one mile thousand views a day

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.820 
about one mile thousand views a day
which<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.729> it's<00:01:21.150> insane<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.619> road

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
which is it's insane and that this road

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.100 
which is it's insane and that this road
probably<00:01:23.040> be<00:01:23.250> seen<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> 100k<00:01:24.210> views<00:01:24.479> very<00:01:24.810> very

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
probably be seen a 100k views very very

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.660 
probably be seen a 100k views very very
soon<00:01:25.380> that'll<00:01:25.890> probably<00:01:26.040> do<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> special<00:01:26.400> video

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
soon that'll probably do a special video

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.330 
soon that'll probably do a special video
you<00:01:26.880> know<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.030> little<00:01:27.299> celebratory<00:01:27.659> video<00:01:28.340> i've

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
you know a little celebratory video i've

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.039 
you know a little celebratory video i've
got<00:01:29.549> put<00:01:30.000> some<00:01:30.030> ideas<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.540> drawing<00:01:30.750> board

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
got put some ideas on a drawing board

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:31.999 
got put some ideas on a drawing board
and<00:01:31.110> let<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.320> know<00:01:31.380> about<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.799> will

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
and let you know about that will

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.350 
and let you know about that will
actually<00:01:32.130> see<00:01:32.340> how<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.549> goes<00:01:32.579> then<00:01:32.970> should

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
actually see how that goes then should

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.789 
actually see how that goes then should
probably<00:01:33.659> be<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.780> lot<00:01:33.900> probably<00:01:34.530> very

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
probably be a lot probably very

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.319 
probably be a lot probably very
interesting<00:01:35.220> actually<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:36.000> we'll<00:01:36.180> see<00:01:36.299> how

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
interesting actually so we'll see how

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.390 
interesting actually so we'll see how
that<00:01:36.390> goes<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.930> also<00:01:37.439> we're<00:01:37.740> also<00:01:37.829> creeping

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
that goes and also we're also creeping

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.120 
that goes and also we're also creeping
up<00:01:38.490> on<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.700> 100<00:01:39.090> video<00:01:39.479> views<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:40.170> 73<00:01:40.619> at<00:01:41.040> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
up on that 100 video views on 73 at the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.440 
up on that 100 video views on 73 at the
moment<00:01:41.430> while<00:01:41.579> sense<00:01:41.820> for<00:01:42.030> when<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.270> one

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
moment while sense for when this one

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.050 
moment while sense for when this one
gets<00:01:42.600> uploaded<00:01:42.860> but<00:01:43.860> from<00:01:44.040> 100<00:01:44.369> video<00:01:44.579> special

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
gets uploaded but from 100 video special

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.030 
gets uploaded but from 100 video special
i<00:01:45.180> was<00:01:45.450> gonna<00:01:45.630> keep<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:45.869> secret<00:01:46.079> source<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.530> 99

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
i was gonna keep it secret source a 99

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.410 
i was gonna keep it secret source a 99
but<00:01:47.310> we're<00:01:47.460> actually<00:01:47.520> doing<00:01:47.850> down<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.240> lives

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
but we're actually doing down the lives

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.080 
but we're actually doing down the lives
of<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.380> be<00:01:49.590> like<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> flogging<00:01:50.130> sort<00:01:50.310> video<00:01:50.460> it

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
of so be like a flogging sort video it

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
of so be like a flogging sort video it
would<00:01:51.180> be<00:01:51.240> something<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.570> little<00:01:51.659> it's<00:01:52.020> gonna

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
would be something a little it's gonna

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.090 
would be something a little it's gonna
be<00:01:52.200> something<00:01:52.380> different<00:01:52.770> for<00:01:52.829> me<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.009> edit

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
be something different for me to edit

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.560 
be something different for me to edit
and<00:01:53.430> something<00:01:53.759> different<00:01:54.210> for<00:01:54.270> me<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.450> put

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
and something different for me to put

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.609 
and something different for me to put
together<00:01:54.780> i<00:01:54.869> hope<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.140> enjoy<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.409> as<00:01:55.590> well

together i hope you enjoy it as well
because<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.310> know<00:01:56.340> it's<00:01:56.909> got<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.060> lot<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.210> time

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
because you know it's got a lot of time

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.399 
because you know it's got a lot of time
and<00:01:57.479> efforts<00:01:57.719> going<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.899> go<00:01:57.960> into<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.140> video

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
and efforts going to go into that video

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.929 
and efforts going to go into that video
and<00:01:58.649> obviously<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.219> make<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.520> best<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.790> can

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
and obviously to make it the best it can

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.410 
and obviously to make it the best it can
possibly<00:02:00.000> be<00:02:00.770> over<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:01.920> next<00:02:02.130> week<00:02:02.490> probably

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
possibly be over this next week probably

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.120 
possibly be over this next week probably
next<00:02:03.540> seven<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.229> ten<00:02:04.469> days<00:02:04.500> maybe<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.009> bit

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
next seven to ten days maybe a bit

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.950 
next seven to ten days maybe a bit
longer<00:02:05.250> than<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.640> think<00:02:05.939> it's<00:02:06.030> about<00:02:06.149> 10<00:02:06.479> it's

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
longer than I think it's about 10 it's

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.290 
longer than I think it's about 10 it's
about<00:02:07.049> 10<00:02:07.290> days<00:02:07.439> or<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.680> next<00:02:07.890> 10<00:02:08.069> days<00:02:08.300> videos

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
about 10 days or the next 10 days videos

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.660 
about 10 days or the next 10 days videos
probably<00:02:09.450> obviously<00:02:10.349> be<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> lot<00:02:10.679> sure<00:02:10.920> pure

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
probably obviously be a lot sure pure

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.520 
probably obviously be a lot sure pure
because<00:02:11.819> it's<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.480> know<00:02:12.510> p<00:02:12.900> it's<00:02:13.230> my<00:02:13.410> last

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
because it's you know p it's my last

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.730 
because it's you know p it's my last
four

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
four

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.590 
four
exams<00:02:14.070> Alice<00:02:14.820> my<00:02:14.940> dad's<00:02:15.090> birthday's<00:02:15.450> on<00:02:15.570> the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.450 
exams Alice my dad's birthday's on the
12<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:16.140> know<00:02:16.320> head<00:02:16.770> supported<00:02:17.070> 10<00:02:17.280> days

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460

next eight days over three exams and

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.040 
next eight days over three exams and
generally<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.150> focus<00:02:24.360> my<00:02:24.480> energies<00:02:24.660> on<00:02:24.750> school

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
generally to focus my energies on school

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.810 
generally to focus my energies on school

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
work so I actually got a backup if say

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.610 
work so I actually got a backup if say
youtube<00:02:27.570> doesn't<00:02:27.690> work<00:02:27.960> out<00:02:28.140> for<00:02:28.170> me<00:02:28.350> which<00:02:28.560> I

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
youtube doesn't work out for me which I

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.810 
youtube doesn't work out for me which I
hope<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:28.920> does<00:02:29.070> I'll<00:02:29.310> still<00:02:29.550> want<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.730> go<00:02:29.790> to
