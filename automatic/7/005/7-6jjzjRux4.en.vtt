00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.920
 what's up kids, well, as you see 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:09.200
 the aquarium is spectacular is in its 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.680
 best time the crystals already barely 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.100
 he needed to clean them 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.900
 and as you can see he 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.790
 The sand does not present 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.830
 absolutely no type of algae is 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.230
 completely white white white white 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.080
 white 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.210
 both corals and fish have 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.699
 all a very good color you can see here 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.060
 to the yellow surgeon who is already 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.540
 recovered 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.070
 l for you who do not bother me so much anymore 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.649
 good and we see them perfect even the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.060
 motto that had white point has already been 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.200
 removed or the fungus s 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.510
 and nothing is Saturday except a little bit of the 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.010
 Marine 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.680
 but I already tell you presents some colors 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.149
 I'm going to leave a little behind 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.470
 so you can see how the 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.030
 back wall 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.290
 if you realize it is going to be very 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.240
 well before long he does not know anything anymore 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.530
 it was in my nothing and it will be like 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.760
 brown color will remain a rock 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.760
 literally a rock 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.390
 so they set the prawns are 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.390
 perfect discs or more too 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.340
 new discs are coming out or more 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.880
 the corals are all very well in 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.399
 less a group now 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.500
 that one already saw that it was a bit touched 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.090
 which was the one that is kg 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.990
 what is that visa that is colored 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.840
 white 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.659
 and that one does not recover 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.740
 everyone else is already well 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.740
 they are perfect 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.340
 but we have coactur the soma disk 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.899
 this is precious in default or this the green 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.770
 someone sends out a couple of discs or more 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.799
 plus 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.280
 we are all very happy 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.850
 equal prawns 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.090
 I do not know how you see the good taste 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.090
 get close to him 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.520
 once in a panoramic from a little 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.329
 well sideways 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.329
 for you to see 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.579
 and he has killed the puppies he walks with 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:21.340
 I know I am 6 pitbull pequeÃ±itos 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:23.730
 I had them there 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.440
 strong where I had them before good 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.140
 say that the mother could not stand 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.340
 a lot and I had to bring the ones I do not know 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.500
 would remove from here 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.570
 and no longer the 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.730
 that is to say that this is not the puppies 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.900
 I really like dogs as well 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.900
 to have would be a puppy 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.480

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.480
 it's all pretty nice pretty 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.340
 and leave a little bit behind so that 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.340
 you see it whole 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.939
 and you can see it 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.519

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.790
