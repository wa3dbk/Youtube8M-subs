00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
sought for a care Adrian thinking it a

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.139 
sought for a care Adrian thinking it a
bit<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.590> converting<00:00:38.340> with<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.640> one<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.879> think

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
bit of converting with that one I think

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.319 
bit of converting with that one I think
I<00:00:39.239> got<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.420> flight<00:00:39.690> 815<00:00:40.680> total<00:00:41.430> Schneiderlin

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
grow another method for you guys today

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.930 
grow another method for you guys today
and<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.210> silver<00:00:54.930> BPL<00:00:55.649> one<00:00:55.920> now<00:00:56.520> there's

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
and it is a silver BPL one now there's

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.790 
and it is a silver BPL one now there's
two<00:00:57.090> ways<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.300> can<00:00:57.420> do<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.750> again<00:00:57.930> but<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
two ways you can do it again but the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.529 
two ways you can do it again but the
first<00:00:59.250> way<00:00:59.520> out<00:00:59.640> says<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> little<00:01:00.210> bit<00:01:00.329> better

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
first way out says a little bit better

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.860 
first way out says a little bit better
so<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.170> normally<00:01:01.620> do<00:01:01.910> first<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.120> all<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.270> do<00:01:03.570> this

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
so I normally do first of all is do this

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.200 
so I normally do first of all is do this
one<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.830> can<00:01:04.860> mix<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.549> up<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.790> bit<00:01:05.820> I

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
one and you can mix it up a bit I

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.270 
one and you can mix it up a bit I
normally<00:01:06.869> do<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.170> I've<00:01:07.650> only<00:01:07.830> just<00:01:07.950> like

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
normally do this I've only just like

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.670 
normally do this I've only just like
come<00:01:08.640> off<00:01:08.760> from<00:01:08.970> doing<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.420> but<00:01:09.600> you've<00:01:10.320> got<00:01:10.530> it

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
come off from doing it but you've got it

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.530 
come off from doing it but you've got it
doesn't<00:01:11.070> take<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.310> long<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.909> get<00:01:12.119> there<00:01:12.330> to

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
doesn't take that long to get there to

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.260 
doesn't take that long to get there to
be<00:01:12.659> honest<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.770> just<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> quick<00:01:14.850> few

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
be honest and you just do a quick few

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.770 
be honest and you just do a quick few
clicks<00:01:15.720> up<00:01:16.110> there<00:01:16.380> m<00:01:17.000> well<00:01:18.000> actually<00:01:18.210> could

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
clicks up there m well actually could

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.710 
clicks up there m well actually could
take<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> little<00:01:19.110> longer<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.360> some<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.390> pause

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
take a little longer and some a pause

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.200 
take a little longer and some a pause
the<00:01:21.930> video<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.530> I'll<00:01:22.619> be<00:01:22.710> right<00:01:22.860> back<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.970> yeah

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
the video and I'll be right back so yeah

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.499 
the video and I'll be right back so yeah
this<00:01:24.360> literally<00:01:24.990> took<00:01:25.670> me<00:01:26.670> not<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.000> long<00:01:27.240> M

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
this literally took me not that long M

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.319 
this literally took me not that long M
it<00:01:28.020> took<00:01:28.320> me<00:01:28.470> about<00:01:28.770> two<00:01:29.310> minutes<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.790> get<00:01:29.909> ESO

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
it took me about two minutes to get ESO

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.499 
it took me about two minutes to get ESO
is<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> quite<00:01:31.229> simple<00:01:31.890> method<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:33.270> when<00:01:33.479> we

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
is a quite simple method and so when we

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.450 
is a quite simple method and so when we
go<00:01:33.720> yet<00:01:33.990> get<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.470> run<00:01:34.590> about<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.829> 50th<00:01:35.280> minute

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
go yet get to run about the 50th minute

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.240 
go yet get to run about the 50th minute
then<00:01:36.270> start<00:01:36.780> just<00:01:36.990> looking<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.530> fit<00:01:37.740> one<00:01:38.100> that

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
then start just looking the fit one that

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.770 
then start just looking the fit one that
I'll<00:01:38.369> look<00:01:38.520> if<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.880> will<00:01:39.030> know<00:01:39.150> someone's<00:01:39.600> go

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
I'll look if you will know someone's go

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.690 
I'll look if you will know someone's go
decent<00:01:40.229> pace<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.619> didn't<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.070> watch<00:01:41.250> list<00:01:41.490> then
