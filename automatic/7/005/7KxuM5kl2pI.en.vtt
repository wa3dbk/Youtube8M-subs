00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
is a template that I made and as you can

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.469 
is a template that I made and as you can
see<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.080> did<00:01:16.290> little<00:01:16.500> designs<00:01:17.100> there<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:18.360> what

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
see I did little designs there and what

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.539 
see I did little designs there and what
I<00:01:18.509> did<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.140> measured<00:01:19.259> an<00:01:19.500> inch<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.979> I

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
I did is I just measured an inch and I

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.420 
I did is I just measured an inch and I
use<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.850> template<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.360> make<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> design<00:01:22.680> and

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
use the template to make the design and

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.859 
use the template to make the design and
then<00:01:23.549> I'd<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.790> know<00:01:24.119> measure<00:01:24.420> another<00:01:24.689> inch

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
then I'd you know measure another inch

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.030 
then I'd you know measure another inch
and<00:01:24.990> then<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.170> use<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.350> template<00:01:25.650> again<00:01:25.680> and

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
and then I use the template again and

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.700 
and then I use the template again and
then<00:01:26.700> another<00:01:27.299> inch<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.439> did<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.650> design

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
then another inch and I did the design

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.240 
then another inch and I did the design
again<00:01:29.150> so<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.299> really<00:01:30.659> simple<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.290> then<00:01:32.070> to

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
again so it's really simple and then to

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.429 
again so it's really simple and then to
make<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.400> sharper<00:01:32.909> instead<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.210> round<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.810> cut

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
make it sharper instead of round I cut

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.499 
make it sharper instead of round I cut
it<00:01:34.530> out<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.820> middle<00:01:36.030> just<00:01:36.150> like<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.329> little

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
it out in the middle just like a little

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.910 
it out in the middle just like a little
like<00:01:36.960> little<00:01:37.170> access<00:01:38.030> foam<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.180> there<00:01:39.329> and

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
like little access foam in there and

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.889 
like little access foam in there and
yeah<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.400> makes<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.729> look<00:01:41.759> sharper<00:01:42.360> it

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
yeah and it makes it look sharper it

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.929 
yeah and it makes it look sharper it
makes<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.170> look<00:01:43.290> cooler<00:01:44.479> sleeker<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:46.790> this<00:01:47.790> is

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
makes it look cooler sleeker and this is

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.069 
makes it look cooler sleeker and this is
like<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.180> all<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.420> do<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:48.780> draw<00:01:48.960> it

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
like this all you do you just draw it

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.270 
like this all you do you just draw it
and<00:01:49.200> then<00:01:49.290> cut<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.649> out<00:01:49.710> like<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.009> cut<00:01:50.250> a

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
and then cut it out like you just cut a

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.120 
and then cut it out like you just cut a
little<00:01:50.369> bit<00:01:50.670> out<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.840> just<00:01:52.799> make<00:01:52.890> like<00:01:53.070> a

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
little bit out of the just make like a

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.819 
little bit out of the just make like a

so yeah and honestly that's all all this
really<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.170> that<00:02:01.170> need<00:02:01.619> for<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.799> to

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
really is is that that need for the to

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.249 
really is is that that need for the to
design<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.549> logo<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.390> shoulder<00:02:03.719> pads<00:02:03.960> and

design the logo the shoulder pads and
like<00:02:04.439> little<00:02:04.740> razor<00:02:04.920> part<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:06.110> you<00:02:07.110> can<00:02:07.229> make

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
like little razor part and you can make

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.380 
like little razor part and you can make
it<00:02:07.469> however<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.829> want<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.190> know<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.670> made<00:02:09.119> I

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
it however you want you know I made I

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.170 
it however you want you know I made I
made<00:02:09.539> my<00:02:09.690> own<00:02:09.720> templates<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:11.030> just<00:02:12.030> made<00:02:12.150> it

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
made my own templates so I just made it

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.250 
made my own templates so I just made it
from<00:02:12.300> scratch

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
from scratch

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.699 
from scratch
so<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.709> mean<00:02:14.159> this<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.120> my<00:02:15.239> idea<00:02:15.599> to<00:02:16.440> make<00:02:16.530> that

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
so I mean this is my idea to make that

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.160 
so I mean this is my idea to make that
either<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.099> new<00:02:17.220> 52<00:02:17.489> or<00:02:17.879> what<00:02:18.780> I<00:02:18.810> did<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.080> the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
either the new 52 or what I did is the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.170 
either the new 52 or what I did is the
mesh<00:02:19.349> of<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.590> new<00:02:19.739> 52<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.459> old<00:02:20.790> school

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
armor I wasn't you know I wasn't sure if

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.920 
armor I wasn't you know I wasn't sure if
I<00:02:59.129> want<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.370> be<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.640> subtle<00:02:59.940> or<00:03:00.150> over-the-top

so I did both and the cool thing is you
can<00:03:03.660> make<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.470> reversible<00:03:05.069> like<00:03:05.340> make

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
can make it reversible like make

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.789 
can make it reversible like make
whatever<00:03:06.420> side<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:06.810> like<00:03:06.930> better<00:03:07.140> like<00:03:07.620> oh<00:03:07.769> I

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
like a subtle one so I'll put that in

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.880 
like a subtle one so I'll put that in
the<00:03:09.329> front<00:03:09.480> or<00:03:09.720> I<00:03:09.780> like<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.379> one<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.650> pops

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
the front or I like the one that pops

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.740 
the front or I like the one that pops
out<00:03:11.069> more<00:03:11.340> I'll<00:03:11.819> put<00:03:12.030> that<00:03:12.150> in<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.359> front<00:03:12.599> and

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
out more I'll put that in the front and

out more I'll put that in the front and
then<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.349> know<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.709> design<00:03:14.010> will<00:03:14.129> also<00:03:14.400> also

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
then you know the design will also also

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.900 
then you know the design will also also
be<00:03:14.910> in<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.060> back<00:03:15.209> so<00:03:16.190> and<00:03:17.190> as<00:03:17.430> you<00:03:17.579> can<00:03:17.700> see<00:03:17.880> I
