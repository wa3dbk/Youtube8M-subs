thinking that it was you know a liquid
lipstick<00:04:07.470> range<00:04:07.860> like<00:04:08.280> all<00:04:08.460> of<00:04:08.580> the<00:04:08.700> other

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
ones that I have so that was just my

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.830 
ones that I have so that was just my
misunderstanding<00:04:10.890> it<00:04:11.850> actually<00:04:12.240> says<00:04:12.540> right

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
misunderstanding it actually says right

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.680 
misunderstanding it actually says right
here<00:04:12.890> that<00:04:13.890> it's<00:04:14.070> a<00:04:14.160> cream<00:04:14.430> it<00:04:14.790> doesn't<00:04:15.330> dry

people that have maybe tried liquid
lipsticks<00:04:32.730> and<00:04:32.880> hated<00:04:33.300> it<00:04:33.420> because<00:04:33.570> you<00:04:34.320> know

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
lipsticks and hated it because you know

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.470 
lipsticks and hated it because you know
either<00:04:34.650> you<00:04:34.950> have<00:04:35.190> really<00:04:35.640> dry<00:04:35.790> lips<00:04:36.150> and<00:04:36.390> it

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
either you have really dry lips and it

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.210 
either you have really dry lips and it
just<00:04:36.660> dries<00:04:36.900> you<00:04:37.050> out<00:04:37.080> too<00:04:37.410> much<00:04:37.440> or<00:04:37.890> you<00:04:38.040> just

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
just dries you out too much or you just

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.460 
just dries you out too much or you just
didn't<00:04:38.580> like<00:04:38.700> that<00:04:38.760> really<00:04:39.330> matter<00:04:39.690> a<00:04:39.960> texture

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
didn't like that really matter a texture

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.140 
didn't like that really matter a texture
of<00:04:40.560> it<00:04:40.710> then<00:04:41.130> these<00:04:41.340> are<00:04:41.400> probably<00:04:41.910> going<00:04:42.090> to

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
of it then these are probably going to

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.900 
of it then these are probably going to
be<00:04:42.240> a<00:04:42.360> really<00:04:42.810> good<00:04:43.110> option<00:04:43.410> for<00:04:44.070> you<00:04:44.250> the
