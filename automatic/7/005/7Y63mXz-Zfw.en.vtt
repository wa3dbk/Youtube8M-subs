00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
in my opinion so it does show of

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.460 
in my opinion so it does show of
deductive<00:01:33.720> really<00:01:33.869> does<00:01:33.990> have<00:01:34.140> potential

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
deductive really does have potential

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.560 
deductive really does have potential
it's<00:01:35.189> kind<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.400> really<00:01:35.549> some<00:01:35.880> interested<00:01:36.479> in

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
seeing what a lot of the pro players can

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.929 
seeing what a lot of the pro players can
do<00:01:38.729> with<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.939> deck<00:01:39.090> um<00:01:40.520> but<00:01:41.520> yeah<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:41.790> right

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
card is really good it's basically like

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.020 
card is really good it's basically like
a<00:04:56.590> scrap<00:04:57.190> dragon<00:04:57.340> of<00:04:57.520> a<00:04:57.550> better<00:04:57.730> because<00:04:57.940> he

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
a scrap dragon of a better because he

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.820 
a scrap dragon of a better because he
can<00:04:58.150> pop<00:04:58.300> pretty<00:04:58.630> much<00:04:58.810> it<00:04:58.990> pops<00:04:59.260> every

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
can pop pretty much it pops every

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.310 
can pop pretty much it pops every
face-up<00:05:00.100> monster<00:05:00.520> you<00:05:00.640> control<00:05:00.730> and

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
face-up monster you control and

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.000 
face-up monster you control and
thankfully<00:05:02.320> I<00:05:02.350> had<00:05:02.530> that<00:05:02.650> effect<00:05:02.890> veiler

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
thankfully I had that effect veiler

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.310 
thankfully I had that effect veiler
because<00:05:03.340> that<00:05:03.520> would've<00:05:03.670> been<00:05:03.730> really<00:05:03.970> bad

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
because that would've been really bad

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.150 
because that would've been really bad
because<00:05:05.320> he<00:05:05.350> would<00:05:05.530> have<00:05:05.560> been<00:05:05.680> able<00:05:05.860> to<00:05:06.070> get

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
because he would have been able to get

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.400 
because he would have been able to get
past<00:05:06.340> everything<00:05:06.640> I<00:05:07.180> had<00:05:07.390> but<00:05:07.990> that<00:05:08.170> effect

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
past everything I had but that effect

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.740 
past everything I had but that effect

guard in a blaster I think let's see

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:25.410 
guard in a blaster I think let's see
what<00:05:19.180> he<00:05:19.270> does<00:05:23.700> flame<00:05:24.700> will<00:05:24.820> guard<00:05:24.970> in<00:05:25.060> a<00:05:25.120> redox

what he does flame will guard in a redox

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.360 
what he does flame will guard in a redox
okay<00:05:25.750> and<00:05:26.080> then<00:05:26.470> he<00:05:26.560> activates<00:05:26.890> the<00:05:27.100> effect

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
okay and then he activates the effect

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.660 
okay and then he activates the effect
and<00:05:27.550> then<00:05:27.670> I<00:05:27.700> veiler<00:05:28.120> and<00:05:28.390> it's<00:05:28.510> like<00:05:28.690> yeah<00:05:29.670> not

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
and then I veiler and it's like yeah not

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:35.010 
and then I veiler and it's like yeah not
today<00:05:30.910> and<00:05:33.060> that<00:05:34.060> pretty<00:05:34.270> much<00:05:34.420> whence<00:05:34.810> me<00:05:34.900> the

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
today and that pretty much whence me the

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.320 
today and that pretty much whence me the
game<00:05:35.140> I<00:05:35.260> think<00:05:35.290> he<00:05:35.530> ends<00:05:35.650> up<00:05:35.770> scooping

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
game I think he ends up scooping

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.880 
game I think he ends up scooping
slightly<00:05:37.330> afterward<00:05:37.750> so<00:05:38.350> as<00:05:38.530> you<00:05:38.650> can<00:05:38.740> see

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
slightly afterward so as you can see

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.620 
slightly afterward so as you can see
chaos<00:05:39.280> dragons<00:05:39.670> are<00:05:39.910> better<00:05:40.150> than<00:05:40.240> the<00:05:40.330> dragon

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
chaos dragons are better than the dragon

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.930 
chaos dragons are better than the dragon
