00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
assault rifles in a game in my personal

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.160 
assault rifles in a game in my personal
opinion<00:02:01.820> and<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.600> see<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.840> running<00:02:04.079> a

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
opinion and you can see is running a

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.530 
opinion and you can see is running a
specialist<00:02:04.799> loaded<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.399> don't<00:02:06.329> really<00:02:06.420> think

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
specialist loaded I don't really think

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.779 
specialist loaded I don't really think
it's<00:02:06.780> perps<00:02:06.990> matter<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.500> too<00:02:08.340> much<00:02:08.520> just

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
it's perps matter that too much just

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.430 
it's perps matter that too much just
because<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.750> know<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.899> get<00:02:10.140> them<00:02:10.289> all

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
because you know you get them all

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.840 
because you know you get them all
eventually

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
eventually

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.150 
eventually
but<00:02:12.850> something<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:13.810> shall<00:02:14.350> point<00:02:14.620> out<00:02:14.800> in<00:02:15.010> this

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
but something I shall point out in this

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.820 
but something I shall point out in this
video<00:02:15.520> is<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.210> fact<00:02:16.690> that<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:17.380> can<00:02:17.530> see<00:02:17.680> this

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
video is the fact that you can see this

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.260 
video is the fact that you can see this
team<00:02:18.100> isn't<00:02:18.310> making<00:02:18.550> much<00:02:18.730> of<00:02:18.790> an<00:02:18.970> effort<00:02:19.090> to

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
team isn't making much of an effort to

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.850 
team isn't making much of an effort to
even<00:02:19.390> move<00:02:19.630> out<00:02:19.810> of<00:02:19.840> their<00:02:19.990> spawn<00:02:20.290> really<00:02:20.680> and

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
even move out of their spawn really and

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.320 
even move out of their spawn really and
that<00:02:21.520> you<00:02:21.670> know<00:02:21.760> there's<00:02:22.000> pretty<00:02:22.300> much

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
that you know there's pretty much

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.450 
that you know there's pretty much
getting<00:02:22.660> decimated<00:02:22.900> four<00:02:23.530> kills<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.340> deaths

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
getting decimated four kills and deaths

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.460 
getting decimated four kills and deaths
wise<00:02:24.790> which<00:02:25.120> is<00:02:25.300> you<00:02:25.480> know<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:26.320> main

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
wise which is you know the main

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.350 
wise which is you know the main
objective<00:02:26.620> in<00:02:27.220> domination<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.180> capture

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
objective in domination is to capture

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.700 
objective in domination is to capture
the<00:02:28.630> flag<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.200> guess<00:02:29.350> it<00:02:29.470> doesn't<00:02:29.590> really

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
the flag and I guess it doesn't really

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.710 
the flag and I guess it doesn't really
matter<00:02:30.130> how<00:02:30.430> many<00:02:30.580> times<00:02:30.850> you<00:02:31.090> kind<00:02:31.300> of<00:02:31.450> died

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
matter how many times you kind of died

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.720 
matter how many times you kind of died
guess<00:02:32.050> you<00:02:32.230> could<00:02:32.410> say<00:02:32.620> but<00:02:32.830> if<00:02:33.460> you're<00:02:33.610> just

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
guess you could say but if you're just

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.270 
guess you could say but if you're just
feeding<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.090> team<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:35.020> enemy's<00:02:35.380> helicopters

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
feeding the team the enemy's helicopters

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.860 
feeding the team the enemy's helicopters

helping at your team in any way now I

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.400 
helping at your team in any way now I
believe<00:02:42.910> that<00:02:43.060> this<00:02:43.330> part<00:02:43.660> in<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.840> video<00:02:44.140> our

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
believe that this part in the video our

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.740 
believe that this part in the video our
game<00:02:45.070> plan<00:02:45.100> nasus<00:02:45.790> ass<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.180> realizes<00:02:46.720> that

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
game plan nasus ass and realizes that

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.630 
game plan nasus ass and realizes that
he's<00:02:47.410> gonna<00:02:47.560> have<00:02:47.740> to<00:02:47.800> go<00:02:47.920> into<00:02:48.040> Slayer<00:02:48.340> mode

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
he's gonna have to go into Slayer mode

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.390 
he's gonna have to go into Slayer mode
and<00:02:48.940> one<00:02:49.930> of<00:02:50.020> the<00:02:50.110> other<00:02:50.470> reasons<00:02:50.830> that<00:02:51.220> I

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
and one of the other reasons that I

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.130 
and one of the other reasons that I
think<00:02:51.970> that<00:02:52.150> led<00:02:52.330> him<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:52.690> side<00:02:52.870> this<00:02:53.080> is

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
think that led him to the side this is

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.450 
think that led him to the side this is
the<00:02:53.290> fact<00:02:53.590> that<00:02:53.680> his<00:02:53.860> team<00:02:54.010> isn't<00:02:54.220> really

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
the fact that his team isn't really

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.030 
the fact that his team isn't really
hopping<00:02:54.850> on<00:02:54.970> very<00:02:55.180> many<00:02:55.210> flags<00:02:55.630> so<00:02:56.380> there's<00:02:56.980> no

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
hopping on very many flags so there's no

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.010 
hopping on very many flags so there's no
point<00:02:57.400> in<00:02:57.550> him<00:02:57.820> hopping<00:02:58.150> on<00:02:58.450> one<00:02:58.480> of<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.750> flags

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
point in him hopping on one of the flags

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.350 
point in him hopping on one of the flags
just<00:02:59.470> to<00:02:59.590> die<00:02:59.800> and<00:03:00.130> you<00:03:00.370> know<00:03:00.490> ruin<00:03:00.850> his<00:03:01.000> streak

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
just to die and you know ruin his streak

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.450 
just to die and you know ruin his streak
so<00:03:01.660> I<00:03:01.840> think<00:03:02.350> he<00:03:02.590> says<00:03:02.830> that<00:03:03.070> you<00:03:03.160> know<00:03:03.250> what

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
so I think he says that you know what

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.430 
so I think he says that you know what
I'm<00:03:03.670> just<00:03:03.910> gonna<00:03:04.030> go<00:03:04.300> and<00:03:04.630> try<00:03:05.020> and<00:03:05.080> see<00:03:05.350> how

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
I'm just gonna go and try and see how

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.170 
I'm just gonna go and try and see how
long<00:03:05.500> I<00:03:05.680> can<00:03:05.770> stay<00:03:06.010> on<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.280> streak<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:06.880> maybe

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
long I can stay on the streak and maybe

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.750 
long I can stay on the streak and maybe
if<00:03:07.360> I<00:03:07.480> do<00:03:07.840> enough<00:03:08.380> killing<00:03:09.370> maybe<00:03:09.550> my

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
if I do enough killing maybe my

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.580 
if I do enough killing maybe my
teammates<00:03:10.150> can<00:03:10.300> maybe<00:03:10.480> hop<00:03:10.750> on<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.050> flag<00:03:11.290> now

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
teammates can maybe hop on the flag now

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.590 
teammates can maybe hop on the flag now
sometimes<00:03:12.460> this<00:03:12.610> doesn't<00:03:12.910> always<00:03:13.090> work<00:03:13.390> the

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
sometimes this doesn't always work the

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.090 
sometimes this doesn't always work the
Slayer<00:03:13.840> mode<00:03:14.110> when<00:03:14.380> you're<00:03:14.500> running<00:03:14.860> in<00:03:15.070> a

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
Slayer mode when you're running in a

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.900 
Slayer mode when you're running in a
solo<00:03:15.490> but<00:03:15.790> you<00:03:16.570> know<00:03:17.220> sometimes<00:03:18.220> you<00:03:18.610> have<00:03:18.640> to

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
solo but you know sometimes you have to

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.250 
solo but you know sometimes you have to
be<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.090> person<00:03:19.300> that<00:03:19.450> actually<00:03:19.600> has<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:20.080> hop

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
be the person that actually has to hop

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.560 
be the person that actually has to hop
on<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.500> flag<00:03:20.800> which<00:03:21.070> you<00:03:21.400> know<00:03:21.520> it<00:03:22.150> just<00:03:22.210> has

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
on the flag which you know it just has

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.320 
on the flag which you know it just has
to<00:03:22.750> be<00:03:22.870> done<00:03:22.990> sometimes<00:03:24.060> but<00:03:25.060> I<00:03:25.120> like<00:03:25.300> the

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
to be done sometimes but I like the

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.690 
to be done sometimes but I like the
brilliance<00:03:25.780> that<00:03:25.870> he<00:03:26.050> uses<00:03:26.260> in<00:03:26.620> this<00:03:27.430> little

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
brilliance that he uses in this little

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.090 
brilliance that he uses in this little
square<00:03:28.000> room<00:03:28.240> between<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.900> tunnel<00:03:29.380> be<00:03:29.860> dumb

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
square room between the tunnel be dumb

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.860 
square room between the tunnel be dumb
and<00:03:30.370> a<00:03:30.550> that<00:03:30.790> little<00:03:31.030> square<00:03:31.270> room<00:03:31.480> on<00:03:31.630> hardhat

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
and a that little square room on hardhat

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.590 
and a that little square room on hardhat
because<00:03:32.860> he<00:03:33.160> actually<00:03:33.280> hold<00:03:33.670> it<00:03:33.820> down<00:03:33.940> so<00:03:34.330> good

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
because he actually hold it down so good

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.630 
because he actually hold it down so good
and<00:03:34.870> I<00:03:35.050> like<00:03:35.260> that<00:03:35.290> way<00:03:35.740> how<00:03:35.950> he<00:03:36.010> patrols<00:03:36.520> the

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
and I like that way how he patrols the

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.490 
and I like that way how he patrols the
perimeter<00:03:37.210> now<00:03:37.750> you<00:03:37.810> can<00:03:38.020> see<00:03:38.140> his<00:03:38.260> team's

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
perimeter now you can see his team's

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.990 
perimeter now you can see his team's
being<00:03:38.710> Triple<00:03:39.010> capped<00:03:39.280> right<00:03:39.550> now<00:03:39.700> so<00:03:39.880> that

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
being Triple capped right now so that

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.060 
being Triple capped right now so that
means<00:03:40.210> that<00:03:40.390> the<00:03:40.750> enemies<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:41.380> his<00:03:41.710> own<00:03:41.860> team

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
means that the enemies and his own team

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.710 
means that the enemies and his own team
are<00:03:42.190> going<00:03:42.220> to<00:03:42.340> spawn<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:42.910> randomly<00:03:43.360> across

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
are going to spawn and randomly across

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.230 
are going to spawn and randomly across
the<00:03:44.020> map<00:03:44.230> so<00:03:44.860> he<00:03:45.370> has<00:03:45.610> two<00:03:46.060> different

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
the map so he has two different

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.060 
the map so he has two different
entrances<00:03:46.810> into<00:03:47.110> this<00:03:47.350> little<00:03:47.590> room<00:03:47.710> right

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
entrances into this little room right

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.040 
entrances into this little room right
here<00:03:48.100> and<00:03:48.520> he<00:03:48.550> has<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.330> watch<00:03:49.480> both<00:03:49.780> at<00:03:49.960> the

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
here and he has to watch both at the

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.470 
here and he has to watch both at the
same<00:03:50.230> time<00:03:50.520> now<00:03:51.520> this<00:03:51.700> team<00:03:51.940> found<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.270> cap

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
same time now this team found the cap

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.630 
same time now this team found the cap
seat<00:03:52.810> and<00:03:53.110> now<00:03:53.200> he<00:03:53.260> has<00:03:53.530> to<00:03:53.560> worry<00:03:53.860> about<00:03:53.980> you

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
seat and now he has to worry about you

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.190 
seat and now he has to worry about you
know<00:03:54.730> they're<00:03:54.970> probably<00:03:55.180> spawning<00:03:55.540> a<00:03:55.840> and

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
know they're probably spawning a and

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.430 
know they're probably spawning a and
maybe<00:03:56.380> the<00:03:56.650> side<00:03:56.920> of<00:03:56.950> B<00:03:57.310> so<00:03:58.150> right<00:03:58.960> here<00:03:59.290> is

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
maybe the side of B so right here is

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.380 
maybe the side of B so right here is
kind<00:03:59.830> of<00:03:59.890> clutch<00:04:00.160> he<00:04:00.580> does<00:04:00.760> go<00:04:00.940> into<00:04:00.970> main

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
kind of clutch he does go into main

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.600 
kind of clutch he does go into main
Slayer<00:04:01.720> mode<00:04:01.990> right<00:04:02.200> here<00:04:02.550> unfortunately<00:04:03.550> his

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
Slayer mode right here unfortunately his

Slayer mode right here unfortunately his
team<00:04:03.850> doesn't<00:04:04.120> really<00:04:04.240> seem<00:04:04.420> to<00:04:04.450> want<00:04:04.660> to<00:04:04.720> cap

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
team doesn't really seem to want to cap

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.960 
team doesn't really seem to want to cap
stuff<00:04:05.200> a<00:04:05.350> new<00:04:05.560> till<00:04:06.040> I<00:04:06.070> think<00:04:06.550> they<00:04:06.730> come

stuff a new till I think they come
around<00:04:07.120> this<00:04:07.240> corner<00:04:07.300> a<00:04:07.600> day<00:04:07.840> after<00:04:08.050> he<00:04:08.260> kills

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
around this corner a day after he kills

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.680 
around this corner a day after he kills
most<00:04:08.800> of<00:04:09.010> them<00:04:09.130> so<00:04:09.370> kind<00:04:10.120> of<00:04:10.240> carrying<00:04:10.570> his

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
most of them so kind of carrying his

00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:27.879 
can when you to gain especially

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:31.710 
can when you to gain especially
objective<00:04:28.300> game<00:04:28.449> modes<00:04:28.479> like<00:04:28.750> domination<00:04:30.720> so

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
objective game modes like domination so

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.719 
objective game modes like domination so
right<00:04:32.680> here<00:04:32.710> you<00:04:32.949> can<00:04:33.340> see<00:04:33.490> he's<00:04:33.669> just

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
right here you can see he's just

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.369 
right here you can see he's just
defending<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:34.389> flag<00:04:34.599> trying<00:04:35.020> to<00:04:35.080> build<00:04:35.289> up

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:35.379 
defending the flag trying to build up

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:38.219 
defending the flag trying to build up
his<00:04:35.560> streak<00:04:35.949> and<00:04:36.240> his<00:04:37.240> team's<00:04:37.539> finally<00:04:37.900> got<00:04:38.050> a

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
his streak and his team's finally got a

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.439 
his streak and his team's finally got a
better<00:04:38.860> triple<00:04:39.250> cap<00:04:39.430> now<00:04:39.669> which<00:04:39.909> is<00:04:39.939> kind<00:04:40.270> of<00:04:40.360> a

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
better triple cap now which is kind of a

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:41.730 
better triple cap now which is kind of a
good<00:04:40.569> thing<00:04:40.629> considering<00:04:41.259> that<00:04:41.560> they

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
good thing considering that they

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.920 
good thing considering that they
actually<00:04:42.129> needed<00:04:42.400> to<00:04:43.000> come<00:04:43.210> back<00:04:43.389> and<00:04:43.539> points

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
actually needed to come back and points

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.600 
actually needed to come back and points
the<00:04:44.050> only<00:04:44.229> thing<00:04:44.379> that<00:04:44.530> I<00:04:44.680> was<00:04:45.370> kind<00:04:45.580> of

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
the only thing that I was kind of

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.580 
the only thing that I was kind of
unfortunate<00:04:45.939> with<00:04:46.360> this<00:04:46.509> gameplay<00:04:46.719> was<00:04:47.469> the

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
unfortunate with this gameplay was the

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.860 
unfortunate with this gameplay was the
fact<00:04:47.770> that<00:04:47.889> how<00:04:48.099> long<00:04:48.370> his<00:04:48.729> team<00:04:49.150> took<00:04:49.569> to

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
fact that how long his team took to

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.110 
fact that how long his team took to
actually<00:04:50.319> you<00:04:50.650> know<00:04:50.770> start<00:04:51.490> capping<00:04:51.969> all

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
actually you know start capping all

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.909 
actually you know start capping all
these<00:04:52.270> flags<00:04:52.569> because<00:04:52.900> it's<00:04:53.439> never<00:04:53.590> good<00:04:53.889> to

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
these flags because it's never good to

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.820
