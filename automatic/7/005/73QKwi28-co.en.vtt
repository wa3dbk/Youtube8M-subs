that<00:01:56.939> happen<00:01:57.149> in<00:01:57.390> my<00:01:57.540> flashlights<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.290> just

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
that happen in my flashlights so I just

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.709 
that happen in my flashlights so I just
keep<00:01:58.649> an<00:01:58.770> eye<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.430> always<00:02:00.420> check<00:02:00.689> my

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
keep an eye on it I always check my

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.020 
keep an eye on it I always check my
spring<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.439> back<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:02.009> spring<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.729> what

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
spring in the back the spring is what

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.760 
spring in the back the spring is what
provides<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.570> tension<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.229> drive<00:02:04.560> your

circuit board here with the front of
your<00:02:06.210> battery<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.530> if<00:02:07.619> your<00:02:07.740> Springs<00:02:08.099> messed

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
your battery so if your Springs messed

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.040 
your battery so if your Springs messed
up<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.879> need<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.090> put<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.239> new<00:02:09.390> spring<00:02:09.690> in<00:02:09.899> there

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
up you need to put a new spring in there

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.110 
up you need to put a new spring in there
or<00:02:10.229> somehow<00:02:10.560> you've<00:02:10.770> been

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
or somehow you've been

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.660 
or somehow you've been
trying<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.569> get<00:02:11.690> it<00:02:11.780> or<00:02:11.870> in<00:02:12.110> or<00:02:12.260> out<00:02:12.409> then<00:02:13.099> make

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
trying to get it or in or out then make

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.280 
trying to get it or in or out then make
sure<00:02:13.700> it's<00:02:13.849> right<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.330> wide<00:02:14.540> side<00:02:14.959> goes<00:02:15.260> to

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
sure it's right the wide side goes to

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.470 
sure it's right the wide side goes to
the<00:02:15.530> bottom<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.069> skinny<00:02:16.310> side<00:02:16.640> points<00:02:17.299> up

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
the bottom and the skinny side points up

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.270 
the bottom and the skinny side points up
I<00:02:17.750> have<00:02:18.140> seen<00:02:18.409> some<00:02:18.590> people<00:02:18.709> that<00:02:18.950> got<00:02:19.069> them<00:02:19.220> in

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
I have seen some people that got them in

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.559 
I have seen some people that got them in
their<00:02:19.400> backwards<00:02:19.610> somehow<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:20.180> mean<00:02:20.330> you<00:02:20.420> can

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
their backwards somehow I mean you can

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:21.820 
their backwards somehow I mean you can
you<00:02:20.750> can<00:02:20.900> flip<00:02:21.110> them<00:02:21.170> out<00:02:21.349> with<00:02:21.470> your<00:02:21.560> finger

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
you can flip them out with your finger

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.460 
you can flip them out with your finger
if<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:21.950> want<00:02:22.220> to<00:02:22.569> always<00:02:23.569> check<00:02:23.989> your<00:02:24.170> circuit

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
if you want to always check your circuit

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.050 
if you want to always check your circuit
board<00:02:24.590> make<00:02:24.860> sure<00:02:24.890> there's<00:02:25.159> no<00:02:25.400> debris<00:02:25.640> on<00:02:26.030> the

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
back of your board here this is what

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.039 
back of your board here this is what
drives<00:02:27.680> your<00:02:27.950> life<00:02:28.129> and<00:02:28.659> next<00:02:29.659> on<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.870> list

drives your life and next on the list

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.289 
drives your life and next on the list
I'll<00:02:30.409> drop<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.769> battery<00:02:31.069> are<00:02:31.280> your<00:02:31.879> threads

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
I'll drop the battery are your threads

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.610 
I'll drop the battery are your threads
if<00:02:32.599> you<00:02:33.170> start<00:02:33.500> feeling<00:02:33.829> a<00:02:34.129> lot<00:02:34.400> of<00:02:34.640> rough

if you start feeling a lot of rough
noises<00:02:36.620> or<00:02:36.799> grinds<00:02:37.340> if<00:02:37.430> you<00:02:37.519> take<00:02:37.730> everything

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
noises or grinds if you take everything

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.210 
noises or grinds if you take everything
out<00:02:38.360> of<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.959> light<00:02:39.319> or<00:02:39.349> your<00:02:39.650> battery<00:02:39.920> out<00:02:39.950> you

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
out of the light or your battery out you

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.470 
out of the light or your battery out you
can<00:02:40.370> really<00:02:40.610> hear<00:02:40.819> it<00:02:40.940> because<00:02:41.060> it's<00:02:41.150> hollow

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
can really hear it because it's hollow

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.569 
can really hear it because it's hollow
if<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.409> start<00:02:42.680> hearing<00:02:42.950> a<00:02:43.069> lot<00:02:43.220> of<00:02:43.370> grinding

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
if you start hearing a lot of grinding

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.849 
if you start hearing a lot of grinding
noises<00:02:44.030> this<00:02:44.329> is<00:02:44.390> just<00:02:44.690> smooth<00:02:44.900> as<00:02:45.079> can<00:02:45.200> be<00:02:45.410> if

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
noises this is just smooth as can be if

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:46.990 
noises this is just smooth as can be if

you start hearing a lot of grinding

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000 
you start hearing a lot of grinding
noises<00:02:47.450> then<00:02:48.200> you<00:02:48.319> need<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.560> check<00:02:48.859> your

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
noises then you need to check your

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.860 
noises then you need to check your
threads<00:02:49.430> take<00:02:50.060> a<00:02:50.120> damp<00:02:50.480> cloth

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870

threads take a damp cloth
pinch<00:02:51.709> it<00:02:51.890> rotate<00:02:52.640> your<00:02:52.819> light<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.510> left

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
pinch it rotate your light to the left

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.860 
pinch it rotate your light to the left
and<00:02:54.200> simply<00:02:55.010> work<00:02:55.280> all<00:02:55.519> the<00:02:56.090> debris<00:02:56.390> out<00:02:56.750> of

and simply work all the debris out of
the<00:02:57.349> threads<00:02:57.739> when<00:02:58.609> you<00:02:58.640> get<00:02:58.819> to<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.060> inside
