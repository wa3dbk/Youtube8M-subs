00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
MV X sound system we decided to go with

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.009 
MV X sound system we decided to go with
two<00:00:08.250> 12<00:00:08.550> inch<00:00:08.700> subs<00:00:09.030> that<00:00:09.540> way<00:00:09.690> we<00:00:09.840> don't<00:00:09.929> have

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
two 12 inch subs that way we don't have

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.959 
two 12 inch subs that way we don't have
to<00:00:10.139> use<00:00:10.349> up<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.679> whole<00:00:10.860> trunk<00:00:11.130> space<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.730> we

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
to use up the whole trunk space and we

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.370 
to use up the whole trunk space and we
can<00:00:12.179> still<00:00:12.330> put<00:00:12.540> some<00:00:12.719> stuff<00:00:12.900> in<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.080> if<00:00:13.259> we

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
can still put some stuff in it if we

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.629 
can still put some stuff in it if we
ever<00:00:13.469> choose<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.740> on<00:00:13.980> trip<00:00:14.219> or<00:00:14.340> something<00:00:14.580> like

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
ever choose to on trip or something like

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.090 
ever choose to on trip or something like
that<00:00:14.700> they're<00:00:15.389> very<00:00:15.690> good-looking<00:00:16.049> subs<00:00:16.619> so

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
that they're very good-looking subs so

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.439 
that they're very good-looking subs so
let's<00:00:17.279> go<00:00:17.369> ahead<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.640> get<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.760> better<00:00:17.910> taste<00:00:18.300> of

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
let's go ahead and get a better taste of

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.050 
let's go ahead and get a better taste of
these<00:00:18.539> bc<00:00:19.140> series<00:00:19.529> subs<00:00:19.770> from<00:00:19.980> nvx<00:00:20.460> these

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
these bc series subs from nvx these

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.259 
these bc series subs from nvx these
particular<00:00:21.600> ones<00:00:21.750> are<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.410> vc<00:00:22.830> w12<00:00:23.609> 2's<00:00:23.970> they

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
particular ones are the vc w12 2's they

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.929 
particular ones are the vc w12 2's they
also<00:00:24.449> have<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> bc<00:00:25.170> w12<00:00:25.710> 4<00:00:26.039> which<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.490> 4<00:00:26.760> own

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.670 
also have a bc w12 4 which is the 4 own
configuration<00:00:27.269> but<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.170> went<00:00:28.320> ahead<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.560> got

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
the 2 ohm coils that way we can drop the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.359 
the 2 ohm coils that way we can drop the
impedance<00:00:31.080> down<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.470> ultimo<00:00:31.920> level<00:00:32.219> and

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
very very nice it's a when ice cast

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.630 
very very nice it's a when ice cast
aluminum<00:01:01.170> basket<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.859> almost<00:01:02.129> reminds<00:01:02.430> me<00:01:02.550> of

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
aluminum basket it almost reminds me of

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.549 
aluminum basket it almost reminds me of
the<00:01:02.699> old<00:01:02.850> HP's<00:01:03.510> but<00:01:03.780> they<00:01:03.899> don't<00:01:04.080> curve<00:01:04.350> out

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
the old HP's but they don't curve out

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.020 
the old HP's but they don't curve out
like<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.890> other<00:01:04.920> ones<00:01:05.220> these<00:01:05.610> ones<00:01:05.790> will<00:01:05.880> just

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
like the other ones these ones will just

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.730 
like the other ones these ones will just
go<00:01:06.150> straight<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.659> but<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.930> old<00:01:07.080> HB<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.470> kind<00:01:07.710> of

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
go straight in but the old HB is kind of

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.710 
go straight in but the old HB is kind of
curled<00:01:08.040> out<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.400> really<00:01:08.939> do<00:01:09.090> like<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.510> it

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
curled out I really do like this it

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.630 
curled out I really do like this it
looks<00:01:10.200> like<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.350> 12<00:01:10.680> spoke<00:01:10.950> basket<00:01:11.460> because

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
looks like a 12 spoke basket because

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.890 
looks like a 12 spoke basket because
after<00:01:12.030> all<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.330> don't<00:01:12.390> need<00:01:12.600> all<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
after all you don't need all the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.270 
after all you don't need all the
strength<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.260> can<00:01:13.470> get<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.710> your<00:01:13.799> woofer<00:01:14.100> once

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
strength you can get in your woofer once

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.100 
strength you can get in your woofer once
they<00:01:14.430> start<00:01:14.700> going<00:01:14.850> crazy<00:01:15.270> but<00:01:15.570> before<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.900> get

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
they start going crazy but before I get

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.600 
they start going crazy but before I get
too<00:01:16.259> excited<00:01:16.380> let's<00:01:16.860> go<00:01:16.979> ahead<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.280> flip<00:01:17.490> her

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
too excited let's go ahead and flip her

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.399 
too excited let's go ahead and flip her
around<00:01:17.850> again<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.390> take<00:01:18.900> off<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.229> little

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
around again and take off this little

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.649 
around again and take off this little
boot<00:01:19.650> because<00:01:19.890> she<00:01:20.369> has<00:01:20.549> got<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.759> nice<00:01:21.000> triple

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
boot because she has got a nice triple

tighten the rack back down yourself I

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.640 
tighten the rack back down yourself I
really<00:02:45.450> do<00:02:45.690> like<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.050> surround<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:46.440> want<00:02:46.590> to

really do like the surround I want to
make<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:46.770> double<00:02:47.100> point<00:02:47.370> on<00:02:47.520> that<00:02:47.700> but<00:02:47.940> this<00:02:48.300> is

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
make a double point on that but this is

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.990 
make a double point on that but this is
also<00:02:48.630> probably<00:02:49.050> glued<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.890> stitched<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.550> nice
