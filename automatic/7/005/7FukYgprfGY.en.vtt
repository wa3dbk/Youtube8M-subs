method
mostly<00:00:13.250> but<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.460> also<00:00:14.639> back<00:00:14.969> combs<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.420> little

bit<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.440> have<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> few<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.520> just<00:00:17.820> kind<00:00:18.240> of

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
bit and I have a few that I just kind of

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.420 
bit and I have a few that I just kind of
didn't<00:00:18.660> feel<00:00:18.900> like<00:00:19.050> finishing<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:19.920> they've

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
didn't feel like finishing and they've

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.349 
didn't feel like finishing and they've
just<00:00:20.460> read<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.270> on<00:00:21.480> their<00:00:21.810> own<00:00:21.869> since<00:00:22.500> then<00:00:22.769> I

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
just read it on their own since then I

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.080 
just read it on their own since then I
have<00:00:24.359> about<00:00:24.539> 30<00:00:25.170> dreads<00:00:25.710> total<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.430> think<00:00:26.699> I've

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
have about 30 dreads total I think I've

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.509

really<00:00:27.390> been<00:00:27.599> hair<00:00:27.840> too<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.980> was<00:00:29.250> kind<00:00:29.490> of

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
really been hair too so I was kind of

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.830 
really been hair too so I was kind of
surprised<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.179> amount<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.660> got<00:00:32.630> yes<00:00:33.630> I

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
surprised the amount that I got yes I

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.520 
surprised the amount that I got yes I
have<00:00:34.110> very<00:00:34.649> thin<00:00:35.190> fine<00:00:35.640> hair<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:37.290> so

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
have very thin fine hair and it's so

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.810 
have very thin fine hair and it's so
possible<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.129> have<00:00:38.309> dreads

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820

worse than they ever will in those three
months<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:44.720> I<00:01:45.720> know<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:46.799> hard<00:01:46.890> to

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.230 

I<00:01:53.520> found<00:01:54.900> aquamarine<00:01:55.900> on<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:56.650> ground<00:01:57.240> um

I found aquamarine on the ground um
anyway<00:01:58.780> I<00:01:59.939> know<00:02:00.939> it's<00:02:01.240> hard<00:02:01.540> to<00:02:02.970> wait<00:02:03.970> for

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
anyway I know it's hard to wait for

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.880 
anyway I know it's hard to wait for
those<00:02:04.540> three<00:02:04.810> months<00:02:04.840> but<00:02:05.229> because<00:02:05.619> you<00:02:05.740> know

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
those three months but because you know

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:06.840 
those three months but because you know
they're<00:02:06.130> gonna<00:02:06.220> look<00:02:06.430> really<00:02:06.729> good

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
they're gonna look really good

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.699 
they're gonna look really good
eventually<00:02:07.509> and<00:02:07.990> you<00:02:08.140> do<00:02:08.289> have<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.470> deal<00:02:08.679> with

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
eventually and you do have to deal with

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.889 
eventually and you do have to deal with
people<00:02:08.890> asking<00:02:09.160> you<00:02:09.429> oh<00:02:09.459> I<00:02:09.610> why<00:02:10.270> is<00:02:10.509> it<00:02:10.690> so

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
people asking you oh I why is it so

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.710 
people asking you oh I why is it so
loose<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:11.680> why<00:02:12.400> is<00:02:12.520> there<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.819> lump<00:02:13.150> in<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.510> and

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
loose and why is there a lump in it and

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.800
