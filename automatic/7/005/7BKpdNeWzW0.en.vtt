00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 at the beginning of october a movie awaits us in 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.210
 the german cinemas the one of us 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.460
 Society without hate and envy tells 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.559
 but the costs are dear and 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.889
 joy and this is about here now 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.640
 Guardian of Remembrance will be over 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.680
 a great deal of grief arose 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.720
 communities peaceful beautiful places 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.720
 from which chaos became harmony 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.940
 however, you fly with the flies 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.730
 to the edge 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.770
 what is behind it no idea 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.950
 We must not do that is 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.950
 forbidden 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.840
 hello my name i know how you are 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.820
 rather , they are the hut if we are 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.400
 eldersrat I need help with 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.879
 know from the past ours 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.879
 changed world there was much more 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.900
 soon she will be all red 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.740
 all nuances of the morning colors 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.750
 Injection through them when people 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.820
 decide to decide freely 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.440
 if the appearance and the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.420
 Reality is perfect 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.890
 different things are looking 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.149
 this is my father 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.939
 after killing both young and old 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.799
 killed to the well of all 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.990
 There are things you do not know about 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.530
 What I'm afraid I know since 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.740
 months 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:38.509
 what do you want to ask was how to do it 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.579
 you can say you can do it 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.579
 end you can end it all 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.970
 find 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.970
 and takes care of him 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.259
 Guardian of Remembrance goes 90 minutes 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.240
 1 2 was not known at the moment 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.770
 but I'll go to a fsk 6 and 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.420
 starts in Germany from the second 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.860
 October in German cinemas told 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.200
 history of an unspecified 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.239
 future of humanity in the these but 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.099
 so far everything creates negative 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.019
 but to eliminate feelings as well 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.489
 also on the positive and completely 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.470
 to create idealistic society 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.970
 who eats everything balanced she lives 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.370
 the height or respectively on the 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.840
 face point of a mountain over the clouds 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.550
 and is determined by the oldest and 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.530
 every single figure in this one 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.180
 Society has its meaning and of 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.470
 the path from her birth to her 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.870
 school to the determination of her 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.310
 Occupy a ready- made way daily 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.930
 the inhabitants have to be different 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.620
 Medication initiates feelings 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.450
 suppress 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.799
 and that is a market equalization in 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.630
 the wars do not exist but also 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.580
 love does not exist and that is that 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.690
 basic scenario inside dgb guardian of 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.549
 memories of the history of 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.989
 Giannas tells a young boy simply 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.670
 also to be determined in one 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.349
 certain time after his school but 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.000
 it becomes clear to him that he is a whole 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.920
 special property bears resp 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.450
 he has a very special task 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.069
 the next opponent within this 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.810
 there is a guardian in society 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.000
 the memory played here by jeff 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.650
 its all the experiences and experiences 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.150
 all the ideas that humankind 1 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.920
 experienced on earth who holds and 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.390
 the oldest of this society advise 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.890
 if you have a new conflict 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.940
 borders come now it is up to jonas 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.829
 to take on this job 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.299
 And to experience all these experiences 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.859
 Of course he does it now and what that 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.510
 We experience castle for him and for the 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.829
 Whole society Yes, I would like that 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.950
 a place not betrayed but beautiful 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.730
 that again films from studiocanal 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.319
 team the first 15 minutes 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.760
 completely in black and white too funk too 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.440
 to underline them as monotonous 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.120
 this society is and in the moment 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.859
 with genres just this experience 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.569
 they instructed these secrets 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.100
 the whole world is slowly getting in 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.900
 color was also turned into a spectator 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.519
 The special colors are really noticeable 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.840
 especially likely are the most 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.400
 Feelings are the most dense water 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.230
 led everything that is part of it 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.430
 just a nice narrative where i am 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.950
 As a spectator you can say 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.840
 yes the memory is definite 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.100
 interesting is such a film on the must 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.630
 you get involved even if one 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.980
 quite a bit to do with equalization 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.720
 has and the world only in black and white 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.250
 and share good and evil because it was all 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.569
 actors to the main actor jeff 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.549
 bridges and meryl streep the easy 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.900
 really good character heads are and you 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.579
 conceive a film somewhere in the 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.420
 fantasy drama area and fortunately without 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.310
 moment 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.020
 They work where you can say yes 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.250
 because you can get involved later, he is 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.660
 now is not world class and you have to 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.099
 not necessarily see it though 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.690
 a bit varied especially 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.250
 another strip like the virgin the 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.660
 has seen its intended I find the 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.400
 more serious and better 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.049
 made and for all fans just from film 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.400
 In this direction is the keeper of the 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.020
 inner walkable definitive 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.180
 interesting book adaptation at this 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.530
 place where I have to say I think well 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.930
 and especially its 90 minutes 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.250
 squeezes in relatively entertaining and that 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.440
 I find a movie where I have to say 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.000
 yes I like to remember that back 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.800
 is decent in this 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.600
 very special jobs should be called keeper 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.400
 The memory walkable gets from me 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.870
 as a science fiction fantasy drama 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.820
 six and a half out of ten possible points 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.590
 what is decent overall on the 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.970
 I would say that cinema-wise 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.110
 You do not have to see the stripes 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.090
 you see six out of ten possible 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.590
 score points on this overall 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.450
 place for this strip and have there 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.460
 I guard my way through my rule 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.660
 Reminisce like a thumb there if 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.130
 this video made it stay that way 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.300
 not otherwise you know that 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.440
 there are still a few left around me 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.330
 and tomorrow at 15 o'clock, of course 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.160
 at the latest a new video 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:07.500
 and then I hope to be with you again 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.500
 of course on the 3
