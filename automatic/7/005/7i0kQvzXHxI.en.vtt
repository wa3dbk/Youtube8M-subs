a<00:03:10.599> lot<00:03:10.720> of<00:03:10.750> Italians<00:03:11.260> which<00:03:11.470> you<00:03:12.340> know<00:03:12.489> it's

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
a lot of Italians which you know it's

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.759 
a lot of Italians which you know it's
debatable<00:03:13.180> whether<00:03:13.209> that's<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:13.900> good<00:03:13.930> idea<00:03:14.170> but

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
debatable whether that's a good idea but

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.589 
debatable whether that's a good idea but
it<00:03:14.980> worked<00:03:15.220> for<00:03:15.370> Watford<00:03:15.819> you<00:03:15.940> could<00:03:16.150> say<00:03:16.390> they

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
it worked for Watford you could say they

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.539 
it worked for Watford you could say they
just<00:03:17.079> missed<00:03:17.290> out<00:03:17.470> on<00:03:17.769> getting<00:03:17.829> promoted<00:03:18.370> I

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
just missed out on getting promoted I

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.550 
just missed out on getting promoted I
