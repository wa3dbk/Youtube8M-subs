 I made jam on the stew program but 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.940
 here you need to look like you have this 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.849

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.370

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.500
 First you need to keep the lid open. 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.599

 lid and turn on the program but what 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.600
 if you stir the sugar goes to the bottom 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.940
 otherwise it will burn and so I begin to quietly 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.579
 warm up fruit fruit produce juice 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.910
