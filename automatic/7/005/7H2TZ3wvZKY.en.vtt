out<00:01:46.179> whilst<00:01:46.929> the<00:01:47.080> bikes<00:01:47.320> still<00:01:47.890> pretty<00:01:48.159> much

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
out whilst the bikes still pretty much

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.310 
out whilst the bikes still pretty much
complete<00:01:48.820> it's<00:01:48.939> a<00:01:48.970> good<00:01:49.149> idea<00:01:49.270> now<00:01:49.689> to<00:01:50.080> try<00:01:50.289> and

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
complete it's a good idea now to try and

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.020 
complete it's a good idea now to try and
put<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.590> handlebars<00:01:51.189> into<00:01:51.579> a<00:01:51.610> secure

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
they're not quite as wide so we want to

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.460

be conscious of space so I'm going to

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.399 
be conscious of space so I'm going to
take<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.679> handlebars<00:02:00.130> completely<00:02:01.200> away<00:02:02.200> from

the front of the stem and then hopefully

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.350 
the front of the stem and then hopefully
take<00:02:05.649> them<00:02:05.830> around<00:02:06.009> the<00:02:06.159> top<00:02:06.340> tube<00:02:09.360> don't

you've<00:02:12.760> taken<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.209> handlebars<00:02:13.720> away<00:02:13.959> from

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
you've taken the handlebars away from

you've taken the handlebars away from
the<00:02:14.260> stem<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:15.099> last<00:02:15.340> thing<00:02:15.580> you<00:02:15.700> want<00:02:15.849> to<00:02:15.910> do

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
the stem the last thing you want to do

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.970 
the stem the last thing you want to do
is<00:02:16.150> get<00:02:16.269> to<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.450> other<00:02:16.630> end<00:02:16.720> you'll<00:02:17.650> find<00:02:17.890> that

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
is get to the other end you'll find that

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.070 
is get to the other end you'll find that
you've<00:02:18.099> got<00:02:18.220> one<00:02:18.400> or<00:02:18.519> two<00:02:18.549> missing<00:02:19.060> Ashley<00:02:19.959> as

you've got one or two missing Ashley as
you<00:02:20.140> can<00:02:20.260> probably<00:02:20.440> see<00:02:20.620> already<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.340> idea<00:02:21.849> is

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
you can probably see already the idea is

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.360 
you can probably see already the idea is
we<00:02:22.989> want<00:02:23.019> to<00:02:23.260> try<00:02:23.440> and<00:02:23.470> protect<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.130> cover

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
we want to try and protect and cover

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.280 
we want to try and protect and cover
pretty<00:02:24.700> much<00:02:24.970> every<00:02:25.360> surface<00:02:25.630> of<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:25.959> frame

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
pretty much every surface of the frame

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.289 
pretty much every surface of the frame
Forks<00:02:26.799> and<00:02:27.069> everything<00:02:27.670> else<00:02:27.819> on<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.090> bike

Forks and everything else on the bike
before<00:02:29.019> it<00:02:29.349> goes<00:02:29.500> into<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:29.860> box<00:02:30.130> so<00:02:30.340> I'm<00:02:30.430> just

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
before it goes into the box so I'm just

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.580 
before it goes into the box so I'm just
going<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.700> put<00:02:30.880> some<00:02:31.030> bubble<00:02:31.239> wrap<00:02:31.590> around

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
going to put some bubble wrap around

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:40.630 
going to put some bubble wrap around
this<00:02:32.739> stem

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.820 

okay<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:41.700> want<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:41.940> get<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.270> bus<00:02:42.540> as<00:02:43.260> far<00:02:43.530> down

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
okay you want to get the bus as far down

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.950 
okay you want to get the bus as far down
this<00:02:44.100> way<00:02:44.340> as<00:02:44.460> possible<00:02:45.060> without<00:02:45.180> really

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
this way as possible without really

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.260 
this way as possible without really
bending<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.500> cables<00:02:46.980> too<00:02:47.220> much<00:02:47.460> if<00:02:47.970> at<00:02:48.120> all

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
bending the cables too much if at all

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.000 
bending the cables too much if at all
possible<00:02:48.330> because<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.410> course<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.740> gives<00:02:49.920> you

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
possible because of course it gives you

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.920 
possible because of course it gives you
more<00:02:50.220> room<00:02:50.280> overall<00:02:51.000> then<00:02:51.180> in<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.480> bike<00:02:51.660> books

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
more room overall then in the bike books

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.540 
more room overall then in the bike books
and<00:02:52.080> once<00:02:52.200> you've<00:02:52.350> got<00:02:52.440> them<00:02:52.530> in<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:53.400> position

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
and once you've got them in to position

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.930 
and once you've got them in to position
which<00:02:54.210> i<00:02:54.330> think<00:02:54.390> is<00:02:54.600> pretty<00:02:54.960> good<00:02:55.730> it's<00:02:56.730> time

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
which i think is pretty good it's time

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.130 
which i think is pretty good it's time
to<00:02:57.150> once<00:02:57.390> again<00:02:58.340> take<00:02:59.340> them<00:02:59.580> in<00:02:59.670> place<00:03:00.110> okay

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
to once again take them in place okay

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.080 
to once again take them in place okay
before<00:03:01.680> I<00:03:01.710> can<00:03:01.830> really<00:03:02.160> put<00:03:02.460> the<00:03:02.580> lagging<00:03:02.970> on

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
before I can really put the lagging on

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.390 
before I can really put the lagging on
the<00:03:03.510> rest<00:03:03.720> of<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.140> frame<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.890> forks<00:03:05.250> a

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
the rest of the frame and the forks a

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.190 
the rest of the frame and the forks a
pretty<00:03:05.730> much<00:03:05.970> need<00:03:06.270> to<00:03:06.300> take<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.780> wheel<00:03:06.990> out

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
pretty much need to take the wheel out

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.870 
pretty much need to take the wheel out
as<00:03:07.380> I<00:03:07.440> said<00:03:07.770> we've<00:03:07.950> already<00:03:08.190> put<00:03:08.520> it<00:03:08.580> down<00:03:08.730> to

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
as I said we've already put it down to

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.340 
as I said we've already put it down to
the<00:03:08.910> lowest<00:03:09.120> COAG<00:03:09.390> at<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.600> back<00:03:09.780> so<00:03:10.050> that

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
the lowest COAG at the back so that

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:34.510 
the lowest COAG at the back so that
should<00:03:10.530> be<00:03:10.560> pretty<00:03:10.830> easy

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.920 

all<00:03:35.520> right<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.730> next<00:03:35.970> thing<00:03:36.150> I'm<00:03:36.420> going<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.810> do

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
all right the next thing I'm going to do

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.410 
all right the next thing I'm going to do
is<00:03:37.110> to<00:03:37.260> take<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.620> rear<00:03:37.920> mech<00:03:38.190> off<00:03:38.400> again<00:03:38.820> being

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
is to take the rear mech off again being

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.120 
is to take the rear mech off again being
a<00:03:39.480> cardboard<00:03:39.840> box<00:03:40.200> there's<00:03:40.500> less<00:03:40.740> protection

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
a cardboard box there's less protection

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.040 
a cardboard box there's less protection
more<00:03:41.460> likelihood<00:03:41.940> of<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:42.180> getting<00:03:42.390> banged<00:03:42.660> and

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
more likelihood of it getting banged and

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.780 
more likelihood of it getting banged and
then<00:03:43.140> you<00:03:43.230> can<00:03:43.350> arrive<00:03:43.830> at<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.130> other<00:03:44.310> end

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
then you can arrive at the other end

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.710 
then you can arrive at the other end
we've<00:03:45.030> been<00:03:45.240> Trier<00:03:45.510> MEK<00:03:45.750> hang<00:03:45.960> up<00:03:46.130> maneuver<00:03:47.130> it

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
we've been Trier MEK hang up maneuver it

carbon seat post but the advantage is

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
where it pretty much fills the box it's

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.960 
where it pretty much fills the box it's
got<00:04:25.320> less<00:04:25.590> chance<00:04:25.620> of<00:04:26.040> rattling<00:04:26.460> about<00:04:28.970> right

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970
