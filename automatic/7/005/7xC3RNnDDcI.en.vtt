and<00:01:59.090> these<00:01:59.750> can<00:01:59.930> be<00:02:00.050> firm<00:02:00.229> naturally<00:02:00.800> but<00:02:01.159> but

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
and these can be firm naturally but but

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.399 
and these can be firm naturally but but
don't<00:02:02.270> bother<00:02:02.510> with<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:02.870> natural<00:02:03.229> way<00:02:03.350> so

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
don't bother with the natural way so

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.070 
don't bother with the natural way so
finally<00:02:03.920> there<00:02:04.220> are<00:02:04.280> much<00:02:04.580> better<00:02:04.850> ways<00:02:05.080> out

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
finally there are much better ways out

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.279 
finally there are much better ways out
there<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:06.710> things<00:02:07.580> such<00:02:07.790> as<00:02:08.000> salicylic<00:02:08.569> acid

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
there and things such as salicylic acid

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.699 
there and things such as salicylic acid
which<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:09.619> find<00:02:09.830> in<00:02:10.069> anti<00:02:10.549> acne<00:02:11.470> products<00:02:12.470> and

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
which you find in anti acne products and

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.370 
which you find in anti acne products and
also<00:02:12.860> glycolic<00:02:13.700> acid<00:02:14.209> now<00:02:14.720> for<00:02:14.959> me<00:02:15.110> I<00:02:15.319> don't

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
also glycolic acid now for me I don't

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.650 
also glycolic acid now for me I don't
have<00:02:15.709> acne<00:02:15.980> and<00:02:16.459> I<00:02:16.610> but<00:02:16.910> I<00:02:16.940> do<00:02:17.060> have<00:02:17.420> large

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
have acne and I but I do have large

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.020 
have acne and I but I do have large
pores<00:02:17.959> and<00:02:18.170> I<00:02:18.530> find<00:02:18.800> that<00:02:18.860> glycolic<00:02:19.490> acid<00:02:19.850> is

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
pores and I find that glycolic acid is

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.199 
pores and I find that glycolic acid is
my<00:02:20.569> favorite<00:02:20.990> way<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.170> cleanse<00:02:21.770> my<00:02:22.010> skin<00:02:22.069> and<00:02:22.520> I

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
my favorite way to cleanse my skin and I

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.750 
my favorite way to cleanse my skin and I
use<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.930> skin<00:02:24.319> the<00:02:24.680> facial<00:02:25.100> exfoliating

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
use the skin the facial exfoliating

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.300 
use the skin the facial exfoliating
cleanser<00:02:26.150> for<00:02:26.780> normal<00:02:27.140> skin<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:27.950> it's<00:02:28.220> a

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
cleanser for normal skin and it's a

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.059 
cleanser for normal skin and it's a
gentle<00:02:28.760> creamy<00:02:29.390> cleanser<00:02:29.540> but<00:02:30.380> it<00:02:30.560> contains

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
gentle creamy cleanser but it contains

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.730 
gentle creamy cleanser but it contains
probably<00:02:31.370> about<00:02:31.700> three<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.270> four<00:02:32.480> percent

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
probably about three to four percent

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.830 
probably about three to four percent
glycolic<00:02:33.740> acid<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.459> when<00:02:34.850> you<00:02:35.000> use<00:02:35.300> it<00:02:35.540> you'll

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
glycolic acid and when you use it you'll

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.110 
glycolic acid and when you use it you'll
find<00:02:36.140> that<00:02:36.470> literally<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.730> can

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
find that literally you can

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.180 
find that literally you can
your<00:02:38.270> face<00:02:38.569> looks<00:02:38.930> glowy<00:02:39.319> up<00:02:39.590> because<00:02:39.890> what<00:02:40.069> it

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
your face looks glowy up because what it

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.630 
your face looks glowy up because what it
does<00:02:40.340> is<00:02:40.580> it<00:02:40.730> breaks<00:02:41.090> down<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:42.250> like<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.430> lip

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
does is it breaks down the like the lip

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.540 
does is it breaks down the like the lip
the<00:02:44.030> lipid<00:02:44.480> bond<00:02:44.750> so<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.200> oily<00:02:45.530> bones<00:02:45.800> of<00:02:46.040> your

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
the lipid bond so the oily bones of your

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.190 
the lipid bond so the oily bones of your
dead<00:02:46.790> skin<00:02:46.970> themselves<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:47.750> helps<00:02:48.050> to

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
dead skin themselves and it helps to

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.949 
dead skin themselves and it helps to
resurface<00:02:48.560> them<00:02:49.010> now<00:02:49.610> I<00:02:49.910> probably<00:02:50.240> do<00:02:50.480> that<00:02:50.690> I

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
resurface them now I probably do that I

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.800 
resurface them now I probably do that I
use<00:02:51.680> this<00:02:51.920> probably<00:02:52.220> every<00:02:52.670> other<00:02:52.880> day<00:02:53.480> and

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
use this probably every other day and

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.920 
use this probably every other day and

with anything with skin problems never
overdo<00:02:57.380> it<00:02:57.530> never<00:02:57.920> try<00:02:58.160> to<00:02:58.220> do<00:02:58.459> it<00:02:58.550> like<00:02:58.580> every

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
overdo it never try to do it like every

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.820 
overdo it never try to do it like every
day<00:02:59.209> twice<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.540> day<00:02:59.840> that<00:03:00.230> you're<00:03:00.410> just<00:03:00.620> going

to<00:03:00.920> exacerbate<00:03:01.370> any<00:03:01.849> skin<00:03:02.270> problem<00:03:02.300> that<00:03:02.780> you

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
to exacerbate any skin problem that you

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.760 
to exacerbate any skin problem that you
have<00:03:03.140> so<00:03:03.800> on<00:03:04.550> the<00:03:04.640> off<00:03:04.760> days<00:03:05.060> I<00:03:05.360> use<00:03:05.900> a<00:03:06.230> gentle

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
have so on the off days I use a gentle

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.500 
have so on the off days I use a gentle
skin<00:03:07.220> cleanser<00:03:07.610> and<00:03:07.849> I<00:03:07.910> am<00:03:08.060> using<00:03:08.270> the

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
skin cleanser and I am using the

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.750 
skin cleanser and I am using the
Cetaphil<00:03:09.020> at<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.739> moment<00:03:10.099> which<00:03:10.310> I<00:03:10.489> think

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
Cetaphil at the moment which I think

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.580 
Cetaphil at the moment which I think
it's<00:03:10.910> okay<00:03:11.330> it's<00:03:11.690> alright<00:03:11.959> it<00:03:12.140> just<00:03:12.170> doesn't

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
it's okay it's alright it just doesn't

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.370 
it's okay it's alright it just doesn't
give<00:03:12.709> me<00:03:12.830> much<00:03:13.040> but<00:03:13.610> I<00:03:14.390> think<00:03:14.660> it's<00:03:15.020> nice<00:03:15.170> and

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
give me much but I think it's nice and

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.170 
give me much but I think it's nice and
gentle<00:03:15.680> when<00:03:16.160> combined<00:03:16.550> with<00:03:16.730> this<00:03:16.880> and<00:03:17.120> this

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
gentle when combined with this and this

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.860 
gentle when combined with this and this
is<00:03:17.330> very<00:03:17.569> very<00:03:17.810> creamy<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:19.520> again<00:03:20.360> I<00:03:20.569> think

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
is very very creamy so again I think

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.589 
is very very creamy so again I think
when<00:03:21.170> it<00:03:21.290> comes<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.800> really-really

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
when it comes to really-really

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.839 
when it comes to really-really
exfoliating<00:03:23.599> the<00:03:23.630> skin<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:24.560> can<00:03:24.770> use

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
exfoliating the skin you can use

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.760 
exfoliating the skin you can use
Luther's<00:03:25.849> or<00:03:26.209> you<00:03:26.390> can<00:03:26.569> use<00:03:26.780> like<00:03:26.900> different

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
Luther's or you can use like different

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.490 
Luther's or you can use like different
kind<00:03:27.980> of<00:03:28.069> manual<00:03:28.670> exfoliation<00:03:28.880> but<00:03:29.840> I<00:03:29.989> find

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
kind of manual exfoliation but I find

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.250 
kind of manual exfoliation but I find
that<00:03:30.620> I<00:03:30.860> don't<00:03:31.190> like<00:03:31.430> using<00:03:32.150> like<00:03:32.450> scrubs<00:03:32.989> to

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
that I don't like using like scrubs to

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.170 
that I don't like using like scrubs to
clear<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.620> skin<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.190> actually<00:03:34.489> you<00:03:34.760> end<00:03:35.000> up

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
clear the skin and actually you end up

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.880 
clear the skin and actually you end up
kind<00:03:35.360> of<00:03:35.510> scratching<00:03:36.080> your<00:03:36.290> skin<00:03:36.620> and

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
kind of scratching your skin and

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.160 
kind of scratching your skin and
actually<00:03:37.400> chemical<00:03:38.270> exfoliation<00:03:38.720> is

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
actually chemical exfoliation is

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.440 
actually chemical exfoliation is
probably<00:03:39.560> better<00:03:39.860> in<00:03:40.250> my<00:03:40.459> opinion<00:03:40.580> and<00:03:41.090> manual

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
probably better in my opinion and manual

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.660 
probably better in my opinion and manual
exfoliation<00:03:41.629> you<00:03:42.440> can<00:03:42.620> then<00:03:42.770> give<00:03:43.129> yourself<00:03:43.280> a

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
exfoliation you can then give yourself a

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.210 
exfoliation you can then give yourself a
deep<00:03:44.000> cleanse<00:03:44.450> clay<00:03:45.200> masks<00:03:45.620> are<00:03:45.739> really

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
deep cleanse clay masks are really

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.369 
deep cleanse clay masks are really
really<00:03:46.520> great<00:03:46.910> at<00:03:47.150> just<00:03:47.360> pulling<00:03:47.959> out<00:03:48.170> the

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
really great at just pulling out the

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.130 
really great at just pulling out the
impurities<00:03:49.160> and<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:49.610> oils<00:03:50.060> and<00:03:50.209> like<00:03:50.959> the

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
impurities and the oils and like the

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.380 
impurities and the oils and like the
things<00:03:51.379> that<00:03:51.560> clog<00:03:51.920> your<00:03:52.310> pores<00:03:52.700> so<00:03:53.239> when

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
your skin now I bet if you did that

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.499 
your skin now I bet if you did that
regularly<00:05:40.650> you<00:05:40.860> genuinely<00:05:41.490> start<00:05:42.029> seeing<00:05:42.330> a

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509 
regularly you genuinely start seeing a

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.180 
regularly you genuinely start seeing a
difference<00:05:42.539> in<00:05:43.080> your<00:05:43.199> skin<00:05:43.259> the<00:05:43.680> key<00:05:43.919> thing

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
difference in your skin the key thing

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.439 
difference in your skin the key thing
that<00:05:44.339> I<00:05:44.370> really<00:05:44.699> feel<00:05:44.909> that<00:05:45.089> makes<00:05:45.300> the

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
that I really feel that makes the

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.309 
that I really feel that makes the
difference<00:05:45.839> in<00:05:46.050> skin<00:05:46.560> is<00:05:47.159> the<00:05:47.520> aah<00:05:48.029> A's<00:05:48.330> or<00:05:48.690> the

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:49.319 
difference in skin is the aah A's or the

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:52.519 
difference in skin is the aah A's or the
glycolic<00:05:49.860> acid<00:05:50.310> it<00:05:50.520> really<00:05:51.000> does<00:05:51.270> work<00:05:51.779> like

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:52.529 
glycolic acid it really does work like

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:54.409 
glycolic acid it really does work like
you<00:05:53.009> will<00:05:53.159> not<00:05:53.370> believe<00:05:53.580> and<00:05:53.969> if<00:05:54.300> you're

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
you will not believe and if you're

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:55.999 
you will not believe and if you're
someone<00:05:54.659> who's<00:05:54.839> got<00:05:54.990> really<00:05:55.289> extreme<00:05:55.650> skin

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:56.009 
someone who's got really extreme skin

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:57.829 
someone who's got really extreme skin
problems<00:05:56.729> then<00:05:56.909> you<00:05:56.939> can<00:05:57.120> always<00:05:57.240> go<00:05:57.509> and<00:05:57.539> get

00:05:57.829 --> 00:05:57.839 
problems then you can always go and get

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:00.230 
problems then you can always go and get
a<00:05:58.020> skin<00:05:58.469> peel<00:05:58.710> people<00:05:59.189> do<00:05:59.370> do<00:05:59.580> them<00:05:59.729> home<00:06:00.029> I

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
a skin peel people do do them home I

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.909 
a skin peel people do do them home I
wouldn't<00:06:00.689> recommend<00:06:00.990> doing<00:06:01.439> them<00:06:01.620> at<00:06:01.740> home

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
wouldn't recommend doing them at home

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.219 
wouldn't recommend doing them at home
I'll<00:06:02.129> probably<00:06:02.339> just<00:06:02.669> go<00:06:02.879> to<00:06:03.419> dermatologist

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:04.229 
I'll probably just go to dermatologist

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:05.899 
I'll probably just go to dermatologist
to<00:06:04.710> get<00:06:04.830> them<00:06:05.009> done<00:06:05.159> but<00:06:05.370> it<00:06:05.460> can<00:06:05.580> be<00:06:05.729> quite

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:05.909 
to get them done but it can be quite

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:09.019 
to get them done but it can be quite
pricey<00:06:06.210> some<00:06:06.960> guys<00:06:07.139> I<00:06:07.349> think<00:06:07.469> that<00:06:08.219> is<00:06:08.430> it<00:06:08.699> and

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:09.029 
pricey some guys I think that is it and

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:11.119 
pricey some guys I think that is it and
I'd<00:06:09.449> say<00:06:09.810> that<00:06:09.839> this<00:06:10.169> is<00:06:10.349> a<00:06:10.379> journey<00:06:10.710> that<00:06:10.860> I've

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:11.129 
I'd say that this is a journey that I've

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:13.040 
I'd say that this is a journey that I've
been<00:06:11.159> on<00:06:11.370> for<00:06:11.699> years<00:06:11.909> and<00:06:12.389> actually<00:06:12.629> when<00:06:12.960> I

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
been on for years and actually when I

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.079 
been on for years and actually when I
physically<00:06:13.650> seen<00:06:13.919> my<00:06:14.189> skin<00:06:14.460> changing<00:06:14.969> and

00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:15.089 
physically seen my skin changing and

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:18.409 
physically seen my skin changing and
improving<00:06:15.180> I<00:06:15.930> have<00:06:16.500> to<00:06:16.680> share<00:06:16.889> what<00:06:17.580> I<00:06:17.610> use<00:06:18.089> and

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
improving I have to share what I use and

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:20.990 
improving I have to share what I use and
what<00:06:19.080> works<00:06:19.770> and<00:06:20.069> a<00:06:20.430> lot<00:06:20.580> of<00:06:20.669> it<00:06:20.819> is<00:06:20.969> that

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
what works and a lot of it is that

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.059 
what works and a lot of it is that
science<00:06:21.569> base<00:06:21.839> as<00:06:22.139> well<00:06:22.349> I'm<00:06:22.589> not<00:06:22.740> just<00:06:22.979> a

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:23.069 
science base as well I'm not just a

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:24.920 
science base as well I'm not just a
product<00:06:23.310> junkie<00:06:23.610> I<00:06:23.909> tried<00:06:24.180> to<00:06:24.330> work<00:06:24.509> out<00:06:24.689> what

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
product junkie I tried to work out what

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.420 
product junkie I tried to work out what
actually<00:06:25.439> works<00:06:25.710> because<00:06:25.919> there's<00:06:26.099> a<00:06:26.219> lot<00:06:26.400> of

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
actually works because there's a lot of

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.249 
actually works because there's a lot of
stuff<00:06:26.669> on<00:06:26.789> the<00:06:26.879> market<00:06:27.060> that<00:06:27.659> tells<00:06:27.960> you<00:06:28.110> it

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:28.259 
stuff on the market that tells you it

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:29.809 
stuff on the market that tells you it
does<00:06:28.409> this<00:06:28.620> it<00:06:28.770> doesn't<00:06:29.069> do<00:06:29.189> anything<00:06:29.460> it

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:29.819 
does this it doesn't do anything it

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:31.969 
does this it doesn't do anything it
doesn't<00:06:30.270> actually<00:06:30.449> contain<00:06:31.080> any<00:06:31.589> of<00:06:31.770> the

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979 
doesn't actually contain any of the

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:33.439 
doesn't actually contain any of the
things<00:06:32.159> that<00:06:32.339> are<00:06:32.520> actually<00:06:32.610> gonna<00:06:32.939> help<00:06:33.149> you
