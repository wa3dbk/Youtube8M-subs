easier backing longer trailer it's just

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.460 
easier backing longer trailer it's just
easier<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.150> back<00:02:28.390> then<00:02:28.599> a<00:02:28.629> shorter<00:02:29.019> a<00:02:29.049> shorter

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
easier to back then a shorter a shorter

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.869 
easier to back then a shorter a shorter
