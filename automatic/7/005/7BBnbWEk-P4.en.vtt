could<00:00:23.039> have<00:00:23.340> been<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.490> variant<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.000> mean<00:00:24.150> we

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
could have been a variant I mean we

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.500 
could have been a variant I mean we
heard<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.130> like<00:00:26.130> galaxies<00:00:26.849> in

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
heard of this and like galaxies in

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.980 
heard of this and like galaxies in
methyl<00:00:28.080> aluminum<00:00:28.429> galaxy<00:00:29.429> device<00:00:29.900> but<00:00:30.900> it

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
methyl aluminum galaxy device but it

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.450 
methyl aluminum galaxy device but it
can't<00:00:31.170> feels<00:00:31.410> now<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.830> it's<00:00:31.920> not<00:00:32.040> gonna<00:00:32.219> come

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
can't feels now that it's not gonna come

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.340

because<00:00:32.820> we<00:00:33.030> now<00:00:33.180> have<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.660> new<00:00:33.899> one<00:00:34.110> over

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
because we now have this new one over

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.670 
because we now have this new one over
here<00:00:34.530> which<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.480> galaxy<00:00:36.480> s5<00:00:36.809> lte-advanced

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
here which is a galaxy s5 lte-advanced

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.400 
here which is a galaxy s5 lte-advanced
variant<00:00:38.129> for<00:00:38.340> South<00:00:38.550> Korea<00:00:39.079> so<00:00:40.079> basically

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
variant for South Korea so basically

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.360 
variant for South Korea so basically
this<00:00:40.649> device<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.399> going<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.180> compact<00:00:43.370> without

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
this device is going to compact without

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.660 
this device is going to compact without
the<00:00:44.640> advanced<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.780> default<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.350> LTE<00:00:46.739> out

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
the advanced so the default is LTE out

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.510 
the advanced so the default is LTE out
there<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.329> South<00:00:48.960> Korea<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.440> then<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.340> also

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
there in South Korea and then it also

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.840 
there in South Korea and then it also
become<00:00:50.910> its<00:00:51.090> new<00:00:51.239> Snapdragon<00:00:51.570> 805<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:53.070> it

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
become its new Snapdragon 805 and it

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.650 
become its new Snapdragon 805 and it
will<00:00:54.660> as<00:00:54.809> well<00:00:55.110> have<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.770> latest<00:00:56.660> Snapdragon

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.080 
then we do have this big thing about
this<00:01:27.869> phone<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:28.350> gonna<00:01:28.470> come<00:01:28.820> with<00:01:29.820> a

this phone that it's gonna come with a
qHD<00:01:30.990> display<00:01:31.409> that's<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> resolution<00:01:33.180> of

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
qHD display that's like a resolution of

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.030 
qHD display that's like a resolution of
2560<00:01:33.930> X<00:01:34.049> 1440<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:34.740> same<00:01:34.950> as<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.189> brand<00:01:35.759> new<00:01:35.939> LG<00:01:36.150> g3

2560 X 1440 so same as a brand new LG g3

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.280 
2560 X 1440 so same as a brand new LG g3
which<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.250> pretty<00:01:38.610> pretty<00:01:38.850> nice<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.570> think<00:01:40.140> that

personally if you ask me qh display

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.490 
personally if you ask me qh display
that's<00:01:45.509> gonna<00:01:45.630> be<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.869> interesting<00:01:46.110> part

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
that's gonna be the interesting part

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.530 
that's gonna be the interesting part
separately<00:01:47.100> 805<00:01:47.880> that's<00:01:48.119> also<00:01:48.329> gonna<00:01:48.450> be

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
separately 805 that's also gonna be

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.240 
separately 805 that's also gonna be
interesting<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.110> then<00:01:49.500> again<00:01:49.619> remember<00:01:50.130> this

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
interesting but then again remember this

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.550 
interesting but then again remember this
is<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.659> new<00:01:52.049> chips<00:01:52.380> and

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
is so this is like so new chips and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.770 
is so this is like so new chips and
stuff<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.189> it's<00:01:53.850> probably<00:01:54.450> no

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
stuff like that so it's probably no

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.800 
stuff like that so it's probably no
single<00:01:55.710> game<00:01:56.070> out<00:01:56.310> there<00:01:56.549> that's<00:01:56.729> that's<00:01:57.240> you

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
single game out there that's that's you

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.380 
single game out there that's that's you
know<00:01:57.930> optimized<00:01:58.530> for<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.130> it's<00:02:00.030> almost<00:02:00.240> a

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
know optimized for it so it's almost a

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.520 
know optimized for it so it's almost a
little<00:02:00.420> bit<00:02:00.630> pointless

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
little bit pointless

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.800 
little bit pointless
-<00:02:02.070> probably<00:02:02.340> have<00:02:02.580> it<00:02:02.700> right<00:02:02.850> now<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.390> does

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
- probably have it right now it does

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.390 
- probably have it right now it does
seem<00:02:03.840> like<00:02:04.080> it<00:02:04.380> comes<00:02:04.650> second<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.160> the<00:02:05.220> same

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
seem like it comes second in the same

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.340 
seem like it comes second in the same
material<00:02:06.090> exactly<00:02:06.510> the<00:02:06.570> same<00:02:06.720> four<00:02:06.960> factor

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
material exactly the same four factor

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.700 
material exactly the same four factor
steel<00:02:08.009> like<00:02:08.250> waterproof<00:02:08.940> as<00:02:09.149> earlier<00:02:09.840> Galaxy

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
steel like waterproof as earlier Galaxy

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.540 
steel like waterproof as earlier Galaxy
devices<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:13.190> that's<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.280> little<00:02:14.430> bit

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
devices so that is that's a little bit

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.800 
devices so that is that's a little bit
boring<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:14.970> also<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.270> it's<00:02:15.390> only<00:02:15.570> what<00:02:15.780> my

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
boring and also that it's only what my

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.510 
boring and also that it's only what my
software<00:02:16.200> right<00:02:16.470> now<00:02:16.500> it's<00:02:17.130> probably<00:02:17.430> gonna

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
software right now it's probably gonna

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.940 
software right now it's probably gonna
come<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:18.030> Europe<00:02:18.420> with<00:02:18.450> like<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.410> brand<00:02:19.709> name

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
come to Europe with like a brand name

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.190 
come to Europe with like a brand name
like<00:02:20.240> Galaxy<00:02:21.240> S<00:02:21.300> five<00:02:21.420> plus<00:02:22.280> or<00:02:23.510> or<00:02:24.510> something

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
like Galaxy S five plus or or something

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.060 
like Galaxy S five plus or or something
like<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.790> in<00:02:26.790> in<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.270> October<00:02:27.660> time<00:02:27.810> frame

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
like that in in the October time frame

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.860 
like that in in the October time frame
it's<00:02:29.070> not<00:02:29.220> really<00:02:29.400> it's<00:02:29.550> on<00:02:29.640> five<00:02:29.880> in<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.690> mean

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
it's not really it's on five in I mean

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.630 
it's not really it's on five in I mean
October<00:02:31.200> time<00:02:31.350> frame<00:02:31.410> that's<00:02:31.770> a<00:02:32.040> few<00:02:32.250> months

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
October time frame that's a few months

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.500 
October time frame that's a few months
down<00:02:32.940> line<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:34.050> definitely<00:02:34.709> is<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:36.000> little

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
down line so that definitely is a little

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.070 
down line so that definitely is a little
bit<00:02:36.660> boring

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
bit boring

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.050 
bit boring
it's<00:02:37.470> 5.1<00:02:37.950> inch<00:02:38.100> tall<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:38.610> it's<00:02:38.820> probably

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
it's 5.1 inch tall so it's probably

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.310 
it's 5.1 inch tall so it's probably
going<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.239> be<00:02:39.300> that<00:02:39.620> it<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:40.650> most<00:02:41.100> pixel<00:02:42.320> has

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
going to be that it is most pixel has

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.680 
going to be that it is most pixel has
the<00:02:43.470> moment<00:02:43.739> amount<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.220> pixels<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.330> screen

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
the moment amount of pixels the screen

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.860 
the moment amount of pixels the screen
and<00:02:46.160> because<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.250> 5.1<00:02:47.670> inch<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.090> gala<00:02:48.270> LG<00:02:48.660> g3

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
and because the 5.1 inch the gala LG g3

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.760 
and because the 5.1 inch the gala LG g3
it<00:02:49.290> also<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.680> quad<00:02:49.920> HD<00:02:49.950> display<00:02:50.340> is<00:02:51.770> it's

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
it also is a quad HD display is it's

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.360 
it also is a quad HD display is it's
like<00:02:53.040> 5.5<00:02:53.910> inch<00:02:54.209> if<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.600> can't<00:02:54.870> recall<00:02:55.050> so<00:02:55.650> it's

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
like 5.5 inch if I can't recall so it's

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.780 
like 5.5 inch if I can't recall so it's
gonna<00:02:56.520> be<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.760> pretty<00:02:57.030> intense<00:02:57.390> screen<00:02:58.610> to<00:02:59.610> see

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
gonna be a pretty intense screen to see

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.890 
gonna be a pretty intense screen to see
a<00:02:59.820> double<00:03:00.150> galaxy's<00:03:01.130> yeah<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.340> kind<00:03:02.580> of<00:03:02.640> sucks
