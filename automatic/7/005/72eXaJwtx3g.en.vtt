00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
the leather I prefer the clip because

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.780 
the leather I prefer the clip because
instead<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.410> having<00:01:16.770> other<00:01:17.130> thing<00:01:17.370> in<00:01:17.490> blades

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
instead of having other thing in blades

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.410 
instead of having other thing in blades
flatten<00:01:18.420> all<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.870> place<00:01:19.730> that's<00:01:20.730> just<00:01:20.970> clipped

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
flatten all of place that's just clipped

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.470 
flatten all of place that's just clipped
let's<00:01:22.040> stay<00:01:23.040> here<00:01:23.370> stays<00:01:23.790> there<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:26.360> so<00:01:27.360> we

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
let's stay here stays there and so we

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.590 
let's stay here stays there and so we
act<00:01:27.630> cheap<00:01:28.290> plastic<00:01:28.550> certainly<00:01:29.550> but<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.480> does

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
act cheap plastic certainly but it does

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.830 
act cheap plastic certainly but it does
this<00:01:30.720> job<00:01:31.050> it<00:01:31.530> does<00:01:31.800> it<00:01:31.950> very<00:01:31.980> well<00:01:32.690> so<00:01:33.690> now

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
this job it does it very well so now

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.090 
this job it does it very well so now
we're<00:01:33.990> going<00:01:34.080> to<00:01:34.170> get<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.560> actual<00:01:34.800> plate

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
we're going to get to the actual plate

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.430 
we're going to get to the actual plate
and<00:01:36.200> so<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.380> an<00:01:37.500> 8<00:01:37.680> 40<00:01:38.070> mg<00:01:38.280> m<00:01:39.200> moura<00:01:40.200> knife

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
and so it's an 8 40 mg m moura knife

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.270 
and so it's an 8 40 mg m moura knife
which<00:01:40.710> stands<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.280> mg<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.900> mostly<00:01:42.900> green<00:01:43.280> if

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
which stands the mg is mostly green if

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.620 
which stands the mg is mostly green if
you<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.640> get<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:44.940> stainless<00:01:45.180> steel<00:01:45.450> or

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
you can get it in stainless steel or

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.230 
you can get it in stainless steel or
carbon<00:01:46.260> steel<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.670> carbon<00:01:48.030> steel

inches<00:03:11.420> that<00:03:12.420> make<00:03:12.569> sense<00:03:14.870> like<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.989> tank

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
inches that make sense like the tank

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.270 
inches that make sense like the tank
it's<00:03:17.459> gone<00:03:17.639> back<00:03:17.909> stop<00:03:18.780> loss<00:03:18.989> here<00:03:19.319> not<00:03:20.159> only

it's gone back stop loss here not only

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.879 
it's gone back stop loss here not only
that's<00:03:20.489> a<00:03:20.609> weak<00:03:20.790> point<00:03:21.079> but<00:03:22.079> it's<00:03:22.169> not<00:03:22.349> because

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
that's a weak point but it's not because

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:25.550 
that's a weak point but it's not because
fluid<00:03:23.730> is<00:03:23.849> a<00:03:23.940> high-quality<00:03:24.120> blade<00:03:24.629> so<00:03:25.379> it's

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
fluid is a high-quality blade so it's

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.039 
fluid is a high-quality blade so it's
not<00:03:25.709> a<00:03:25.889> weak<00:03:26.250> point<00:03:26.430> instead<00:03:26.879> of<00:03:26.910> being<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.840> full

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
tank in the blade ends down there it

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.930
