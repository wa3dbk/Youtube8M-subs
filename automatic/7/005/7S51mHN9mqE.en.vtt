00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
they definitely could have done a better

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.280 
they definitely could have done a better
work<00:01:26.070> there<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:27.210> back<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.479> definitely<00:01:28.259> very

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290

very<00:01:28.530> clean<00:01:29.070> though<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.670> they<00:01:30.090> also<00:01:30.240> have

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
very clean though and they also have

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.179 
very clean though and they also have
another<00:01:30.689> variant<00:01:31.170> which<00:01:31.710> another<00:01:31.979> material

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
another variant which another material

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.069 
another variant which another material
on<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.729> back<00:01:32.880> which<00:01:33.150> actually<00:01:33.630> think<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.049> would

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
on the back which actually think I would

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.330 
on the back which actually think I would
enjoy<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.560> little<00:01:34.770> bit<00:01:34.860> more<00:01:35.040> like<00:01:35.250> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
enjoy a little bit more like the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.270 
enjoy a little bit more like the
blackberry<00:01:35.790> but<00:01:36.000> i<00:01:36.030> do<00:01:36.180> like<00:01:36.710> white<00:01:37.710> phones<00:01:38.040> as

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
blackberry but i do like white phones as

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.109 
blackberry but i do like white phones as
you<00:01:38.400> can<00:01:38.490> see<00:01:38.790> here<00:01:39.320> also<00:01:40.320> i<00:01:40.979> won't<00:01:41.700> think<00:01:41.850> that

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
you can see here also i won't think that

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.149 
you can see here also i won't think that
a<00:01:42.150> quick<00:01:42.329> analysis<00:01:42.780> was<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.710> had<00:01:43.770> become

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
a quick analysis was that it had become

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.359 
a quick analysis was that it had become
they<00:01:44.759> come<00:01:45.000> with<00:01:45.180> horrible<00:01:45.509> wallpapers<00:01:46.220> and<00:01:47.220> i

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
they come with horrible wallpapers and i

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.289 
they come with horrible wallpapers and i
also<00:01:47.579> don't<00:01:47.939> think<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.399> use<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.549> icons<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
also don't think the use the icons the

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.630 
also don't think the use the icons the
stork<00:01:51.869> icon<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.439> i<00:01:52.470> don't<00:01:52.619> think<00:01:52.860> they<00:01:53.100> look

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
stork icon so i don't think they look

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.399 
stork icon so i don't think they look
that<00:01:53.880> impressive<00:01:54.060> but<00:01:54.630> then<00:01:54.840> again<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.259> can

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
that impressive but then again you can

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.280 
that impressive but then again you can
change<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.829> UI<00:01:56.040> look<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.610> lot<00:01:57.149> in<00:01:57.509> android<00:01:57.990> and

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
change the UI look a lot in android and

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.740 
change the UI look a lot in android and
then<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.860> also<00:01:58.979> have<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.399> like<00:01:59.670> weird<00:02:00.180> thing

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.980 
then you also have this like weird thing
here<00:02:00.990> now<00:02:01.200> like<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.340> drawing<00:02:02.640> thing<00:02:02.990> doesn't

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990
