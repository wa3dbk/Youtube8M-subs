what<00:00:21.210> about<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.449> different<00:00:22.080> inversions<00:00:23.210> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
what about a different inversions the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.779 
what about a different inversions the
name<00:00:24.420> flat<00:00:24.720> minor<00:00:25.050> more<00:00:25.980> guess<00:00:26.189> what<00:00:26.460> it's<00:00:26.730> the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
name flat minor more guess what it's the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.820 
name flat minor more guess what it's the
same<00:00:26.970> thing<00:00:27.029> still<00:00:27.570> one<00:00:27.960> note<00:00:28.199> moving<00:00:28.650> from

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
same thing still one note moving from

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.640 
same thing still one note moving from
the<00:00:28.949> minor<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.849> dominant<00:00:30.480> but<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.410> note

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
the minor to the dominant but the note

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.459 
the minor to the dominant but the note
is<00:00:31.920> not<00:00:32.189> right<00:00:32.790> up<00:00:32.940> here<00:00:33.239> it's<00:00:33.480> not<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.870> second

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
is not right up here it's not the second

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.530 
is not right up here it's not the second
fun<00:00:34.680> for<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.190> top<00:00:35.460> instead<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.390> bottom

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
fun for the top instead of the bottom

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.900 
fun for the top instead of the bottom
note<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.469> what<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.010> bottom<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:38.760> is

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
note but what is that bottom of this is

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.220 
note but what is that bottom of this is
a<00:00:38.940> different<00:00:39.360> inversion<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
a different inversion this is the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.440 
a different inversion this is the
seventh<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> seventh<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.120> minor

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
seventh so the seventh of the minor

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.279 
seventh so the seventh of the minor
chord<00:00:42.920> resolves<00:00:43.920> down<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.460> third<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.289> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
chord resolves down to the third of the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.180 
chord resolves down to the third of the
D<00:00:47.010> flat<00:00:47.219> 7<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.210> stays<00:00:49.010> while<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
D flat 7 and in that stays while the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.779 
D flat 7 and in that stays while the
other<00:00:50.219> three<00:00:50.640> move<00:00:51.300> down<00:00:51.539> right<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:53.219> let's<00:00:53.579> do

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
other three move down right so let's do

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.729 
other three move down right so let's do
something<00:00:54.329> easier<00:00:54.899> right<00:00:55.170> let's<00:00:55.410> forget

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
something easier right let's forget

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.279 
something easier right let's forget

with common tones to move chords quickly
with<00:02:15.860> this<00:02:16.040> work<00:02:16.370> with<00:02:17.000> shell<00:02:17.299> chords<00:02:17.780> to

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
with this work with shell chords to

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.190 
with this work with shell chords to
absolutely<00:02:19.250> all<00:02:19.790> right<00:02:19.970> so<00:02:20.330> let's<00:02:20.780> say<00:02:20.989> I<00:02:21.049> take

absolutely all right so let's say I take
a<00:02:21.260> see<00:02:21.560> minor<00:02:21.799> 7<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:22.519> I'm<00:02:22.670> going<00:02:22.819> to<00:02:22.879> go<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.030> my

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
a see minor 7 and I'm going to go to my

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.949 
a see minor 7 and I'm going to go to my
F<00:02:23.599> right<00:02:24.440> so<00:02:24.860> now<00:02:24.980> when<00:02:25.220> I<00:02:25.250> go<00:02:25.340> from<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.269> sea<00:02:26.629> to

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
F right so now when I go from a sea to

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.069 
F right so now when I go from a sea to
an<00:02:27.079> F<00:02:27.260> anytime<00:02:27.829> I<00:02:27.860> have<00:02:28.159> that<00:02:28.370> like<00:02:28.579> 25<00:02:29.540> or<00:02:29.900> that

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
an F anytime I have that like 25 or that

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.740 
an F anytime I have that like 25 or that
dominant<00:02:30.709> motion<00:02:31.220> but<00:02:31.670> more<00:02:31.940> basically<00:02:32.390> going

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
dominant motion but more basically going

up a fifth I'm trying up on fourth down

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.020 
up a fifth I'm trying up on fourth down

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
but I have that motion if I go from like

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.360 
but I have that motion if I go from like
ac72<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:44.030> f7<00:02:44.660> well<00:02:45.410> I'm<00:02:45.470> not<00:02:45.590> going<00:02:45.709> to<00:02:45.799> go<00:02:45.950> see

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
ac72 and f7 well I'm not going to go see

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.979 
ac72 and f7 well I'm not going to go see
summon<00:02:46.670> up<00:02:46.819> to<00:02:46.940> f7<00:02:47.359> I'm<00:02:47.510> not<00:02:47.629> going<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:47.840> do<00:02:47.959> that

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
summon up to f7 I'm not going to do that

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.559 
summon up to f7 I'm not going to do that
jump<00:02:48.500> is<00:02:49.010> that's<00:02:49.220> not<00:02:49.400> really<00:02:49.760> good<00:02:50.000> voice<00:02:50.299> Lee

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
jump is that's not really good voice Lee

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.199 
jump is that's not really good voice Lee
instead<00:02:51.230> I<00:02:51.260> place<00:02:51.590> c7<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.670> go<00:02:52.819> down<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.030> the

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
instead I place c7 and I go down to the

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.630 
instead I place c7 and I go down to the
root<00:02:53.569> and<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:53.989> third<00:02:54.290> of<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.859> f<00:02:55.010> but<00:02:55.549> again

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
root and the third of the f but again

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.789 
root and the third of the f but again
look<00:02:55.970> at<00:02:56.000> how<00:02:56.209> easy<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.840> is<00:02:56.870> see<00:02:57.440> how<00:02:57.560> that's

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
look at how easy that is see how that's

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.119 
look at how easy that is see how that's
the<00:02:58.489> seventh<00:02:59.000> of<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.150> sea<00:02:59.510> just<00:03:00.049> slides<00:03:00.530> down

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
the seventh of the sea just slides down

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.210 
the seventh of the sea just slides down
to<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.519> third<00:03:02.060> of<00:03:02.239> the<00:03:02.959> f<00:03:03.109> now<00:03:03.890> it's<00:03:04.040> not<00:03:04.190> a

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
to the third of the f now it's not a

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.940 
to the third of the f now it's not a
common<00:03:04.670> tone<00:03:05.120> but<00:03:05.659> again<00:03:05.989> in<00:03:06.230> my<00:03:06.500> mind<00:03:06.799> I'm

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
common tone but again in my mind I'm

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.460 
common tone but again in my mind I'm
thinking<00:03:06.980> oh<00:03:07.370> it's<00:03:07.700> just<00:03:07.940> an<00:03:08.060> easy<00:03:08.390> slide<00:03:09.049> down

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
thinking oh it's just an easy slide down

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.649 
thinking oh it's just an easy slide down
by<00:03:09.739> a<00:03:09.769> half<00:03:10.099> step<00:03:10.129> and<00:03:10.489> believe<00:03:11.299> it<00:03:11.420> or<00:03:11.510> not

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:11.659 
by a half step and believe it or not

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.879 
by a half step and believe it or not
that<00:03:12.379> trick<00:03:13.130> all<00:03:13.730> right<00:03:13.940> is<00:03:14.150> able<00:03:15.019> to<00:03:15.169> is<00:03:15.680> able

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:15.889 
that trick all right is able to is able

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:18.309 
that trick all right is able to is able
to<00:03:16.130> help<00:03:16.340> you<00:03:16.489> get<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:16.819> that<00:03:17.060> root<00:03:17.569> 3<00:03:17.959> chord

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
to help you get to that root 3 chord

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.479 
to help you get to that root 3 chord
voicing<00:03:18.799> really<00:03:19.340> quickly<00:03:19.700> so<00:03:19.849> you<00:03:20.030> go<00:03:21.489> you

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
voicing really quickly so you go you

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.280 
voicing really quickly so you go you
know<00:03:22.609> it<00:03:22.700> sees<00:03:22.910> how<00:03:23.090> I<00:03:23.120> can<00:03:23.870> get<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.169> those

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
know it sees how I can get to those

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.680 
know it sees how I can get to those
those<00:03:24.950> shells<00:03:25.579> a<00:03:25.760> lot<00:03:25.910> faster<00:03:28.389> right<00:03:29.389> because

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
those shells a lot faster right because

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.860 
those shells a lot faster right because
I<00:03:29.840> just<00:03:30.200> know<00:03:30.650> there's<00:03:30.980> B<00:03:31.250> flat<00:03:31.720> sliding<00:03:32.720> down

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
I just know there's B flat sliding down

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.770 
I just know there's B flat sliding down
the<00:03:33.019> E<00:03:33.200> flat<00:03:33.379> there's<00:03:34.280> a<00:03:34.519> flat<00:03:35.000> sliding<00:03:35.599> down

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
the E flat there's a flat sliding down

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.319 
the E flat there's a flat sliding down
to<00:03:35.959> D<00:03:36.139> flat<00:03:36.440> so<00:03:36.859> it<00:03:37.010> works<00:03:37.220> absolutely<00:03:37.489> four

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
to D flat so it works absolutely four

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.720 
to D flat so it works absolutely four
shelves<00:03:38.720> as<00:03:39.109> well<00:03:39.709> all<00:03:40.190> right<00:03:40.280> you<00:03:40.400> can<00:03:40.430> use

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
shelves as well all right you can use

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.689 
shelves as well all right you can use
this<00:03:40.879> trick<00:03:41.150> for<00:03:41.359> shells<00:03:41.660> also<00:03:42.699> Robert

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:43.699 
this trick for shells also Robert

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:45.699 
this trick for shells also Robert
oftentimes<00:03:44.510> core<00:03:44.780> tones<00:03:44.989> are<00:03:45.169> so<00:03:45.199> similar

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
oftentimes core tones are so similar

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.619 
oftentimes core tones are so similar
than<00:03:45.980> I<00:03:46.040> just<00:03:46.250> change<00:03:46.519> the<00:03:46.699> base<00:03:46.940> note<00:03:47.239> and

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
than I just change the base note and

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.360 
than I just change the base note and
leave<00:03:47.780> all<00:03:47.959> the<00:03:48.049> chord<00:03:48.290> tones<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:48.650> same<00:03:48.919> as<00:03:49.160> a

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
leave all the chord tones the same as a
