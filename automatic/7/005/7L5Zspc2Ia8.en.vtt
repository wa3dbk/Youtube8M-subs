00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:14.400

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:17.460
 antonio and today we tell you how 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.930
 the idea of antonia runs and won 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.930
 news he is the same 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:35.280
 we are done with our training 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:38.040
 It's monday and this week's pilot 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.940
 words that means we do half 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.370
 but set himself exactly dodged 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.040
 This training is a lot 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:53.300
 shorter and you get into one 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.300
 recovery phase our recovery phase 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:01.289
 blog about my diet as it currently 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.330
 runs and and I'll tell you more 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:09.420
 the final phase of my shoot 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:14.729
 I would say so as the 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:17.580
 I am 13 days I realize I am 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.009
 that I'm still unclear who he is there yet 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.130
 no heaters have the calorie-up 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.729
 again 4200 so I guess it 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.700
 are exactly 2100 because I'm always with the 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:33.229
 vegetable barrier and that can be up to and 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.869
 I have calculated karen 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.780
 not the best, but not me 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:44.880
 deficit but with those twice on 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:51.840
 six times a week and twelve times a week 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:54.090
 belly dance days later comes another 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.200

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.170
 the best good 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:45.730
 I myself, the whole thing goes slowly 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:48.700
 still at 3,200 calories actually 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.990
 still no deficit but before with contact 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.410

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.190

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.860
 and yes that's it so far I have 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.650
 still no title until today 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.090
 My goal would not be four 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.430
 months without a job 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.319
 Let's see what my coach hagen lives 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.360

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.470
 So I am currently in the final phase 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.019
 main on 7 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.819
 and as you can see 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.940
 slowly it gets rich and watery 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:32.220
 I am now as hard as never me 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.220
 I am now about 77 kilo 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:42.600
 I think 23 kilo muscle mass 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:46.120
 The host was fat and water but no matter 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:52.030

00:03:46.120 --> 00:04:02.170
