00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
different way of taking an energy but

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.540 
different way of taking an energy but
yeah<00:02:35.420> well<00:02:35.750> penny<00:02:36.050> yeah<00:02:36.620> lots<00:02:36.980> of<00:02:37.160> guy<00:02:37.310> yeah

exactly was a Brannick energetic yeah
well<00:02:42.380> what<00:02:43.370> I'd<00:02:43.760> done<00:02:43.910> a<00:02:43.970> lot<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:44.180> energy<00:02:44.480> work

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
well what I'd done a lot of energy work

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.450 
well what I'd done a lot of energy work
to<00:02:45.020> in<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.230> past<00:02:45.410> like<00:02:45.740> doing<00:02:45.950> Reiki<00:02:46.340> energy

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
to in the past like doing Reiki energy

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.810 
to in the past like doing Reiki energy
work<00:02:46.970> so<00:02:47.180> familiar<00:02:48.140> with<00:02:48.370> you<00:02:49.370> know<00:02:49.490> think<00:02:49.700> is

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
like you as I you know as it went

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.140 
like you as I you know as it went
further<00:03:03.230> into<00:03:03.590> this<00:03:03.860> out<00:03:04.100> this<00:03:04.370> past<00:03:04.610> it<00:03:05.000> was

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
further into this out this past it was

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.420 
further into this out this past it was
more<00:03:05.930> and<00:03:06.080> more<00:03:06.260> opening<00:03:06.620> I'd<00:03:06.740> you<00:03:07.100> know<00:03:07.160> keep

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
more and more opening I'd you know keep

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.790 
more and more opening I'd you know keep
stretching<00:03:07.760> onion<00:03:08.240> and<00:03:08.510> keep<00:03:08.720> it<00:03:09.080> so<00:03:09.410> my<00:03:09.560> body

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
stretching onion and keep it so my body

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.400 
stretching onion and keep it so my body
wouldn't<00:03:10.100> like<00:03:10.250> it<00:03:10.370> cause<00:03:10.520> of<00:03:10.670> slimy<00:03:10.910> uh<00:03:11.410> open

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
wouldn't like it cause of slimy uh open

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.750 
wouldn't like it cause of slimy uh open
up<00:03:12.530> more<00:03:12.770> you<00:03:12.980> know<00:03:13.160> because<00:03:13.430> there<00:03:13.580> was

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
up more you know because there was

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.880 
up more you know because there was
differences<00:03:14.750> and<00:03:15.019> come<00:03:15.170> out<00:03:15.350> and<00:03:15.590> inside

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
differences and come out and inside

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.520 
differences and come out and inside
stretch<00:03:16.340> must<00:03:17.330> allow<00:03:17.660> them<00:03:17.989> through<00:03:18.350> the

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
stretch must allow them through the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.259 
stretch must allow them through the
stiffnesses<00:03:19.100> to<00:03:19.280> move<00:03:19.430> out<00:03:19.580> an<00:03:19.730> energy<00:03:20.120> to

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
stiffnesses to move out an energy to

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.300 
stiffnesses to move out an energy to
move<00:03:20.420> more<00:03:20.690> smoothly<00:03:21.260> through<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:21.769> body<00:03:22.010> as

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
move more smoothly through the body as

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.540 
move more smoothly through the body as
likes<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:23.120> then<00:03:23.560> yeah<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:24.800> then<00:03:24.920> towards<00:03:25.310> the

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
likes and then yeah and then towards the

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.220 
likes and then yeah and then towards the
end<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:26.120> then<00:03:26.239> house<00:03:26.420> and<00:03:26.720> I<00:03:26.810> don't<00:03:26.989> know<00:03:27.080> why

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
end and then house and I don't know why

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.660 
end and then house and I don't know why
I<00:03:27.260> mean<00:03:27.530> they<00:03:27.709> went<00:03:27.830> back<00:03:28.010> towards<00:03:28.280> cake<00:03:28.519> I

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
I mean they went back towards cake I

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.040 
I mean they went back towards cake I
guess<00:03:28.850> I<00:03:28.880> had<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.120> learn<00:03:29.269> something<00:03:29.720> from<00:03:29.750> it

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
guess I had to learn something from it

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.670 
guess I had to learn something from it
but<00:03:30.320> healed<00:03:30.980> my<00:03:31.190> heel<00:03:31.910> my<00:03:32.090> captors<00:03:32.630> but<00:03:32.680> the

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
but healed my heel my captors but the

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.890 
but healed my heel my captors but the
words<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:34.310> end<00:03:34.519> of<00:03:34.670> that<00:03:34.850> just<00:03:35.360> three<00:03:35.570> day<00:03:35.690> is

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
words the end of that just three day is

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.350 
words the end of that just three day is
just<00:03:36.050> three<00:03:36.290> days<00:03:36.320> to<00:03:37.040> inhibit<00:03:37.459> the<00:03:37.820> feeling

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
just three days to inhibit the feeling

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.610 
just three days to inhibit the feeling
was<00:03:38.600> just<00:03:38.870> like<00:03:39.110> right<00:03:40.600> it<00:03:41.600> was<00:03:41.720> like<00:03:41.900> I<00:03:42.050> was<00:03:42.080> it

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
was just like right it was like I was it

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.440 
was just like right it was like I was it
wasn't<00:03:42.980> like<00:03:43.220> being<00:03:43.610> used<00:03:43.850> there<00:03:44.180> was<00:03:44.330> no

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
wasn't like being used there was no

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.750 
wasn't like being used there was no
there<00:03:44.840> was<00:03:44.900> a<00:03:45.019> less<00:03:45.709> of<00:03:45.920> a<00:03:46.010> sense<00:03:46.280> of<00:03:46.430> I<00:03:46.700> the

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
there was a less of a sense of I the

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.810 
there was a less of a sense of I the
rather<00:03:47.380> asbestos<00:03:48.380> of<00:03:48.620> connectedness<00:03:49.220> in<00:03:49.610> this

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
rather asbestos of connectedness in this

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.130 
rather asbestos of connectedness in this
and<00:03:50.120> everything<00:03:51.760> was<00:03:52.760> connected<00:03:53.090> and<00:03:53.480> I<00:03:53.720> feel
