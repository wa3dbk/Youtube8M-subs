so there's basically three different

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.539 
so there's basically three different
kind<00:02:28.349> of<00:02:28.379> interfaces<00:02:28.920> here<00:02:29.159> that<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:29.430> can

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
kind of interfaces here that you can

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.910 
kind of interfaces here that you can

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
play through just by swiping over and I

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.440 
play through just by swiping over and I
like<00:02:32.129> this<00:02:32.310> functionality<00:02:32.760> better<00:02:33.090> than<00:02:33.299> the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
like this functionality better than the

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.630 
like this functionality better than the
typing<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.049> which<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.680> still<00:02:34.950> have<00:02:35.159> to<00:02:35.310> get<00:02:35.430> to

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
typing it which you still have to get to

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.569 
typing it which you still have to get to
it<00:02:35.790> but<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.870> just<00:02:37.230> like<00:02:37.530> swiping<00:02:38.069> from<00:02:38.129> the<00:02:38.370> side

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
it but I just like swiping from the side

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.280 
it but I just like swiping from the side
it<00:02:38.790> kind<00:02:39.329> of<00:02:39.450> reminds<00:02:39.689> me<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.870> some<00:02:40.109> of<00:02:40.200> the

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
background and then this is where you

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.930 
background and then this is where you
would<00:05:04.440> just<00:05:04.620> go<00:05:04.740> ahead<00:05:04.830> and<00:05:04.980> you<00:05:05.400> know<00:05:05.520> type<00:05:05.760> in

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940

all your password and then it would go

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.850 
all your password and then it would go

now<00:05:11.400> basically<00:05:11.880> what<00:05:12.180> happens<00:05:12.510> is<00:05:12.810> it

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
now basically what happens is it

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.410 
now basically what happens is it
connects<00:05:13.560> to<00:05:13.620> the<00:05:13.800> Wi-Fi<00:05:14.130> network<00:05:14.490> based<00:05:15.120> on
