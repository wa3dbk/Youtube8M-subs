00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.500
 contemporary scrum has its own characteristics because 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.560
 for example in the past it was unlocked nei that it was I do not think 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.130
 anything 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.259
 had been restored and the rights of slaves nowadays to people no longer 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:28.570
 There is more the question 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.109
 we are slave labor in the opposition the works only do 

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:35.859
 they if the ethical question you had the question that a black slave today in 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:37.640
 day no longer has this differentiation 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.899
 nowadays slave and river work have more focus the social question is 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.210
 that low-income person who 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.600
 has very few communities, practically none that also come in 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.450
 very poor regions there are seduced by the promise of 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.140
 the most common in season work 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.500
 Even without this week I'm going to work there in Goiás working in thick 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.989
 for 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.699
 for six months or 10 months and will be a difficult match 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.789
 I hope to be able to return because in the Venetian region you will not find 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.710
 the job is working 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.219
 and in this process in which the capture of how made 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:12.759
 the advertising of the proposal and of employment 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.200
 that do not reach the people who treat 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.040
 there is a whole criminal network that involves this 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.810
 also identified in the research that an internal research 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.810
 the main focuses of a motion of the 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.850
 migration to slave labor 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.799
 they come from the region of the northeast region 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.290
 even taken to the north region mainly the state of Par 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.030
 and now has been diagnosed that they have much to the Midwest 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.520
 practically formed in the mato grosso mato grosso do sul because of the rain of 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.270
 expansion 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.620
 and the agricultural area 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.530
 only that morais has recently been found several foci of minutes 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.020
 slave labor city until very close to goiânia in the people to 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.610
 cane cut region - drivers who will buy clothing food 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.040
 then in safe remedy they buy directly from the gift of the farm 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.070
 that we have a warehouse in the place we are the way it is that the 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.900
 debt they buy goods in value sometimes three times larger than 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:06.579
 would be 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:07.760
 normally marketed 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.680
 their salary increases nor ever does their salary at the end of the month pay 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.260
 debt 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.939
 he ends up accumulating larger debt 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:16.599
 the coalition of the moral obligation of the worker is enough there comes the 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.799
 issue can come out because the study with the effect of armed security 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:22.839
 not put up in water 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:24.450
 physical punishment sometimes 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.849
 and even retraction option 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.840
 dead this denunciation of bodies same workers tried to escape 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.920
 and were killed at that level that attempted escape we have a very idea 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.470
 that people who use slave labor are people who do not 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.910
 are aware of the labor law but quite the opposite. 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.740
 denunciations that have been said the use of slave labor 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.360
 are large farmers who have a cultural level sometimes even 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.890
 and has an excellent tonic for the as 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.700
 advisory has office 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.500
 lawyers and also provides labor advice and are also 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.770
 linked to the international trade area, an interesting 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.260
 of the house that actually began the convictions to 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.220
 appropriation to fake serious form by using dutra vaz kral to the people here that 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.959
 would be necessary of the expropriation that takes lieutenant we tried a peugeot 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.069
 slave labor even without paid indemnity because without any kind of 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.840
 penalty kicked 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.050
 also a greater prison time the people who are involved and 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.119
 in others even larger in the list dirty a greater period of dengue permanence 

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:26.179
 on that dirty list that I think I look like people who use slave labor 

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:29.289
 in the research but that they found how to get better at 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:33.199
 question of slave labor in Brazil and what would be the most 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:36.649
 effective to apply now I will make a parallel sometimes a slave 

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:40.779
 of class slavery would be even better treated than today's 

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:44.799
 because the gilded was at home showed my property and needs to feed 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.299
 the minister also so that it produces nowadays or worker who is 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.929
 reduced to the condition of slave he was considered considered one more possible and 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:56.499
 die by sinop of illness or overwork print it is suspect
