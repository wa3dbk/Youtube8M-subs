00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.740
 so we prepared the substrate 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.080
 small fraction 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:14.700
 in order to burn it for what it is 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.730
 need in different harmful bacteria and fungi 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.270
 and other dirt contained in 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.080
 straw 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.359
 they must be destroyed 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.210
 pasteurized for this we made here 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.990
 such as people say pribludu 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:35.630
 ordinary stove that is heated 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:39.360
 firewood and pipes connected 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.649
 hoses with a barrel is ordinary 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.320
 aluminum barrel 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.430
 she's taken in some kind of lake farm farm 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.050
 trait we changed 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:52.260
 from aluminum it is light it was a tank 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.320
 standard milk cooling barrel 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.789
 somewhere 350 liters alexey there quietly 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.750
 climbs cleaned and so on it is connected 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.989
 how about the central heating system 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:13.310
 on top 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:17.070
 there is a pipe and here is a pipe where it circulates 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.540
 hot water heating is a water heater 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.909
 I have a water shirt pouring water 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.710
 heat the flooded whole thing 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.369
 hot water is heated by 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.880
 to this 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.060
 there will be a nice barrel bags are 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.939
 straw and cooling it goes down 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.880
 the cold down again heats up and here 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.150
 thus circulating 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:47.450
 as in the ordinary heating system in 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:50.939
 House and here is flank nipple screen 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:56.149
 we put on the hose here and it will be 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:59.280
 waste water such straw tea 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:02.790
 brick black is dirt 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.040
 cleaned up we will drain it and again 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.670
 don't just merge somewhere in the swamp 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.550
 ditch it will be a wonderful fertilizer 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.610
 because like vitamin tea 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.770
 this fertilizer after cooling we can 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.140
 pour some baths and here on 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.010
 a garden then work will be fine 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.230
 it will be possible to grow grass in it 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.620
 it's just great to be fertilizer 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.540
 Well, in principle, the tea that we drink 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.460
 this is the same for you on and the grass and 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.010
 here we not only brewed grass and 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.890
 straw it will be this way 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.310
 we will be circulating 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.780
 temperature over eighty degrees 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:51.390
 and the exposure is recommended well, for example 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:55.760
 24 hours is better here and more well 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:03:01.130
 for example 4 hours and we spent for this 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:04.230
 thermal insulation and 60 degrees and 12 hours 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.890
 thermal insulation barrels the higher the degree of 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.670
 less time from the isover position 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.910
 all neatly then come back and then layer 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.580
 here such go tight everything is done and 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.690
 so when we close yet 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:23.910
 foam and a lid here is very 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.200
 long keeps the temperature if we are in the evening 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:31.650
 but we do damage until the morning almost 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:34.650
 even water is hot so i fill in here 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.170
 bags how many will fit usually 6 bags 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.630
 because she swells this straw 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.320
 the main thing is that you can bags through 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.760
 the neck 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:47.010
 get this heat capacity like this 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.340
 isolated and held out by the police what 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.510
 can be made at home 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:57.090
 if there are no such conditions, we will show you 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:00.300
 here is such a barrel 200 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.459
 liter and a barrel there in theme mode this 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:05.430
 we show all this clearly how it is 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.610
 done here like this is the key 220 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:13.550
 volt will show a system of blocks like this 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:15.590
 You can do how to make the cover well, two 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.109
 inside the bag you can 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.419
 for such a barrel there is one 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.060
 if not there will be such a barrel 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.340
 the most as it is cyprus insulated easily 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.850
 ordinary leaf to turn from the lake 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:32.110
 we'll show you all without these now 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.880
 fill in several bags with this sulphate 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.919
 fill the barrel with water and now we have this 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:42.889
 process we show you how to do it 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:47.479
 and so is the process of loading bags 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:49.639
 substrate tight to the level of bricks 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.160
 do not need to press because it 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:55.790
 make everything swell desired 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.940
 assistant job is easy just two 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:08.180
 more convenient here to the extent we fill 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:12.530
 bags can be made special 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:15.139
 I will apply to take a pass butter bucket the same 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.680
 cut the stool itself and cut it 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:21.710
 bottom and fill one somewhere it is 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.630
 just can not find in the winter we hanger 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:29.360
 there were no other tasks involved 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:37.220
 here's a bag one is ready just as well 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:37.729
 same way the other six are made 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.510
 bags 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:43.610
 prepared rammed straw 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:46.610
 plugged in here made damian and ira 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.430
 how many shelves are there to 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:52.370
 the bags didn't pop up so that they were not 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:57.440
 the barrel is completely filled with water 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:06:00.560
 with water here is an hour to light up to 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:06.070
 neck stove already flooded here goes 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:08.870
 smoke from the pipe show a few poles 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:11.090
 Heats up and everything here will not be 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:14.720
 Yes 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:18.410
 bookmark close the lid tightly 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:22.880
 foam and barrel as it is already warm on all 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:27.539
 and will go from the bag position 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:29.000
 mucus water runs this hot water is not 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:34.080
 hot cold 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:37.740
 with the boy we will merge well save on water 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.780
 I think there is no big sense for example 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.900
 in the same broth several times 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:45.110
 death but especially there is nothing there all this 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:49.850
 will go to fertilizer when cool 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:53.880
 when will get already show 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:58.639
 by means of charging mycelium bags 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:02.669
 Well, now almost full of water 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:04.400
 still a little close the water on it all 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:07.440
 will tell you 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:10.070
