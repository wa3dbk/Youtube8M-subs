perfect link in there with and the PK
Jordi<00:01:38.880> Alba<00:01:39.180> pretty<00:01:39.570> decent<00:01:39.960> he<00:01:40.050> reminds<00:01:40.320> me

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
Jordi Alba pretty decent he reminds me

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.080 
Jordi Alba pretty decent he reminds me
of<00:01:40.500> Coentrao<00:01:40.980> on<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.190> game<00:01:41.370> just<00:01:41.580> a<00:01:41.730> really

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
of Coentrao on this game just a really

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.060 
of Coentrao on this game just a really
quick<00:01:42.390> left-back<00:01:43.320> who's<00:01:43.530> pretty<00:01:43.770> good<00:01:43.920> going

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
quick left-back who's pretty good going

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.500 
quick left-back who's pretty good going
forward<00:01:44.550> and<00:01:44.700> pretty<00:01:44.940> decent<00:01:45.300> coming

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
forward and pretty decent coming

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.420 
forward and pretty decent coming
backwards<00:01:45.690> anyway<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.260> this<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:47.100> second

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
backwards anyway so this is the second

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.800 
backwards anyway so this is the second
in<00:01:47.550> fun<00:01:47.730> with<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.970> team<00:01:48.180> now<00:01:48.450> from<00:01:48.690> this

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
in fun with the team now from this

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.060 
in fun with the team now from this
week's<00:01:49.050> team<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.560> week<00:01:49.710> we've<00:01:49.920> got

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
week's team of the week we've got

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.980 
week's team of the week we've got
griezmann<00:01:50.580> and<00:01:50.760> I<00:01:51.240> don't<00:01:51.450> know<00:01:51.570> ever<00:01:51.720> as<00:01:51.870> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
griezmann and I don't know ever as the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.960 
griezmann and I don't know ever as the
formation<00:01:52.530> on<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.340> didn't<00:01:53.820> like

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
formation on that but I didn't like

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.180 
formation on that but I didn't like
either<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.600> winger's<00:01:54.870> on<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.110> team<00:01:55.320> 442

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
either of the winger's on this team 442

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.880 
either of the winger's on this team 442
seems<00:01:56.580> to<00:01:56.700> be<00:01:56.820> very<00:01:56.850> strange<00:01:57.480> the<00:01:58.110> midfield<00:01:58.560> in

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
seems to be very strange the midfield in

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.400 
seems to be very strange the midfield in
general<00:01:59.370> didn't<00:01:59.880> seem<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.210> do<00:02:00.330> a<00:02:00.360> lot<00:02:00.540> it's<00:02:01.200> one

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
general didn't seem to do a lot it's one

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.530 
general didn't seem to do a lot it's one
of<00:02:01.440> those<00:02:01.590> formations<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.430> just<00:02:02.760> I<00:02:03.060> don't

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
of those formations that just I don't

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.760 
of those formations that just I don't
know<00:02:03.690> it<00:02:03.870> was<00:02:03.990> something<00:02:04.260> about<00:02:04.350> one<00:02:04.620> we've

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
know it was something about one we've

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.130 
know it was something about one we've
got<00:02:04.890> Grenier<00:02:05.220> he<00:02:05.640> links<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.330> with<00:02:06.510> the<00:02:06.750> left

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
got Grenier he links in with the left

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.990 
got Grenier he links in with the left
midfielder<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.740> striker<00:02:08.009> most<00:02:08.670> get<00:02:08.850> one

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
midfielder and the striker most get one

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.760 
midfielder and the striker most get one
go<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.210> him<00:02:09.360> which<00:02:09.690> was<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.869> penalty<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.470> we

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
go of him which was a penalty and we

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.800 
go of him which was a penalty and we
managed<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:12.030> eat

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
managed to eat

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.900 
managed to eat
it<00:02:12.870> could<00:02:13.530> kind<00:02:13.739> of<00:02:13.800> run<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.220> midfield<00:02:14.580> pretty

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
it could kind of run the midfield pretty

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.280 
it could kind of run the midfield pretty
well<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.239> be<00:02:15.330> honest<00:02:15.569> he's<00:02:15.690> got<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.900> couple<00:02:16.170> of

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
well to be honest he's got a couple of

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.589 
well to be honest he's got a couple of
good<00:02:16.470> runs<00:02:16.680> going<00:02:16.860> forward<00:02:17.310> defensively<00:02:18.180> he

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
good runs going forward defensively he

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.630 
good runs going forward defensively he
you<00:02:18.930> know<00:02:19.020> he's<00:02:19.230> not<00:02:19.260> usually<00:02:19.739> a<00:02:20.040> defensive

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
you know he's not usually a defensive

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.309 
you know he's not usually a defensive
player<00:02:20.819> as<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.000> center<00:02:21.330> attacking<00:02:21.720> mid<00:02:21.900> usually

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
player as a center attacking mid usually

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.860 
player as a center attacking mid usually
but<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.739> like<00:02:23.520> him<00:02:23.819> as<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.090> center<00:02:24.420> attacking<00:02:24.780> mid

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
but I like him as a center attacking mid

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.839 
but I like him as a center attacking mid
as<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.050> sense<00:02:25.319> midfielder<00:02:25.860> not<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:26.400> much<00:02:26.580> unless

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
as a sense midfielder not so much unless

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.130 
as a sense midfielder not so much unless
you've<00:02:27.030> got<00:02:27.180> defensive<00:02:27.420> one<00:02:27.720> next<00:02:27.959> to<00:02:28.050> him

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140
