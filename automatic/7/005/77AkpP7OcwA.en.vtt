00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
cheaper by then and right now it's going

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.090

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
literally when I bought this he was 3

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.949 
literally when I bought this he was 3
million<00:04:00.520> cuz<00:04:00.910> team<00:04:01.150> of<00:04:01.239> the<00:04:01.300> seasons<00:04:01.660> had<00:04:01.810> come

it<00:04:04.090> for<00:04:04.180> 2.8<00:04:04.690> 2.7<00:04:05.350> as<00:04:05.470> well<00:04:05.590> if<00:04:05.680> you<00:04:05.739> wait<00:04:05.890> a<00:04:05.950> bit

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
it for 2.8 2.7 as well if you wait a bit

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.590 
it for 2.8 2.7 as well if you wait a bit
longer<00:04:06.130> it<00:04:06.520> could<00:04:06.670> even<00:04:06.790> drop<00:04:07.000> down<00:04:07.180> more<00:04:07.420> and

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
longer it could even drop down more and

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.180 
longer it could even drop down more and

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
to come up against I was going to change

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.140 
to come up against I was going to change
my<00:04:51.530> method<00:04:51.979> of<00:04:52.070> how<00:04:52.160> i<00:04:52.190> do<00:04:52.340> squad<00:04:52.669> builders<00:04:53.000> to

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
my method of how i do squad builders to

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.820 
my method of how i do squad builders to
just<00:04:53.360> putting<00:04:53.900> all<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.169> best<00:04:54.350> highlights<00:04:54.560> at

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
just putting all the best highlights at

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
just putting all the best highlights at
the<00:04:54.919> end<00:04:55.010> of<00:04:55.070> the<00:04:55.130> video<00:04:55.250> but<00:04:55.400> I<00:04:55.460> think<00:04:55.760> it

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
the end of the video but I think it

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.219 
the end of the video but I think it
makes<00:04:56.000> it<00:04:56.150> more<00:04:56.240> spontaneous<00:04:56.780> to<00:04:56.870> have<00:04:57.020> it<00:04:57.139> as

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
makes it more spontaneous to have it as

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.710 
makes it more spontaneous to have it as
three<00:04:57.889> games<00:04:58.160> or<00:04:58.460> four<00:04:59.120> games<00:04:59.360> because<00:04:59.630> then

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
three games or four games because then

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.210 
three games or four games because then
you<00:04:59.810> can<00:04:59.930> see<00:05:00.139> how<00:05:00.320> the<00:05:00.380> team<00:05:00.650> plays<00:05:00.979> in

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
you can see how the team plays in

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.620 
you can see how the team plays in
general<00:05:01.580> rather<00:05:01.940> than<00:05:02.090> having<00:05:02.300> mixed

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
general rather than having mixed

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.960 
general rather than having mixed
collective<00:05:03.169> clips<00:05:03.470> of<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:04.550> team's<00:05:04.760> best

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
collective clips of the team's best

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.159 
collective clips of the team's best
performances<00:05:05.450> cuz<00:05:05.630> that<00:05:05.780> does<00:05:05.900> not<00:05:06.020> do

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
performances cuz that does not do

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.379 
performances cuz that does not do
justice<00:05:06.200> as<00:05:06.830> to<00:05:06.979> how<00:05:07.100> the<00:05:07.160> team<00:05:07.460> played<00:05:07.760> is<00:05:08.270> you

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
justice as to how the team played is you

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.600 
justice as to how the team played is you
can<00:05:08.870> just<00:05:09.020> make<00:05:09.169> it<00:05:09.200> look<00:05:09.440> good<00:05:09.590> like<00:05:09.770> that<00:05:09.830> and

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
can just make it look good like that and

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.280 
can just make it look good like that and

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
it went on until the most you could

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.029 
it went on until the most you could
actually<00:05:29.810> do<00:05:30.110> it<00:05:30.229> and<00:05:30.350> I<00:05:30.410> was<00:05:30.500> a<00:05:30.560> really<00:05:30.889> nice

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
actually do it and I was a really nice

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.010 
actually do it and I was a really nice
header<00:05:31.340> I<00:05:31.580> really<00:05:32.060> respect<00:05:32.479> when<00:05:32.690> my<00:05:32.810> opponent

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
header I really respect when my opponent

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.379 
header I really respect when my opponent
was<00:05:33.320> a<00:05:33.380> really<00:05:33.770> nice<00:05:33.919> cool<00:05:34.220> and<00:05:34.460> I<00:05:35.000> think<00:05:35.210> every

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
was a really nice cool and I think every

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.659 
was a really nice cool and I think every
headers<00:05:35.960> just<00:05:36.380> outside<00:05:37.039> where<00:05:37.220> the<00:05:37.310> penalty

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
headers just outside where the penalty

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.790 
headers just outside where the penalty
spot<00:05:37.700> is<00:05:38.030> I<00:05:38.210> think<00:05:39.139> you<00:05:39.410> know<00:05:39.560> it's<00:05:39.650> really

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.320 
spot is I think you know it's really
difficult<00:05:40.039> to<00:05:40.310> score<00:05:40.460> like<00:05:40.610> that<00:05:40.639> keep<00:05:41.180> those

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
difficult to score like that keep those

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:42.730 
difficult to score like that keep those
