00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello to all and I come back our 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.590
 gait 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:15.599
 yes I know I know that's at least 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.650
 long time I did not make video I 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.699
 think now you understand 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.359
 as videos every two weeks 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.880
 ended 1 because that's here I 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.310
 have no more for me and when 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.460
 I try to find I have everything 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.869
 just laziness 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.219
 but it does not matter since here I am 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.840
 with this new video you have 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.630
 had to wait for weeks because I 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.190
 am obviously very famous on youtube 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:50.430
 so we will see today the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:51.660
 middle-age mode we spend the period 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.820
 Gallic and Roman 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.739
 because because so here we are at 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.930
 middle age where fashion obviously has to 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.850
 blow changed finished the practical outfits or 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.920
 simple now it's heavy 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.090
 actually it started in the thirteenth century 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.920
 because there is a greater importance 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.170
 for the outside look break if 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.909
 defined the social class we speak 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.340
 of clothes has no physical beauty 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.450
 I would just report because if 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.770
 we take into account the visitors 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.979
 may have doubts 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.930
 in short, we will do two categories 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.759
 rich and the people 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.619
 I know I am very original in my 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.049
 work I was saying just now that 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.670
 we passed the Gaulish but the peasants 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.070
 of the middle ages will still keep the same 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.329
 style that the Gauls down when we 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.950
 works in the rooms 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.869
 it's true that it's logical to have a 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.020
 hyper class dress with heels or a 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.110
 sharp suit and not are those who 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.850
 should understand it 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.799
 so the holding of a peasant is limited more 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.579
 often a tunic a card shot a 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.320
 short cape and that's all even if she 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.680
 some changes do not mess 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.659
 still 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.250
 for example the man had a shirt and 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.450
 a canvas break a quote that was 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.740
 more or less a tunic with 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.640
 sleeves at right angles to the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.319
 body with short or long breaks 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.560
 so right now it's a kind of 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.540
 pants not a species of 15 according to 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.200
 now to a cropped pants you ok us 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.450
 that's it I repeat it was working 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.060
 in the fields 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:26.540
 so having class is not the 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.330
 first priority is therefore above 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.660
 it's true because it was not like that 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.580
 still 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.380
 we put things you know these 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.420
 famous brown stuff that are only at 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.610
 leg level facilitate movement 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.680
 all that and then sometimes there were 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.110
 hats but then there is the choice 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.840
 one of you chapron straw hat 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.730
 good and we did that varied according to the 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.890
 centuries still women was a 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.959
 little different a shirt without a break 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.730
 are free and not without joke 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.650
 a banner of yesteryear to maintain the 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.239
 chest a rating like men and 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.239
 hats because hats 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.920
 yes, there were a few steps 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.870
 different and some ornamentations 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.540
 for the wealthy with them no stone 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.400
 precious of course on the belt but 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.799
 nothing crazy crazy what relatives called the 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.980
 said is that the land for men 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:18.110
 there is also the odds or bio for 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.760
 intimate ferns a taxi joke that 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.530
 has evolved a lot for these classes and the 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.329
 cost which began over the 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.640
 side with or without sleeves but maintained 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.160
 by a belt paddy coat its 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.790
 chain what there is also the attached caps 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.769
 right shoulder 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.310
 a slight addiction to anyone 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:36.170
 noble my famous horses 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.790
 forgiveness but visitors the Middle Ages 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:43.190
 it's all hard and the chaperones 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.780
 who sometimes wore one has form of 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.790
 kabul 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.480
 do not try said kaboul 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.480
 they are chaperones 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:56.090
 foot a gain and of course the must of the must 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.800
 the long enough horse shoes 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.440
 shoes could reach a size 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:04.130
 disproportionate according to the grade of the noble kind 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.600
 from 2 cm to 50 cm if if my mouth 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.790
 women in addition had a coast 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.920
 repeats a weird name I must 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.430
 admit it the most famous dress of the 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.910
 Middle Ages 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.440
 finally camelot is also a coat in 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.510
 semicircle that could even be 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.540
 maintained by a jewel or something 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.000
 of that kind of thing you're going to tell me you do not 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.590
 do not know much 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:31.580
 like to have fun with hairstyles 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:33.290
 ah yes huh we build after the very 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.050
 mainsail that hides the hair or 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.780
 the long braids in the thirteenth century 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.810
 he had many other hairstyles by 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.830
 following I will not list everything 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.260
 you really believe that I was going number 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.810
 and no, no, because I have everything 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.490
 simply laziness of course 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.440
 unlike peoples the stuffs and 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.160
 the ornamentations it was badass 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.060
 gold embroidery loses pieri jewel either to 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.540
 multicolored stripes may 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.970
 and in 1476 the sanctuary laws did not 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.410
 been cool little extravagance then 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.919
 from Europe too do not have foals 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.350
 too long 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.880
 short we laugh anymore the belt was 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.810
 gone as important declining under 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.300
 all forms are yet 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:15.960
 different levels ornamented or not he 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.740
 there are also the colors of the fabrics but 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.580
 he did to talk about it 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.139
 ah ah well yes it's the holidays so we 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.820
 could sum up the fashion of the Middle Ages 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.590
 like a revolution after sobriety 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.310
 previous centuries we value the 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.050
 forms 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.030
 we give more importance to 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.590
 colors and for the first time we are going 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.660
 really the difference between men 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.270
 and the women the people he is noble and 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.680
 this is good 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.240
 from there the hand really has to 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.669
 become important a lot more hashed 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.900
 huge obviously and that's why 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.880
 I still have a job 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.710
 so here I hope that this video you 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.380
 will have pleased the street I put all my 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.990
 energy one day I can not see it 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.040
 so I hope these lives of you 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.130
 remember I have to stop repeating 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.200
 it's at least twice and I'll 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.960
 found in a year and a half is not it 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.610
 for the next video and so I 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.930
 will vote very soon down for this 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.930
 next video lease
