00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
U then Super Mario 64 I mean what can I

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.470 
U then Super Mario 64 I mean what can I
possibly<00:00:22.410> say<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:22.919> you<00:00:23.669> don't<00:00:24.029> already<00:00:24.300> know

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
possibly say that you don't already know

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.550 
possibly say that you don't already know
and<00:00:24.930> haven't<00:00:25.470> fully<00:00:25.680> heard<00:00:26.070> before<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.779> one

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
and haven't fully heard before it is one

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.069 
and haven't fully heard before it is one
of<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.919> most<00:00:29.310> amazing<00:00:29.579> games<00:00:30.000> ever<00:00:30.360> made<00:00:30.599> I

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
of the most amazing games ever made I

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.470 
of the most amazing games ever made I
think<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.130> still<00:00:32.399> holds<00:00:32.759> up<00:00:32.880> greatly<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:34.070> I

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
think it still holds up greatly and I

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.330 
think it still holds up greatly and I
think<00:00:36.480> all<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.590> must<00:00:37.829> have<00:00:37.980> played<00:00:38.190> this

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
think all of you must have played this

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.979 
think all of you must have played this
game<00:00:38.430> by<00:00:38.699> now<00:00:38.850> surely<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.510> mean<00:00:39.690> if<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.809> haven't

Wow that mean mary 64 is like is old now

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.639 
Wow that mean mary 64 is like is old now
I<00:00:53.550> mean<00:00:53.670> it's<00:00:54.000> about<00:00:54.269> two<00:00:54.539> decades<00:00:54.989> old<00:00:55.199> isn't

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
I mean it's about two decades old isn't

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.489 
I mean it's about two decades old isn't
it's<00:00:55.800> not<00:00:55.949> weird<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.280> think<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:57.199> think<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.320> still

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:58.499 
it's not weird to think I think it still

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:00.560 
it's not weird to think I think it still
holds<00:00:58.739> up<00:00:58.969> reasonably<00:00:59.969> well<00:01:00.239> especially

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
holds up reasonably well especially

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.389 
holds up reasonably well especially
compared<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> lot<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.440> other<00:01:01.710> 3d

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
compared to a lot of other 3d

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.030 
compared to a lot of other 3d
platformers<00:01:03.059> at<00:01:03.179> the<00:01:03.269> time<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:04.260> came<00:01:04.800> at<00:01:05.010> a

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
platformers at the time it came at a

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.130 
platformers at the time it came at a
time<00:01:05.309> where<00:01:05.670> there<00:01:06.000> was<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.240> kind<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.900> very

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
time where there was that kind of very

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.560 
time where there was that kind of very
immature<00:01:07.680> period<00:01:08.190> between<00:01:08.370> in<00:01:09.240> terms<00:01:09.450> of

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
immature period between in terms of

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.930 
immature period between in terms of
technology<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.320> let's<00:01:10.890> say<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.130> Mario<00:01:11.490> 64

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
technology and let's say that Mario 64

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.820 
technology and let's say that Mario 64
is<00:01:12.030> an<00:01:12.090> immature<00:01:12.300> game<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.500> came<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.740> that

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
is an immature game and it came in that

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.430 
is an immature game and it came in that
period<00:01:14.190> between<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.610> 16-bit<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.600> 32<00:01:16.170> /

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
period between the 16-bit and the 32 /

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.770 
period between the 16-bit and the 32 /
64<00:01:17.100> bit<00:01:18.440> generations<00:01:19.440> where<00:01:20.100> 3d<00:01:21.090> was<00:01:21.390> coming

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
64 bit generations where 3d was coming

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.440 
64 bit generations where 3d was coming
and<00:01:22.580> developers<00:01:23.580> were<00:01:23.820> kind<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.060> struggling

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
and developers were kind of struggling

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.500 
and developers were kind of struggling
to<00:01:24.930> cope<00:01:25.530> with<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.130> massive<00:01:26.790> change<00:01:27.150> from

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
to cope with that massive change from

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.320 
to cope with that massive change from
the<00:01:27.830> 2d<00:01:28.830> coming<00:01:29.400> games<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.760> old<00:01:29.880> especially

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
the 2d coming games of old especially

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.450 
the 2d coming games of old especially
platformers<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.500> having<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.950> deal<00:01:32.100> with<00:01:32.130> a

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
platformers to having to deal with a

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.190 
platformers to having to deal with a
full<00:01:33.090> 3d<00:01:33.680> playing<00:01:34.680> area<00:01:35.240> including<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:37.140> know

full 3d playing area including you know

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.340 
full 3d playing area including you know
cameras<00:01:37.800> which<00:01:38.070> were<00:01:38.430> troublesome<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.630> mean<00:01:39.840> we

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
cameras which were troublesome I mean we

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.170 
cameras which were troublesome I mean we
still<00:01:40.590> have<00:01:40.620> issues<00:01:41.100> with<00:01:41.430> cameras<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.090> video

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
still have issues with cameras and video

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.600 
still have issues with cameras and video
games<00:01:42.510> today<00:01:42.770> it<00:01:43.770> was<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:43.980> hell<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.430> lot<00:01:44.580> worse

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
games today it was a hell of a lot worse

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.020 
games today it was a hell of a lot worse

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
back in 95 96 97 at that kind of time

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.590 
back in 95 96 97 at that kind of time
and<00:01:48.740> somehow<00:01:50.030> Nintendo<00:01:51.030> managed<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.330> create

and somehow Nintendo managed to create

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.030 
and somehow Nintendo managed to create
this<00:01:51.720> game<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.820> that<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.780> felt<00:01:55.080> like<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.560> 2d

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
this game the that it felt like a 2d

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.090 
this game the that it felt like a 2d
Mario<00:01:56.280> game<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:56.940> a<00:01:57.240> full<00:01:57.450> 3d<00:01:57.870> area<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
Mario game in a full 3d area and the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.690 
Mario game in a full 3d area and the
camera<00:01:59.610> works<00:01:59.960> exceptionally<00:02:00.960> well<00:02:01.470> it<00:02:02.460> gave

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
camera works exceptionally well it gave

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.920 
camera works exceptionally well it gave
you<00:02:02.940> a<00:02:03.240> mix<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:04.790> predetermined<00:02:05.790> camera<00:02:06.720> and

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
you a mix of a predetermined camera and

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.199 
you a mix of a predetermined camera and
also<00:02:07.380> gave<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.800> a<00:02:07.830> chance<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.250> control<00:02:09.030> that

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
also gave you a chance to control that

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.229 
also gave you a chance to control that
camera<00:02:09.690> yourself<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.440> what<00:02:11.370> I've<00:02:11.910> really

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
camera yourself and what I've really

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.699 
camera yourself and what I've really
liked<00:02:12.420> about<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.780> was<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.340> Navy

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
liked about it was the Navy

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.949

nice to have that authenticity in terms

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.460 
nice to have that authenticity in terms
of<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.350> game<00:03:33.910> in<00:03:34.910> terms<00:03:35.239> of<00:03:35.360> other<00:03:35.510> additions

of the game in terms of other additions

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.039 
of the game in terms of other additions
I<00:03:36.560> mean<00:03:36.650> there's<00:03:36.799> not<00:03:36.920> too<00:03:37.130> much<00:03:37.280> you<00:03:37.340> can

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
I mean there's not too much you can

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.710 
I mean there's not too much you can
basically<00:03:39.049> you<00:03:39.410> can<00:03:39.850> redefine<00:03:40.850> all<00:03:41.420> the

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
basically you can redefine all the

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.650 
basically you can redefine all the
gamepad<00:03:42.230> keys<00:03:43.220> oh<00:03:43.459> yeah<00:03:43.970> you<00:03:44.299> can<00:03:44.540> actually

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
gamepad keys oh yeah you can actually

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.599 
gamepad keys oh yeah you can actually
use<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.049> gamepad<00:03:45.230> to<00:03:45.560> play<00:03:45.709> this<00:03:45.890> this<00:03:46.340> game

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
use the gamepad to play this this game

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.770 
use the gamepad to play this this game
unlike<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:48.530> Wii<00:03:48.850> releases<00:03:49.850> that<00:03:50.030> I<00:03:50.060> think

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
unlike the the Wii releases that I think

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.229 
unlike the the Wii releases that I think
videos<00:03:51.049> for<00:03:51.320> a<00:03:51.560> while<00:03:51.980> ago<00:03:52.459> so<00:03:53.120> you<00:03:53.180> know

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
videos for a while ago so you know

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.660 
videos for a while ago so you know
that's<00:03:53.390> great<00:03:53.630> you<00:03:53.750> can<00:03:53.780> play<00:03:54.079> off<00:03:54.470> TV<00:03:54.890> which

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
that's great you can play off TV which

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.270 
that's great you can play off TV which
is<00:03:55.790> also<00:03:55.940> good<00:03:56.209> and<00:03:56.840> playing<00:03:57.650> this<00:03:57.769> game<00:03:57.980> again

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
is also good and playing this game again

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.830 
is also good and playing this game again
for<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.549> first<00:03:58.670> time<00:03:58.790> probably<00:03:59.299> since<00:03:59.510> the

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
for the first time probably since the

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.949 
for the first time probably since the
yes<00:04:00.590> game<00:04:01.090> I'll<00:04:02.090> probably<00:04:02.450> would<00:04:02.630> highly

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
yes game I'll probably would highly

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.509 
yes game I'll probably would highly
recommend<00:04:03.410> that<00:04:03.560> you'll<00:04:03.829> just<00:04:04.040> have<00:04:04.310> another

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
recommend that you'll just have another
