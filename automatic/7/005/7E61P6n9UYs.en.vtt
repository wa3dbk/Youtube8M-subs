00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
controller movements we just need to

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.240 
controller movements we just need to
check<00:00:24.050> your<00:00:24.169> mobile<00:00:24.560> enough<00:00:24.770> for<00:00:24.980> the<00:00:25.039> Viets

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:36.720 

so<00:00:35.679> let's<00:00:35.859> fire<00:00:36.100> up

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
so let's fire up

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.360 
so let's fire up
to<00:00:37.300> start<00:00:37.630> the<00:00:37.809> engine<00:00:38.230> reach<00:00:38.559> across<00:00:38.890> to<00:00:39.190> this

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
to start the engine reach across to this

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.250
