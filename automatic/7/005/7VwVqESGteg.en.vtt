with<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.140> bag<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.710> had<00:01:04.949> purchased<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.519> bag

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
with this bag I had purchased this bag

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.969 
with this bag I had purchased this bag
why<00:01:06.420> had<00:01:06.540> God<00:01:06.720> must<00:01:06.960> bag<00:01:07.110> as<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> gift<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.799> two

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
why had God must bag as a gift to two

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.090 
why had God must bag as a gift to two
years<00:01:08.250> ago<00:01:08.520> for<00:01:08.850> Christmas<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.799> my<00:01:10.799> biggest

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
years ago for Christmas and my biggest

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.770 
years ago for Christmas and my biggest
concern<00:01:11.580> about<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.909> bag<00:01:12.060> was<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.479> perhaps

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
concern about the bag was that perhaps

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.530 
concern about the bag was that perhaps
the<00:01:13.320> straps<00:01:13.830> were<00:01:14.070> too<00:01:14.280> stiff<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.509> I

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
the straps were too stiff and so I

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.679 
the straps were too stiff and so I
returned<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.320> for<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:17.180> monogram<00:01:18.180> print<00:01:18.479> bag

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
returned it for the monogram print bag

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.780 
returned it for the monogram print bag
and<00:01:19.020> then<00:01:19.409> when<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.530> got<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:20.009> bag<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.549> was

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
and then when I got that bag I was

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.330 
and then when I got that bag I was
worried<00:01:21.090> about<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:22.200> patina<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.860> bag<00:01:23.040> and

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
worried about the patina on that bag and

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.820 
worried about the patina on that bag and
so<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.820> end<00:01:24.030> up<00:01:24.090> selling<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.720> one<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.200> then

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
so I end up selling that one and then

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.210 
so I end up selling that one and then
later<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:27.030> got<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.600> e-cat<00:01:28.140> version<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:28.950> it's

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
later on I got the e-cat version so it's

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.149 
later on I got the e-cat version so it's
the<00:01:29.509> special<00:01:30.509> limited<00:01:31.229> edition<00:01:31.290> version<00:01:32.009> with

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
the special limited edition version with

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.980 
the special limited edition version with
the<00:01:32.340> pink<00:01:32.759> sort<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.540> trim<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:35.750> when<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.780> got

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
the pink sort of trim and when I got

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.710 
the pink sort of trim and when I got
home<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.590> realized<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.520> wasn't<00:01:38.720> classic

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
home I realized that it wasn't classic

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.870 
home I realized that it wasn't classic
enough<00:01:39.960> for<00:01:40.200> me<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:41.040> perhaps<00:01:41.220> I'm<00:01:41.640> not<00:01:41.850> a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
enough for me and that perhaps I'm not a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.389 
enough for me and that perhaps I'm not a
special<00:01:42.420> edition<00:01:42.840> type<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.229> girl<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.369> I

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
special edition type of girl and so I

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.550 
special edition type of girl and so I
did<00:01:44.700> end<00:01:44.850> up<00:01:44.909> returning<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.479> one<00:01:45.780> but<00:01:46.110> what<00:01:46.530> I

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
did end up returning that one but what I

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.020 
did end up returning that one but what I
think<00:01:46.799> about<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.220> was<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.490> very<00:01:47.790> very

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
think about it that was a very very

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.149 
think about it that was a very very
pretty<00:01:48.240> bag<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.930> any<00:01:49.320> case<00:01:49.590> I'm<00:01:49.799> really<00:01:50.009> glad

collection<00:01:52.290> right<00:01:52.320> now<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.799> I'm<00:01:52.860> glad<00:01:53.070> that

it's this one because where I live the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.550 
it's this one because where I live the
weather<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.670> not<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.450> greatest<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.320> think

this and I got this one first though I

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.360 
this and I got this one first though I
when<00:02:26.050> I<00:02:26.080> got<00:02:26.290> this<00:02:26.440> when<00:02:26.620> I<00:02:26.650> was<00:02:26.770> expecting<00:02:27.280> the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
when I got this when I was expecting the

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.980 
when I got this when I was expecting the
pochette<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.820> be<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.060> same<00:02:28.300> size<00:02:28.600> but<00:02:28.840> it

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
pochette to be the same size but it

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.050 
pochette to be the same size but it
makes<00:02:29.140> sense<00:02:29.320> that<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:30.130> bigger<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.460> bag<00:02:30.790> the

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
makes sense that the bigger the bag the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.310 
makes sense that the bigger the bag the
bigger<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.420> push-ups<00:02:31.810> I'm<00:02:31.960> going<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.170> show

bigger the push-ups I'm going to show

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.400 
bigger the push-ups I'm going to show
you<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:33.340> size<00:02:33.580> difference<00:02:34.120> so<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:35.110> one<00:02:35.290> in

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
you the size difference so the one in

you the size difference so the one in
the<00:02:35.500> front<00:02:35.650> obviously<00:02:36.160> is<00:02:36.280> for<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:37.090> PM<00:02:37.480> size

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
the front obviously is for the PM size

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.050 
the front obviously is for the PM size
and<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.350> one<00:02:38.500> in<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.650> back<00:02:38.890> is<00:02:39.100> for<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.640> mm

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
and the one in the back is for the mm

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.470 
and the one in the back is for the mm
size<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:41.160> this<00:02:42.160> one<00:02:42.370> I<00:02:42.400> keep<00:02:42.670> my<00:02:42.850> makeup<00:02:43.090> in

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
size and this one I keep my makeup in

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.480 
size and this one I keep my makeup in
because<00:02:44.170> I<00:02:44.560> actually<00:02:44.950> really<00:02:45.100> like<00:02:45.460> that

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
because I actually really like that

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.570 
because I actually really like that
because<00:02:45.850> I<00:02:45.940> know<00:02:46.000> that<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.330> makeup<00:02:47.370> bag<00:02:48.370> that

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
because I know that the makeup bag that

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.700 
because I know that the makeup bag that
you<00:02:48.640> can<00:02:48.700> get<00:02:48.880> at<00:02:49.000> Louis<00:02:49.270> Vuitton<00:02:49.300> is<00:02:49.870> very<00:02:50.320> I

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
you can get at Louis Vuitton is very I

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.620 
you can get at Louis Vuitton is very I
guess<00:02:50.770> wide<00:02:51.610> at<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.790> base<00:02:52.060> which<00:02:52.330> means<00:02:52.570> you

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
guess wide at the base which means you

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.480 
guess wide at the base which means you
could<00:02:52.720> fit<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:52.960> lot<00:02:52.990> more<00:02:53.140> but<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.770> also<00:02:54.070> takes

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
could fit a lot more but it also takes

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.490 
could fit a lot more but it also takes
up<00:02:54.670> more<00:02:54.820> space<00:02:54.880> in<00:02:55.270> your<00:02:55.360> bag<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.750> I<00:02:56.230> really

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
up more space in your bag and I really

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.890 
up more space in your bag and I really
like<00:02:56.680> how<00:02:56.860> this<00:02:57.010> one<00:02:57.070> has<00:02:57.520> stayed<00:02:57.790> flat<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.450> I

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
like how this one has stayed flat and I

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.270 
like how this one has stayed flat and I
wasn't<00:02:59.080> really<00:02:59.260> using<00:02:59.620> it<00:02:59.680> for<00:02:59.830> anything<00:03:00.040> else

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
wasn't really using it for anything else

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.110 
wasn't really using it for anything else
so<00:03:00.610> it<00:03:01.360> worked<00:03:01.570> out<00:03:01.660> for<00:03:01.870> me<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.320> this<00:03:02.980> is<00:03:03.120> the

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
so it worked out for me and this is the

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.240 
so it worked out for me and this is the
stuff<00:03:04.360> that<00:03:04.390> comes<00:03:04.690> with<00:03:04.870> it<00:03:04.990> it's<00:03:05.350> completely

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
stuff that comes with it it's completely

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.600 
stuff that comes with it it's completely
white<00:03:06.460> because<00:03:06.760> I<00:03:06.790> haven't<00:03:07.030> used<00:03:07.180> it<00:03:08.340> ok<00:03:09.340> so<00:03:09.400> I

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
white because I haven't used it ok so I

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.060 
white because I haven't used it ok so I
know<00:03:09.760> how<00:03:10.000> I<00:03:10.030> just<00:03:10.060> mentioned<00:03:10.630> that<00:03:10.720> I<00:03:11.650> was

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
know how I just mentioned that I was

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.560 
know how I just mentioned that I was
worried<00:03:12.310> about<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.640> patina<00:03:13.030> on<00:03:13.150> this<00:03:13.420> bag

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
worried about the patina on this bag

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.810 
worried about the patina on this bag
when<00:03:13.780> I<00:03:13.810> had<00:03:14.050> this<00:03:14.890> in<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.310> bigger<00:03:15.550> version

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
when I had this in the bigger version

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.850 
when I had this in the bigger version
but<00:03:16.330> what<00:03:16.870> I<00:03:16.900> really<00:03:17.260> wanted<00:03:17.620> was<00:03:17.710> a

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
but what I really wanted was a

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.060 
but what I really wanted was a
monogrammed<00:03:18.690> shoulder<00:03:19.690> bag<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.200> I<00:03:20.590> tried<00:03:20.890> on

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
monogrammed shoulder bag and I tried on

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.920 
monogrammed shoulder bag and I tried on
the<00:03:21.100> artsy<00:03:21.700> I<00:03:21.730> tried<00:03:22.000> on<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.150> delightful<00:03:22.750> but

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
the artsy I tried on the delightful but

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.690 
the artsy I tried on the delightful but
it<00:03:23.050> didn't<00:03:23.290> fit<00:03:23.440> on<00:03:23.560> my<00:03:23.710> shoulders<00:03:24.100> very<00:03:24.460> well

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
it didn't fit on my shoulders very well

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.790 
it didn't fit on my shoulders very well
and<00:03:25.090> I<00:03:25.300> found<00:03:25.450> that<00:03:25.660> these<00:03:25.780> straps<00:03:26.200> go<00:03:26.590> on<00:03:26.710> my

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
and I found that these straps go on my

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.740 
and I found that these straps go on my
shoulder<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.220> best<00:03:27.490> and<00:03:27.760> so<00:03:28.300> when<00:03:28.480> I<00:03:28.510> bought

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
shoulder the best and so when I bought

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.840 
shoulder the best and so when I bought
this<00:03:28.900> bag<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:29.410> had<00:03:29.770> the<00:03:29.950> idea<00:03:30.070> that<00:03:30.310> it<00:03:30.550> would<00:03:30.640> be

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
this bag I had the idea that it would be

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.630 
this bag I had the idea that it would be
sort<00:03:31.270> of<00:03:31.360> a<00:03:31.510> mid-sized<00:03:32.260> smallish<00:03:33.070> shoulder

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
sort of a mid-sized smallish shoulder

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.850 
sort of a mid-sized smallish shoulder

that this is a really good investment
and<00:04:36.289> at<00:04:36.439> the<00:04:36.530> time<00:04:36.860> that<00:04:37.250> I<00:04:37.310> bought<00:04:37.610> it<00:04:37.870> this

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
was the only one that was left so I know

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.369 
was the only one that was left so I know
that<00:04:42.139> it's<00:04:42.889> very<00:04:43.129> popular<00:04:43.310> okay<00:04:44.030> so<00:04:44.719> my<00:04:45.229> other

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:45.379 
that it's very popular okay so my other

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:48.249 
that it's very popular okay so my other
two<00:04:45.680> bags<00:04:45.979> are<00:04:46.310> the<00:04:47.060> one<00:04:47.210> in<00:04:47.360> Azure<00:04:47.569> print<00:04:48.050> and

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259 
two bags are the one in Azure print and

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.200 
two bags are the one in Azure print and
the<00:04:48.469> monogram<00:04:48.889> and<00:04:48.919> they're<00:04:49.159> both<00:04:49.280> 25<00:04:49.819> as<00:04:50.000> well

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
the monogram and they're both 25 as well

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.920 
the monogram and they're both 25 as well
and<00:04:50.509> I<00:04:51.439> guess<00:04:51.860> I<00:04:52.069> had<00:04:52.370> thought<00:04:52.669> about<00:04:52.930> getting

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
and I guess I had thought about getting

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.360 
and I guess I had thought about getting
these<00:04:54.110> ones<00:04:54.319> in<00:04:54.469> the<00:04:54.560> been<00:04:54.710> earlier<00:04:55.009> version

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
these ones in the been earlier version

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.459 
these ones in the been earlier version
as<00:04:55.490> well<00:04:55.520> but<00:04:56.330> I<00:04:56.360> figured<00:04:56.689> since<00:04:56.719> I<00:04:56.990> had<00:04:57.199> this

00:04:57.459 --> 00:04:57.469 
as well but I figured since I had this

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:59.350 
as well but I figured since I had this
one<00:04:57.830> that<00:04:58.189> these<00:04:58.550> ones<00:04:58.789> can<00:04:58.969> be<00:04:59.000> handheld

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
one that these ones can be handheld

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.850 
one that these ones can be handheld
because<00:04:59.659> I<00:04:59.719> used<00:04:59.960> these<00:05:00.199> a<00:05:00.259> lot<00:05:00.560> less

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
because I used these a lot less

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.450 
because I used these a lot less
frequently<00:05:01.569> so<00:05:02.569> I<00:05:02.960> bought<00:05:03.500> both<00:05:03.830> I<00:05:04.099> bought<00:05:04.340> all

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
frequently so I bought both I bought all

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.219 
frequently so I bought both I bought all

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
buy it in you because I was worried

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.980 
buy it in you because I was worried
about<00:05:21.520> the<00:05:22.520> patina<00:05:22.849> again<00:05:23.210> and<00:05:23.419> I<00:05:23.479> figured<00:05:23.840> if

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
about the patina again and I figured if

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.540 
about the patina again and I figured if
it<00:05:24.139> was<00:05:24.259> already<00:05:24.500> had<00:05:25.039> a<00:05:25.069> little<00:05:25.310> bit<00:05:25.460> of

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
it was already had a little bit of

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.719 
it was already had a little bit of
patina<00:05:25.849> then<00:05:26.449> I<00:05:26.840> would<00:05:27.500> feel<00:05:27.889> more<00:05:28.129> carefree

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
patina then I would feel more carefree

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.709 
patina then I would feel more carefree
to<00:05:28.909> use<00:05:29.089> it<00:05:29.270> and<00:05:30.039> this<00:05:31.039> one<00:05:31.370> is<00:05:31.759> made<00:05:32.389> in<00:05:32.539> France

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:32.719 
to use it and this one is made in France

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:34.839 
to use it and this one is made in France
okay<00:05:33.259> this<00:05:33.379> one's<00:05:33.560> made<00:05:33.680> in<00:05:33.800> u.s.<00:05:34.099> and<00:05:34.339> this

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849 
okay this one's made in u.s. and this

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:36.790 
okay this one's made in u.s. and this
was<00:05:35.000> also<00:05:35.150> made<00:05:35.360> in<00:05:35.449> u.s.<00:05:35.719> and<00:05:35.900> then<00:05:36.409> this<00:05:36.589> bag

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
was also made in u.s. and then this bag

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.680 
was also made in u.s. and then this bag
is<00:05:36.919> my<00:05:37.069> monogram<00:05:37.520> print<00:05:37.849> bag<00:05:38.089> and<00:05:38.389> this<00:05:38.569> is

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
is my monogram print bag and this is

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.589 
is my monogram print bag and this is
probably<00:05:38.900> the<00:05:39.139> oldest<00:05:39.589> oldest<00:05:40.430> speedy<00:05:41.180> out<00:05:41.449> of

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:41.599 
probably the oldest oldest speedy out of

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:46.659 
probably the oldest oldest speedy out of
these<00:05:41.779> three<00:05:42.080> I<00:05:42.379> think<00:05:43.129> it<00:05:43.460> was<00:05:43.639> made<00:05:44.539> in<00:05:45.669> 2007

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
these three I think it was made in 2007

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.240 
these three I think it was made in 2007
perhaps<00:05:47.180> and<00:05:47.509> I<00:05:48.110> really<00:05:48.349> wanted<00:05:48.620> a<00:05:48.740> bag<00:05:48.919> during

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
perhaps and I really wanted a bag during

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.029 
perhaps and I really wanted a bag during
that<00:05:49.370> time<00:05:49.639> because<00:05:50.000> I<00:05:50.300> feel<00:05:50.779> like<00:05:50.810> the<00:05:51.379> canvas

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 
that time because I feel like the canvas

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:54.909 
that time because I feel like the canvas
was<00:05:52.729> a<00:05:52.759> lot<00:05:53.029> thicker<00:05:53.330> than<00:05:53.689> like<00:05:54.110> it<00:05:54.379> just<00:05:54.589> it

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
was a lot thicker than like it just it

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:56.619 
was a lot thicker than like it just it
feels<00:05:55.159> different<00:05:55.580> even<00:05:55.699> like<00:05:55.939> these<00:05:56.120> three<00:05:56.479> it

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:56.629 
feels different even like these three it

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:02.140 
feels different even like these three it
feels<00:05:56.839> different<00:05:57.349> and<00:05:58.629> I<00:06:00.219> initially<00:06:01.219> had<00:06:01.789> a

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
feels different and I initially had a

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.050 
feels different and I initially had a
Louis<00:06:02.839> Vuitton<00:06:02.870> speedy<00:06:03.710> monogram<00:06:04.699> in<00:06:04.939> the

Louis Vuitton speedy monogram in the
size<00:06:05.270> 30<00:06:05.750> and<00:06:06.080> that<00:06:06.529> was<00:06:06.710> my<00:06:06.860> very<00:06:06.919> first

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
size 30 and that was my very first

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.260 
size 30 and that was my very first
designer<00:06:08.060> bag<00:06:08.360> I<00:06:08.719> bought<00:06:09.289> it<00:06:09.439> from<00:06:09.939> Saks<00:06:10.939> Fifth

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270

Avenue<00:06:11.330> in<00:06:12.080> New<00:06:12.439> York<00:06:12.469> and<00:06:13.009> I<00:06:13.639> was<00:06:13.849> very

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
Avenue in New York and I was very

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.029

excited<00:06:14.389> about<00:06:14.629> the<00:06:14.839> bag<00:06:15.050> and<00:06:15.409> I<00:06:15.680> think<00:06:15.889> like

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039 
excited about the bag and I think like

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:17.740 
excited about the bag and I think like
everybody<00:06:16.310> else<00:06:16.639> once<00:06:16.879> you<00:06:17.029> get<00:06:17.150> that<00:06:17.300> bag<00:06:17.509> you

everybody else once you get that bag you

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.689 
everybody else once you get that bag you
feel<00:06:18.020> like<00:06:18.289> that's<00:06:18.889> the<00:06:19.009> olden<00:06:19.339> bag<00:06:19.520> that

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:19.699 
feel like that's the olden bag that

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:22.119 
feel like that's the olden bag that
you're<00:06:19.789> ever<00:06:19.969> gonna<00:06:20.120> need<00:06:20.479> and<00:06:20.870> I<00:06:21.740> guess<00:06:21.919> what

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:22.129 
you're ever gonna need and I guess what

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:24.279 
you're ever gonna need and I guess what
happened<00:06:22.520> with<00:06:22.639> it<00:06:22.789> eventually<00:06:23.180> is<00:06:23.569> that<00:06:23.839> one

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:24.289 
happened with it eventually is that one

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:26.260 
happened with it eventually is that one
day<00:06:24.469> I<00:06:24.500> was<00:06:24.680> washing<00:06:24.919> my<00:06:25.099> hands<00:06:25.490> and<00:06:25.729> I<00:06:26.029> kind<00:06:26.240> of

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
day I was washing my hands and I kind of

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.480 
day I was washing my hands and I kind of
went<00:06:26.419> like<00:06:26.509> this<00:06:26.870> and<00:06:27.139> I<00:06:27.680> got<00:06:27.860> a<00:06:27.919> few<00:06:28.250> water

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
went like this and I got a few water

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.300 
went like this and I got a few water
marks<00:06:28.909> on<00:06:29.060> the<00:06:29.270> handle<00:06:29.719> and<00:06:29.870> I<00:06:30.379> guess<00:06:30.860> I<00:06:31.009> didn't

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.310 
marks on the handle and I guess I didn't

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.029 
marks on the handle and I guess I didn't
know<00:06:31.520> that<00:06:31.879> the<00:06:32.389> patina<00:06:32.719> process<00:06:33.259> happens<00:06:33.740> and

know that the patina process happens and

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:38.040 
know that the patina process happens and

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
I try to wipe it off and I made it worse

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.529 
I try to wipe it off and I made it worse
and<00:06:38.139> overall<00:06:38.949> it<00:06:39.490> wasn't<00:06:39.669> that<00:06:39.849> bad<00:06:40.060> after<00:06:40.270> it

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:40.539 
and overall it wasn't that bad after it

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:42.540 
and overall it wasn't that bad after it
dried<00:06:40.870> but<00:06:41.199> I<00:06:41.379> got<00:06:41.620> scared<00:06:41.919> of<00:06:42.069> the<00:06:42.129> bag<00:06:42.310> and<00:06:42.490> I

this<00:07:10.090> is<00:07:10.240> definitely<00:07:10.419> one<00:07:10.780> of<00:07:11.020> them<00:07:11.610> because<00:07:12.610> I

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 
this is definitely one of them because I

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:14.219 
this is definitely one of them because I
feel<00:07:12.729> like<00:07:12.909> when<00:07:13.210> I<00:07:13.240> was<00:07:13.419> selling<00:07:13.719> that<00:07:13.840> bag<00:07:14.080> I

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:14.229 
feel like when I was selling that bag I

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:15.570 
feel like when I was selling that bag I
was<00:07:14.349> really<00:07:14.620> trying<00:07:14.770> to<00:07:14.860> convince<00:07:15.069> the<00:07:15.370> girl

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:15.580 
was really trying to convince the girl

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.719 
was really trying to convince the girl
to<00:07:15.729> go<00:07:15.879> for<00:07:16.180> it<00:07:16.270> and<00:07:17.099> really<00:07:18.099> I<00:07:18.129> felt<00:07:18.460> like<00:07:18.610> it

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:18.729 
to go for it and really I felt like it

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:20.850 
to go for it and really I felt like it
cheapened<00:07:19.120> my<00:07:19.240> experience<00:07:19.840> because<00:07:20.020> that<00:07:20.409> bag

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:20.860 
cheapened my experience because that bag

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.249 
cheapened my experience because that bag
had<00:07:21.069> more<00:07:21.340> value<00:07:21.550> more<00:07:22.090> sentimental<00:07:22.960> value<00:07:23.229> to

00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:23.259 
had more value more sentimental value to

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:25.950 
had more value more sentimental value to
me<00:07:23.500> than<00:07:23.680> it<00:07:23.770> did<00:07:23.889> to<00:07:24.069> her<00:07:24.280> and<00:07:24.550> I<00:07:25.419> wish<00:07:25.719> that<00:07:25.900> I

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:25.960 
me than it did to her and I wish that I

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.499 
me than it did to her and I wish that I
had<00:07:25.990> kept<00:07:26.349> it<00:07:26.469> for<00:07:26.680> that<00:07:26.800> reason<00:07:27.449> okay<00:07:28.449> so
