00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:09.550
 we continue we have made ourselves first 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:13.380
 help can be safely continued in the past 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:17.769
 parts I tried very cruel with us 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:21.159
 did 75 after all cuts they are 85 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:23.829
 but this again I repeat the sharpening of 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:27.009
 boxes will be interesting to look at 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:32.529
 him just sharpening more or less say 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:39.900
 well and scored well and after it goes all 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:39.900
 favorite knife mora 2000 on a sandwich blade 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.320
 let's see what he tells us Scandinavian 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.810
 so about sharpening here i am you 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.830
 Hard to say because this and 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.600
 this knife as usual for me long pastry my 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:04.839
 good friend andrew 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:06.850
 knee 19 then this is my tachila Selenite 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.820
 I was treated I do not know but she cuts the paper 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.780
 hair shaves so basically you can 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.880
 to continue the test using 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:24.380
 Well, I went in principle very very 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:02:08.479
 even interesting 1 2 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:02:13.640
 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 20 23 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:19.540
 tomorrow's cuts she doesn't read cruel 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:24.489
 Of course with regard to the rope naturally 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.489
 all without any effort problems 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.410
 now we wipe the adhesive off 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.410
 piece of paper 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:03:10.090
 20 cuts here is some kind of chain 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:21.299
 there is but while you can work and while 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:34.000
 you can work safely on two or three times 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:36.189
 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.480
 especially nice to cut forcing then 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:39.480
 is she coping with it without any problems 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:04:17.829
 30 cuts let's do another ten and 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:04:20.130
 let's see two times three 4 5 six 7 10 by 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:25.870
 I read the burial service at this sendrik 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:28.840
 look at the number of paper means not to 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:32.710
 there were issues rubbing with cotton dipped 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:36.240
 acetone for the glue to go off right away 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.240
 do not lose neither mine nor your time 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.870
 while cutting 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:05:03.510
 conquer so 40 cuts went well cut 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:05:13.860
 much harder than the first test 1 3 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:13.860
 4 5 6 7 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:35.800
 eight nine ten no continue 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:38.990
 let's look at 10 more cuts as opposed to 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:44.140
 cruel she went very early on 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:06:01.840
 confidently and now she is not going now 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:06:01.840
 pushed but cuts cuts me completely 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:15.970
 all lands there everything is clear 50 cuts on 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:20.570
 my 16 mm rope tag 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:24.590
 wrapped masking tape with my 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:28.100
 sharpening conditions but not in this case 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:31.130
 In this case, before sharpening out of the box and not 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.380
 for this knife naturally this knife by 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:37.700
 I already ruled because yuzany 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:40.340
 unlike jessica, then we â€™ll see 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:45.260
 that will show us pieces of wood and in general 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:48.470
 convenience of working with these knives i think 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.510
 it will be interesting at least to me 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:54.620
 personally to me as a user 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.180
 it was always interesting hard work for 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:00.710
 the knife 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:05.360
 rather than warez though I agree it is not 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:07.490
 the latest condition is possible for you 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.860
 the very first thing for the knife but for me 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:12.110
 still it would be more interesting to force 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.930
 some work on planing let's see 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.880
 pick and break 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:20.539
 but thank you all so much for 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:24.289
 time spent if there is any 

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:27.020
 claims by the test is ready it 

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:30.970
 all listen well and apply the future 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.970
 thanks for watching bye
