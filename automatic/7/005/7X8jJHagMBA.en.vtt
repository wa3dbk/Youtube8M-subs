 easyjet title 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:20.169
 he was his lover 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.689
 m tsahal 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.289
 you are here I am made to choose 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.289
 the files 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.740
 3 so j 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.380
 in fact 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.330
 in the duel that had sparked a huge site it works a bit like a 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.500
 wii remote is a motion detector so to replace it 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.050
 drought 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.430
 we believe 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.030
 what is the best 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.030
 and in dance 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.900
 we start again 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.750
 at the moment of sylvie launch well these three meters 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.590
 it's over just world 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.010
 with combined motion detectors 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.760
 here 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.110
 launched he posted as cisse his shopping a real Swiss we're going 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.110
 try in our game 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.460
 to show you that it works all here fishing 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.040
 even because it's the same thing 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.460
 we see the fish or 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.410
 we will wait for them to come 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.640
 the shoe 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.640
 ambience 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.210
 we are waiting again 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.310
 and we will do exactly what a fisherman does 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.760
 when his death 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:12.279
 normally it works 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:18.999
 here 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:21.129
 so you have six different games 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.439
 and if exactly the same accelerator operating mode of 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.959
 movement percent and percent 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.099
 and even with that it detects a movement 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:32.999
 Well, that's all for today
