00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
almost free spooling by me I can put my

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.730 
almost free spooling by me I can put my
thumb<00:01:44.690> on<00:01:44.720> it<00:01:44.930> real<00:01:45.080> hard<00:01:45.110> where<00:01:45.470> it<00:01:45.530> doesn't

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
thumb on it real hard where it doesn't

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.710 
thumb on it real hard where it doesn't
move<00:01:45.800> at<00:01:45.920> all<00:01:46.010> or<00:01:46.610> I<00:01:46.640> can<00:01:46.850> let<00:01:47.090> line<00:01:47.300> out<00:01:47.510> and

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
move at all or I can let line out and

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.550 
move at all or I can let line out and
this<00:01:47.840> allows<00:01:48.200> me<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:49.060> basically<00:01:50.560> determine

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
this allows me to basically determine

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.260 
this allows me to basically determine
how<00:01:51.710> much<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.130> line<00:01:52.280> on<00:01:52.430> one<00:01:52.580> out<00:01:52.610> or<00:01:53.000> how<00:01:53.150> much

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
how much the line on one out or how much

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.610 
how much the line on one out or how much
tension<00:01:53.510> I<00:01:53.660> want<00:01:53.870> on<00:01:53.930> that<00:01:53.960> reel<00:01:54.230> rather<00:01:54.440> than

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
tension I want on that reel rather than

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.710 
tension I want on that reel rather than
kind<00:01:55.010> of<00:01:55.100> turn<00:01:55.370> up<00:01:55.550> and<00:01:55.760> turn<00:01:55.790> down<00:01:55.940> my<00:01:56.210> drag<00:01:56.450> I

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
kind of turn up and turn down my drag I

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.670 
kind of turn up and turn down my drag I
can<00:01:57.080> maintain<00:01:57.800> what<00:01:58.640> I<00:01:58.670> really<00:01:58.970> want<00:01:59.210> it<00:01:59.270> to<00:01:59.330> be

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
can maintain what I really want it to be

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.080 
can maintain what I really want it to be
by<00:02:00.680> my<00:02:00.890> thumb<00:02:01.130> and<00:02:01.310> that's<00:02:01.460> basically<00:02:01.940> how<00:02:02.060> we

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
by my thumb and that's basically how we

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.040 
by my thumb and that's basically how we
call<00:02:02.330> it<00:02:02.360> thumb<00:02:02.600> boring

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
call it thumb boring

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.170 
call it thumb boring
because<00:02:03.500> you're<00:02:03.650> using<00:02:03.890> your<00:02:04.010> thumb<00:02:04.370> to

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
because you're using your thumb to

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.670 
because you're using your thumb to
determine<00:02:06.050> how<00:02:06.110> much<00:02:06.230> tension

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
determine how much tension

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.800 
determine how much tension
oh<00:02:06.770> my<00:02:07.040> guys<00:02:07.250> are<00:02:07.460> all<00:02:07.490> over<00:02:07.730> place<00:02:08.000> determine

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
oh my guys are all over place determine

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.930 
oh my guys are all over place determine
how<00:02:08.869> much<00:02:08.990> tension<00:02:09.230> you<00:02:09.980> have<00:02:10.220> on<00:02:10.460> your<00:02:10.610> spool

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
how much tension you have on your spool

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.430 
how much tension you have on your spool
and<00:02:11.330> so<00:02:11.480> when<00:02:11.600> that<00:02:11.660> fish<00:02:11.870> comes<00:02:12.080> up<00:02:12.200> there<00:02:12.350> and

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
and so when that fish comes up there and

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.930 
and so when that fish comes up there and
he's<00:02:12.800> really<00:02:13.100> fighting<00:02:13.250> you<00:02:13.550> know<00:02:13.580> he's<00:02:13.790> only
