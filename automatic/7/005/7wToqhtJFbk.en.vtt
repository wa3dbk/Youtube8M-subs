now what we're planning on doing though

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.339 
now what we're planning on doing though
is<00:00:26.460> turning<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> computer<00:00:28.109> disk

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
is turning this in to a computer disk

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.800 
is turning this in to a computer disk
the<00:00:29.070> first<00:00:29.340> step<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.789> removing<00:00:30.359> some<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
there's the matter of all the holes left

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.389 
there's the matter of all the holes left
behind<00:00:42.600> by<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:42.989> missing<00:00:43.469> Hardware<00:00:43.920> I'm

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
behind by the missing Hardware I'm

feeling<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.940> biggest<00:00:45.360> part<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> void

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
feeling the biggest part of the void

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.560 
feeling the biggest part of the void
with<00:00:46.320> wood<00:00:46.590> before<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:47.129> start<00:00:47.460> mixing<00:00:47.910> up<00:00:48.239> some

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
with wood before I start mixing up some

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.779 
with wood before I start mixing up some
auto<00:00:48.809> body<00:00:49.200> filler<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.890> finish<00:00:50.250> patching<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
auto body filler to finish patching the

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.450 
auto body filler to finish patching the
holes<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.719> stuff<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.230> often<00:00:52.680> referred<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.070> by

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
holes this stuff is often referred to by

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.000 
holes this stuff is often referred to by
the<00:00:53.520> trade<00:00:53.969> name<00:00:54.000> bondo<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.110> it'll<00:00:55.469> dry<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.739> an

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
the trade name bondo and it'll dry to an

the trade name bondo and it'll dry to an
extremely<00:00:56.730> hard<00:00:57.000> finish<00:00:57.300> really<00:00:57.719> fast<00:00:58.079> so

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
extremely hard finish really fast so

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.139 
extremely hard finish really fast so
it's<00:00:58.800> perfect<00:00:59.370> for<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.609> kind<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.910> project

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
it's perfect for this kind of project

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.090 
it's perfect for this kind of project
but<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.870> don't<00:01:01.199> want<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.440> leave<00:01:01.620> too<00:01:01.920> much

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
but you don't want to leave too much

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.490 
but you don't want to leave too much
excess<00:01:02.730> because<00:01:03.239> you'll<00:01:03.750> end<00:01:03.899> up<00:01:04.080> having<00:01:04.470> to

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
excess because you'll end up having to

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.160 
excess because you'll end up having to
sand<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.189> all<00:01:05.309> off<00:01:05.610> once<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.150> dry<00:01:06.390> because

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
sand it all off once it's dry because

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.440 
sand it all off once it's dry because
its<00:01:07.619> strength<00:01:07.920> some<00:01:08.220> as<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.610> dries<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:08.909> often

its strength some as it dries it often

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.450 
its strength some as it dries it often

old<00:01:46.770> there's<00:01:47.189> quite<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> bit<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.909> flaking<00:01:48.450> paint

that has to be scraped off and of course

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.780 
that has to be scraped off and of course
that<00:01:51.840> means<00:01:52.170> more<00:01:52.740> sanding

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
that means more sanding

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.410 
setting them out on the door to put them
together<00:02:04.619> really<00:02:05.130> helps<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.579> ensure<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.060> the

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
all right Alan this shouldn't take much

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.210 
all right Alan this shouldn't take much
installation<00:04:24.200> at<00:04:24.320> all<00:04:24.440> huh<00:04:24.740> I<00:04:24.800> think<00:04:25.040> this<00:04:25.160> is

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
installation at all huh I think this is

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.010 
installation at all huh I think this is
gonna<00:04:25.340> be<00:04:25.430> as<00:04:25.520> simplest<00:04:25.970> you<00:04:26.360> find<00:04:26.630> the<00:04:26.780> spot

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
gonna be as simplest you find the spot

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.290 
gonna be as simplest you find the spot
and<00:04:27.050> set<00:04:27.920> it<00:04:28.040> in<00:04:28.130> place<00:04:28.160> that's<00:04:28.760> a<00:04:28.940> pretty<00:04:29.120> good

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
and set it in place that's a pretty good

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.880 
and set it in place that's a pretty good
spot<00:04:29.570> because<00:04:30.050> you<00:04:30.200> know<00:04:30.320> in<00:04:30.380> a<00:04:30.440> living<00:04:30.710> room

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
spot because you know in a living room

spot because you know in a living room
like<00:04:31.040> this<00:04:31.250> people<00:04:31.670> really<00:04:32.000> don't<00:04:32.180> tend<00:04:32.420> to

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
like this people really don't tend to

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.600 
like this people really don't tend to
use<00:04:32.900> it<00:04:33.140> as<00:04:33.260> much<00:04:33.410> as<00:04:33.590> they<00:04:33.710> do<00:04:33.770> other<00:04:34.040> rooms<00:04:34.400> in

use it as much as they do other rooms in

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.550 
use it as much as they do other rooms in
their<00:04:34.760> house<00:04:34.970> and<00:04:35.300> to<00:04:35.750> have<00:04:35.930> this<00:04:36.140> right<00:04:36.440> in
