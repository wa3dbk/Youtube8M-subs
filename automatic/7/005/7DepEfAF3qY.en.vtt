00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.129
 hello with you alex forehead stars and today 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.250
 I would like to talk about tanks 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.980
 but in general all of a sudden yes and if more precisely then 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.380
 on those who play in them are familiar to everyone 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.840
 Bottom rachÑ‘ deer and huntsman 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.970
 developers at the request to cut this 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.239
 class of players somewhere on the reservation 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.430
 stated two things firstly if all these 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.980
 evolution errors send to the bottom 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.590
 where they will have an adequate place 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.020
 half an hour wait for inputs pain and they say it is not 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.859
 Good here I actually with the developers 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.480
 I agree spit I'm waiting for 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:50.629
 15-minute battle on the strap-on 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.390
 cheap sex shop but it was announced yet 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.850
 one thing that supposedly unsuccessful people 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.370
 It will not be interesting to play when 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.230
 enemy team guys from top clans 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.350
 we have Alexey Kalinchik 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.600
 and Andrew, born in 2005 who 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.120
 spent 25 thousand battles 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.670
 not a damn thing learned to play and merge 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.040
 in the first minutes of battle on their tops and 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.439
 you have to twist the last 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.600
 body pulls out again extras 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.000
 that uvochkova would envy 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.530
 and yet you merge because 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.040
 support has already died 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:28.310
 something I was not interested to play seemed 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.680
 would have something to do with this no answer with 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.539
 than i totally disagree and want 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.350
 present you with your concept 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:38.090
 mental development and skill enhancement 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.399
 actually this concept is applicable 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.829
 absolutely to any phenomenon not 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.759
 necessarily tiger but we are talking now 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.729
 about tanks 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.520
 Hear what I propose in the first place 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.930
 during registration hold 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.450
 psychological test still passed 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.280
 are in school every year for me personally or 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.649
 never called to a psychologist that 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.530
 pushes the idea that I'm still 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:03.140
 passed but I personally saw some 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.500
 asked to come up and this will be the first step 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.119
 to the removal of the most vulnerable brains lady and 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.039
 spare zones for them 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.770
 next we need from those people 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.310
 who cannot decide for themselves what 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.720
 it is better 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.080
 these are children under 12 and teenagers from 2 on 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.180
 children under 16 to activate account in 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.100
 I propose to introduce the game to mandatory 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.460
 item notarized 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.790
 photocopy of passport for people over 16 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.970
 years old 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.980
 for teenagers from 12 to 16 years 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.200
 mandatory item will be written 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.690
 parental permission indicating 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.360
 time limit on being in 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.060
 playing in this way children under 12 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.340
 just won't be able to enter the game and 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.920
 this way they will have more time 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.830
 on the self-development of the country will be less 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.170
 sozhennyh chairs and so how to deal with 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.000
 we have already defined the risk group as 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.100
 deal with a successful society 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.630
 businessmen and billionaires who 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.300
 over 16 years old 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.420
 on monkeys and it came out in development further 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.600
 their example we take the scenario of the most intelligent 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.030
 namely, a block of general questions and pounding 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.459
 it to the base under the program which will be 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.650
 run after login to the game and 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.080
 suggest answering the question for 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.090
 most developed populations answer 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.790
 such questions will not make much 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.280
 labor well or at least not make 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.800
 labor google the question everything takes not 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.650
 more than a couple of minutes and not much in the way 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.540
 game process but for those who are all 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.560
 will still try to cram a cube 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.180
 round hole I will become a barrier 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.760
 so irresistible elite 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.230
 Allowed tigers will become people with well 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.590
 developed intelligence 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.540
 billionaires in words and nurse no longer 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.730
 will interfere with play and will not 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.780
 to annoy players with your presence 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.060
 both teams 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.700
 communities will become much more cultured 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.070
 parenting and will be much more respectful 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.790
 treat each other well and in the end 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.290
 anyway even after all these 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.870
 restrictions in the game still leak out 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.660
 hands that are nevertheless pretty 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.450
 adequate people for these suggest 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.269
 introduce the next sentence for 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.340
 the next 25 years to them so the player must 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.799
 will for example write an article 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.959
 about anything on the network MSU game 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.859
 This article will be posted on the site. 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.930
 games 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.110
 until then he will be blocked 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.969
 access to the game 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.610
 so the person will start 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:31.189
 think about how best to act 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.050
 in certain gaming moments not to 

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:35.629
 put on another article 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.090
 thus increasing your skill also 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:40.580
 the person will develop as well 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.830
 will do good for the whole community 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.409
 since the article will be helpful and either 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.439
 novice players or those who are few 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:50.240
 familiar with the article covered in general 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:52.939
 everyone will only get better 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.669
 and being a gamer will be even more prestigious 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:58.639
 since gamers will be smart people 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:01.699
 what is this concept I wanted with you 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.810
 I hope to share a similar idea visited 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:05.210
 they are me alone 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.569
 well, or at least you support my 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.729
 point of view if you liked the release 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:12.680
 like and subscribe to the channel 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.349

 VKontakte all links in the description 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.909
