00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
lamp in front of the details it's still

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.180 
lamp in front of the details it's still
tight<00:02:34.480> oh<00:02:34.840> that's<00:02:35.770> a<00:02:35.890> cam<00:02:36.160> position<00:02:36.370> sensor

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
tight oh that's a cam position sensor

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.560 
tight oh that's a cam position sensor
the<00:02:39.190> probably<00:02:39.580> has<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.790> do<00:02:39.940> with<00:02:40.030> firing<00:02:40.300> all

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
the probably has to do with firing all

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.400 
the probably has to do with firing all
those<00:02:40.750> coils

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
those coils

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.760 
those coils
yeah<00:02:42.100> just<00:02:42.520> for<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:42.970> timing<00:02:43.270> build<00:02:43.600> wear<00:02:43.870> so

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
yeah just for the timing build wear so

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.740 
yeah just for the timing build wear so
now<00:02:45.130> I<00:02:45.160> have<00:02:45.550> to<00:02:45.760> take<00:02:46.030> off<00:02:46.270> all<00:02:46.420> those<00:02:46.540> other
