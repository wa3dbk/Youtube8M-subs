00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
backflip is in its unique design where

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.990 
backflip is in its unique design where
it<00:02:48.060> has<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:49.019> key<00:02:49.230> keypad<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.459> full<00:02:50.700> keypad

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
it has the key keypad the full keypad

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.449 
it has the key keypad the full keypad
keyboard<00:02:51.720> on<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.290> back<00:02:52.530> of<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.010> that's

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
keyboard on the back of it and that's

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.199 
keyboard on the back of it and that's
only<00:02:53.670> one<00:02:53.910> with<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.629> only<00:02:54.840> way<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.019> rotate<00:02:55.470> it

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
only one with the only way to rotate it

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.880 
only one with the only way to rotate it
so<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.959> camera<00:02:58.319> is<00:02:58.349> on<00:02:58.879> the<00:02:59.879> keyboard<00:03:00.239> here

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
so the camera is on the keyboard here

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.819 
so the camera is on the keyboard here
let's<00:03:01.890> go<00:03:02.040> back<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.250> home<00:03:06.560> another<00:03:07.560> thing

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
let's go back to home another thing

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.880 
let's go back to home another thing
about<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.190> helm<00:03:09.049> control<00:03:10.049> our<00:03:10.170> backflip<00:03:10.650> in

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
about the helm control our backflip in

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.259 
about the helm control our backflip in
is<00:03:11.549> they<00:03:12.299> are<00:03:12.650> alternative<00:03:13.910> navigation<00:03:14.910> here

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
is they are alternative navigation here

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.680 
is they are alternative navigation here
that<00:03:15.989> you<00:03:16.139> can<00:03:16.290> navigate<00:03:16.470> on<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.040> screen<00:03:17.370> by

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
that you can navigate on the screen by

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.009 
that you can navigate on the screen by
moving<00:03:18.690> your<00:03:18.840> fingers<00:03:19.290> headed<00:03:20.130> back<00:03:20.250> off<00:03:20.489> the

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
moving your fingers headed back off the

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.410 
moving your fingers headed back off the
device<00:03:22.019> which<00:03:22.980> is<00:03:23.190> an<00:03:23.639> interesting<00:03:24.180> addition

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
device which is an interesting addition

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.610 
device which is an interesting addition
but<00:03:24.810> I'm<00:03:25.019> not<00:03:25.620> sure<00:03:25.650> how<00:03:25.859> practical<00:03:26.310> that<00:03:26.579> is

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
but I'm not sure how practical that is

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.500 
but I'm not sure how practical that is
so<00:03:28.620> here's<00:03:28.889> a<00:03:29.010> brief<00:03:29.340> comparison<00:03:29.910> of<00:03:30.299> these

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
so here's a brief comparison of these

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.670 
so here's a brief comparison of these
two<00:03:30.810> devices<00:03:31.410> in<00:03:32.000> terms<00:03:33.000> of<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.480> home<00:03:34.260> screen

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
two devices in terms of the home screen

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.360 
two devices in terms of the home screen
the<00:03:35.510> software<00:03:36.510> version<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.109> the<00:03:37.769> camera<00:03:38.190> and

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
the software version and the camera and

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.280 
the software version and the camera and
some<00:03:38.609> of<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.819> basic<00:03:39.150> designs<00:03:39.480> on<00:03:39.690> this<00:03:39.870> to
