00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.250
 he is now in this state let's say so in 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.489
 which his name was released that's how I would 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.890
 he was brought to mind the system perekaza 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.770
 because he was 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.630

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.940
 manned her a little bit 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.360
 and the part I brought it to its original appearance 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.010
 and that it should have been equestrian 58 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.630
 year made so on it and it is worth 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.420
