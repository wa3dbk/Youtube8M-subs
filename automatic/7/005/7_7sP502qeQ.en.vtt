00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.240 
I think that the team the players are
pretty<00:00:39.540> much<00:00:39.719> insulated<00:00:40.469> from<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:40.920> think<00:00:41.160> if

it<00:05:21.390> makes<00:05:21.690> no<00:05:21.960> sense<00:05:21.990> and<00:05:22.620> I<00:05:22.680> think<00:05:22.710> now<00:05:23.340> that

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
it makes no sense and I think now that

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.270 
it makes no sense and I think now that
this<00:05:23.730> man<00:05:23.970> has<00:05:24.270> been<00:05:24.300> in<00:05:24.480> criminally<00:05:25.110> indicted

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
he was pulling one over on UNC I think

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.000

biases absolutely I think you know Mary
I<00:06:28.909> think<00:06:29.120> the<00:06:29.360> evidence<00:06:29.569> is<00:06:29.780> very<00:06:29.870> clear<00:06:30.110> you

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:30.889 
I think the evidence is very clear you

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:32.409 
I think the evidence is very clear you
have<00:06:31.069> Danny<00:06:31.280> Caine<00:06:31.580> and<00:06:31.759> the<00:06:31.849> news<00:06:32.000> observer

have Danny Caine and the news observer
again<00:06:32.830> they've<00:06:33.830> brought<00:06:34.069> great<00:06:34.550> emails<00:06:35.449> and

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:35.780 
again they've brought great emails and

other things that showed there was

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.790 
other things that showed there was
discussions<00:06:37.569> again<00:06:38.569> I<00:06:38.810> don't<00:06:39.199> believe<00:06:39.770> that

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 
discussions again I don't believe that

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.040 
discussions again I don't believe that

there<00:07:02.870> are<00:07:03.020> no<00:07:03.050> easy<00:07:04.009> answers<00:07:04.190> for<00:07:05.090> this<00:07:05.210> team

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:05.509 
there are no easy answers for this team

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:08.320 
there are no easy answers for this team
I<00:07:05.539> think<00:07:06.020> that<00:07:06.229> the<00:07:07.159> players<00:07:07.460> right<00:07:07.849> now<00:07:08.090> are

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.330 
I think that the players right now are

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.999 
I think that the players right now are
just<00:07:08.389> kind<00:07:08.810> of<00:07:08.900> questioning<00:07:09.380> themselves<00:07:09.590> they

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:10.009 
just kind of questioning themselves they

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:11.860 
just kind of questioning themselves they
have<00:07:10.159> a<00:07:10.190> week<00:07:10.460> off<00:07:10.639> between<00:07:10.880> the<00:07:11.210> loss<00:07:11.840> that
