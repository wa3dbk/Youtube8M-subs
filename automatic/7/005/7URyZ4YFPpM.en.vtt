time and

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.460 
time and
yeah<00:01:57.980> if<00:01:58.980> you're<00:01:59.160> gonna<00:01:59.340> get<00:01:59.610> this<00:02:00.200> thing<00:02:01.200> I

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
yeah if you're gonna get this thing I

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.320 
yeah if you're gonna get this thing I

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330

so<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.720> way<00:02:06.930> they<00:02:07.200> don't<00:02:07.230> get<00:02:07.800> their<00:02:10.670> cage

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
so that way they don't get their cage

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.770 
so that way they don't get their cage
