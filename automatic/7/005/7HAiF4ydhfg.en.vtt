00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
know the truth and they probably would

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.730 
know the truth and they probably would
never<00:01:15.330> know<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.630> truth<00:01:15.810> as<00:01:15.960> explained<00:01:16.590> by

take<00:04:17.650> on<00:04:17.769> the<00:04:18.190> hidden<00:04:18.430> leaf<00:04:18.609> and<00:04:18.820> what<00:04:19.000> they've

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
take on the hidden leaf and what they've

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.150 
take on the hidden leaf and what they've
been<00:04:19.299> through<00:04:19.359> and<00:04:19.600> their<00:04:19.750> experiences<00:04:20.500> and<00:04:20.680> I

been through and their experiences and I

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.290 
been through and their experiences and I
think<00:04:21.370> it's<00:04:21.489> kind<00:04:21.640> of<00:04:21.669> like<00:04:21.789> one<00:04:22.090> of<00:04:22.180> those

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
think it's kind of like one of those

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.210 
think it's kind of like one of those
situations<00:04:22.479> where<00:04:22.840> as<00:04:23.020> I<00:04:23.200> guess<00:04:23.950> not<00:04:24.190> really

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
situations where as I guess not really

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.879 
situations where as I guess not really
grass<00:04:24.700> is<00:04:25.030> greener<00:04:25.390> on<00:04:25.539> the<00:04:25.690> other<00:04:25.780> side<00:04:25.960> but

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
grass is greener on the other side but

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.969 
grass is greener on the other side but
more<00:04:27.099> as<00:04:27.219> though<00:04:27.430> I<00:04:27.759> have<00:04:28.569> my<00:04:28.810> way<00:04:29.080> of<00:04:29.409> what<00:04:29.949> I

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
more as though I have my way of what I

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.529 
more as though I have my way of what I
feel<00:04:30.069> I<00:04:30.340> got<00:04:30.580> out<00:04:30.729> of<00:04:30.819> the<00:04:30.879> hidden<00:04:31.150> leaf<00:04:31.270> and

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:28.079 
though they handled they're pretty good
and<00:05:26.499> I<00:05:27.249> think<00:05:27.310> that<00:05:27.639> the<00:05:27.759> comment<00:05:28.029> on

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:28.089 
and I think that the comment on

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:30.480 
and I think that the comment on
flashback<00:05:28.539> is<00:05:29.050> actually<00:05:29.620> exciting<00:05:30.009> to<00:05:30.099> see<00:05:30.310> if

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490

they<00:05:30.759> can<00:05:30.939> handle<00:05:31.089> it<00:05:31.270> as<00:05:31.419> well<00:05:31.449> as<00:05:31.719> they<00:05:31.779> did

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
they can handle it as well as they did

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.540 
they can handle it as well as they did
