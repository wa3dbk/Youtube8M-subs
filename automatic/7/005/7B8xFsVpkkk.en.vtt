00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 battle team genre popular but 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.210
 somewhat monotonous appearance of the call of 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.820
 duty to counter strike 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.519
 everywhere gunfire grenades and 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.500
 other attributes of modernity in general 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.820
 very strange that the domestic panzar 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.250
 almost the first successful attempt 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.859
 make teams action fantasy 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.779
 according to the latest fashion panzar action with 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.720
 pumping for each fight hero 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.820
 accrued experience and gold and the ratio 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.769
 you can change the sliders and have to 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.119
 donate money to fast 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.880
 development or vice versa 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.130
 besides slaughtering heroes get resources 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.309
 to create armor and healing potions 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.469
 can use real for impatient 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.840
 who want searches and purchased 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.120
 the main action takes place on in combat 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.590
 maps from miniature meadows where 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.840
 teams fighting for capture 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.640
 single target up to challenging 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.610
 aren't a day long forgotten 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.710
 on the type of cards and depends on the rules of the game 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.050
 one they are elementary key point 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.719
 gives points to the team which is his day on 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.609
 other capture points are somewhat the same. 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.040
 the country is storming the other is protecting 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.070
 if normal team pain wall on 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.380
 wall the battles themselves are in spirit very 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.200
 similar to command sermons and from that 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.869
 same warcraft and or warhammer online us 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.850
 there are parameters of the character is, 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.250
 classic talent trees and items 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.439
 effort pool role but decides from nanny and 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.140
 quick response and generally the skill of playing 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.090
 action films kick your back for example on a lot in 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.610
 frontal egg plan who watches 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.440
 summer grass lives longer 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.510
 block departures also save a lot 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.860
 health and even a weak opponent tightly 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.070
 blocked and do not let the enemy to the rear 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.780
 help hold out until help 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.880
 besides traditional role health and 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.640
 mana here is the third parameter this 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.200
 energy it diverges to run fast and 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.610
 power strikes which are much 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.740
 more effective than ordinary 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.710
 I'm a newbie who just created 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.270
 your first hero and folders to battle all 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.000
 what is happening is likely to be 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.420
 remind pointless crowd meat 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.090
 running into the light someone rushes to the center 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.640
 cards there meets a crowd of enemies and 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.130
 gone-gone killed wait a few 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.100
 seconds and reborn in the same place 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.440
 or on the taken point we run to the center again 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.750
 cards of someone we wet from someone 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.450
 embrace and so on until you get bored 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.730
 but the first impression is very deceptive 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.890
 worth starting to pay attention to what 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.380
 going around and here it is clear that here 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.520
 something more is going on than a group 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.500
 ruby and beautiful 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.459
 it becomes obvious that without work 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.110
 team catching anything on the battlefield 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.269
 the group here is very sisters 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.730
 flashes then the elven ears of that 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.780
 calculate and how not kv-4 times and 2 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.730
 class for each 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.920
 menacing game of use on the skin and 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.910
 fanged tanks in one hand no jack 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.250
 another mountain shield 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.680
 tanks keeps hitting dots and 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.450
 draws chains of enemies but by 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.600
 useful ability magical defense 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.489
 which stops magic and bullets under 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.370
 the cover of the machine command goes forward 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.780
 like a siege machine around tanks 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.360
 usually jumps berserks 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.299
 also green-skinned arches but with 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.580
 double handed batons and no shields leaves 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.340
 the battle they break into to bash 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.430
 rapture left and right both those and others 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.010
 did nothing without treatment and for 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.850
 the backs of orcs usually run tails 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.970
 paladins in his hand scepter which he 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.130
 slaves or heals friends sneak around the corners 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.440
 inquisitors having caught the moment they leave in 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.960
 stealth term i'm hi wing hanging 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.390
 ira sudden powerful blow with two swords in 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.640
 back most often gets alfikom 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.890
 that isolate to fire magic or 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.550
 running in the thick of the battle tremor alive 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.710
 everyone on earth is forever businesslike and fussy 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.930
 gnomes bounces on mini walkers 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.640
 they put useful cdma 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.520
 install teleportator 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.530
 while others are cocked into a trap and mines are collected 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.420
 machine guns at strategic locations and 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.090
 send aside mortal 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.710
 lead gifts 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.170
 fun is probably the main thing that 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.510
 failed panzar developers would 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.370
 Of course it's great not only to get a fight 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.650
 well, an open world but its absence 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.520
 hardly a big problem for an amateur 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.520
 pure pvp
