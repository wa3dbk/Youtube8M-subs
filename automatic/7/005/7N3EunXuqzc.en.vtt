00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
a very important topic and I think I've

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.560 
a very important topic and I think I've
done<00:04:06.730> videos<00:04:06.910> similar<00:04:07.720> to<00:04:07.960> this<00:04:08.170> before<00:04:08.350> but<00:04:08.980> I

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
done videos similar to this before but I

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.690 
done videos similar to this before but I
think<00:04:10.570> it's<00:04:10.690> important<00:04:11.230> to<00:04:11.440> keep<00:04:11.890> talking<00:04:12.580> but

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
think it's important to keep talking but

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.270 
think it's important to keep talking but
making<00:04:13.030> videos<00:04:13.330> like<00:04:13.420> this<00:04:13.750> because<00:04:14.050> a<00:04:14.620> lot<00:04:15.250> of

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
making videos like this because a lot of

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.890 
making videos like this because a lot of
people<00:04:15.750> lose<00:04:16.750> motivation<00:04:16.959> for<00:04:17.500> working<00:04:17.770> out
