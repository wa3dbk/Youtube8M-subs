00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.369
 tricks 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.130
 what you need is a make-up product 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:20.080
 with which you can make an eyeliner and me 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.350
 there may be eye pencil and liquid 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.090
 eye liner or possibly a gel liner 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.350
 I'm going to use the lines from you 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.310

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.310
 and it looks like this 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.810
 it is a very intense dark brown 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.810
 eyeliner cream 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.780
 and I've already used it that can 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.580
 use natural black but if you 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.230
 not too hard to find you can also 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.400
 take a shade lighter so a moment will 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.980
 dark brown 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.870
 and the city just a little softer at the 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.780

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.700
 brush for eyeliner and I will 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.560
 also use this tutorial 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.900
 which is handy to have on hand 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.729
 a cotton swab or has it on 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.790
 moist tissue for any 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.470
 corrections with which the tower I also yoga 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.170
 this concealer palette of super looks 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.790
 you don't have to use it, but I will 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.660
 show you exactly 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.810
 oh and this use so let's go 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.810
 to start 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.659
 first I go with my brush in the 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.250
 eyeliner queen and then ironing a 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.960
 few times over my hand so that one 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.960
 even layer of eyeliner 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.160
 I start in the inner corner and work 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.750
 from there to the outer corner of the eye and 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.090
 there I lay eyeliner plot on the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.440
 upper lash edge and make as short 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.760
 dashes 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.530
 so that you can keep control easier 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.330
 how often you cross the same line des 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.610
 the more intense the eyeliner becomes in color 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.860
 and often I start with a thinner line 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.090
 on the inside and makes the eyeliner 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.530
 gradually thicker 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.530
 as soon as I cool outside there 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.260
 wind eyeliner received first guideline 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.879
 so that I know which way to go 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.680
 I lay the back of the brush 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.599
 next to my nostrils and next to my 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.069
 outer corner of the eye 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.080
 the tip of her plot point to 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.870
 down because I have such a tighter point 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.579
 can make and also stick with this ring 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.579
 with short lines the most control 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.340
 for a beautiful katana 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.890
 turn the tip of the brush upwards 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.300
 and pull it to the middle of you 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.099
 eyelash edge 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.099
 if there are still open spots you can do that 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.980
 fill in and the eyeliner is as good as 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:55.030
 ready and so I am now on the line 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.030
 to make a tidy one 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.310
 Now it might not be so tight 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.650
 then you can also use the concealer next to the 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.810
 go eyeliner and wipe it out 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.720
 I use the concealer palette of this 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.880
 super looks in the color light and the 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.830
 concealer corrects and takes care of it 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.830
 for the eyeliner to stand out even more 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.780
 I hope you have some tips from the video 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.770
