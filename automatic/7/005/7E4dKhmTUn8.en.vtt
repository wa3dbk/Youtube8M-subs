it<00:02:35.300> has<00:02:35.450> very<00:02:35.690> good<00:02:35.810> off-road<00:02:36.080> capabilities

Humvee<00:02:39.709> I<00:02:39.950> can<00:02:40.520> accomplish<00:02:40.820> pretty<00:02:41.209> much<00:02:41.450> any

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
Humvee I can accomplish pretty much any

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.590 
Humvee I can accomplish pretty much any
mission<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:43.220> m1114<00:02:43.730> Humvee<00:02:44.390> can

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
mission that the m1114 Humvee can

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.530 
mission that the m1114 Humvee can
accomplish<00:02:44.950> but<00:02:45.950> 70%<00:02:46.310> more<00:02:46.760> fuel<00:02:47.090> efficient

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
accomplish but 70% more fuel efficient

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.750 
accomplish but 70% more fuel efficient
so<00:02:48.200> this<00:02:48.410> is<00:02:48.530> a<00:02:48.560> cooling<00:02:49.310> vest<00:02:49.490> that's

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
so this is a cooling vest that's

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.540 
so this is a cooling vest that's
generally<00:02:50.209> used<00:02:50.450> in<00:02:50.630> helicopters<00:02:51.410> we<00:02:52.250> applied

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
generally used in helicopters we applied

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.280 
generally used in helicopters we applied
it<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:52.760> this<00:02:52.940> program<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.510> idea<00:02:53.570> being<00:02:54.140> that

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
it to this program the idea being that

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.680 
it to this program the idea being that
it's<00:02:54.560> easier<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.340> cool<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:55.970> occupants<00:02:56.480> than

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
it's easier to cool the occupants than

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.020 
it's easier to cool the occupants than
it<00:02:56.780> is<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:56.990> cool<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:57.380> cab<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:58.490> have<00:02:58.700> all<00:02:58.910> the

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
it is to cool the cab and have all the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.550 
it is to cool the cab and have all the
air<00:02:59.120> escaping<00:02:59.570> when<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.780> soldiers<00:03:00.170> exit<00:03:00.500> the

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
air escaping when the soldiers exit the

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.120 
air escaping when the soldiers exit the
vehicle

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
vehicle

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.040 
vehicle
so<00:03:01.550> idea<00:03:01.880> is<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.209> soldier<00:03:02.630> wears<00:03:02.840> this

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
so idea is the soldier wears this

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.509 
so idea is the soldier wears this
underneath<00:03:03.350> their<00:03:03.590> body<00:03:03.800> armor<00:03:04.160> up<00:03:04.280> against

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
underneath their body armor up against

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.360 
underneath their body armor up against
their<00:03:04.700> body<00:03:05.019> and<00:03:06.019> there's<00:03:06.170> a<00:03:06.230> pump<00:03:06.530> here<00:03:06.860> that

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
their body and there's a pump here that

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.490 
their body and there's a pump here that
circulates<00:03:08.000> cool<00:03:08.209> fluid<00:03:08.720> through<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.320> best

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
circulates cool fluid through the best

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.290 
circulates cool fluid through the best
and<00:03:10.070> cools<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.519> soldier<00:03:10.910> as<00:03:11.060> they're

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
and cools the soldier as they're

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.930 
and cools the soldier as they're
traveling
