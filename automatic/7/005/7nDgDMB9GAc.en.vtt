the National enduro series we've got a

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.560

little<00:00:42.010> bit<00:00:42.130> of<00:00:42.190> a<00:00:42.250> break<00:00:42.460> since<00:00:42.730> round<00:00:43.030> three

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
little bit of a break since round three

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.020 
little bit of a break since round three
since<00:00:44.410> then<00:00:44.560> the<00:00:44.680> OMA<00:00:45.010> Nationals<00:00:45.520> was<00:00:45.640> kicked

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
since then the OMA Nationals was kicked

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.750 
since then the OMA Nationals was kicked
off<00:00:46.180> and<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.920> been<00:00:48.040> a<00:00:48.070> little<00:00:48.190> bumpy<00:00:48.400> road

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
off and it's been a little bumpy road

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.550 
off and it's been a little bumpy road
around<00:00:48.970> one<00:00:49.270> now<00:00:49.630> the<00:00:49.690> one<00:00:49.870> I<00:00:49.900> ran<00:00:50.170> out<00:00:50.290> of<00:00:50.350> fuel

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.560 
around one now the one I ran out of fuel

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.340 
around one now the one I ran out of fuel
so<00:00:51.040> it's<00:00:51.850> been<00:00:52.030> some<00:00:52.240> of<00:00:52.330> that<00:00:52.420> break<00:00:53.140> in

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
so it's been some of that break in

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.410 
so it's been some of that break in
between<00:00:53.440> tests<00:00:54.400> and<00:00:54.550> things<00:00:54.940> to<00:00:55.180> get<00:00:55.300> a<00:00:55.330> little

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
between tests and things to get a little

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.660 
between tests and things to get a little
better<00:00:55.540> fuel<00:00:55.870> economy<00:00:55.990> on<00:00:56.350> the<00:00:56.670> two-stroke

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
better fuel economy on the two-stroke
