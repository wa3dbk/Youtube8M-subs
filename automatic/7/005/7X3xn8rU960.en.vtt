00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.180
 compatible with this version will work with any peace act that is 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.700
 compatible with and with any one is as much as the 1 as in two because this 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.700
 it is the first museum that exists for him there is grass 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.190

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.110
 he is working 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.100
 until then let's start like this 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.100

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.170
 I repeat everything works for any device that is compatible with this 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.940
 decision and probably made it easier and faster time that exists 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.379
 You can know the page and what it offered will look like this 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.829

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:24.019
