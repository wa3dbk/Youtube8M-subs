00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:09.299
 the poems wines and the novels photos 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:09.299
 planets that it rains 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.910
 And what about how they hope bones 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.070
 are very well welcome to a 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.840
 Destiny video I almost do not upload 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.420
 to the channel but today we're going to see the first 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.970
 exotic weapon that I got is a 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.529
 great shotgun and for those who do not know 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.660
 how difficult it is to get one of these 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.360
 weapons that are the ones that have the color 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.759
 yellow background is very very bastard 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.770
 you have to have a lot of luck and the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.050
 time is like something very fun to be 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.510
 trying to get these weapons 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.890
 they get 100% randomly so that's good 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.500
 they have nothing to do simply 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.260
 you play a game and you play in this 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.690
 I had to pass some things 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.790
 missions as a requirements let's say 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.460
 I had to pass some waves and then 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.010
 some missions and buy 50 times a 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.720
 blowjob to was shit and in the end 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.030
 you got shotgun that looks great 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.340
 As I am telling you, it is very difficult 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.650
 get exotic weapons weapons this 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.750
 caliber at destination so I show you 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.549
 the exotic for those who have the doubt and 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.560
 sometimes they ask me what I upload 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.689
 secrets to the channel and tell me how it 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.090
 they get guns from the girls at destination 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.320
 it's pure luck as I'm telling you 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.300
 it's to the ranges 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.310
 when you finish a game like a 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.320
 Weapon generator starts spinning 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.720
 and the probability of you getting a 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.940
 yellow is very very little is like a 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.620
 in a million or something like that not literally 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.660
 but if it is a very low possibility 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.610
 get this kind of weapons I wanted them 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.020
 share this video of this weapon that 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.570
 I am very happy to have got 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.520
 It has been a long time since I 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.680
 I was glad to get a pixel in 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.930
 a videogame in fifa I get excited when 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.610
 I play players more or less and in 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.830
 destiny and good I just got to be 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.840
 bad mother whore ' chingón a los armas 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.100
 exotic are very cool if they are 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.229
 hard to get 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.910
 when I put it on for the first time 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.950
 they fix there is a little sign that says that only 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.869
 you can have two exotic at a time 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.820
 it's something that I did not know this shotgun in 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.039
 particular is very strong and the exotic 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.350
 in general they are too good at 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.970
 Destiny's there are several very exotic weapons 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.530
 Chinese I've seen in videos because 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.300
 well this is how I tell you it's the first 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.039
 exotic weapon that I have achieved and there 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.050
 many that look very good 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.000
 some submachine guns that fire very 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.340
 bastards for those who do not know these 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.019
 weapons in addition to being stronger are very 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.209
 weird so that's why the name 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.380
 exotic wey I do not have to explain that and 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.800
 besides that 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.260
 this little mother chevere chipocludo or 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.660
 eggs are sold they look much better than 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.100
 ordinary weapons something else 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.590
 what I wanted to show you in this video is 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.140
 that bungie added a secret to destiny 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.630
 and it is very cool is a reference gay 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.620
 the bastards that were doing 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.810
 farming or they were going to a cave 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.060
 they killed monsters and left you in agra 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.800
 more or encrypt more or fucking mother wey no 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.540
 I remember what those mothers call me 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.640
 guayos worth Verga things that give you 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.860
 so you can go with the decipher 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.080
 when you are bitten x you will hear a voice 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.820
 diabolical good that says not a million 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.640
 deaths will be enough for the teacher raúl 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.650
 which is the wey that deciphers these codes 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.910
 these weapons that you find in 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.910
 missions in games 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.590
 for the teacher 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.510
 for those who do not know and you go to those 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.799
 caves and you made quotes between traps 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.810
 because you stayed in one place 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.549
 firing shooting firing up 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.349
 to get the armor or things 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.420
 what do you want, bulli realized 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.159
 this logically and something cool is that 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.480
 they put the secret there not as well as 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.879
 good and we know that they are 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.590
 doing like a trap by exploiting a 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.930
 ship that is in the game at the destination 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.340
 let's leave this little secret alone 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.840
 I did not find the cave click the 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.060
 I was looking for a good time being 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.769
 honest I was like half an hour walking 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.450
 that's why I did not find her and I 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.790
 I despaired this is my first weapon 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.590
 exotic and it's the first secret that 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.450
 encounter in destine in general there are 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.310
 several things that supposedly are 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.750
 references but to me personally not 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.549
 they make me nothing flashy so no 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.019
 there were and this is the first 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.939
