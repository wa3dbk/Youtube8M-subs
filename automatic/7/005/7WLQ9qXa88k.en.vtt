00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.560 

I'll<00:00:15.200> be<00:00:15.380> demonstrating<00:00:15.560> how<00:00:16.490> to<00:00:16.550> execute<00:00:17.150> a

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
I'll be demonstrating how to execute a

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.890 
I'll be demonstrating how to execute a
make<00:00:17.960> one<00:00:18.260> increase<00:00:18.530> on<00:00:19.460> the<00:00:20.000> purl<00:00:20.330> side<00:00:20.660> of

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
make one increase on the purl side of

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.470 
make one increase on the purl side of
your<00:00:21.020> fabric<00:00:21.580> there<00:00:22.580> are<00:00:22.730> three<00:00:23.060> different

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
your fabric there are three different

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.769 
your fabric there are three different
ways<00:00:23.689> to<00:00:23.830> execute<00:00:24.830> this<00:00:25.250> stitch<00:00:25.610> and<00:00:25.970> you

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
ways to execute this stitch and you

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.730 
ways to execute this stitch and you
choose<00:00:27.320> the<00:00:27.350> correct<00:00:28.010> stitch<00:00:28.720> by<00:00:29.740> determining

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
choose the correct stitch by determining

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.060 
choose the correct stitch by determining
what<00:00:31.580> the<00:00:32.650> increase<00:00:33.650> will<00:00:34.070> look<00:00:34.280> like<00:00:34.550> on<00:00:34.900> the

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
what the increase will look like on the

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.880 
what the increase will look like on the
right<00:00:37.070> side<00:00:37.400> or<00:00:37.730> knit<00:00:38.270> side<00:00:38.570> of<00:00:38.720> the<00:00:38.809> fabric<00:00:39.080> so

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
right side or knit side of the fabric so

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.130 
right side or knit side of the fabric so
if<00:00:40.160> you<00:00:40.400> would<00:00:40.580> like<00:00:40.940> the<00:00:42.489> increase<00:00:44.140> the

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
if you would like the increase the

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.530 
if you would like the increase the
finished<00:00:45.590> result<00:00:46.040> to<00:00:46.400> lean<00:00:46.580> to<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:46.879> right<00:00:46.909> you

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
finished result to lean to the right you

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.619 
finished result to lean to the right you
will<00:00:47.750> pick<00:00:48.199> the<00:00:48.229> make<00:00:48.890> one<00:00:49.129> parol<00:00:49.550> that<00:00:49.790> does

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
will pick the make one parol that does

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.200 
will pick the make one parol that does
that<00:00:50.900> or<00:00:51.229> if<00:00:51.530> you<00:00:51.680> want<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:52.280> make<00:00:52.550> one<00:00:52.850> Pro<00:00:53.150> to

that or if you want the make one Pro to

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.469 
that or if you want the make one Pro to
lean<00:00:53.629> to<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.140> left<00:00:54.699> you<00:00:55.699> will<00:00:55.879> choose<00:00:56.180> the

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:56.479 
lean to the left you will choose the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:58.990 
lean to the left you will choose the
second<00:00:57.019> option<00:00:57.229> I<00:00:57.680> will<00:00:58.010> demonstrate<00:00:58.220> which

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
second option I will demonstrate which

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.899 
second option I will demonstrate which
will<00:00:59.239> show<00:00:59.540> how<00:00:59.900> to<00:00:59.960> get<00:01:00.650> a<00:01:00.890> left-leaning

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:01.909 
will show how to get a left-leaning

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.110 
will show how to get a left-leaning
increase<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:03.110> the<00:01:03.710> third<00:01:04.070> increase<00:01:04.670> that<00:01:05.030> I

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
increase and the third increase that I

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.899 
increase and the third increase that I
will<00:01:05.269> show<00:01:05.510> is<00:01:05.810> decorative<00:01:06.580> so<00:01:07.580> they're<00:01:07.760> all

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
will show is decorative so they're all

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.880 
will show is decorative so they're all
done<00:01:08.180> on<00:01:08.299> the<00:01:08.420> purl<00:01:08.659> side<00:01:08.930> but<00:01:09.229> their<00:01:09.440> effect

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
done on the purl side but their effect

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.570 
done on the purl side but their effect
is<00:01:10.100> on<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:11.120> right<00:01:11.750> side<00:01:12.020> of<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:12.320> fabric<00:01:12.580> so

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
is on the right side of the fabric so

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.780 
is on the right side of the fabric so
let's<00:01:13.880> start<00:01:14.330> with<00:01:14.690> a<00:01:14.750> purl<00:01:15.140> stitch<00:01:15.520> and<00:01:16.520> I'm

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
let's start with a purl stitch and I'm

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.600 
let's start with a purl stitch and I'm
going<00:01:16.970> to<00:01:17.030> show<00:01:17.240> how<00:01:17.510> to<00:01:17.570> make<00:01:17.750> a<00:01:18.370> make<00:01:19.370> one

going to show how to make a make one

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.180 
going to show how to make a make one
purl<00:01:19.970> that<00:01:20.300> will<00:01:20.480> have<00:01:20.780> a<00:01:20.960> right<00:01:21.320> lean<00:01:21.650> on<00:01:21.950> the

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
purl that will have a right lean on the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.330 
purl that will have a right lean on the
knit<00:01:22.400> side<00:01:22.640> of<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:22.910> fabric<00:01:23.320> so<00:01:24.320> to<00:01:24.410> make<00:01:24.890> this

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340

and we're going to pick it up from back
to<00:01:47.120> front<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:48.560> we're<00:01:48.680> going<00:01:48.800> to<00:01:48.860> purl<00:01:49.220> through

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
to front and we're going to purl through

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.160 
to front and we're going to purl through
that<00:01:49.820> front<00:01:50.150> loop<00:01:50.360> with<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.750> loop<00:01:50.930> that's

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
that front loop with the loop that's

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.390 
that front loop with the loop that's
closest<00:01:51.770> to<00:01:51.890> you<00:01:52.130> and<00:01:53.290> that's<00:01:54.290> it<00:01:54.650> so<00:01:55.310> I'll

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.010 
purl another stitch and I'll show you
that<00:01:57.170> again<00:01:57.790> we<00:01:58.790> take<00:01:59.000> our<00:01:59.150> left<00:01:59.390> needle<00:01:59.690> tip

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
that again we take our left needle tip

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.140 
that again we take our left needle tip
and<00:02:00.260> we're<00:02:00.380> going<00:02:00.590> to<00:02:00.680> pick<00:02:00.980> up<00:02:01.250> that<00:02:01.640> running

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
and we're going to pick up that running

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.610 
and we're going to pick up that running
thread<00:02:02.860> from<00:02:03.860> back<00:02:04.310> to<00:02:04.340> front<00:02:04.790> and<00:02:05.409> purl<00:02:06.409> it

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
thread from back to front and purl it

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.240 
thread from back to front and purl it
through<00:02:07.010> the<00:02:07.640> front<00:02:07.970> loop<00:02:08.830> let's<00:02:09.830> pull<00:02:10.220> one

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
through the front loop let's pull one

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.820 
through the front loop let's pull one
more<00:02:10.429> stitch<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.450> turn<00:02:12.409> it<00:02:12.560> to<00:02:12.709> the<00:02:12.800> right

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
more stitch and turn it to the right

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.380 
more stitch and turn it to the right
side<00:02:13.340> and<00:02:13.780> see<00:02:15.010> how<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.330> make<00:02:17.330> one<00:02:17.780> behaved

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
side and see how that make one behaved

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.809 
side and see how that make one behaved
here<00:02:20.390> are<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:22.069> two<00:02:22.519> make<00:02:23.299> one<00:02:24.370> increases<00:02:25.370> and

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
here are the two make one increases and

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.160 
here are the two make one increases and
you<00:02:26.510> can<00:02:26.719> see

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
you can see

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.089 
you can see
that<00:02:27.530> both<00:02:27.830> of<00:02:27.860> those<00:02:28.370> have<00:02:29.240> a<00:02:29.270> definite<00:02:30.099> lean

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
that both of those have a definite lean

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.870 
that both of those have a definite lean
to<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.489> right<00:02:31.630> so<00:02:32.630> that<00:02:33.400> make<00:02:34.400> one<00:02:34.610> parole

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
to the right so that make one parole

to the right so that make one parole
resulted<00:02:35.840> in<00:02:36.050> a<00:02:36.410> right<00:02:36.590> leaning<00:02:36.739> decrease<00:02:36.920> on

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
resulted in a right leaning decrease on

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.610 
resulted in a right leaning decrease on
the<00:02:37.550> knit<00:02:37.700> side<00:02:37.880> of<00:02:38.000> our<00:02:38.090> fabric<00:02:38.290> so<00:02:39.290> let's<00:02:39.440> say

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
the knit side of our fabric so let's say

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.620 
the knit side of our fabric so let's say
you<00:02:39.680> want<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.190> have<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:40.550> appear<00:02:41.030> as<00:02:41.239> a

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
you want to have it appear as a

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.830 
you want to have it appear as a
left-leaning<00:02:42.170> decrease<00:02:42.530> on<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:44.420> knit<00:02:44.600> side

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
left-leaning decrease on the knit side

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.530 
left-leaning decrease on the knit side
you<00:02:45.739> will<00:02:45.920> execute<00:02:46.370> this<00:02:46.819> stitch<00:02:47.150> a<00:02:47.300> little

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
you will execute this stitch a little

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.540 
you will execute this stitch a little
differently<00:02:47.870> we<00:02:48.530> are<00:02:48.650> still<00:02:48.980> going<00:02:49.220> to<00:02:49.310> pick

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
differently we are still going to pick

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.640 
differently we are still going to pick
up<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.850> running<00:02:50.180> thread<00:02:50.510> with<00:02:50.840> our<00:02:51.170> left<00:02:51.530> hand

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
up the running thread with our left hand

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.830 
up the running thread with our left hand
needle<00:02:52.250> but<00:02:52.910> this<00:02:53.060> time<00:02:53.300> we're<00:02:53.450> going<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.600> pick

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
needle but this time we're going to pick

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.259 
needle but this time we're going to pick
up<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.140> running<00:02:54.440> thread<00:02:54.709> from<00:02:55.100> front<00:02:55.819> to<00:02:55.940> back

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
up the running thread from front to back

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.830 
up the running thread from front to back
and<00:02:57.130> now<00:02:58.130> we<00:02:58.190> need<00:02:58.819> to<00:02:59.000> purl<00:02:59.360> through<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.720> back

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
and now we need to purl through the back

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.970 
and now we need to purl through the back
loop<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:00.680> it<00:03:00.950> is<00:03:01.250> this<00:03:01.580> one<00:03:02.030> right<00:03:02.420> back<00:03:03.170> here

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
loop and it is this one right back here

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.340 
loop and it is this one right back here
that<00:03:04.130> you<00:03:04.190> can<00:03:04.459> see<00:03:04.790> it's<00:03:05.690> a<00:03:05.750> little<00:03:05.870> tricky<00:03:06.230> to

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
that you can see it's a little tricky to

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.350 
that you can see it's a little tricky to
pick<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:06.799> up<00:03:06.950> you<00:03:07.280> need<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:07.459> take<00:03:07.790> your<00:03:08.000> right

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
pick it up you need to take your right

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.140 
pick it up you need to take your right
hand<00:03:08.390> needle<00:03:08.930> and<00:03:09.470> you<00:03:09.680> need<00:03:09.860> to<00:03:09.980> come<00:03:10.250> past

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
hand needle and you need to come past

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.380 
hand needle and you need to come past
that<00:03:11.870> stitch<00:03:12.769> and<00:03:14.620> then<00:03:15.620> come<00:03:16.040> in<00:03:16.160> between<00:03:16.760> the

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
that stitch and then come in between the

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.559 
that stitch and then come in between the
two<00:03:17.840> loops<00:03:18.290> and<00:03:19.180> then<00:03:20.180> purl<00:03:20.690> that<00:03:21.019> stitch

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
two loops and then purl that stitch

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.460 
two loops and then purl that stitch
let's<00:03:23.569> try<00:03:23.930> that<00:03:24.110> again

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
let's try that again

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.030 
let's try that again
purl<00:03:25.430> one<00:03:25.670> in<00:03:25.790> between<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:26.830> you're<00:03:27.830> going<00:03:27.980> to

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
purl one in between and you're going to

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.059 
purl one in between and you're going to
pick<00:03:28.280> up<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.670> running<00:03:28.940> thread<00:03:29.420> from<00:03:30.080> front<00:03:30.950> to

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
pick up the running thread from front to

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.849 
pick up the running thread from front to
back<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:32.000> we're<00:03:32.900> going<00:03:33.019> to<00:03:33.049> purl<00:03:33.470> through

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
back and we're going to purl through

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.610 
back and we're going to purl through
that<00:03:34.010> back<00:03:34.280> loop<00:03:34.700> so<00:03:35.570> I<00:03:35.600> think<00:03:36.170> of<00:03:36.290> it<00:03:36.380> as<00:03:36.500> I

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
that back loop so I think of it as I

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.370 
that back loop so I think of it as I
come<00:03:36.859> over<00:03:37.160> it<00:03:37.609> and<00:03:37.880> then<00:03:38.000> come<00:03:38.750> towards<00:03:39.200> you

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
come over it and then come towards you

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.050 
come over it and then come towards you
some<00:03:39.769> people<00:03:40.010> like<00:03:40.130> think<00:03:40.370> I'm<00:03:40.519> coming<00:03:40.940> the

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
some people like think I'm coming the

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.810 
some people like think I'm coming the
needle<00:03:41.390> from<00:03:41.840> I<00:03:42.109> go<00:03:42.859> over<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.370> stitch<00:03:43.579> and

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
needle from I go over the stitch and

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.479 
needle from I go over the stitch and
then<00:03:44.000> pick<00:03:44.239> it<00:03:44.269> up<00:03:44.450> from<00:03:44.690> left<00:03:45.170> to<00:03:45.320> right<00:03:45.620> so

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
then pick it up from left to right so

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.080 
then pick it up from left to right so
here<00:03:46.940> I<00:03:46.970> will<00:03:47.329> grab<00:03:47.959> that<00:03:47.989> guy<00:03:48.970> coming<00:03:49.970> in

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
here I will grab that guy coming in

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.610 
here I will grab that guy coming in
between<00:03:50.540> those<00:03:50.780> two<00:03:51.079> loops<00:03:51.410> and<00:03:51.799> purl<00:03:52.609> that

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
between those two loops and purl that

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.860 
between those two loops and purl that
let's<00:03:54.620> probe<00:03:54.920> one<00:03:55.070> more<00:03:55.250> stitch<00:03:55.549> and<00:03:55.910> see<00:03:56.690> what

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
let's probe one more stitch and see what

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.770 
let's probe one more stitch and see what
it<00:03:56.959> looks<00:03:57.170> like<00:03:57.260> on<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:57.620> knit<00:03:58.160> side<00:03:58.600> so<00:03:59.600> when<00:03:59.750> I

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
it looks like on the knit side so when I

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.330 
it looks like on the knit side so when I
turn<00:04:00.290> that<00:04:01.420> here<00:04:02.420> are<00:04:02.660> my<00:04:02.900> two<00:04:03.100> make<00:04:04.100> one

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
turn that here are my two make one

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.460 
turn that here are my two make one
pearls<00:04:04.760> that<00:04:05.000> have<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.750> left-leaning

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
pearls that have the left-leaning

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.490 
pearls that have the left-leaning
decrease<00:04:06.709> our<00:04:07.459> increase<00:04:08.239> excuse<00:04:08.690> me<00:04:08.900> you<00:04:09.350> can

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
decrease our increase excuse me you can

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.400 
decrease our increase excuse me you can
see<00:04:09.769> that<00:04:10.040> stitch<00:04:10.910> has<00:04:11.150> a<00:04:11.180> definite<00:04:11.780> left<00:04:12.109> lean

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
see that stitch has a definite left lean

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.110 
see that stitch has a definite left lean
so<00:04:13.400> let<00:04:13.549> me<00:04:13.640> demonstrate<00:04:13.850> the<00:04:14.450> last<00:04:15.049> way<00:04:15.500> to

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
so let me demonstrate the last way to

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.210 
so let me demonstrate the last way to
execute<00:04:17.120> a<00:04:17.419> make<00:04:17.600> one<00:04:17.810> purl<00:04:18.109> now<00:04:18.950> in<00:04:19.070> those

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
execute a make one purl now in those

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.640 
execute a make one purl now in those
first<00:04:19.459> two<00:04:19.700> options<00:04:20.329> I<00:04:20.450> gave<00:04:20.690> you<00:04:20.959> we<00:04:21.380> knit

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
first two options I gave you we knit

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.560 
first two options I gave you we knit
through<00:04:21.919> the<00:04:21.950> front<00:04:22.340> or<00:04:22.550> the<00:04:23.060> back<00:04:23.090> of<00:04:23.450> the

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
through the front or the back of the

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.320 
through the front or the back of the
stitch<00:04:23.810> and<00:04:24.169> that's<00:04:24.770> what<00:04:25.340> twisted<00:04:26.060> the

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
stitch and that's what twisted the

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.180 
stitch and that's what twisted the
stitch<00:04:26.539> and<00:04:26.720> made<00:04:26.870> it<00:04:26.960> nice<00:04:27.110> and<00:04:27.139> tight<00:04:27.560> and<00:04:27.860> a

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
stitch and made it nice and tight and a

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.260 
stitch and made it nice and tight and a
nearly<00:04:28.550> invisible<00:04:28.760> increase<00:04:29.630> on<00:04:30.430> this<00:04:31.430> option

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
nearly invisible increase on this option

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.170 
nearly invisible increase on this option
we're<00:04:33.139> going<00:04:33.260> to<00:04:33.320> go<00:04:33.440> ahead<00:04:33.560> and<00:04:34.070> pick<00:04:34.669> up<00:04:34.700> that

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
we're going to go ahead and pick up that

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.270 
we're going to go ahead and pick up that
running<00:04:35.780> thread<00:04:36.050> again<00:04:36.260> from<00:04:36.800> front<00:04:37.099> to<00:04:37.159> back

running thread again from front to back

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.130 
running thread again from front to back
except<00:04:38.240> this<00:04:38.360> time<00:04:38.630> we're<00:04:38.840> just<00:04:38.870> going<00:04:39.020> to

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
except this time we're just going to

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.840 
except this time we're just going to
purl<00:04:39.470> it

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
purl it
