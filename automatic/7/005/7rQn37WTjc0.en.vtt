as a participant with NASA on that
frontier<00:04:07.010> I<00:04:07.220> think<00:04:07.610> that<00:04:07.730> can<00:04:07.850> work<00:04:08.060> I<00:04:08.300> don't

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
frontier I think that can work I don't

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:09.910 
frontier I think that can work I don't
have<00:04:08.810> a<00:04:08.840> problem<00:04:09.080> with<00:04:09.260> that<00:04:09.380> that's<00:04:09.709> right

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
have a problem with that that's right

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.010 
have a problem with that that's right
it's<00:04:10.520> unlike<00:04:10.970> private<00:04:11.300> sectors<00:04:11.510> were<00:04:11.690> already

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
it's unlike private sectors were already

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
no doubt absolutely we know that he was

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.120 
no doubt absolutely we know that he was
speaking<00:04:16.700> in<00:04:17.000> Florida<00:04:17.570> yeah<00:04:17.930> do<00:04:18.859> you<00:04:18.919> think

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
speaking in Florida yeah do you think

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.070 
speaking in Florida yeah do you think
that<00:04:19.250> may<00:04:19.430> have<00:04:19.459> colored<00:04:19.910> somewhat<00:04:20.570> a<00:04:20.750> little

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
bit as you know it's a political race

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.340 
bit as you know it's a political race
wouldn't<00:04:23.430> have<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.730> same<00:04:23.970> impact<00:04:24.600> in<00:04:24.870> Idaho

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
wouldn't have the same impact in Idaho

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.170 
wouldn't have the same impact in Idaho
not<00:04:25.590> right<00:04:25.740> yeah<00:04:26.070> if<00:04:26.280> you<00:04:26.430> can<00:04:26.550> ease<00:04:26.760> you<00:04:27.030> can
