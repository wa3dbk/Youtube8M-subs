00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.540
 Hello everyone 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.460
 What I want to introduce today is 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.360
 a condiment 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.240
 Sounds like a sauce 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.020
 In fact it can replace 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.760
 Salt seasoning 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.700
 It can be used to pickle vegetables 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.760
 Making bread 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.200
 Marinated meat 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.720
 It is rich in enzymes 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.760
 About a hundred enzymes 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.840
 It has quite a lot of probiotics 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.000
 Very good for the body 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 very healthy 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.620
 This is in Japan 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.240
 In fact, a long time ago 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.580
 That is it in recent years 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.800
 Quite red in Japan 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.040
 Also red to Taiwan 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.120
 Currently available at this 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.800
 Some in Japan 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.660
 Japanese department store supermarket 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.740
 Can be bought 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.800
 About 300 grams or so 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.320
 It takes about 100 Taiwan dollars 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.220
 But I later discovered 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.960
 Some recipes 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.200
 Teach us how 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.280
 Made at home 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.160
 Found very simple 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.920
 And save more than half of the money 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.640
 So I think it’s very cost-effective 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.920
 So I recommend it to everyone. 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.320
 How to make homemade salt dipping sauce at home 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.740
 Making salt 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.640
 First of all 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.320
 Have to prepare one first 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.680
 Disinfected 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.840
 Large glass jar 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.120
 I recommend glass jar 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.700
 Some people say that they use sealed boxes. 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.520
 Some people say that they use plastic cans. 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.620
 Can 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.840
 But I still recommend 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.120
 May be more stable 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.720
 Material or glass jar 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.920
 a little safer 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.840
 Afraid that it releases some substances 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.400
 Still plastic 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.520
 a little worried 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.000
 Also I bought it on the internet. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.480
 This is called rice bran 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.400
 Or you can talk to some rice shops 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.480
 Ask about it 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.060
 Nami is a fermented rice 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.760
 Mi Fu, I bought it at an open auction. 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.480
 Very convenient 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.700
 After I booked it, 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.800
 Received the next day 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.040
 Today this is dry 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.240
 Some people sell it wet. 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.540
 It is a piece 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.160
 To break it up 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.480
 This is dry 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.640
 So relative 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.900
 Part of the water 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.280
 Will increase 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.500
 Salt 麴 production 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.920
 Just use three things. 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.020
 One is rice bran 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.900
 One is water 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.680
 One is salt 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.740
 It's that simple 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.040
 But the proportion of these three things 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.740
 If you are wet 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.120
 Or frozen rice bran 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.540
 That ratio is 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.480
 1:3:4 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.060
 Is a salt 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.940
 look 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.500
 Salt 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.080
 I remember this way. 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.600
 Is the salt first 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.060
 Salt is 1 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.420
麴 is 3 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.320
 Water is 4 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.680
 But because I am dry 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.720
 I will become 1:3:6 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.400
 So today I am 100 grams of salt. 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.440
 Part of the salt 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.480
 I suggest you 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.480
 Just like cooking salt 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.040
 Then you have to use sea salt. 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.440
 But don't use a salt 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.320
 Rock salt 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.840
 Because of the minerals in the rock salt 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.000
 Will affect the brewing of rice bran 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.520
 Just hot water has been put in 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.480
 Then you have to find a way to dissolve it. 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.060
 Rice bran 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.920
 Placed in a sterilized jar 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.040
 Pour it in 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.711
 Remember that the jar is disinfected by any means 

00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:00.440
 Can 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.520
 The remaining cold water 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.320
 Put these first 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.480
 Just pour in it. 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.720
 No relationship 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.680
 There are some salt inside. 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.840
 Still not completely dissolved 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.166
 No relationship 

00:03:14.166 --> 00:03:15.020
 Just pour in 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.480
 Mix it up again 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.320
 After stirring 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.640
 In fact, this sauce 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.598
 Already completed啰

00:03:20.598 --> 00:03:22.000
 But because of this sauce 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.240
 Need to be placed for 7 to 14 days 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.920
 It is the temperature of autumn now 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.240
 I can finish it in about 7 days. 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.280
 But we are every day 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.460
 Just like this 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.080
 Come in and stir it once 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.260
 Until we found rice grains 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.120
 When it has become porridge 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.520
 This salt dipping sauce 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.680
 Finished 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.300
 That's it now. 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.400
 I will stand still 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.640
 At room temperature 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.380
 Gently cover 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.100
 Slightly covered 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.300
 But don't close it 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.040
 Tight 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.040
 It has no way to breathe 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.120
 Rice bran is an active thing 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.380
 I just said about its enzymes. 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.760
 There are up to 100 kinds of 喔

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.960
 This probiotic 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.720
 Also quite a lot 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.920
 It is alive 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.520
 So we remember to give it 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.480
 a little air like this 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.140
 We are in normal 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.700
 a cool corner 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.400
 It’s ok 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.440
 Then I will come back tomorrow. 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.840
 How does it become? 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.680
 The second day of homemade salt 喔

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.640
 Then we act like 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.200
 Just open it 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.200
 You can see salt 麴

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.240
 Seems to have a little bubble 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.160
 No relationship 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.120
 We will pick it up 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.600
 Just mix and match 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.560
 Let it mix evenly 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.100
 That can also be seen 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.720
 Still not like porridge 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.880
 Still not mature 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.360
 Then let's take a look at it tomorrow. 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.440
 That is the third day of salt 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.440
 You have to pick up the lid喔

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.400
 You just have to do one thing 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.920
 Help it stir it 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.920
 Help it ferment 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.520
 That still didn't go to porridge 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.420
 So put it 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.560
 Because today is the third day 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.200
 Gently cover 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.080
 Let it continue to ferment 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.520
 Then we have this salt dipping sauce 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.080
 Already made 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.160
 Today is the tenth day 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.600
 Has been stirred like this every day 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.240
 Then everyone can obviously see 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.680
 Day 10 today 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.800
 Our confusion 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.240
 Already obvious 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.300
 Present this image 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.400
 Porridge-like appearance 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.700
 Salt dipping sauce 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.040
 It’s already done 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.360
 Finish the salt dipping sauce that has been prepared 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.760
 Let's put it tight 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.240
 After tightening 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.380
 Put the salt sauce 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.200
 Put it in the fridge 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.140
 Probably available 

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.920
 Three months to six months 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.340
 Very simple 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.280
 Homemade salt dipping sauce at home 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.120
 Already completed啰

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.800
 Everyone has a chance to try it. 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.600
 Extremely fun 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.480
 Salt-like sauce like experiment
