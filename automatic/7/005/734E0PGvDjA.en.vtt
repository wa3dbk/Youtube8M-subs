let's keep moving it's an organic lock

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.660 
let's keep moving it's an organic lock
like<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:15.290> one<00:03:15.500> at<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.769> bunker<00:03:18.400> there<00:03:19.400> should

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
like the one at the bunker there should

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.400 
like the one at the bunker there should
be<00:03:19.700> matching<00:03:20.239> trigger<00:03:20.510> points<00:03:20.900> on<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:21.200> walls
