really<00:01:11.460> like<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.760> lay<00:01:11.880> down<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.299> he's<00:01:13.260> going<00:01:13.350> to

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
really like to lay down so he's going to

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.960 
really like to lay down so he's going to
play<00:01:13.530> draws<00:01:13.799> pretty<00:01:14.010> strong<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.460> decided<00:01:14.790> to

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
play draws pretty strong so I decided to

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.969 
play draws pretty strong so I decided to
try<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.240> get<00:01:15.630> stacks<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.049> from<00:01:16.200> if<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.710> bet<00:01:16.890> he

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
try and get stacks in from if I bet he

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.200 
try and get stacks in from if I bet he
might<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.280> call<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.610> then<00:01:17.700> all<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.970> sudden

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
might just call and then all of a sudden

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.760 
might just call and then all of a sudden
I<00:01:18.390> can't<00:01:18.720> get<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> stacked<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.409> go<00:01:19.590> for<00:01:19.740> a

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
I can't get a stacked in so I go for a

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.429 
I can't get a stacked in so I go for a
check<00:01:19.950> reason<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.729> worked<00:01:21.180> out<00:01:21.360> but<00:01:21.780> he<00:01:22.170> tended

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
check reason it worked out but he tended

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.390 
check reason it worked out but he tended
he's<00:01:22.530> really<00:01:22.710> aggressive<00:01:23.070> with<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.220> drawer

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
he's really aggressive with this drawer

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.730 
he's really aggressive with this drawer
so<00:01:23.640> that's<00:01:24.270> why<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.420> thought<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.689> line<00:01:24.869> how

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
so that's why I thought that line how

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.200 
so that's why I thought that line how
many<00:01:25.890> times<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.460> played<00:01:26.759> against<00:01:27.000> swing

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
many times have you played against swing

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.240 
many times have you played against swing
