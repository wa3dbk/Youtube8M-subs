00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:08.490
 you don't want to tell you how to do 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:16.670
 grouser and hubs to the motoblock 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:22.730
 me walking tractor forte g105 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:27.110
 here's a clear lug I made from 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:33.950
 machine disks from r13 machine 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:37.350
 But to make such simple ones 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:43.290
 grouser on the walking tractor 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:49.579
 I used this disk tavern thick 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:55.140
 4 mm here such bent and welded 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:01:00.690
 here tires turned out eight pieces eight 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:04.250
 pieces on each wheel is equal to 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.380
 calculated and 8 pieces turned out 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.710
 such hooks 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.880
 to make themselves hubs to 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.350
 motoblock because the whole is no longer cheap 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:23.640
 my dear motor walker hex shaft 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.220
 So I thought how to make myself 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.869
 these hubs 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:32.060
 hub did elementary here see 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:37.950
 long they are in order 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:43.110
 here they are about 150 millimeters here and I 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.860
 calculated each facet consists of 18 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.750
 millimeters 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:55.210
 6 pieces cut here such here 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:59.020
 cut the long plate here and on the shaft 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.890
 all this wire squeezed and scalded but 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.140
 the last 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.010
 I do not scald here is the last not 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.890
 robbed because if you do everything in 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:12.190
 a bunch and like that to create on the shaft they are bad 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.510
 put on the hubs so I did 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.970
 Do not scalp the latter 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.550
 and slightly opened the hub well 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.270
 dressed on the shaft and scalded pasted here 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:27.400
 electrode and scalded from this here further 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:31.209
 all elementary centering on the plate from 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.340
 and scald here like this 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.620
 hexagon 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.950
 further holes are drilled which 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:43.920
 locking finger will be fixed here 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:47.610
 here and all four holes on the disk and 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.820
 These are just not 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.920
 grouser 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:58.330
 and working this year already I was working on 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:01.480
 They really liked here so much 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.790
 just make a hex here 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:10.180
 hexagon 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:13.510
 hub sleeve motoblock on tell 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.959
 for moto blog because I did not find the video 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.519
 I did not find a single video on the Internet 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:22.000
 given walk-behind tractor for petrol walk-behind tractor 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:24.700
 fort no adjustments anything next 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.370
 video I will tell about the device 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.519
 carburetor and how to tune it 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:34.320
 Thank you all for your attention.
