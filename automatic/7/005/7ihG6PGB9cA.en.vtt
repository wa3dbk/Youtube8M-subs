00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.990
 red lego hats for guys let's go 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.779
 to build the houses of these there was 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.789
 our little cannon that opens us 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.860
 this door in this way because 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:27.220
 we have access to this part of the port 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:31.390
 we are going to destroy all this since the 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:35.370
 Moneditas also serve us a lot and we 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.370
 they will be needed for the unlocks 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.210
 I 'll see what we have here 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.950
 missing pieces so we 're going to 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.329
 mount them quickly 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.159
 there is very good 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.870
 to the great we go for the little coins 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:53.429
 those who have stayed here and 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.429
 let's destroy the little box that 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.880
 OK, perfect 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.460
 we have here is worth more than appointments 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.090
 so we're going to keep riding the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.090
 very well 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.880
 there is perfect 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.780
 is what we have to do now it's worth 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:19.110
 well we have to go around this 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.560
 perfect very well there you have 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.890
 that we have here a small crane or 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.890
 something like that 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.170
 OK, very good 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.960
 right now we have to get a 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.540
 girl is worth 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.980
 let's go up here we go down 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.310
 over here and let's climb this 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.810
 and we have a chain 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.810
 let's help ourselves from it 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.180
 and here we have a lot of coins 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.490
 golden 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.530
 so let's take the ones I also have 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.280
 to climb up there 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.490
 it's very good we're here 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.399
 and we are going to use this 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.920
 this gizmo is worth there we have a 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.920
 pirate with a little stick looking for treasures 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.549
 so let's follow his movements 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.549
 without losing sight of it 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.470
 Well, it seems that it is something or something and I have not 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.470
 found nothing 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.530
 we have to follow him very well 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:33.080
 without losing our vision 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:35.530
 very well will dig again 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.260
 there is very good 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.920
 and they did not find anything like that either 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.920
 to follow him 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.720
 it's really cool here we are going to dig 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.720
 again 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:56.280
 it very well and it seems that this time and 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.280
 we have found something 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.340
 for boys in this way because it has 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.709
 unlocked our hat in red 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.760
 it's called treasure x 10 and it's going to 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:13.080
 cost 2 million 500 thousand small coins 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.760
 that we are going to buy it and what is it 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.040
 so multiply our little coins 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.450
 by 10 so let's activate it 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.630
 this treasure x 10 activated several guys 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:28.349
 having activated the treasure x2 treasure x 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:31.950
 60 x 10 we are going to multiply 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:34.260
 our little coins for 120 so now 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.420
 same we have run out of money and 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.770
 let's go 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:44.060
 for a few coins that you'll see 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.060
 that are going to be enough 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:50.070
 very well we are already in this part of the 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.940
 port and as you can see our little coins 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:56.900
 multiply by 120 we are going to get with 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:00.150
 martÃ­ that I do not know is much easier 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.700
 destroy the blocks ego landmarks and 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.800
 get the coins we're going to start 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.950
 here 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.770
 here is how you see we had 200,000 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.950
 little coins and in a short time we have 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.220
 got 900,000 and we have passed the 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.560
 million 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.620
 and well, this is the easiest way 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.780
 to get 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:27.880
 coins quickly 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.880
 we have entered the canteen that 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.090
 a cavern as you want to call it 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.340
 here we are also going to get hats 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.400
 of fringes red but also this what 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.530
 we leave for another episode for me what 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.480
 let's get all the coins 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.690
 that we can 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.110
 there it was very good and as you can see then 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.220
 we have 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:54.510
 more than 3 million pieces or coins 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.510
 how do you want to call him 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:02.729
 maybe at the beginning it will be difficult 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:06.960
 get the 2,500,000 to buy the 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:10.169
 lego red treasure hat x 10 but 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.849
 so it's pretty worth it for that 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.789
 I wanted to do the unlocking first 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:16.379
 these three hats that are 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:21.370
 multipliers of coins so not 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:24.639
 We are going to have more money problems 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.820
 guys there it is because we have five 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:30.040
 millions of coins or pieces of lego 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.139
 so I hope you like it is from 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.510
