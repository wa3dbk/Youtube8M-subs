 Today I came and I decided to do a tutorial 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:21.539
 It's how you know if you have viruses in your 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.240
 computer is not the total method but 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.269
 still very much in the performance of its 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.570
 computer because you know it exists 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:35.250
 very malicious program that you 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:40.379
 find positions in others and ignore 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:43.649
 or computer in our programs ie 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.579
 they start working to make it come to 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.070
 ground for you an easy way but that 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:55.860
 I also want you to know why it is 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.960

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.300
 windows component 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.520
 so you have to be careful and fail 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.960
 only as if above 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:10.010
 You know, click the start button and 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.010

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.590

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.750
 itec 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:34.140
 Then you explain in which local machine 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:39.780
 applies to who just pro is that software goes 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:43.320

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.369

 search windows from windows 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:57.619
 windows so that the im page is the 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:57.619
 sick part and demand occurs the reverse 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:14.180
