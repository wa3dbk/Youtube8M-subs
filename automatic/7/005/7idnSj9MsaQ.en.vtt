00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
too long focus on one idea and how to

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.090 
too long focus on one idea and how to

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
really expand on that one idea my

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.340 
really expand on that one idea my
favorite<00:01:03.489> movies<00:01:03.760> are<00:01:03.880> in<00:01:04.030> it<00:01:04.180> was<00:01:04.540> about<00:01:05.289> a

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350

favorite movies are in it was about a
flying<00:01:05.649> pig<00:01:05.889> I<00:01:06.130> got<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:06.609> idea<00:01:06.840> by<00:01:07.840> playing<00:01:08.289> the

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
flying pig I got the idea by playing the

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.980 
flying pig I got the idea by playing the
game<00:01:08.619> and<00:01:08.799> seeing<00:01:09.219> the<00:01:09.759> flying<00:01:10.569> pig<00:01:10.780> and

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
game and seeing the flying pig and

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.300 
game and seeing the flying pig and
that's<00:01:11.109> pretty<00:01:11.259> much<00:01:11.380> all<00:01:11.710> it's<00:01:11.889> about<00:01:12.009> it's

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
that's pretty much all it's about it's

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.800 
that's pretty much all it's about it's
just<00:01:12.490> different<00:01:12.729> scenes<00:01:13.210> of<00:01:13.420> him<00:01:13.569> flying

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
just different scenes of him flying

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.809 
just different scenes of him flying
through<00:01:14.079> the<00:01:14.200> sky<00:01:14.409> when<00:01:15.159> you're<00:01:15.280> building<00:01:15.520> an

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:15.819 
through the sky when you're building an

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:18.059 
through the sky when you're building an
environment<00:01:16.509> for<00:01:16.780> a<00:01:16.840> movie<00:01:17.259> you<00:01:17.499> really<00:01:17.799> are

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
going to be thinking in terms of L

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.050 
going to be thinking in terms of L
shapes<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:20.709> squares<00:01:21.130> you're<00:01:21.639> going<00:01:21.759> to<00:01:21.850> want
