strategy getting ready for New York
where<00:01:33.550> I<00:01:33.580> think<00:01:33.670> if<00:01:33.909> he<00:01:34.000> comes<00:01:34.179> in<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:34.960> happy

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
where I think if he comes in the happy

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.020 
where I think if he comes in the happy
medium<00:01:35.590> between<00:01:35.619> this<00:01:36.220> new<00:01:36.369> size<00:01:36.610> and<00:01:36.909> where

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
medium between this new size and where

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.160 
medium between this new size and where
he<00:01:37.090> was<00:01:37.240> at<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:37.450> Olympia<00:01:37.750> in<00:01:37.840> terms<00:01:38.020> of
