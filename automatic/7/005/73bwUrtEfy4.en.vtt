the you know clip some guy opening up

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.060 
the you know clip some guy opening up
the<00:00:14.400> door<00:00:14.639> this<00:00:15.420> box<00:00:15.809> kind<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.350> look<00:00:16.500> like<00:00:16.770> it's

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
the door this box kind of look like it's

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.740 
the door this box kind of look like it's
in<00:00:17.310> development<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.270> kind<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.600> like<00:00:18.720> a

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
in development it's kind of like a

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.320 
in development it's kind of like a
prototype<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.670> highly<00:00:20.670> doubt<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:20.939> we're

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
prototype I highly doubt that we're

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.509 
prototype I highly doubt that we're
gonna<00:00:21.420> get<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.689> box<00:00:21.930> like<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.340> cuz<00:00:23.340> we

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
gonna get a box like that cuz we

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.300 
gonna get a box like that cuz we
obviously<00:00:23.730> seen<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.330> scans<00:00:24.779> for<00:00:25.080> Walmart<00:00:25.560> and

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
obviously seen the scans for Walmart and

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.730 
obviously seen the scans for Walmart and
all<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.580> other<00:00:26.789> places<00:00:27.230> maybe<00:00:28.230> when<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.500> open

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
all the other places maybe when you open

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.740 
all the other places maybe when you open
the<00:00:28.830> birth<00:00:28.980> mother<00:00:29.160> box<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.330> what<00:00:30.539> comes

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
the birth mother box this is what comes

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.020 
the birth mother box this is what comes
out<00:00:30.990> but<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.470> highly<00:00:31.769> doubt<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.160> considering<00:00:32.880> so

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
out but I highly doubt it considering so

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.470 
out but I highly doubt it considering so
the<00:00:33.270> game<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.480> aimed<00:00:33.870> towards<00:00:34.260> cakes<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:35.480> he

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
the game is aimed towards cakes and he

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.920 
the game is aimed towards cakes and he
had<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.780> glowy<00:00:37.110> stuff<00:00:37.489> it's<00:00:38.489> probably<00:00:38.820> why<00:00:38.969> it

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
had the glowy stuff it's probably why it

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.040 
had the glowy stuff it's probably why it
cost<00:00:40.620> more<00:00:40.980> money<00:00:41.280> than<00:00:41.579> in<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.000> other<00:00:42.180> games

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
cost more money than in the other games

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.250 
cost more money than in the other games
to<00:00:43.410> life<00:00:44.160> journey<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.820> game<00:00:45.000> but<00:00:45.960> here<00:00:46.110> we

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
to life journey to the game but here we

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.690 
to life journey to the game but here we
see<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.530> guy<00:00:46.680> open<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.160> instructions

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
see the guy open in the instructions

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.520

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
which is pretty cool that it's actually

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.740 
which is pretty cool that it's actually
coming<00:00:49.890> with<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.100> instructions<00:00:50.640> actually<00:00:51.300> it

coming with the instructions actually it

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.720

infinity other portals a lot sure of
this<00:01:07.770> detector<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.790> he<00:01:08.939> had<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.270> his<00:01:09.390> hand

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
this detector that he had in his hand

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.679 
this detector that he had in his hand
but<00:01:10.380> look<00:01:10.530> at<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.150> Wizard<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.240> Oz

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
but look at that on Wizard of Oz

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.390 
but look at that on Wizard of Oz
reference<00:01:13.049> right<00:01:13.439> there<00:01:13.740> if<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.100> stud

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
reference right there if the stud

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.550 
reference right there if the stud
detector<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:15.119> part<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:15.930> little<00:01:16.320> place

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
detector is part of this little place

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.289 
detector is part of this little place
huh

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
huh

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.480 
huh
because<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.420> kind<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.659> looked<00:01:18.840> like<00:01:18.900> a

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
because it kind of looked like a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.690 
because it kind of looked like a
Batarang<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.820> some<00:01:21.180> sort<00:01:22.070> but<00:01:23.070> all<00:01:23.280> we<00:01:23.400> know<00:01:23.580> is

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
Batarang of some sort but all we know is

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.240 
Batarang of some sort but all we know is
that<00:01:23.729> does<00:01:24.119> call<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.479> portal<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.080> from<00:01:25.680> one<00:01:25.890> I'm

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
that does call it portal I from one I'm

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.890 
that does call it portal I from one I'm
not<00:01:26.460> really<00:01:26.729> too<00:01:26.970> sure<00:01:27.210> if<00:01:27.240> I'm<00:01:27.479> going<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.780> be

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
not really too sure if I'm going to be

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.289 
not really too sure if I'm going to be
building<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.770> portal<00:01:29.189> not<00:01:29.790> too<00:01:30.030> sure<00:01:30.210> if

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
building the portal not too sure if

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.270 
building the portal not too sure if
it'll<00:01:30.689> work<00:01:30.750> without<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.470> portal<00:01:31.890> since<00:01:32.159> I'm

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
it'll work without the portal since I'm

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.380 
it'll work without the portal since I'm
a<00:01:32.400> college<00:01:32.759> student

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
a college student

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.350 
a college student
maybe<00:01:34.110> just<00:01:34.710> maybe<00:01:35.040> it's<00:01:35.490> easier<00:01:35.790> for<00:01:36.000> me<00:01:36.180> to

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
maybe just maybe it's easier for me to

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.080 
maybe just maybe it's easier for me to
transfer<00:01:36.660> to<00:01:37.080> about<00:01:37.440> the<00:01:37.650> level<00:01:37.830> parts<00:01:38.370> so

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
transfer to about the level parts so

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.060 
transfer to about the level parts so
this<00:01:39.480> is<00:01:39.690> pretty<00:01:40.050> good<00:01:40.350> for<00:01:40.410> people<00:01:40.920> who<00:01:40.950> are

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
this is pretty good for people who are

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.090 
this is pretty good for people who are
actually<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.480> go<00:01:42.690> a<00:01:42.720> lot<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.290> he<00:01:43.620> seems<00:01:44.040> to

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
actually on the go a lot and he seems to

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.550 
actually on the go a lot and he seems to
have<00:01:44.190> a<00:01:44.340> lot<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.550> arcades<00:01:45.150> in<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.510> back<00:01:45.720> who

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560

knows if a lot of these arcade related

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.360 
knows if a lot of these arcade related
kind<00:01:49.020> kids<00:01:49.260> won't<00:01:49.470> make<00:01:49.650> their<00:01:49.860> game<00:01:50.100> people

such<00:03:44.780> as<00:03:45.019> a<00:03:45.290> lot<00:03:45.500> of<00:03:45.590> Ninjago<00:03:45.950> characters<00:03:46.610> and

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
such as a lot of Ninjago characters and

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.809 
such as a lot of Ninjago characters and
Tin<00:03:47.630> Man<00:03:47.840> actually<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.650> this<00:03:49.430> guy<00:03:49.610> actually

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
Tin Man actually and this guy actually

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.940 
Tin Man actually and this guy actually
did<00:03:50.060> put<00:03:50.450> a<00:03:50.510> modification<00:03:50.900> on<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.590> portal

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
did put a modification on the portal

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:52.449 
did put a modification on the portal
itself

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
itself

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.900

I'm<00:03:53.180> kind<00:03:53.450> of<00:03:53.709> wondering<00:03:54.709> if<00:03:55.250> a<00:03:55.459> few

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
I'm kind of wondering if a few

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.699 
I'm kind of wondering if a few
implementations<00:03:56.140> there<00:03:57.140> could<00:03:57.319> be<00:03:57.350> two

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
implementations there could be two

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.280 
implementations there could be two
portals<00:03:58.190> maybe<00:03:58.459> because<00:03:59.420> they<00:03:59.600> did<00:03:59.840> say<00:04:00.080> that

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
portals maybe because they did say that

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.240 
portals maybe because they did say that
this<00:04:00.470> game<00:04:00.680> will<00:04:00.920> last<00:04:01.250> longer<00:04:01.900> than<00:04:02.900> ones

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
this game will last longer than ones

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.320 
this game will last longer than ones
degeneration<00:04:04.250> for<00:04:04.519> example<00:04:04.940> if<00:04:05.000> you<00:04:05.120> buy<00:04:05.299> one

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
degeneration for example if you buy one

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.750 
degeneration for example if you buy one
is<00:04:05.840> good<00:04:06.140> for<00:04:06.319> the<00:04:06.380> part<00:04:06.620> 2<00:04:06.799> game<00:04:07.040> by<00:04:07.280> 3<00:04:07.519> game

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
is good for the part 2 game by 3 game

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.390 
is good for the part 2 game by 3 game
but<00:04:08.540> what<00:04:09.019> if<00:04:09.140> you<00:04:09.319> really<00:04:09.650> do<00:04:09.860> want<00:04:10.130> to<00:04:10.220> buy

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
but what if you really do want to buy

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.670 
but what if you really do want to buy
the<00:04:10.459> sequel<00:04:11.090> game<00:04:11.299> once<00:04:11.660> the<00:04:11.810> portal<00:04:12.170> does

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
the sequel game once the portal does

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
minifigures that's something that they

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.949 
minifigures that's something that they
should<00:04:16.549> implement<00:04:16.820> because<00:04:17.329> I<00:04:17.359> kind<00:04:17.690> of<00:04:17.750> want

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
should implement because I kind of want

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.930 
should implement because I kind of want

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
to boot in team battles which would

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.510 
to boot in team battles which would
actually<00:04:20.209> be<00:04:20.690> pretty<00:04:20.840> good<00:04:21.280> here<00:04:22.280> we<00:04:22.400> have

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
actually be pretty good here we have
