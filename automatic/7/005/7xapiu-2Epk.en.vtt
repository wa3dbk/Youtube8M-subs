00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.490 
Hollywood writers for the story of the
game<00:02:02.009> as<00:02:02.280> well<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:03.240> maybe<00:02:03.479> we<00:02:03.869> would<00:02:04.110> get<00:02:04.229> some

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
game as well so maybe we would get some

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.959 
game as well so maybe we would get some
better<00:02:04.619> storylines<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.520> would<00:02:05.729> be<00:02:05.790> pretty

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
better storylines that would be pretty

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.180 
better storylines that would be pretty
interesting<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.899> see<00:02:07.170> what<00:02:07.500> we<00:02:07.680> have<00:02:07.829> there

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
interesting to see what we have there

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.190 
interesting to see what we have there
and<00:02:08.369> he<00:02:08.670> also<00:02:08.849> announced<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.539> new<00:02:09.660> voice

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
and he also announced that a new voice

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.619 
and he also announced that a new voice
for<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.860> ghost<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.459> also<00:02:11.910> being<00:02:12.120> implemented

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
for the ghost is also being implemented

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.460 
for the ghost is also being implemented
maybe

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
maybe

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.860 
maybe
we'll<00:02:13.560> even<00:02:13.740> see<00:02:13.860> Morgan<00:02:14.640> Freeman<00:02:15.120> or<00:02:15.270> Homer

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
we'll even see Morgan Freeman or Homer

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.260 
we'll even see Morgan Freeman or Homer
Simpson<00:02:16.470> being<00:02:17.160> used<00:02:17.460> for<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.790> voice<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:18.240> the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
Simpson being used for the voice of the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.540 
Simpson being used for the voice of the
ghost<00:02:18.630> now<00:02:19.230> bungee<00:02:19.650> apparently<00:02:20.100> stated<00:02:20.460> that

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
ghost now bungee apparently stated that

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.190 
ghost now bungee apparently stated that
they<00:02:20.700> are<00:02:20.820> not<00:02:21.060> going<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.450> continue<00:02:21.780> with<00:02:21.990> deal

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
they are not going to continue with deal

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.410 
they are not going to continue with deal
sees<00:02:22.530> but<00:02:22.980> instead<00:02:23.370> would<00:02:23.670> release<00:02:24.030> free

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
sees but instead would release free

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.080 
sees but instead would release free
raids<00:02:24.750> planets<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.680> more<00:02:26.250> throughout<00:02:26.640> time

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
raids planets and more throughout time

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.880 
raids planets and more throughout time
and<00:02:27.360> they<00:02:27.750> will<00:02:27.900> only<00:02:28.080> be<00:02:28.290> continuing<00:02:28.860> with

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
and they will only be continuing with

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.860 
and they will only be continuing with
the<00:02:29.100> main<00:02:29.310> games<00:02:29.610> after<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.060> taken<00:02:30.450> King<00:02:30.660> and

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
the main games after the taken King and

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.010 
the main games after the taken King and
its<00:02:31.380> successor<00:02:32.010> DLCs<00:02:32.820> now<00:02:33.600> I'm<00:02:33.720> not<00:02:33.870> really

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
its successor DLCs now I'm not really

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.110 
its successor DLCs now I'm not really
sure<00:02:34.140> how<00:02:35.100> they<00:02:35.430> would<00:02:35.460> actually<00:02:35.940> do<00:02:36.090> that

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
sure how they would actually do that

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.480 
sure how they would actually do that
because<00:02:36.420> activision<00:02:37.170> would<00:02:37.620> probably<00:02:38.280> want

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
because activision would probably want

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.490 
because activision would probably want
to<00:02:38.640> implement<00:02:38.940> DLCs<00:02:39.510> because<00:02:39.900> they<00:02:40.020> have<00:02:40.230> done

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
to implement DLCs because they have done

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.170 
to implement DLCs because they have done
that<00:02:40.620> in<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.830> past<00:02:40.920> with<00:02:41.340> call<00:02:41.550> of<00:02:41.580> duty<00:02:42.060> and

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
that in the past with call of duty and

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.780 
that in the past with call of duty and
many<00:02:42.750> other<00:02:42.930> games<00:02:43.230> like<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:44.460> it's

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
many other games like that so it's

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.370 
many other games like that so it's
really<00:02:45.090> interesting<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.720> see<00:02:45.990> what<00:02:46.110> we<00:02:46.230> have

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
really interesting to see what we have

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.290 
really interesting to see what we have
with<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:46.890> now<00:02:47.340> getting<00:02:47.670> into<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.910> taken

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
with that now getting into the taken

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.960 
with that now getting into the taken
king<00:02:48.600> we<00:02:48.959> found<00:02:49.140> out<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.440> artifacts<00:02:50.280> are<00:02:50.550> not

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
king we found out that artifacts are not

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.240 
king we found out that artifacts are not
in<00:02:51.150> fact<00:02:51.360> going<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.080> be<00:02:52.320> relics<00:02:52.830> they're<00:02:53.040> going

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
in fact going to be relics they're going

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.130 
in fact going to be relics they're going
to<00:02:53.310> be<00:02:53.430> something<00:02:53.700> completely<00:02:54.270> different

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
to be something completely different

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.230 
to be something completely different
they're<00:02:55.680> going<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:55.890> be<00:02:56.040> much<00:02:56.310> cooler<00:02:56.640> giving

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
they're going to be much cooler giving

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.570 
they're going to be much cooler giving

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
play now like I said before none of this

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.770 
play now like I said before none of this
is<00:03:01.950> confirmed<00:03:02.610> but<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.209> is<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.480> very

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
is confirmed but it is a very

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.080 
is confirmed but it is a very
interesting<00:03:04.020> topic<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.890> discuss<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.610> that<00:03:05.970> is

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090
