00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello together and welcome 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.190
 at this screencast and captain 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.290
 Cruise differently is a ndr reportage 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.570
 from monday this week that for a lot 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.990
 vortex has worried because two relatively 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:17.160
 unconscious Kreuzberg newbies with aida im 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.779
 mediterranean were on the way and the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.789
 make a scathing judgment 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.539
 actually come and actually all 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.609
 Newcomers must have fear 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.849
 to go with all the holidays and that is 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.589
 completely wrong how many I say 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.969
 Yesterday have a tv-criticism with 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.620
 published and the 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.230
 Report in detail 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.910
 looked at and can be driven apart 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.500
 you almost do it because he just 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.659
 really many handicraft defects in it 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.550
 are and just things are claimed 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:46.949
 which are not at all like that for everyone 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.649
 you who have not seen the show 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:52.159
 I recommend ndr.de to surf here 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.570
 go upstairs to the media library 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:58.430
 over the mediathek you can here the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.479
 choose missed shipments 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.339
 the internet is a bit of a chance 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:04.890
 Here, the date blows up here 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.810
 the 19 may is the first 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.729
 broadcast dates broadcast scrolls 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.979
 bit down to 21 o'clock here 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.860
 Large holiday check cruise arrives 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.240
 you can start the video and you 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.950
 For three quarters of an hour, something like that is surprising 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.810
 for singular results the makers 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.420
 come 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.890
 Here we can already see the two 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.880
 leading actress frauke and julia sander 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.540
 are the first time on one 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.579
 Cruise ship 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.259
 I phoned Joscha yesterday 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.300
 and indeed he actually feels 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.400
 correctly reproduced so many things 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.800
 which he then experienced are still 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.659
 not so optimally run out of his 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.370
 you have to say that the couple 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.210
 really not well informed at all 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.700
 has as much as expensive internet what i have 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.250
 mentioned here sometimes have the approximately 160 euros 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.909
 this is to be found on aida de 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.560
 So that's not a thing somehow 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.590
 fell from the tree or or 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.159
 Somehow surprising is there 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.729
 you would have a little yes 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.409
 may seek the circumstance also falls 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.360
 that the onboard bill will always be 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.920
 thereon 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.009
 above the cocktails just cost money yes 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.210
 cocktails cost money 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.040
 But that is in every other hotel 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.450
 just like that and it always depends 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.430
 repeatedly emphasized that above 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.230
 that is confusing and that one 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.900
 do not know how much you pay behind 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.730
 it has to be that over the tv 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.350
 directly accessible in the cabin 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.700
 You can also pass the front desk 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.310
 go and say hey people how much must 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.520
 I pay the previous and wife and 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.870
 mother were reasonably needed 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.120
 you do not have your cabin the same 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.470
 found something critical 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.440
 it was clear to her that was it 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.140
 ship big but not so big 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.209
 how to get the other ships and that one 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.580
 as a cruise first time rookie 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:50.440
 Difficulties have its dates 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.580
 it is not surprising to find it 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.260
 That's why now the holiday 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.989
 I should not know if it should be bad 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.260
 that is really important to me too 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.300
 noticed that the makers 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.810
 actually went with the intention ran 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.450
 are 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.020
 The cruise also goes well behind 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.180
 come 1490 euro with flights together 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.320
 certainly a lot but the sanders have 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.540
 also very nice 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.120
 the heritage lived so it has 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.670
 Get massaged for a lot of money you have 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.440
 he has booked expensive land excursions 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.600
 An import shop bought a pair of glasses 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.230
 People if you want a cheap cruise 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.180
 wants to do 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:31.310
 you always see that on my blog 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:34.010
 again then you can find that 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.970
 I'm extremely unfair again here 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.769
 deals with alida 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.330
 That's why I said yesterday as I said 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.940
 this article written in tv review 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.769
 and fact check in the report of 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.930
 I arrived extremely well with you 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.400
 have quite a few comments already on the 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.830
 Many thanks for this blog 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:54.280
 that he strengthens my back on himself 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:58.900
 in the one group is on facebook 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.380
 This contribution is visited very often 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.320
 been 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:08.790
 and also there are all people actually 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:12.370
 just this view that the impossible 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:16.120
 broadcast was just as with us 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.970
 captain kreuzberg on facebook over 760 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.670
 People licon that many many really 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.550
 many comments about that people 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.930
 get so excited that they 're there 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.730
 is displayed poorly and that too 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.320
 rightly because I really think that 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.940
 handicrafts are still and 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.650
 holes in it 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.850
 I have the ndr addressed 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.180
 I have in a report yesterday too 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:43.360
 mentioned while so the press officer 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:48.190
 from aida the fans you can here 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:50.350
 You see , that's more about it 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.850
 tendentious reporting went down and 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.470
 most of them would be very nice 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.860
 Everyone is happy with everything 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:05:00.940
 confirmed or many many on facebook 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:05.080
 Confirm the woman stops benz 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.700
 the press office that's easy 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.280
 been transparent price comparisons 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.280
 and therefore their management 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.510
 opportunity had somehow to it 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.560
 take position and this 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.840
 justifications in the film 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.700
 I think that's what it is 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.700
 not optimally successful 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:25.990
 I think the report in the ndr was one 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:27.910
 insolence and 16 comments here with me 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.710
 on the blog show that as well 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.090
 really 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.280
 it really is in unison so that the 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.229
 people are really mad so everyone 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.030
 more often with an idea proves wondering 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.229
 worry about that 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.380
 Incidentally, the highlight was me 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:44.110
 cause a picture of james rizzi here 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.900
 600 euros was priced I have in 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.540
 calorie 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.820
 in dortmund in hamburg where i travel 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:53.720
 was already twice the triple 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.490
 quadruple seen so far art 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.590
 I have written coal and so on 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.690
 is the time out of dear people 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.800
 that was my first screencast i hope 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.320
 you liked it a bit 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.940
 I am looking forward to more comments here 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.860
 facebook or of course on my blog 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.289
 now seen the new layout is too 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.180
 I'll be there soon 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:14.800
 I also thank you on Mondays 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.800
 you and good day you all the best
