very<00:05:01.750> simple<00:05:02.110> basic<00:05:02.740> but<00:05:03.310> a<00:05:03.430> very<00:05:03.849> very<00:05:04.090> good

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
very simple basic but a very very good

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.969 
very simple basic but a very very good
build<00:05:04.539> nonetheless<00:05:04.840> so<00:05:05.199> congratulations<00:05:05.919> to

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
build nonetheless so congratulations to

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:07.770 
build nonetheless so congratulations to
you<00:05:06.190> you<00:05:06.699> got<00:05:06.880> third<00:05:07.180> place<00:05:07.210> in<00:05:07.509> the<00:05:07.690> universe

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
signed object so in second place we had

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.439 
signed object so in second place we had
entry<00:05:13.389> number<00:05:14.039> 287<00:05:15.039> so<00:05:15.969> here<00:05:16.150> you<00:05:16.270> have<00:05:16.300> it

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.839 
entry number 287 so here you have it
this<00:05:16.990> was<00:05:17.229> one<00:05:17.560> of<00:05:17.590> the<00:05:17.889> best<00:05:18.039> bills<00:05:18.310> we<00:05:18.490> got<00:05:18.669> I

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
this was one of the best bills we got I

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:20.279 
this was one of the best bills we got I
say<00:05:19.030> one<00:05:19.210> of<00:05:19.240> the<00:05:19.449> best<00:05:19.629> because<00:05:19.870> there<00:05:19.990> is<00:05:20.110> one

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289 
say one of the best because there is one

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:22.050 
say one of the best because there is one
better<00:05:20.500> but<00:05:21.219> the<00:05:21.340> reason<00:05:21.460> that<00:05:21.639> this<00:05:21.849> did<00:05:22.030> not

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
better but the reason that this did not

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.180 
better but the reason that this did not
get<00:05:22.360> first<00:05:22.599> place<00:05:22.810> is<00:05:23.110> we<00:05:23.830> thought<00:05:23.979> it<00:05:24.099> was

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
get first place is we thought it was

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.189 
get first place is we thought it was
very<00:05:24.370> good<00:05:24.550> very<00:05:24.610> detailed<00:05:25.150> but<00:05:25.719> we<00:05:25.900> have<00:05:26.020> seen

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
very good very detailed but we have seen

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:28.020 
very good very detailed but we have seen
this<00:05:26.229> a<00:05:26.380> lot<00:05:26.469> before<00:05:26.979> these<00:05:27.370> designs<00:05:27.759> aren't

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
this a lot before these designs aren't

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.670 
this a lot before these designs aren't
completely<00:05:28.360> original<00:05:28.630> we've<00:05:29.469> definitely

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
completely original we've definitely

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.499 
completely original we've definitely
seen<00:05:30.069> the<00:05:30.130> fountain<00:05:30.550> before<00:05:30.729> we've<00:05:31.150> seen<00:05:31.389> the

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:31.509 
seen the fountain before we've seen the

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:32.879 
seen the fountain before we've seen the
walls<00:05:31.690> before<00:05:31.960> we've<00:05:32.289> seen<00:05:32.469> the<00:05:32.560> towers

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
walls before we've seen the towers

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.129 
walls before we've seen the towers
before<00:05:33.219> but<00:05:33.969> nonetheless<00:05:34.120> it<00:05:34.479> must<00:05:34.930> have<00:05:35.080> been

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
before but nonetheless it must have been

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:36.480 
before but nonetheless it must have been
very<00:05:35.199> difficult<00:05:35.380> to<00:05:35.800> build<00:05:35.919> because<00:05:36.190> there

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
very difficult to build because there

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.120 
very difficult to build because there
was<00:05:36.580> no<00:05:36.729> creative<00:05:37.180> mode<00:05:37.360> and<00:05:38.289> it<00:05:38.590> was<00:05:38.710> just<00:05:38.889> it

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
was no creative mode and it was just it

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.129 
was no creative mode and it was just it
was<00:05:39.190> it<00:05:39.969> was<00:05:40.090> put<00:05:40.210> together<00:05:40.330> very<00:05:40.690> well<00:05:40.750> it<00:05:41.020> was

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
was it was put together very well it was

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:43.830 
was it was put together very well it was
very<00:05:41.169> well<00:05:41.529> structured<00:05:41.919> and<00:05:42.460> Ryan<00:05:42.969> and<00:05:43.060> I<00:05:43.210> had

very good time just looking at this one
and<00:05:46.210> judging<00:05:46.569> it<00:05:46.690> so<00:05:47.169> we<00:05:47.380> decided<00:05:47.650> to<00:05:47.800> give

and finally the first place winner of
the<00:05:59.889> universe<00:06:00.279> competition<00:06:00.520> is<00:06:01.150> entry<00:06:02.139> number

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:03.569 
the universe competition is entry number

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:06.839 
the universe competition is entry number
208<00:06:04.569> so<00:06:05.020> I<00:06:05.259> think<00:06:05.680> see<00:06:05.949> this<00:06:06.099> one<00:06:06.279> as<00:06:06.699> it

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:06.849 
208 so I think see this one as it

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:08.640 
208 so I think see this one as it
doesn't<00:06:07.090> have<00:06:07.270> as<00:06:07.360> much<00:06:07.479> stuff<00:06:07.990> as<00:06:08.199> the<00:06:08.529> other

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
doesn't have as much stuff as the other

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.589 
doesn't have as much stuff as the other
two<00:06:08.889> but<00:06:09.159> we'll<00:06:09.550> really<00:06:09.759> made<00:06:10.300> this<00:06:10.419> one

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 
two but we'll really made this one

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:13.170 
two but we'll really made this one
standout<00:06:11.050> is<00:06:11.259> uh<00:06:11.319> it<00:06:12.219> was<00:06:12.340> just<00:06:12.490> unique<00:06:12.819> the

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
standout is uh it was just unique the

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.930 
standout is uh it was just unique the
buildings<00:06:13.779> were<00:06:13.900> original<00:06:14.440> there<00:06:15.250> were<00:06:15.370> farms

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
buildings were original there were farms

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.490 
buildings were original there were farms
which<00:06:16.210> is<00:06:16.360> something<00:06:16.539> I<00:06:16.719> think<00:06:16.930> every<00:06:17.259> good

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
which is something I think every good

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.320 
which is something I think every good
minecraft<00:06:17.979> build<00:06:18.219> should<00:06:18.430> have<00:06:18.610> other

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
minecraft build should have other

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.540 
minecraft build should have other
animals<00:06:19.930> there<00:06:20.319> were<00:06:20.469> it<00:06:20.860> was<00:06:21.009> just<00:06:21.159> those

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
animals there were it was just those

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.100 
animals there were it was just those
more<00:06:21.759> minecraft<00:06:22.419> II<00:06:22.539> the<00:06:22.659> other<00:06:22.750> ones<00:06:22.960> were

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
more minecraft II the other ones were

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.279 
more minecraft II the other ones were
kind<00:06:23.349> of

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:24.289 
kind of

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:25.779 
kind of
it's<00:06:24.710> hard<00:06:24.919> to<00:06:25.009> explain<00:06:25.189> the<00:06:25.430> other<00:06:25.550> ones<00:06:25.669> were

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:25.789 
it's hard to explain the other ones were

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:27.339 
it's hard to explain the other ones were
just<00:06:25.969> kind<00:06:26.119> of<00:06:26.149> like<00:06:26.270> buildings<00:06:26.779> put<00:06:27.169> together

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:27.349 
just kind of like buildings put together

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:29.519 
just kind of like buildings put together
and<00:06:27.860> structured<00:06:28.430> nice<00:06:28.759> this<00:06:29.059> one<00:06:29.240> actually

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:29.529 
and structured nice this one actually

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:32.019 
and structured nice this one actually
kind<00:06:30.529> of<00:06:30.559> shows<00:06:30.830> minecraft<00:06:31.550> you<00:06:31.699> even<00:06:31.909> have<00:06:31.999> a

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:32.029 
kind of shows minecraft you even have a

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:34.209 
kind of shows minecraft you even have a
treehouse<00:06:32.509> the<00:06:32.869> treehouse<00:06:33.529> was<00:06:33.710> really<00:06:34.009> nice

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:34.219 
treehouse the treehouse was really nice

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:37.389 
treehouse the treehouse was really nice
and<00:06:34.569> all<00:06:35.569> together<00:06:35.809> we<00:06:36.069> decided<00:06:37.069> that<00:06:37.219> this

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:37.399 
and all together we decided that this

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:41.230 
and all together we decided that this
deserved<00:06:37.969> first<00:06:38.270> place<00:06:38.830> it<00:06:39.830> wasn't<00:06:40.580> like<00:06:40.699> the

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
deserved first place it wasn't like the

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.929 
deserved first place it wasn't like the
greatest<00:06:41.569> built<00:06:41.960> in<00:06:42.289> the<00:06:42.619> world<00:06:42.860> but<00:06:43.249> out<00:06:43.879> of

00:06:43.929 --> 00:06:43.939 
greatest built in the world but out of
