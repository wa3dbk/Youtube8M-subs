00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
ahead and you want to push this lever in

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.190 
ahead and you want to push this lever in
the<00:02:32.340> top<00:02:32.580> one<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.090> at<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.450> same<00:02:33.690> time<00:02:33.930> you

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
the top one and at the same time you

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.720 
the top one and at the same time you
want<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.470> go<00:02:34.770> ahead<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.160> slide<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.580> bottom

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
want to go ahead and slide the bottom

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.660 
want to go ahead and slide the bottom
one<00:02:36.060> down<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.660> open<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:37.050> up<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.470> if<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.460> do

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
one down to open it up and if you do

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.800 
one down to open it up and if you do
that<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:39.060> takes<00:02:39.210> a<00:02:39.330> little<00:02:39.390> bit<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.600> practice

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
that it takes a little bit of practice

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.970 
that it takes a little bit of practice
at<00:02:40.140> first<00:02:40.250> but<00:02:41.250> then<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.670> door<00:02:42.030> should<00:02:42.980> go

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
at first but then that door should go

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.540 
at first but then that door should go
ahead<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:44.280> open<00:02:44.400> up<00:02:44.670> for<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:46.340> so<00:02:47.340> this<00:02:47.490> is

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
ahead and open up for you so this is

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
advance it right up to that where that

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.960 
advance it right up to that where that
red<00:03:53.519> index<00:03:54.120> is<00:03:55.190> and<00:03:56.190> you'll<00:03:56.519> see<00:03:56.730> that<00:03:56.910> right

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
red index is and you'll see that right

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.940 
red index is and you'll see that right
here<00:03:58.400> that<00:03:59.400> index<00:03:59.910> marker<00:04:00.739> basically<00:04:01.739> said

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
here that index marker basically said

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.590 
here that index marker basically said
that's<00:04:02.190> where<00:04:02.489> you<00:04:02.640> advance<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.090> film<00:04:03.330> leader

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
that's where you advance the film leader

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.440 
that's where you advance the film leader
-<00:04:03.930> and<00:04:04.200> it<00:04:04.950> should<00:04:05.720> catch<00:04:07.910> this<00:04:08.910> film<00:04:09.209> leader

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
- and it should catch this film leader

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.340 
- and it should catch this film leader
at<00:04:09.780> that<00:04:10.500> point<00:04:10.830> right<00:04:11.100> there<00:04:11.160> I'm<00:04:12.120> actually

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
at that point right there I'm actually

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.199 
at that point right there I'm actually
been<00:04:13.350> advancing<00:04:13.950> just<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.400> little<00:04:14.820> bit<00:04:14.940> further

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
been advancing just a little bit further

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.199 
been advancing just a little bit further
than<00:04:15.480> that<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:16.820> also<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:17.880> want<00:04:17.970> to<00:04:18.060> make<00:04:18.120> sure

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
than that and also you want to make sure

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.780 
than that and also you want to make sure
that<00:04:18.450> this<00:04:18.630> is<00:04:18.840> nice<00:04:19.109> and<00:04:19.320> flat<00:04:19.650> in<00:04:20.010> here

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
that this is nice and flat in here

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.980 
that this is nice and flat in here
as<00:04:21.390> well<00:04:22.070> and<00:04:23.070> then<00:04:23.220> basically<00:04:23.670> at<00:04:23.760> this<00:04:23.880> point

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
as well and then basically at this point

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.340 
as well and then basically at this point
you<00:04:25.260> close<00:04:25.560> the<00:04:25.590> door<00:04:26.900> make<00:04:27.900> sure<00:04:27.930> it's<00:04:28.200> locked

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
you close the door make sure it's locked

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.050 
you close the door make sure it's locked
in<00:04:28.590> place

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
in place

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.930 
in place
and<00:04:30.360> then<00:04:31.080> to<00:04:31.620> advance<00:04:31.980> that<00:04:32.280> to<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.640> first

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
and then to advance that to the first

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.800 
and then to advance that to the first
frame<00:04:33.480> of<00:04:33.890> your<00:04:34.890> exposure<00:04:35.450> you<00:04:36.450> basically

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
frame of your exposure you basically

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.840 
frame of your exposure you basically
take<00:04:37.110> and<00:04:37.440> hold<00:04:38.040> down<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:39.050> shutter<00:04:40.050> button<00:04:40.850> so

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
take and hold down the shutter button so

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.850 
take and hold down the shutter button so
we're<00:04:42.000> to<00:04:42.060> go<00:04:42.150> ahead<00:04:42.240> and<00:04:42.420> do<00:04:42.570> that<00:04:42.600> and<00:04:43.170> then

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
we're to go ahead and do that and then

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.240 
we're to go ahead and do that and then
you<00:04:44.010> you<00:04:44.460> just<00:04:44.670> heard<00:04:44.880> the<00:04:45.300> film<00:04:46.290> advance<00:04:46.740> in

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
you you just heard the film advance in

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.670 
you you just heard the film advance in
place<00:04:47.490> for<00:04:48.330> the<00:04:48.420> first<00:04:48.660> exposure<00:04:49.050> and<00:04:49.440> to

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
place for the first exposure and to

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.370 
place for the first exposure and to
confirm<00:04:50.040> that<00:04:50.310> it<00:04:51.210> does<00:04:51.420> stay<00:04:51.600> number<00:04:51.840> one<00:04:51.930> on

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
confirm that it does stay number one on

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.830 
confirm that it does stay number one on
here<00:04:54.350> so<00:04:55.350> that's<00:04:55.920> really<00:04:56.160> it<00:04:56.570> as<00:04:57.570> far<00:04:57.810> as

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
here so that's really it as far as

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.320

loading film into your f-100 it's a

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.560 
loading film into your f-100 it's a
fairly<00:05:00.540> automated<00:05:00.990> process<00:05:02.300> and<00:05:04.910> it's<00:05:05.910> it's

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
fairly automated process and it's it's

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.260 
fairly automated process and it's it's
pretty<00:05:06.810> straightforward<00:05:07.490> and<00:05:08.490> I've<00:05:09.150> never

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
pretty straightforward and I've never

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.690 
pretty straightforward and I've never
had<00:05:09.600> it<00:05:09.810> where<00:05:10.650> it<00:05:10.740> said<00:05:10.950> number<00:05:11.100> one<00:05:11.220> and<00:05:11.610> it

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
had it where it said number one and it

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.250 
had it where it said number one and it
really<00:05:11.880> wasn't<00:05:12.150> loaded<00:05:12.390> properly<00:05:12.750> or<00:05:13.110> it

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
really wasn't loaded properly or it

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.660 
really wasn't loaded properly or it
where<00:05:13.650> it<00:05:13.740> didn't<00:05:13.980> advance<00:05:14.220> to<00:05:14.460> the<00:05:14.580> next

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
where it didn't advance to the next

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.030 
where it didn't advance to the next
frame<00:05:15.170> properly<00:05:16.170> so<00:05:16.350> that's<00:05:16.470> that's<00:05:16.890> pretty

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
frame properly so that's that's pretty

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.920 
frame properly so that's that's pretty
