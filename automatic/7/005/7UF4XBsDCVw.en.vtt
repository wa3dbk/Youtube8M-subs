left to cover I think the JavaScript
going<00:01:57.479> through<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.719> much<00:01:57.899> faster<00:01:58.409> cpu<00:01:58.920> is

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
going through the much faster cpu is

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.219 
going through the much faster cpu is
making<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.399> big<00:01:59.610> difference<00:01:59.930> because<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.140> can

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
making a big difference because you can

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.780 
making a big difference because you can
see<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:01.469> not<00:02:01.619> going<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.460> little<00:02:02.579> ways<00:02:02.759> and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
see it's not going a little ways and

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.370 
see it's not going a little ways and
stop<00:02:03.210> big<00:02:03.360> when<00:02:03.509> Louise<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.869> stopping<00:02:04.079> it's

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
stop big when Louise and stopping it's

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.320 
stop big when Louise and stopping it's
it's<00:02:05.750> smashing<00:02:06.750> through<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.229> javascript

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
it's smashing through that javascript

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.290 
it's smashing through that javascript
let's<00:02:09.330> try<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.660> again<00:02:09.780> we're<00:02:10.319> going<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.739> do<00:02:10.890> our

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.840 

so<00:02:13.750> there<00:02:13.990> we<00:02:14.110> go<00:02:14.170> it<00:02:14.440> pops<00:02:14.770> up<00:02:14.920> much<00:02:15.250> faster<00:02:15.280> on

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
so there we go it pops up much faster on

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.490 
so there we go it pops up much faster on
