metal detector in one scoop
I<00:00:16.340> started<00:00:17.340> metal<00:00:17.580> detecting<00:00:18.029> back<00:00:18.480> in<00:00:18.660> 1976

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
I started metal detecting back in 1976

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.279 
I started metal detecting back in 1976
in<00:00:20.090> those<00:00:21.090> days<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.600> couldn't<00:00:21.779> get<00:00:21.990> all<00:00:22.140> the

you know quit for a diver I wasn't a
diver<00:00:30.920> but<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:31.949> adapted<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.520> white<00:00:33.260> to<00:00:34.260> where<00:00:34.380> I

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
diver but I adapted a white to where I

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.750 
diver but I adapted a white to where I
could<00:00:34.649> use<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.579> go<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> water<00:00:36.600> -<00:00:36.989> wait

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
could use it to go in the water - wait

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
could use it to go in the water - wait
now<00:00:39.170> I'm<00:00:40.170> going<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.440> go<00:00:40.559> in<00:00:41.750> and<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:45.260> big

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
main part of the sector here this white

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.690 
main part of the sector here this white
that<00:00:51.990> is<00:00:52.380> where<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> electronics<00:00:53.520> is

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
that is where the electronics is

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.870 
that is where the electronics is
situated<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.330> looks<00:00:54.480> like<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> capsule<00:00:55.760> takes<00:00:56.760> a

9-volt battery and of course the
headphones<00:00:59.670> are<00:00:59.940> hanging<00:01:00.330> there<00:01:00.860> now<00:01:01.860> the

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
headphones are hanging there now the

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.880 
headphones are hanging there now the
whole<00:01:02.880> detector<00:01:03.480> originally<00:01:04.580> was<00:01:05.660> from<00:01:06.890> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
whole detector originally was from the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.360 
whole detector originally was from the
coil<00:01:08.720> up<00:01:09.720> until<00:01:10.229> about<00:01:10.380> right<00:01:10.830> there<00:01:11.100> just

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
coil up until about right there just

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.860 
coil up until about right there just
above<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.560> top<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.860> detector<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.870> modified

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
above the top of the detector I modified

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.130 
above the top of the detector I modified
it<00:01:16.080> with<00:01:16.260> a<00:01:16.470> longer<00:01:16.800> shaft<00:01:17.220> off<00:01:17.840> another<00:01:18.840> old

it with a longer shaft off another old

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.280 
it with a longer shaft off another old
detector<00:01:20.000> to<00:01:21.000> have<00:01:21.240> one<00:01:21.479> long<00:01:21.780> enough<00:01:21.930> to

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
detector to have one long enough to

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.260 
detector to have one long enough to
where<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.500> could<00:01:22.710> wait<00:01:23.509> the<00:01:24.509> little<00:01:24.930> top

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
where I could wait the little top

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.840 
where I could wait the little top
medicine<00:01:27.270> bottle<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.660> you<00:01:27.780> see<00:01:27.960> up<00:01:28.080> there

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
medicine bottle that you see up there

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.109 
medicine bottle that you see up there
contains<00:01:29.850> overing<00:01:30.390> lubricant<00:01:31.020> because<00:01:32.119> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
contains overing lubricant because the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.390 
contains overing lubricant because the
you<00:01:33.930> had<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.229> open<00:01:34.500> up<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.800> electronic

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
you had to open up the electronic

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.940 
you had to open up the electronic
section<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.899> has<00:01:37.020> an<00:01:37.140> o-ring<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.530> protect

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
section and it has an o-ring to protect

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.030 
section and it has an o-ring to protect
it<00:01:38.100> from<00:01:38.130> getting<00:01:38.310> water<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.119> now<00:01:40.040> we

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040
