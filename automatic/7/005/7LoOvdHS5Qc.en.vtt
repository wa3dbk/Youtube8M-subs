00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.820 
you know what I mean yeah yeah well
anyway<00:02:25.030> but<00:02:25.810> don't<00:02:26.019> worry<00:02:26.170> about<00:02:26.470> more<00:02:26.680> you

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
anyway but don't worry about more you

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.350 
anyway but don't worry about more you
know<00:02:26.950> don't<00:02:27.280> worry<00:02:27.370> about<00:02:27.580> it<00:02:27.670> I<00:02:27.790> think<00:02:28.269> the

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
know don't worry about it I think the

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.780 
know don't worry about it I think the
solution<00:02:28.630> is<00:02:28.930> we<00:02:29.320> can<00:02:29.530> just<00:02:29.650> write<00:02:29.860> adam<00:02:30.430> /

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
solution is we can just write adam /

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.630 
solution is we can just write adam /
Todd<00:02:31.600> and<00:02:32.019> then<00:02:32.560> that<00:02:32.799> or<00:02:33.310> we<00:02:33.459> could<00:02:33.610> just

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
Todd and then that or we could just

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.340 
Todd and then that or we could just
write<00:02:33.910> Adam<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.570> know<00:02:34.690> we<00:02:34.840> could<00:02:34.870> relieve<00:02:35.230> an

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
write Adam you know we could relieve an

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.140 
write Adam you know we could relieve an
item<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.860> make<00:02:36.160> oh<00:02:36.310> now<00:02:36.519> they're<00:02:36.790> looking<00:02:36.880> it

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
item to make oh now they're looking it

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.729 
item to make oh now they're looking it
up<00:02:37.269> that's<00:02:37.570> really<00:02:37.810> bring<00:02:38.049> then<00:02:38.320> you<00:02:38.470> would

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
up that's really bring then you would

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.500 
up that's really bring then you would
know<00:02:38.890> how<00:02:39.070> many<00:02:39.250> army<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:39.820> how<00:02:39.970> many<00:02:40.030> are<00:02:40.209> you

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
know how many army and how many are you

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.449 
know how many army and how many are you
and<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:41.230> would<00:02:41.410> be<00:02:41.560> weird<00:02:41.769> yeah<00:02:42.040> that's<00:02:42.280> true

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459

and that would be weird yeah that's true
okay<00:02:42.940> so<00:02:43.000> then<00:02:43.209> why<00:02:43.360> don't<00:02:43.420> we<00:02:43.600> just<00:02:43.780> do<00:02:43.930> the

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
okay so then why don't we just do the

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.770 
okay so then why don't we just do the
atom<00:02:44.350> /<00:02:44.500> top<00:02:45.040> fine<00:02:45.310> I<00:02:45.519> wore<00:02:45.880> it<00:02:45.910> well<00:02:46.150> or<00:02:46.450> and

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
atom / top fine I wore it well or and

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.610
