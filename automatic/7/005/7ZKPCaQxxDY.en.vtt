00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.529
 I'm going to fish for me today 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.080
 which is called pollock yes it doesn't matter 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.450
 what kind of fish really well I sure 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.030
 I think it's good for fishcakes 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.770
 first of all white fish i mean fish 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.750
 which meat is white 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.539
 so here I actually do not need 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.920
 so somehow get too hung up on 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.420
 In this I will prepare this child for 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:32.279
 cutlet namely my task now 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:36.930
 just remove the meat from her now I'm in 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.510
 Generally it is said to cut into fillets here 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.649
 one fillet 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:48.780
 here is the second filet spine I won't 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:53.850
 use as you understand it here 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.280
 fish mean look here I have a fish 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.840
 there are still bones here there are still 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:08.240
 all sorts of fins I ruthlessly 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:13.290
 I cut it is not necessary, you can of course 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:17.280
 buy ready fillets and do not process 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.110
 fish yourself well i'm not afraid of it 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.360
 I'm showing you now already 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.820
 recipe cutlets are they ways of cutting fish 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.869
 but still decided 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.790
 do you know start over here 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.759
 a little rib bones is this their 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.580
 clean up so that their stuffing was homogeneous 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.510
 highly 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.640
 and now I can only remove 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.130
 skin because cutlets they make fillets with 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.750
 skin see here skin to skin will remove 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:55.450
 Now I will connect here so here you will remove 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:02:01.150
 I can calmly say the skin so tear off 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:03.350
 so i will do with another philip 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.890
 I will show you cutlets today 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.800
 guys copyright it means that I have 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.420
 here are some of their secret fishes on 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.420
