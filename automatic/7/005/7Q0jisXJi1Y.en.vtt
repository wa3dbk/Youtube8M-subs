00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.700 
entrances pretty crazy it's way
different<00:02:01.570> than<00:02:01.810> amateur<00:02:02.350> stuff<00:02:02.590> the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
different than amateur stuff the

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.090 
different than amateur stuff the
intensity<00:02:03.369> is

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
intensity is

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.130 
intensity is
it's<00:02:04.520> not<00:02:04.670> just<00:02:04.729> there<00:02:05.090> for<00:02:05.119> five<00:02:05.510> laps<00:02:05.780> sit

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
it's not just there for five laps sit

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.320 
it's not just there for five laps sit
for<00:02:06.350> 30<00:02:06.560> plus<00:02:06.799> two<00:02:07.159> and<00:02:07.340> most<00:02:07.909> of<00:02:08.149> them<00:02:08.240> get

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
for 30 plus two and most of them get

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.410 
for 30 plus two and most of them get
stronger<00:02:08.720> they<00:02:09.140> go<00:02:09.350> so<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.880> tracks<00:02:11.150> get

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
stronger they go so and the tracks get

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.949 
stronger they go so and the tracks get
way<00:02:11.600> to<00:02:11.660> offer<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:13.040> everything<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:13.810> it's<00:02:14.810> a

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
way to offer and everything so it's a

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.809 
way to offer and everything so it's a
big<00:02:15.140> difference<00:02:15.500> from<00:02:15.620> hammer<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:16.130> play<00:02:16.520> i

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
big difference from hammer to play i

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.970 
big difference from hammer to play i
would<00:02:17.360> say<00:02:17.569> i'd<00:02:17.900> say<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.290> journey<00:02:18.560> was<00:02:18.770> my

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
would say i'd say the journey was my

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.830 
would say i'd say the journey was my
