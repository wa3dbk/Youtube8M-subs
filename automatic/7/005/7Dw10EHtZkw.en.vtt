00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.720
 in electronic electromagnetic installations the electrical signals 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.100
 of the control part have to be transformed into pneumatic actions their 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.100
 logical in the work part 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.439
 for this, solenoid valves are used 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.480
 the solenoid valves are throwing elements only that their function is not 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.750
 the same as pneumatic or hydraulic days valves 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.650
 the difference lies in the way it works 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.540
 the electrically ovated valves here we see a 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.920
 converter erraia n which means that an electrical signal causes a 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.920
 matica action 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.410
 the same happens with milk and the only 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.900
 in this case the electrical signal those formed to execute an action 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.900
 hydraulics 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.080
 with this four-way hydraulic valve we can explain the 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.390
 operation of a solenoid valve 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.100
 so that switching occurs from the normal position happens 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.950
 next on one of the sides of the valve there is an electromagnet its core 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.800
 It acts as an armature that acts only on the control plunger 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.570
 from valvule 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.990
 alex cite the bobia an electromagnetic field is created the armature is 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.520
 moves towards the center of the coil moving against the strength of a 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.160
 When doing so, push the plunger of the valve to another position of 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.320
 switching the valve remain this position while receiving the signal 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.270
 electric 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.250
 when the signal is interrupted the magnetic field disappears and its 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.800
 respective force consequently the pressure spring to his Bethlehem bolus isobel 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.840
 induced until it returns to its normal position 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:14.309
 let's look at a real application a push button a solenoid valve a cylinder 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:19.119
 When the signal is emitted, the cylinder advances the LED 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:23.079
 indicates that current flows which means that there is a signal 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.159
 now after a while the cylinder recedes 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:32.129
 and these are the symbols 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.439
 first the single item for the cylinder 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.049
 and for the solenoid valve of four lines and then on the 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.049
 electrical part for the push button 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:48.689
 and again for solenoid valve although different since it is a symbol 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:49.319
 electric
