stack size at the table is to use what
we<00:00:17.740> call<00:00:17.770> em<00:00:18.189> or<00:00:18.880> CSI<00:00:19.860> it's<00:00:20.860> similar<00:00:21.220> to

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
we call em or CSI it's similar to

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.339 
we call em or CSI it's similar to
calculating<00:00:22.060> a<00:00:22.180> stack<00:00:22.509> amount<00:00:22.840> when<00:00:23.020> using

calculating a stack amount when using

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.850 
calculating a stack amount when using
bebes<00:00:23.939> except<00:00:24.939> we<00:00:25.360> don't<00:00:25.599> divide<00:00:26.050> a<00:00:26.259> stack

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.470 
bebes except we don't divide a stack
amount<00:00:27.220> by<00:00:27.910> just<00:00:28.869> the<00:00:29.020> big<00:00:29.169> blind<00:00:29.460> rather<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
amount by just the big blind rather the

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.889

is<00:00:35.050> in<00:00:35.200> play<00:00:35.760> most<00:00:36.760> top<00:00:37.059> tournament<00:00:37.390> players

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
is in play most top tournament players

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.440 
is in play most top tournament players
prefer<00:00:38.260> this<00:00:38.770> system<00:00:39.280> over<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.030> big<00:00:40.270> blind

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
prefer this system over the big blind

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.650 
prefer this system over the big blind
system<00:00:40.930> because<00:00:41.770> it<00:00:41.800> accounts<00:00:42.280> for<00:00:42.580> any<00:00:43.330> ant

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
system because it accounts for any ant

system because it accounts for any ant
is<00:00:43.870> in<00:00:44.050> play<00:00:44.290> and<00:00:44.590> the<00:00:45.310> size<00:00:45.580> of<00:00:45.730> the<00:00:45.820> antics<00:00:46.150> as

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
is in play and the size of the antics as

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.090 
is in play and the size of the antics as
well<00:00:46.990> as<00:00:47.110> the<00:00:47.200> number<00:00:47.470> of<00:00:47.560> players<00:00:47.830> at<00:00:48.070> the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
well as the number of players at the

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.970 
well as the number of players at the
table<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:49.450> let's<00:00:49.870> practice<00:00:50.530> calculating

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
table so let's practice calculating

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.430 
table so let's practice calculating
stack<00:00:51.670> size<00:00:51.940> using<00:00:52.600> em<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:55.270> here<00:00:55.600> I'll<00:00:55.870> play

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
stack size using em so here I'll play

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.850 
stack size using em so here I'll play
with<00:00:56.710> 3,000<00:00:57.550> chips<00:00:57.790> we<00:00:58.450> simply<00:00:58.810> divide<00:00:58.989> it<00:00:59.410> by

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
with 3,000 chips we simply divide it by

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.009 
with 3,000 chips we simply divide it by
the<00:00:59.890> amount<00:01:00.250> in<00:01:00.400> the<00:01:00.460> pot<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.710> this<00:01:02.890> plays<00:01:03.130> M<00:01:03.340> is

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
the amount in the pot so this plays M is

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.770 
the amount in the pot so this plays M is
3000<00:01:05.019> /<00:01:05.850> 475<00:01:06.850> is<00:01:07.149> an<00:01:07.990> M<00:01:08.229> of<00:01:08.409> around<00:01:08.710> six<00:01:09.310> as<00:01:09.780> we

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
3000 / 475 is an M of around six as we

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.670 
3000 / 475 is an M of around six as we
said<00:01:11.020> they<00:01:11.470> can<00:01:11.680> survive<00:01:12.040> six<00:01:12.700> orbits<00:01:13.680> however

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
said they can survive six orbits however

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.070 
said they can survive six orbits however
before<00:01:15.040> the<00:01:15.370> entities<00:01:15.670> were<00:01:15.820> introduced<00:01:16.390> this

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
before the entities were introduced this

before the entities were introduced this
players<00:01:17.409> m<00:01:17.680> was<00:01:17.860> 3,000<00:01:18.640> /<00:01:19.479> 300<00:01:20.290> so<00:01:20.650> m<00:01:20.890> 10<00:01:21.750> now<00:01:22.750> we

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
players m was 3,000 / 300 so m 10 now we

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.570 
players m was 3,000 / 300 so m 10 now we
have<00:01:23.049> a<00:01:23.080> system<00:01:23.500> that<00:01:23.680> changes<00:01:24.370> how<00:01:24.400> we

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
have a system that changes how we

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.300 
have a system that changes how we
interpret<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.540> stack<00:01:25.810> size<00:01:26.049> to<00:01:26.680> reflect<00:01:27.220> the

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
interpret the stack size to reflect the

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.930 
interpret the stack size to reflect the
change<00:01:27.760> in<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.240> blinds<00:01:28.690> and<00:01:28.830> antes<00:01:29.940> better

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
change in the blinds and antes better

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.110 
change in the blinds and antes better

realized<00:01:34.810> this<00:01:34.990> and<00:01:35.280> recommended<00:01:36.280> this

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
realized this and recommended this

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.810

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:15.999 
the table here when we do this it's okay

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:18.330 
the table here when we do this it's okay
to<00:02:16.060> round<00:02:16.359> up<00:02:16.599> or<00:02:16.810> down<00:02:16.989> a<00:02:17.019> little<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:17.650> here

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
to round up or down a little so here

with 475 in the pot

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.360 
with 475 in the pot
make<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.910> five<00:02:21.180> hundred<00:02:21.680> so<00:02:22.680> we<00:02:23.190> said<00:02:23.490> m6<00:02:24.180> here

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
make it five hundred so we said m6 here

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:33.290 
make it five hundred so we said m6 here
this<00:02:26.370> player<00:02:26.640> has<00:02:27.770> 4500<00:02:29.090> so<00:02:30.200> 4500<00:02:31.200> /<00:02:31.670> 500<00:02:32.670> is<00:02:32.850> 9

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
this player has 4500 so 4500 / 500 is 9

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:42.290 
this player has 4500 so 4500 / 500 is 9
so<00:02:33.660> this<00:02:34.620> player<00:02:34.860> has<00:02:34.890> m9<00:02:37.010> almost<00:02:38.510> m7<00:02:39.510> here<00:02:41.300> m

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
so this player has m9 almost m7 here m
