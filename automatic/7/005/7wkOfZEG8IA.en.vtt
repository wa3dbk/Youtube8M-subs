00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.520 

this<00:01:56.450> is<00:01:56.600> what<00:01:56.720> it<00:01:56.840> should<00:01:56.960> look<00:01:56.990> like<00:01:57.140> then

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
you want to repeat this step for the

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.170 
you want to repeat this step for the
other<00:02:00.560> arm<00:02:00.770> but<00:02:01.250> make<00:02:01.400> sure<00:02:01.430> it's<00:02:01.730> going<00:02:01.880> down

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
other arm but make sure it's going down

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.050 
other arm but make sure it's going down
instead<00:02:02.600> of<00:02:02.720> towards<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.650> middle<00:02:04.220> and<00:02:04.400> just

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
instead of towards the middle and just

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.330 
instead of towards the middle and just
secure<00:02:05.300> and<00:02:05.600> smooth<00:02:05.840> this<00:02:06.020> again<00:02:09.220> then<00:02:10.220> you

I'm<00:02:29.360> just<00:02:29.540> going<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.720> show<00:02:29.900> you<00:02:29.930> how<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.140> make<00:02:30.380> a

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
I'm just going to show you how to make a

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.460 
I'm just going to show you how to make a
stand<00:02:30.860> for<00:02:31.070> your<00:02:31.400> rabbit<00:02:32.180> so<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.570> liquid<00:02:33.080> clay

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
stand for your rabbit so the liquid clay

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.830 
stand for your rabbit so the liquid clay
will<00:02:33.680> not<00:02:33.890> go<00:02:34.880> everywhere<00:02:35.210> some<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.510> do<00:02:35.660> what

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
will not go everywhere some to do what

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.290 
will not go everywhere some to do what
I'm<00:02:35.990> showing<00:02:36.350> on<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.770> screen<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.370> basically

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
I'm showing on the screen and basically

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.680 
I'm showing on the screen and basically
you<00:02:38.510> can<00:02:38.660> just<00:02:38.690> make<00:02:39.050> a<00:02:39.230> little<00:02:39.320> stand<00:02:40.130> so<00:02:40.640> that

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
you can just make a little stand so that

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.380 
you can just make a little stand so that
the<00:02:41.690> liquid<00:02:41.870> clay<00:02:42.350> will<00:02:42.620> not<00:02:42.940> go<00:02:43.940> everywhere

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
the liquid clay will not go everywhere

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.750 
the liquid clay will not go everywhere
so<00:02:45.290> then<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:45.560> just<00:02:45.740> want<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:45.950> bend<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.460> top<00:02:46.610> of

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
so then you just want to bend the top of

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.690 
so then you just want to bend the top of
the<00:02:46.850> head<00:02:47.000> pin<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.770> then<00:02:48.770> it'll<00:02:49.070> be<00:02:49.220> easy<00:02:49.430> to

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
the head pin and then it'll be easy to

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.340 
the head pin and then it'll be easy to
put<00:02:49.880> it<00:02:50.000> on<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.300> stand<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:50.900> then<00:02:50.990> you<00:02:51.140> want<00:02:51.290> to

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
put it on the stand and then you want to

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.050 
put it on the stand and then you want to
mix<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.800> same<00:02:52.040> color<00:02:52.340> of<00:02:52.460> clay<00:02:52.670> you've<00:02:52.880> been

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
mix the same color of clay you've been

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.170 
mix the same color of clay you've been
using<00:02:53.330> with<00:02:54.190> liquid<00:02:55.190> clay<00:02:55.460> and<00:02:55.700> then<00:02:55.850> you<00:02:55.970> just

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
using with liquid clay and then you just

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.010 
using with liquid clay and then you just
want<00:02:56.360> to<00:02:56.450> put<00:02:56.630> this<00:02:56.720> on<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.050> top<00:02:57.290> for<00:02:58.070> the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
want to put this on the top for the

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.380 
want to put this on the top for the
melting<00:03:00.020> effect<00:03:00.500> of<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:01.240> chocolate<00:03:02.240> and

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
melting effect of the chocolate and

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.580 
melting effect of the chocolate and
don't<00:03:02.570> worry<00:03:02.780> it's<00:03:03.050> not<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.290> right<00:03:03.410> color

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
don't worry it's not the right color

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:12.740 
don't worry it's not the right color
because<00:03:03.980> it<00:03:04.130> will<00:03:04.220> change<00:03:04.490> after<00:03:04.820> it's<00:03:05.180> baked

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.060 

and<00:03:13.750> if<00:03:13.870> you're<00:03:14.020> using<00:03:14.260> an<00:03:14.500> eye<00:03:14.620> pin<00:03:14.890> you<00:03:15.040> can

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
and if you're using an eye pin you can

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.250 
and if you're using an eye pin you can
easily<00:03:15.760> just<00:03:16.270> put<00:03:16.450> it<00:03:16.570> on<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.780> wire<00:03:16.930> but<00:03:17.140> you

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
easily just put it on the wire but you

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.710 
easily just put it on the wire but you
might<00:03:17.440> want<00:03:17.620> to<00:03:17.680> be<00:03:17.830> careful<00:03:18.280> because<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:19.330> eye

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
might want to be careful because the eye

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.540 
might want to be careful because the eye
pin<00:03:19.990> might<00:03:20.170> fall<00:03:20.470> out<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.890> that<00:03:21.040> happened<00:03:21.430> to

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
pin might fall out and that happened to

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.700 
pin might fall out and that happened to
me<00:03:21.730> once<00:03:21.970> but<00:03:22.240> yep<00:03:22.660> now<00:03:23.140> you<00:03:23.200> just<00:03:23.440> want<00:03:23.620> to
