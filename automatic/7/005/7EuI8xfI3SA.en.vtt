pickup<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:55.050> was<00:00:55.199> really<00:00:55.469> before<00:00:55.640> they

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
pickup this was really before they

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.299

started<00:00:57.030> naming<00:00:57.690> their<00:00:58.230> vehicles<00:00:58.890> they<00:00:59.100> just

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
started naming their vehicles they just

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.009 
started naming their vehicles they just
really<00:00:59.579> had<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.969> pickup<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.629> Corolla<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.410> a

really had the pickup the Corolla and a
trailblazer<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.170> think<00:01:04.530> there<00:01:05.339> might<00:01:05.489> be<00:01:05.549> a

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
trailblazer I think there might be a

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.800 
trailblazer I think there might be a
couple<00:01:06.060> more<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.360> there<00:01:06.510> but<00:01:06.720> I'm<00:01:06.840> not<00:01:07.400> that

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
couple more in there but I'm not that

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.780 
couple more in there but I'm not that
knowledgeable<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:10.290> those<00:01:10.530> other<00:01:11.250> cars

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
before and after type deal so basically

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.109 
before and after type deal so basically
here's<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.979> front<00:01:47.220> as<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.670> can<00:01:47.759> see<00:01:47.939> the

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.300 
little bit of rust on it here and there
hopefully<00:02:21.819> it's<00:02:22.390> not<00:02:22.569> too<00:02:22.629> bad<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.739> bed's<00:02:23.980> got

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
hopefully it's not too bad the bed's got

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.920 
hopefully it's not too bad the bed's got
a<00:02:24.340> little<00:02:24.640> bit<00:02:24.760> of<00:02:24.849> rust<00:02:25.060> holes<00:02:25.299> in<00:02:25.569> it<00:02:25.689> but<00:02:25.840> I

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
a little bit of rust holes in it but I

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.309 
a little bit of rust holes in it but I
think<00:02:25.959> I<00:02:26.200> can<00:02:26.379> fix<00:02:26.620> those<00:02:26.879> pretty<00:02:27.879> easy<00:02:28.319> for

think I can fix those pretty easy for

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.229 
think I can fix those pretty easy for
the<00:02:29.440> most<00:02:29.620> part<00:02:29.920> of<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.099> bed<00:02:30.280> still<00:02:30.790> intact

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
this thing running right now it will not

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:09.189 
this thing running right now it will not
run<00:06:04.969> the<00:06:05.870> first<00:06:06.139> the<00:06:06.469> first<00:06:06.650> plan<00:06:07.750> the<00:06:08.750> thing<00:06:08.990> I

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 
run the first the first plan the thing I

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:11.469 
run the first the first plan the thing I
plan<00:06:09.440> to<00:06:09.469> do<00:06:09.710> first<00:06:10.069> is<00:06:10.430> to<00:06:11.000> get<00:06:11.150> the<00:06:11.270> thing

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 
plan to do first is to get the thing

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:14.770 
plan to do first is to get the thing
running<00:06:11.690> and<00:06:12.550> I'm<00:06:13.550> thinking<00:06:14.150> it<00:06:14.300> might<00:06:14.479> be<00:06:14.539> the

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
running and I'm thinking it might be the

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.490 
running and I'm thinking it might be the
fuel<00:06:15.020> pump<00:06:15.050> or<00:06:15.590> it<00:06:15.860> might<00:06:16.069> be<00:06:16.099> uh<00:06:17.289> it<00:06:18.289> might<00:06:18.440> be

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
fuel pump or it might be uh it might be

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.140 
fuel pump or it might be uh it might be
the<00:06:18.800> ignition<00:06:19.159> coil<00:06:19.310> I<00:06:19.340> think<00:06:19.639> it's<00:06:19.759> the<00:06:19.940> fuel

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
the ignition coil I think it's the fuel

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.510 
the ignition coil I think it's the fuel
pump<00:06:20.419> though<00:06:20.599> because<00:06:21.289> we<00:06:21.620> we<00:06:21.889> tried<00:06:22.130> to<00:06:22.250> start

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
pump though because we we tried to start

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.969 
pump though because we we tried to start
it<00:06:22.610> up<00:06:22.789> last<00:06:23.000> time<00:06:23.270> and<00:06:23.479> it<00:06:23.960> run<00:06:24.169> off<00:06:24.319> a<00:06:24.349> gas<00:06:24.710> but

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:24.979 
it up last time and it run off a gas but

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:28.089 
it up last time and it run off a gas but
it<00:06:25.069> wouldn't<00:06:25.310> run<00:06:25.490> off<00:06:25.520> of<00:06:25.940> but<00:06:26.870> it<00:06:27.099> we-well

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:28.099 
it wouldn't run off of but it we-well

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:30.610 
it wouldn't run off of but it we-well
yet<00:06:28.580> it's<00:06:29.000> not<00:06:29.120> the<00:06:29.330> it's<00:06:29.630> not<00:06:29.870> a<00:06:29.900> spark<00:06:30.349> that's

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620 
yet it's not the it's not a spark that's

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.330 
yet it's not the it's not a spark that's
not<00:06:30.830> the<00:06:30.919> problem

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.340 
not the problem

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.180 
not the problem
the<00:06:31.819> problem<00:06:32.330> is<00:06:32.569> it's<00:06:33.259> not<00:06:33.380> giving<00:06:33.830> fuel<00:06:34.039> to

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
the problem is it's not giving fuel to

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.769 
the problem is it's not giving fuel to
the<00:06:34.279> carburetor<00:06:34.310> I<00:06:35.000> don't<00:06:35.449> know<00:06:35.570> whether

00:06:35.769 --> 00:06:35.779 
the carburetor I don't know whether

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:37.420 
the carburetor I don't know whether
that's<00:06:36.020> the<00:06:36.320> fuel<00:06:36.560> pump<00:06:36.830> I<00:06:37.039> know<00:06:37.130> where<00:06:37.339> the

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
that's the fuel pump I know where the

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.430 
that's the fuel pump I know where the
fuel<00:06:37.610> pump<00:06:37.820> is<00:06:38.000> and<00:06:38.360> it's<00:06:38.539> a<00:06:38.750> cheaper<00:06:39.080> fixed

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 
fuel pump is and it's a cheaper fixed

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:39.999 
fuel pump is and it's a cheaper fixed
and<00:06:39.560> rebuild

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:40.009 
and rebuild

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:41.619 
and rebuild
the<00:06:40.039> carburetor<00:06:40.369> I<00:06:40.580> really<00:06:41.089> do<00:06:41.210> not<00:06:41.360> want<00:06:41.419> to

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:41.629 
the carburetor I really do not want to

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:43.570 
the carburetor I really do not want to
rebuild<00:06:42.020> the<00:06:42.199> carburetor<00:06:42.409> but<00:06:42.830> if<00:06:42.919> I<00:06:43.009> do<00:06:43.069> I'll

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.580 
rebuild the carburetor but if I do I'll

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.329 
rebuild the carburetor but if I do I'll
make<00:06:43.789> a<00:06:43.819> video<00:06:43.999> of<00:06:44.389> it<00:06:44.569> and<00:06:44.919> but<00:06:45.919> that's<00:06:46.039> pretty

00:06:46.329 --> 00:06:46.339 
make a video of it and but that's pretty

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:49.959
