 hello to all and william for this beautiful 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.099
 quoted little bone so today I'm going 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.800
 explain how to put an image 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.779
 as a folder or file image 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.260
 so for example let's imagine I create a 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.580
 new folder rather then here is 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.230
 there is always this image of records 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.210
 if you want to add an image like 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.900
 for example I take a picture a 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.050
 png image that I created and want 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.370
 put it in the place of the folders there 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.329
 you have to open your image jumps with 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.070
 photoshop with a publisher of two 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:45.570
 of picture so for example paint and 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:49.289
 save it as bmp format as 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:53.579
 this so even bitmap 24 bits so this 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.809
 will be a point bmp that's ok so if I get 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.430
 found with the same image I can 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.670
 delete that one I end up with 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.579
 this image into bmp files and then here 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.650
 you must have previously displayed the 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.420
 the file extensions you made 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.439
 a little tutorial some time ago for 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:14.250
 this to do that so here you do f2 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:17.009
 or renamed f2 that shortened for 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.850
 to make fame and change you just 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.979
 the file extension by xo 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.259
 we validate yes you change 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.659
 the extension is so here icÃ©o is 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.130
 the icon extension so that's it 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.159
 was created our icon from our 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.460
 picture bmp and now we're going to go in 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.320
 the properties of the folder you want 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.600
 see in custom is here change 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.360
 icon 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.710
 we will go and go on our 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:51.300
 office look for the icon I created 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:54.300
 here is the image point ico open 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.970
 ok validated involved and here I am 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.370
 found with a record that has who is 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:03.290
 an image as a representation 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.290
 that's it for this tutorial 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.560
 key 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.560
