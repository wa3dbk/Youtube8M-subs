the first step is to test the water and

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.479 
the first step is to test the water and
balance<00:03:38.260> it<00:03:38.380> with<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.500> HTH<00:03:39.070> 6-way<00:03:39.280> test

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
balance it with the HTH 6-way test

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.770 
balance it with the HTH 6-way test
strips<00:03:40.530> we<00:03:41.530> simply<00:03:41.860> grab<00:03:41.950> a<00:03:42.040> test<00:03:42.310> strip

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
strips we simply grab a test strip

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.900 
strips we simply grab a test strip
simply<00:03:43.780> dip<00:03:43.959> it<00:03:44.110> in<00:03:44.230> pull<00:03:45.160> it<00:03:45.250> out<00:03:45.340> and<00:03:45.820> we

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
simply dip it in pull it out and we

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.000 
simply dip it in pull it out and we
compare<00:03:46.239> what's<00:03:46.420> on<00:03:47.110> a<00:03:47.170> strip<00:03:47.500> with<00:03:47.680> what's<00:03:47.860> on

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
compare what's on a strip with what's on

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.680 
compare what's on a strip with what's on
the<00:03:48.100> file<00:03:48.280> and<00:03:48.580> it<00:03:48.760> looks<00:03:48.970> like<00:03:49.030> everything's

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
the file and it looks like everything's

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.090 
the file and it looks like everything's
in<00:03:49.780> really<00:03:50.140> good<00:03:50.290> balance<00:03:50.470> except<00:03:50.980> your

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
in really good balance except your

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
sanitizers a little bit low which we can

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.780

take<00:03:53.380> care<00:03:53.500> of<00:03:53.590> in<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.709> next<00:03:53.890> step<00:03:54.040> so<00:03:54.520> ease<00:03:54.670> it

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
take care of in the next step so ease it
