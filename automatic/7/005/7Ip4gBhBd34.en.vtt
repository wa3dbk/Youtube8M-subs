from just minerals in your water if you
have<00:00:39.570> hard<00:00:39.989> water<00:00:40.700> me<00:00:41.700> personally<00:00:42.300> I've<00:00:42.930> never

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
have hard water me personally I've never

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.959 
have hard water me personally I've never
had<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> repelling<00:00:43.920> issue<00:00:44.100> but<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.640> do<00:00:44.730> get

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
had a repelling issue but I do get

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.959 
had a repelling issue but I do get
buildup<00:00:45.329> from<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.600> minerals<00:00:45.930> in<00:00:45.989> our<00:00:46.110> water

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
buildup from the minerals in our water

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.000 
buildup from the minerals in our water
we<00:00:47.969> have<00:00:48.120> very<00:00:48.360> hard<00:00:48.600> water<00:00:48.750> here<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
we have very hard water here so the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.680 
we have very hard water here so the
process<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.579> use<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.149> going<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.600> be

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
process that I use is going to be

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.930 
process that I use is going to be
different<00:00:52.020> than<00:00:52.680> probably<00:00:53.070> what<00:00:53.340> might<00:00:53.789> work

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
different than probably what might work

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.900 
different than probably what might work
for<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.350> everybody<00:00:55.350> has<00:00:55.559> different<00:00:56.340> sorts<00:00:56.820> of

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
for you everybody has different sorts of

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.029 
for you everybody has different sorts of
diapers<00:00:57.329> different<00:00:57.840> water<00:00:58.050> these<00:00:58.559> different

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
diapers different water these different

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.709 
diapers different water these different
detergents<00:00:59.340> they<00:01:00.059> have<00:01:00.239> different<00:01:00.570> type<00:01:00.690> of

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
detergents they have different type of

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.640 
detergents they have different type of
washing<00:01:01.590> machines<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.930> all<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.260> kind<00:01:04.589> of

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
washing machines and all that kind of

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.280 
washing machines and all that kind of
plays<00:01:04.920> into<00:01:05.060> how<00:01:06.060> often<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.510> need<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> strip<00:01:07.049> if

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
plays into how often you need a strip if

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.280 
plays into how often you need a strip if
you<00:01:07.500> do<00:01:08.330> what<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.540> noticed<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:10.049> that

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
you do what I have noticed is that

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.920 
you do what I have noticed is that
microfiber<00:01:10.820> synthetic<00:01:11.820> fibers<00:01:12.180> microfiber

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
microfiber synthetic fibers microfiber

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.109 
microfiber synthetic fibers microfiber
especially<00:01:13.530> needs<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.460> stripped<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.909> lot

more<00:01:15.299> than<00:01:15.479> natural<00:01:15.659> fibers<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.590> used

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
more than natural fibers so I used

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.249 
more than natural fibers so I used
cotton<00:01:17.520> pre<00:01:17.850> folds<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.390> need<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.170> be

stripped<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.619> lot<00:01:19.830> less<00:01:20.100> than<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.729> microfiber

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
stripped a lot less than the microfiber

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
boil them on the stove and then I wash

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.740 
boil them on the stove and then I wash
them<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.070> machine<00:01:53.430> several<00:01:53.970> times<00:01:54.180> and

shelves for the diapers anything with

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.200 
shelves for the diapers anything with
pul<00:02:01.560> would<00:02:01.829> get<00:02:02.009> damaged<00:02:02.399> by<00:02:02.579> boiling<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.119> you

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
pul would get damaged by boiling so you

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.910

water<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:25.760> stockpot<00:02:26.209> here<00:02:26.599> and<00:02:27.290> usually<00:02:27.860> I

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
water and a stockpot here and usually I

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.559

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.180 
ships I just use tongs to get them down
into<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.620> water<00:02:37.989> now<00:02:38.989> I<00:02:39.050> don't<00:02:39.230> measure<00:02:39.620> but

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.150 
into the water now I don't measure but
this<00:02:40.400> is<00:02:40.610> just<00:02:41.000> plain<00:02:41.569> white<00:02:41.750> vinegar<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:42.440> just

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
this is just plain white vinegar I just

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.040 
this is just plain white vinegar I just
use<00:02:43.370> a<00:02:43.640> little<00:02:43.910> bit<00:02:44.180> I<00:02:44.450> don't<00:02:44.540> know<00:02:44.750> it's

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
use a little bit I don't know it's

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.410 
use a little bit I don't know it's
probably<00:02:45.230> a<00:02:46.300> quarter<00:02:47.300> cup<00:02:48.190> for<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.760> four

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
probably a quarter cup for the four

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.729 
probably a quarter cup for the four
inserts<00:02:50.780> that<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:50.989> have<00:02:51.110> in<00:02:51.230> there<00:02:51.380> I'm<00:02:51.590> gonna

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
inserts that I have in there I'm gonna

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.920 
inserts that I have in there I'm gonna
use<00:02:51.950> washing<00:02:52.519> soda<00:02:53.030> this<00:02:53.330> is<00:02:53.480> different<00:02:53.810> than

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
use washing soda this is different than

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.620 
use washing soda this is different than
baking<00:02:54.319> soda<00:02:54.910> it's<00:02:55.910> probably<00:02:56.330> in<00:02:56.450> your

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
baking soda it's probably in your

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.180 
baking soda it's probably in your
laundry<00:02:56.900> aisle<00:02:57.260> instead<00:02:57.680> of<00:02:57.799> like<00:02:57.950> in<00:02:58.100> the

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
laundry aisle instead of like in the

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.360 
laundry aisle instead of like in the
baking<00:02:58.519> aisle<00:02:58.700> I<00:02:59.290> have<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.440> order<00:03:00.590> this<00:03:00.830> around

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
baking aisle I have to order this around

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.410 
baking aisle I have to order this around
here<00:03:01.549> they<00:03:01.700> don't<00:03:01.819> sell<00:03:02.060> it<00:03:02.120> in<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.269> grocery

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
here they don't sell it in the grocery

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.539 
here they don't sell it in the grocery
store<00:03:02.840> so<00:03:03.080> I<00:03:03.110> order<00:03:03.530> it<00:03:03.620> from<00:03:04.040> like<00:03:04.400> Ace

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.220 
store so I order it from like Ace
Hardware<00:03:04.850> again<00:03:05.510> I<00:03:05.540> don't<00:03:05.720> really<00:03:05.870> measure

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
Hardware again I don't really measure

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.309 
Hardware again I don't really measure
but<00:03:06.920> I<00:03:07.190> put<00:03:07.880> in<00:03:07.970> probably<00:03:08.480> I<00:03:08.750> don't<00:03:08.900> know<00:03:09.019> maybe

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
but I put in probably I don't know maybe

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.710 
but I put in probably I don't know maybe
1/4<00:03:09.769> cup<00:03:10.069> of<00:03:10.160> this<00:03:10.280> too<00:03:10.549> and<00:03:10.910> this<00:03:11.239> is<00:03:11.420> a<00:03:11.540> water

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
1/4 cup of this too and this is a water

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.420 
1/4 cup of this too and this is a water
softener<00:03:12.110> so<00:03:12.620> you<00:03:12.680> can<00:03:12.920> use<00:03:13.069> this<00:03:13.220> in<00:03:13.400> your

softener so you can use this in your

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
like instead of Calgon as a water

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.830 
like instead of Calgon as a water
softener<00:03:19.190> if<00:03:19.430> you<00:03:19.519> have<00:03:19.609> hard<00:03:19.820> water<00:03:19.850> but<00:03:20.810> I

softener if you have hard water but I

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.740 
softener if you have hard water but I
just<00:03:21.140> use<00:03:21.320> it<00:03:21.350> to<00:03:21.500> strip<00:03:21.920> and<00:03:22.280> then<00:03:23.090> it<00:03:23.209> sort<00:03:23.630> of

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
just use it to strip and then it sort of

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.229 
just use it to strip and then it sort of
fizzes<00:03:24.079> up<00:03:24.340> similar<00:03:25.340> it's<00:03:25.519> similar<00:03:25.730> to<00:03:25.910> baking

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
fizzes up similar it's similar to baking

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.780 
fizzes up similar it's similar to baking
soda<00:03:26.450> but<00:03:26.570> it's<00:03:26.720> not<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:27.049> same<00:03:27.260> like<00:03:28.100> compound

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790

so<00:03:29.420> my<00:03:29.510> diapers<00:03:29.840> have<00:03:29.930> only<00:03:30.079> been<00:03:30.260> boiling<00:03:30.650> now

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
so my diapers have only been boiling now

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.410 
so my diapers have only been boiling now
for<00:03:30.980> about<00:03:31.040> 10<00:03:31.340> minutes<00:03:31.519> but<00:03:31.940> I<00:03:32.090> don't<00:03:32.269> know<00:03:32.329> if

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
you can't boil because the pol can get

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.650

left<00:05:12.070> so<00:05:12.400> I<00:05:12.430> took<00:05:12.970> them<00:05:13.120> out<00:05:13.180> to<00:05:13.240> hang<00:05:13.870> to<00:05:14.200> dry

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
left so I took them out to hang to dry

left so I took them out to hang to dry
five<00:05:16.270> rinses<00:05:16.690> might<00:05:16.900> sound<00:05:17.170> like<00:05:17.320> a<00:05:17.380> lot<00:05:17.520> but

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
five rinses might sound like a lot but

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.030 
five rinses might sound like a lot but
my<00:05:19.600> machine<00:05:19.930> doesn't<00:05:20.200> use<00:05:20.320> much<00:05:20.500> water<00:05:20.530> so<00:05:20.830> if

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
my machine doesn't use much water so if

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.130 
my machine doesn't use much water so if
you<00:05:21.130> have<00:05:21.310> a<00:05:21.340> top<00:05:21.640> loader<00:05:21.880> that<00:05:22.210> uses<00:05:22.930> more
