on<00:00:10.370> Ice<00:00:11.370> Cube<00:00:12.679> seeding<00:00:14.420> it's<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.599> method<00:00:15.839> I

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
on Ice Cube seeding it's a method I

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.460 
on Ice Cube seeding it's a method I
can't<00:00:16.500> remember<00:00:16.859> if<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.250> saw<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.789> on<00:00:18.029> YouTube<00:00:19.020> or

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
can't remember if I saw it on YouTube or

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.960 
can't remember if I saw it on YouTube or
I<00:00:19.500> just<00:00:19.590> read<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.310> someplace<00:00:21.090> on<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.900> internet

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
I just read it someplace on the internet

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.060 
I just read it someplace on the internet
but<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.029> was<00:00:24.390> interested<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.470> because<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:25.890> had

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
but I was interested in it because I had

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.109 
but I was interested in it because I had
a<00:00:26.099> lot<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.400> perennial<00:00:27.060> seeds<00:00:27.680> and<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:29.160> didn't

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
a lot of perennial seeds and I didn't

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.269 
a lot of perennial seeds and I didn't
want<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.480> plant<00:00:30.779> them<00:00:31.380> up<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.890> middle<00:00:32.009> of

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
want to plant them up in the middle of

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.650 
want to plant them up in the middle of
winter<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.940> couldn't<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.530> decided<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.880> put

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
winter I couldn't so I decided to put

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.770 
winter I couldn't so I decided to put
seed<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.530> an<00:00:38.370> ice<00:00:38.730> cube<00:00:39.030> tray<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.570> each

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
seed in an ice cube tray in each

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.660 
seed in an ice cube tray in each
compartment<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.590> dropped<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.040> few<00:00:41.250> seeds<00:00:41.670> and

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
compartment I dropped a few seeds and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.840 
compartment I dropped a few seeds and
then<00:00:44.809> throw<00:00:45.809> them<00:00:46.129> took<00:00:47.129> them<00:00:47.309> out<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.700> ice

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
then throw them took them out of the ice

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.139 
then throw them took them out of the ice
cube<00:00:48.239> tray<00:00:48.710> put<00:00:49.710> them<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.950> baggie<00:00:50.280> mark<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
cube tray put them in a baggie mark the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.430 
cube tray put them in a baggie mark the
baggie<00:00:51.420> what<00:00:52.350> perennial<00:00:53.219> was<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.289> the<00:00:55.289> ice

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
baggie what perennial was in the ice

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.950 
baggie what perennial was in the ice
cube<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.629> then<00:00:57.629> put<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.899> back<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.109> my<00:00:58.440> freezer

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
cube and then put it back in my freezer

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.179 
cube and then put it back in my freezer
so<00:01:01.370> some<00:01:02.370> months<00:01:02.730> later<00:01:02.789> today<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.930> March<00:01:04.559> 21st

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
so some months later today is March 21st

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.890 
so some months later today is March 21st
the<00:01:05.400> first<00:01:05.909> day<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.119> spring<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:07.970> decided<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.390> pop

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
the first day of spring I decided to pop

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.870 
the first day of spring I decided to pop
these<00:01:10.200> ice<00:01:10.439> cubes<00:01:10.830> up<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:12.049> I<00:01:13.100> used<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.369> mix<00:01:14.640> of

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
these ice cubes up and I used a mix of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.210 
these ice cubes up and I used a mix of
just<00:01:15.150> perlite<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.900> peat<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:17.240> I<00:01:18.240> also<00:01:19.220> marked

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
just perlite and peat and I also marked

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.840 
just perlite and peat and I also marked
each<00:01:20.810> row<00:01:21.810> with<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:24.439> mini<00:01:25.439> blind<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.189> use<00:01:26.549> mini

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
each row with a mini blind I use mini

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.069 
each row with a mini blind I use mini
blinds<00:01:27.299> for<00:01:27.479> markers<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.170> used<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:30.079> permanent

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
blinds for markers and used a permanent

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.370 
blinds for markers and used a permanent
marker<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.530> write<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.509> so<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.840> don't<00:01:34.170> forget

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
marker to write on so I don't forget

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.460 
marker to write on so I don't forget
what's<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.159> pot<00:01:35.930> hopefully<00:01:36.930> what<00:01:37.259> this

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
what's in the pot hopefully what this

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.330 
what's in the pot hopefully what this
does<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.340> mimic<00:01:39.119> our<00:01:40.009> cold<00:01:41.009> Wisconsin<00:01:41.909> weather

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
does is mimic our cold Wisconsin weather

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.749 
does is mimic our cold Wisconsin weather
here<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:45.290> perennials<00:01:46.290> Ricci<00:01:46.860> drop<00:01:47.310> on<00:01:47.549> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
here the perennials Ricci drop on the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.539 
here the perennials Ricci drop on the
ground<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.420> then<00:01:49.229> come<00:01:49.530> up<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:50.040> following

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
ground and then come up the following

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.840 
ground and then come up the following
spring<00:01:50.899> so<00:01:51.899> I'm<00:01:52.259> thinking<00:01:52.829> placing<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.700> ice

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
spring so I'm thinking placing the ice

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.080 
spring so I'm thinking placing the ice
cubes<00:01:54.299> on<00:01:54.540> top<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.259> letting<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.070> melt<00:01:56.399> into<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
cubes on top and letting a melt into the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.330 
cubes on top and letting a melt into the
dirt<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.869> letting<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.920> rain<00:01:59.810> pound<00:02:00.810> them<00:02:01.079> in

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
dirt and letting the rain pound them in

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.240 
dirt and letting the rain pound them in
that<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:02.700> will<00:02:03.560> be<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.740> same<00:02:04.979> as<00:02:05.219> having

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
that this will be the same as having

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.219 
that this will be the same as having
them<00:02:05.700> in<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.850> garden<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.540> having<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.020> seed

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
them in the garden and having the seed

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.580 
them in the garden and having the seed
drop<00:02:07.530> in<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.890> garden<00:02:08.810> so<00:02:09.810> tonight<00:02:10.410> we're

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
drop in the garden so tonight we're

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.540 
drop in the garden so tonight we're
supposed<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.979> get<00:02:11.160> rain

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
supposed to get rain

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.970 
supposed to get rain
and<00:02:12.670> I<00:02:13.360> thought<00:02:13.900> this<00:02:14.080> would<00:02:14.260> be<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.440> good<00:02:14.710> time

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
and I thought this would be a good time

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.450 
and I thought this would be a good time
that'll<00:02:15.370> melt<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.820> ice<00:02:15.940> cubes<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:18.900> cloudy<00:02:19.900> so

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
that'll melt the ice cubes and cloudy so

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.580 
that'll melt the ice cubes and cloudy so
it<00:02:21.460> won't<00:02:21.700> be<00:02:21.850> full<00:02:22.090> Sun<00:02:22.390> on<00:02:22.570> them<00:02:22.780> right<00:02:22.960> away

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
it won't be full Sun on them right away

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.370 
it won't be full Sun on them right away
I<00:02:23.850> put<00:02:24.850> hardware<00:02:25.300> cloth<00:02:25.570> over<00:02:25.990> them<00:02:26.080> because

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
I put hardware cloth over them because

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.040 
I put hardware cloth over them because
we<00:02:26.530> have<00:02:26.620> lots<00:02:26.860> of<00:02:27.070> squirrels<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:28.050> bunnies

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
we have lots of squirrels and bunnies

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.990 
we have lots of squirrels and bunnies
and<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:29.680> don't<00:02:29.740> want<00:02:30.100> them<00:02:30.220> digging<00:02:30.490> in<00:02:30.790> that

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
and I don't want them digging in that

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.170 
and I don't want them digging in that
loose<00:02:31.240> dirt<00:02:31.740> so<00:02:32.740> I'll<00:02:32.920> keep<00:02:33.160> you<00:02:33.340> posted<00:02:33.370> if

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
loose dirt so I'll keep you posted if

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.220 
loose dirt so I'll keep you posted if
this<00:02:34.960> works<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.790> ice<00:02:37.000> cubes<00:02:37.450> method<00:02:38.050> of

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
this works the ice cubes method of

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.980 
this works the ice cubes method of
seeding<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.490> it<00:02:39.970> doesn't<00:02:40.390> take<00:02:40.570> a<00:02:40.600> lot<00:02:40.840> of

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
seeding and it doesn't take a lot of

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.170 
seeding and it doesn't take a lot of
space<00:02:41.230> up<00:02:41.470> in<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.710> freezer<00:02:41.980> so<00:02:42.370> that's<00:02:42.580> what's

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180
