00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.730
 Welcome from Basel with the hp mini 10 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.859
 tablet pc which a favorable version is 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.450
 Alley Cat 900 is that many of you 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.769
 Maybe that means a bit 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.190
 less listened but still the full 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.770
 windows surface to 10 inches also with 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.050
 a completely free office package 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.119
 we can see we have to say two 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.189
 or three is 64 person 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.019
 Chargeable but there is the home 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.160
 and student version what has to cost him 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.779
 which have the desktop Pro -Western if 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.429
 but we also want to use them 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.650
 in the normal windows surface or 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.910
 the modern surface goes back 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.980
 bit finger friendly is again 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.180
 also nice and fast, I can remember here 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.760
 between last program back and forth 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.469
 I can switch to eg the browser here 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.910
 then zoom in and out and see here 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.910
 Again, that the display is real 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.530
 very nice and sharp for play 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.989
 also for games on very pleasant 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.610
 I can also short keyboard 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.020
 demonstrate that looks very nice 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.610
 how then, however , of the content 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.800
 not seeing much, and yes, too 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.899
 with the last website together 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.820
 I could be visited again 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.129
 but also open the cameras are 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.870
 The rear-facing camera was quite successful 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.760
 is a bit slow just now 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.049
 yet so if i keep my hand content of 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.670
 the speed is but the 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.689
 Focus in I do not want to work out completely 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.460
 the colors are a bit 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.500
 washed out but what you definitely 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.659
 I like it when I'm here on the 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.400
 front camera change that they are nice and far 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.610
 really the quality is very much 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.820
 beautiful nice sharp for the 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.680
 hang out or Skype perfect 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.750
 so what we have to show in any case 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.600
 what is here for connections in 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.130
 the hp scenes are in it and we noticed 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.810
 I used the bock now 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.190
 there is a power plug of the 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.720
 according to here directly into the tablet 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.490
 but we go right next to it 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.290
 still micro-usb connection to data too 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.530
 Transfer and a micro hdmi connection 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.270
 to issue the image sd card reader order 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.100
 To be precise micro sd card is your 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.020
 flap available and two speakers 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.940
 We also have a headphone jack 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.860
 so that only little music becomes 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.840
 listen to speakers and have a 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.360
 and off switch on the top is called 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.979
 Of course, the device can also be complete 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.640
 be turned off and a microphone is 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.990
 also available 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.890
 imprints we see here again the 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.360
 I'll go to the camera before 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.759
 have demonstrated ever but also the 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.110
 beautiful rubberized surface the 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.300
 I like very much because of the haptics 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.950
 that's almost not out of it 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.900
 hand slide 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.630
 it is always nice long handle 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.800
 stay supple otherwise 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.690
 had volume control hendrix and otherwise 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.400
 actually nothing like on this 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.980
 page that we have shown you little 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.500
 we really only really find it at all 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.820
 nothing if now thought over is 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.920
 yes, another 10 should miss 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.320
 that's the slate scenes is an android 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.900
 but at the first look exactly the same 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.450
 but if we look closely at it 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.269
 the back plastic is not good but 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.829
 only such a surface crops buttons only 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.900
 about usb rechargeable completely different 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.220
 Price class and actually to work 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.150
 Of course windows then 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.920
 probably still more useful 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.780
 whereby by bluetooth here best world 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.549
 another keyboard can be connected 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.720
 should and in one out and then you can 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.570
 you really satisfied 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.950
 go through the day and here in the 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.360
 standard surface that you know 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.000
 work wonderfully 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.790
 whether one completes here now or 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.769
 changes or how you use it 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.799
 of course from him but that was 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.930
 for now the hpc in a short hands-on 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.579
 I like it until next time 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.880
 my name is a carbon-Trieste at the 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.880
 divorce papers
