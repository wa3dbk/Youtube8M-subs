00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.479
 the most important thing about this device and the 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.229
 best functioning of is really the 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.289
 remote Control 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:40.420

 so you can adjust how fast 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.380
 you are looking for the normal user 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.250
 stop slowly for beautiful rivers 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.130
 so to speak 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.140
 and here we have other things 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.750
 features about this button over the 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.020
 are this lip you can the whole office 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.420
 and issue the camcorder here 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.739

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.569
 you can store well too 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.879
 really quietly press this button 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.990
 that you do not hear him at the movie 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:20.420
 here you still have the function for 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.730
 take a photo with a video or synonymous 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.100
 normal and here you have one more button 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.490
 for the grid the grid you see then 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.010
 on the camcorder 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.790
 otherwise there is no more to it 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.620
 say 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.560
 the size is really nice too 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:40.430
 adapted for the complete hand and 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.170
 down here we have the stop 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.440
 different feet that is with these 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.820
 clips that is extremely stable if you 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.950
 you know you have no 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:53.960
 rickety tripod but that's all 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.700
 very firm which is very nice in the 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.960
 In the middle you have just this this 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.810
 Three things that really stood out 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.690
 very stable makes it so that 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.220
 best on the whole part 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.830
 that is equally stable and this 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.890
 big head is stored very nicely 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.720
 there you have the different ones 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.990
 Adjust this left adjusting screw 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.660
 is for the left and right move and 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:23.420
 the set screw here to you mostly 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.640
 shows it up for the tilt and 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.620
 if you do not feel like it 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.690
 I can completely ask 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.760
 then you have no inclination there 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.550
 inside there is a set screw with it 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.430
 We can do the remote completely 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.340
 lose weight if you want that 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:44.000
 I'm not good up here now 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.430
 you have so little lot with it you 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.560
 See that she always stands straight that is 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.690
 pretty important if you have a horizon 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.340
 he just wanted to have and sees that 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.860
 very professional if that 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.820
 nicely aligned is at the top of the 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.370
 camera we still have this 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.380
 shutter 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.910
 is also supplied for this purpose the foot 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.150
 might is for just one camera 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.010
 not see the 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.160
 otherwise there is no more 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.650
 to say that 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.700
 a tripod which is really nice costs 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.690
 just a few euros more than 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.290
 cheap parts but I think that's worth it 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.180
 very much 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.359
 and now there is only one left 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.359
 question
