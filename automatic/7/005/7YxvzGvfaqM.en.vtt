okay last year September about the bike
immediately<00:01:00.170> started<00:01:01.170> planning<00:01:02.690> hashing<00:01:03.690> out

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
immediately started planning hashing out

a<00:01:03.840> trip<00:01:04.140> with<00:01:04.440> a<00:01:04.769> friend<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.129> mine<00:01:05.309> Jeff<00:01:07.400> first

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
a trip with a friend of mine Jeff first

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.790 
a trip with a friend of mine Jeff first
first<00:01:09.030> trip<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.390> did<00:01:09.420> we<00:01:09.660> went<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.990> Wainwright

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
first trip we did we went to Wainwright

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
first trip we did we went to Wainwright
and<00:01:13.160> we<00:01:14.160> had<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> lot<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.610> fun<00:01:16.520> so<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.640> wasn't

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
and we had a lot of fun so it wasn't

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.370 
and we had a lot of fun so it wasn't
long<00:01:18.030> after<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:18.840> decided<00:01:19.110> we

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
long after that that we decided we

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.930 
long after that that we decided we
should<00:01:19.530> probably<00:01:19.710> start<00:01:20.130> doing<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.490> again<00:01:20.760> so

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
should probably start doing it again so

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.130 
should probably start doing it again so
I<00:01:21.000> guess<00:01:21.119> had<00:01:21.300> been<00:01:21.420> about<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.660> year<00:01:21.720> since

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
really good idea Jeff's hip to the idea

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
so am I so we start trying to figure out

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.690 
so am I so we start trying to figure out
where<00:01:58.229> we're<00:01:58.380> going<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.560> go<00:01:58.590> we<00:01:59.399> didn't<00:01:59.640> know

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
where we're going to go we didn't know

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.180 
where we're going to go we didn't know
where<00:02:00.060> exactly<00:02:00.479> we<00:02:00.869> wanted<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.289> go<00:02:01.560> what<00:02:01.860> we

where exactly we wanted to go what we

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.919 
where exactly we wanted to go what we
both<00:02:02.369> figured<00:02:02.580> mountains<00:02:03.119> would<00:02:03.240> be<00:02:03.300> nice<00:02:03.569> its

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929

crisps<00:02:04.319> from<00:02:04.440> Saskatchewan<00:02:05.220> I'm<00:02:05.399> from

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
crisps from Saskatchewan I'm from

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.880 
crisps from Saskatchewan I'm from
Alberta<00:02:06.060> roads<00:02:06.990> with<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.229> few<00:02:07.440> twists<00:02:07.709> and

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
Alberta roads with a few twists and

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.559 
Alberta roads with a few twists and
turns<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.310> them<00:02:08.490> would<00:02:08.610> be<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.789> pretty<00:02:09.360> nice

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
turns in them would be a pretty nice

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.690 
turns in them would be a pretty nice
change<00:02:09.929> all<00:02:10.649> we<00:02:10.860> really<00:02:11.009> knew<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.459> we

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
change all we really knew is that we

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.720 
change all we really knew is that we
just<00:02:11.730> wanted<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.270> get<00:02:12.420> out<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:13.140> town<00:02:13.410> out<00:02:13.770> of

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
just wanted to get out of town out of

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.500 
just wanted to get out of town out of
the<00:02:14.880> province<00:02:15.330> see<00:02:16.200> some<00:02:16.380> territory<00:02:16.890> that

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
the province see some territory that

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.880 
the province see some territory that
sort<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.569> again<00:02:18.840> we<00:02:19.020> didn't<00:02:19.410> really<00:02:19.620> know

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
sort of again we didn't really know

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.280 
sort of again we didn't really know
where<00:02:20.160> we<00:02:20.310> want<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.730> go<00:02:21.000> we<00:02:21.900> thought<00:02:22.080> the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
where we want it to go we thought the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.839 
where we want it to go we thought the
mountains<00:02:22.680> would<00:02:22.890> have<00:02:22.980> been<00:02:23.069> a<00:02:23.099> nice<00:02:23.250> place

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
mountains would have been a nice place

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.309 
mountains would have been a nice place
to<00:02:23.880> start<00:02:24.270> just<00:02:24.510> for<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.690> scenery<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.260> the

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
to start just for the scenery and the

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.800 
to start just for the scenery and the
challenging<00:02:25.830> roads<00:02:26.150> so<00:02:27.150> Jeff<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:27.540> spent<00:02:27.780> a

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
challenging roads so Jeff and I spent a

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.720 
challenging roads so Jeff and I spent a
lot<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:27.959> time<00:02:28.080> on<00:02:28.349> msn<00:02:28.830> trying<00:02:29.459> to<00:02:29.520> hash<00:02:29.700> things

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
lot of time on msn trying to hash things

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.390 
lot of time on msn trying to hash things
out<00:02:30.150> eventually<00:02:31.140> we<00:02:31.440> decided<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.980> go<00:02:32.099> south

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400
