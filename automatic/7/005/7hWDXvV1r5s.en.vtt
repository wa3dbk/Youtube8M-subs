something that I was really enough to do

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.170 
something that I was really enough to do
when<00:00:48.649> a<00:00:48.680> child<00:00:48.980> with<00:00:49.250> special<00:00:49.399> needs<00:00:49.850> comes

to be an experienced horse person

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.830

because the training here is so

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.380 
because the training here is so
comprehensive<00:01:24.229> that<00:01:25.030> before<00:01:26.030> you<00:01:26.180> are

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.420 

it's<00:01:35.990> important<00:01:36.410> that<00:01:36.440> we're<00:01:36.710> not<00:01:36.800> terribly

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
it's important that we're not terribly

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.530

but<00:01:39.100> it<00:01:40.100> isn't<00:01:40.430> really<00:01:40.610> necessary<00:01:40.730> to<00:01:41.690> be<00:01:41.900> a

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
but it isn't really necessary to be a

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.430 
but it isn't really necessary to be a
person<00:01:44.060> who<00:01:44.180> has<00:01:44.390> always<00:01:44.630> worked<00:01:45.110> with<00:01:45.290> horses
