00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.630
 two 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.099
 two 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.199
 and now if what everyone expected in me 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:21.420
 catai here what if the house does not finish 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.180
 of the mega express is already hills but not 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.910
 matter let's start with the mega 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.669
 size will be the ones every month and their 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.510
 guys now let's look at the sizes and their 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:37.879
 subtypes that are short by luck then 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.879
 follow jungles jungo jeans and others 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.940
 and here is juan we pass right in the house 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.890
 and we enter here 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.450
 there was the agenda that up to the portal 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:56.110
 neider says this because it looks nice not 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:59.250
 it's wrong I'm going to fuck fuck 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:03.280
 put this here as if it were a path 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.770
 I love the language of the cat and I win 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.470
 of the fall is with the pot shop 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.030
 I love it a lot because it makes me record 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.030
 it's movies 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.479
 we are in a forest imagine this to 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.479
 the night 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.020
 it's a bit scary, it's not 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.670
 will ask how am I come to good 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:30.120
 I put several as it is called varieties 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.120
 stone pupils in the trees eat here 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.100
 and it looks great at night in the boat 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.350
 these trips is great because they are 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.140
 like those movies not with the post sun 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.270
 there is that post sun is actually 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.980
 dry leaves com 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.220
 with moist earth not 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:53.700
 autumnal tip we could say is strange is 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.530
 like a stew of nature 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.930
 more or less I love it is not a kind 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.140
 but for a slender not with a text 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:08.490
 or a genetic mode we go through the house 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:12.480
 because I'm going to stand up 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:15.960
 we enter from below in an elevator 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.990
 water from these simple ones and those that 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.210
 we have no problems without doing and water 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.390
 I was squeezing in we closed the door 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.990
 we climb 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.380
 and here I have in bed chests me 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.520
 fired ovens 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.800
 and nothing else I think 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.900
 and this is brown 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.740
 happens to live a brown let's go up 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.740
 up is not 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:49.260
 what was this 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.260
 the enchantment table to enchant 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:59.760
 I'm going to put this here this is colored 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:03:02.860
 green what they call in January chest 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:07.160
 and well this is the house really 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.569
 There is not much but it's simple 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.810
 for the entire family 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.900
 when I saw this biome not the mega 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.680
 is I imagined a kind of 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:23.969
 cottage more than this rather as there was 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.709
 four subtypes of mega gas well tie me 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:28.500
 I imagined that some of those were going to be 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.870
 a cabin and not at the end of a I did 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.969
 but I think I'm going to do it like 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.959
 second position of houses a cabin not 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:41.329
 like movie laughs but I love 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.329
 this language I just love 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.220
 just like the house 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:50.420
 and that has a lot is not very pretty 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.100
 it seems a kind hotel here not 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.320
 there are the trees 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.170
 I had that as you know I think there's no 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.990
 splintered trees three by three 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.710
 there are only two by two but I had to 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.870
 add more fir wood 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.840
 to be style 3 could be the 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.180
 elevator 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.180
 and the tree elevator is very good 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.239
 I love them I love
