really<00:00:28.150> big<00:00:28.480> explosive<00:00:28.960> weapons<00:00:29.470> so<00:00:29.919> the

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040 
really big explosive weapons so the

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.589 
really big explosive weapons so the
weapons<00:00:30.340> I<00:00:30.430> would<00:00:30.550> say<00:00:30.640> we<00:00:30.759> push<00:00:31.119> a<00:00:31.149> little<00:00:31.300> bit

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
weapons I would say we push a little bit

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.549 
weapons I would say we push a little bit
farther<00:00:31.899> again<00:00:32.529> like<00:00:32.739> that<00:00:33.670> sort<00:00:34.149> of<00:00:34.239> mantra

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
farther again like that sort of mantra

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.170 
farther again like that sort of mantra
this<00:00:35.559> can<00:00:35.710> only<00:00:35.829> happen<00:00:36.010> resistance<00:00:36.850> I<00:00:37.000> think

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
this can only happen resistance I think

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.490 
this can only happen resistance I think
we've<00:00:37.270> got<00:00:37.390> a<00:00:37.420> really<00:00:37.570> unique<00:00:37.780> unique<00:00:38.260> meet

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
we've got a really unique unique meet

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.830 
we've got a really unique unique meet
dose<00:00:38.710> and<00:00:38.920> our<00:00:39.580> game<00:00:39.790> the<00:00:40.210> mutator<00:00:40.600> is<00:00:40.660> a<00:00:40.720> good

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
dose and our game the mutator is a good

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.050 
dose and our game the mutator is a good
example<00:00:40.930> where<00:00:41.440> they've<00:00:41.830> taken<00:00:42.160> chimera<00:00:42.880> and

time something was pretty close to you

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.750 
time something was pretty close to you
it'll<00:02:29.320> just<00:02:29.500> auto<00:02:29.650> target<00:02:30.070> them<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.400> zap<00:02:30.610> them

shoots out these sort of lightning bolts
and<00:02:37.570> it<00:02:37.630> actually<00:02:37.780> sucks<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.410> enemies<00:02:38.890> into

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100

it drags them in picks them up and they

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.350 
it drags them in picks them up and they
pretty<00:02:42.100> good<00:02:42.250> spending<00:02:42.520> around<00:02:42.700> so<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:43.240> get<00:02:43.330> a

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
bunch of body parts and a rag doll or

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.410 
bunch of body parts and a rag doll or
two<00:02:45.280> moving<00:02:45.520> around<00:02:45.640> was<00:02:45.820> pretty<00:02:46.030> awesome
