00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.879
 sometimes 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.610
 well everyone is worth today I bring you a 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.320
 tutorial on how to place the 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.020
 Turrets these costs them to the 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.720
 center our all this for power 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.239
 take us the and put them in others 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.890
 sites or for example here in this mission 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:33.530
 from here I do not know if it is for those who do not 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.350
 have made a turret can be placed 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.899
 here here 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.390
 or here and they only give us two and we have to 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.850
 defend all this is worth the positions 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.409
 a 4 how can we do for example as 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.219
 it's about four teams that each 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:49.219
 have a turret 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:57.179
 ok what we have to do is 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.300
 we give him here he says hold down to 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:02.850
 install anything and if we give the square 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.339
 once, nothing else, we take it if 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.930
 we press give the release is worth what 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.570
 we have to make the square 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.880
 just once to give it to take it like this 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.590
 as a decision and we should just 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.890
 to catch it we started to keep the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.000
 triangle look what happens we let loose a 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.000
 turret to do again 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.140
 a weapon 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.100
 because what will loose the hard track 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.799
 I really do not know 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.140
 so then we come here and what 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:43.460
 we collect 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.460
 then it's worth we put it on 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:51.170
 look that comes out you only have to 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.960
 then we place it, we already have a 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.640
 correct 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.150
 they are not going to spend us, it's as if they were 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.150
 infinite 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.040
 we already have another turret 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.460
 again 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:16.280
 As you have seen, I already have the 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.280
 four turrets 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.180
 and good good
