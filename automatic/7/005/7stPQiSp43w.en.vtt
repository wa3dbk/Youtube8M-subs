00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
of really the only good program that was

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.370 
of really the only good program that was
out<00:00:21.029> there<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.300> mean<00:00:21.570> Corel<00:00:21.840> Painter<00:00:22.170> has<00:00:22.260> been

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
out there I mean Corel Painter has been

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.529 
out there I mean Corel Painter has been
around<00:00:22.560> for<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.859> long<00:00:23.039> time<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:24.269> have<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> lot

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.200 
around for a long time and so have a lot
of<00:00:24.840> other<00:00:24.990> graphics<00:00:25.500> programs<00:00:25.949> but<00:00:26.730> Photoshop

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
of other graphics programs but Photoshop

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.880 
of other graphics programs but Photoshop
was<00:00:27.359> really<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.630> most<00:00:27.779> popular<00:00:27.990> one<00:00:28.470> because

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
was really the most popular one because

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.099 
was really the most popular one because
it<00:00:29.039> was<00:00:29.130> fast<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:29.880> was<00:00:30.029> updated<00:00:30.210> often<00:00:30.660> and

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
it was fast and it was updated often and

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.269 
it was fast and it was updated often and
it<00:00:31.199> seemed<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.529> work<00:00:31.560> really<00:00:31.710> well

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
it seemed to work really well

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.270 
it seemed to work really well
but<00:00:32.880> really<00:00:33.540> nowadays<00:00:33.989> like<00:00:34.380> it's<00:00:34.590> it's<00:00:34.920> not

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
but really nowadays like it's it's not

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.979 
but really nowadays like it's it's not
really<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.670> best<00:00:35.880> program<00:00:36.329> for<00:00:36.540> painting<00:00:36.870> and

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
really the best program for painting and

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.020 
really the best program for painting and
I<00:00:37.050> know<00:00:37.110> there's<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.410> lot<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:38.030> world-famous

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
I know there's a lot of world-famous

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.569 
I know there's a lot of world-famous
artists<00:00:39.629> who<00:00:39.750> use<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.110> exclusively<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.430> lot

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
artists who use it exclusively and a lot

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.280 
artists who use it exclusively and a lot
of<00:00:41.610> people<00:00:41.879> who<00:00:41.969> create<00:00:42.149> some<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.140> best

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
of people who create some of the best

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.049 
of people who create some of the best
digital<00:00:43.500> artwork<00:00:43.980> out<00:00:44.129> there<00:00:44.399> with<00:00:44.550> Photoshop

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
digital artwork out there with Photoshop

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.510 
digital artwork out there with Photoshop
but<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.899> think<00:00:46.230> that's<00:00:46.379> just<00:00:46.530> because<00:00:46.649> they're

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
but I think that's just because they're

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.069 
but I think that's just because they're
either<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.000> used<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.300> using<00:00:48.510> Photoshop

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
either so used to using Photoshop

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.450 
either so used to using Photoshop
because<00:00:49.260> they've<00:00:49.559> used<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.890> for<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.190> long<00:00:50.219> and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
because they've used it for so long and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.040 
because they've used it for so long and
don't<00:00:50.850> care<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.149> change<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.570> something<00:00:51.899> else

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
don't care to change to something else

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.900 
don't care to change to something else
or<00:00:52.320> they're<00:00:52.980> not<00:00:53.070> aware<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.489> other<00:00:53.610> things

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
or they're not aware that other things

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.119 
or they're not aware that other things
are<00:00:54.059> out<00:00:54.210> there<00:00:54.449> now<00:00:55.020> since<00:00:55.590> I've<00:00:55.739> tried<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> lot

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
are out there now since I've tried a lot

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.400 
are out there now since I've tried a lot
of<00:00:56.489> different<00:00:56.789> applications<00:00:57.079> I've<00:00:58.079> kind<00:00:58.379> of

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
of different applications I've kind of

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.900 
of different applications I've kind of
decided<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:58.949> one<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.219> works<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.609> best<00:00:59.640> for

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
decided on one that works the best for

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.029 
decided on one that works the best for
me<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.510> my<00:01:00.600> personal<00:01:01.320> painting<00:01:01.649> technique

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
that's really what I'm most comfortable

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.640 
that's really what I'm most comfortable
working<00:01:08.729> with<00:01:08.850> although<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.810> do<00:01:10.140> like<00:01:10.409> some

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
working with although I do like some

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.740 
working with although I do like some
other<00:01:10.799> programs<00:01:11.280> like<00:01:11.460> ArtRage<00:01:12.060> for<00:01:12.390> instance

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
other programs like ArtRage for instance

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.330 
other programs like ArtRage for instance
it's<00:01:12.900> kind<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.260> cool<00:01:13.409> program<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.979> paint<00:01:14.159> an

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
it's kind of a cool program to paint an

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.670 
it's kind of a cool program to paint an
as<00:01:14.490> well<00:01:14.670> but<00:01:15.299> what<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.509> paint<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:15.900> Photoshop<00:01:16.320> no

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
as well but what I paint in Photoshop no

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.859 
as well but what I paint in Photoshop no
way<00:01:16.830> because<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.430> like<00:01:17.610> such<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> rudimentary

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
way because it's like such a rudimentary

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.350 
way because it's like such a rudimentary
program<00:01:19.500> there's<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:20.070> very<00:01:20.640> limited<00:01:20.850> number<00:01:21.330> of

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
program there's a very limited number of

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.090 
program there's a very limited number of
brushes<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.200> can<00:01:22.409> make<00:01:22.619> your<00:01:22.770> own<00:01:22.799> brushes

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
brushes you can make your own brushes

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.859 
brushes you can make your own brushes
but<00:01:23.610> compared<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.030> something<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.360> painter

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
but compared to something like painter

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.560 
but compared to something like painter
it's<00:01:25.619> just<00:01:26.009> it's<00:01:26.310> too<00:01:26.640> simple<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.299> know<00:01:27.420> it's

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
it's just it's too simple you know it's

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.590 
it's just it's too simple you know it's
child's<00:01:27.930> play<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.200> we<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.009> take<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.280> look<00:01:29.400> at

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
child's play so we can take a look at

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.819 
child's play so we can take a look at
Photoshop<00:01:30.600> here<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.500> tools<00:01:31.710> for

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
Photoshop here and the tools for

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.950 
Photoshop here and the tools for
painting<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:33.090> know<00:01:33.180> we<00:01:33.329> have<00:01:33.450> our<00:01:33.600> basic

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
painting you know we have our basic

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.020 
painting you know we have our basic
brushes<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.070> brushes<00:01:35.100> do<00:01:35.549> work<00:01:35.759> pretty

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
brushes and the brushes do work pretty

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.010 
brushes and the brushes do work pretty
fast<00:01:36.590> there's<00:01:37.590> some<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.159> here<00:01:38.400> like<00:01:38.610> these

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
fast there's some in here like these

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.999 
fast there's some in here like these
chalk<00:01:40.020> textures<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.829> things<00:01:41.240> but<00:01:42.530> if<00:01:43.530> we<00:01:43.860> look

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
chalk textures and things but if we look

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.859 
chalk textures and things but if we look
at<00:01:44.130> these<00:01:44.280> they're<00:01:44.820> kind<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.090> like<00:01:45.270> these

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
at these they're kind of like these

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.630 
at these they're kind of like these
repeating<00:01:46.380> stamps<00:01:46.979> they<00:01:47.130> don't<00:01:47.280> look<00:01:47.399> that

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
repeating stamps they don't look that

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.960 
repeating stamps they don't look that
cool<00:01:47.880> if<00:01:48.780> we<00:01:49.049> go<00:01:49.170> into<00:01:49.320> something<00:01:49.799> like<00:01:50.100> Corel

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
cool if we go into something like Corel

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.620 
cool if we go into something like Corel
Painter<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.630> we<00:01:52.110> try<00:01:52.380> they're<00:01:52.860> chalk<00:01:53.159> brush

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
Painter and we try they're chalk brush

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.780 
Painter and we try they're chalk brush
you<00:01:54.630> can<00:01:54.810> see<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.380> has<00:01:55.409> it's<00:01:56.399> still<00:01:56.610> kind

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.449 
for text Emily I don't know I can't make
up<00:03:22.080> my<00:03:22.140> mind<00:03:22.260> I'll<00:03:22.709> just<00:03:22.860> do<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.070> little<00:03:23.160> bit<00:03:23.340> of

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
up my mind I'll just do a little bit of

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.430 
up my mind I'll just do a little bit of
everything<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:24.180> kind<00:03:24.330> of<00:03:24.480> do<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:25.320> know<00:03:25.410> a

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
everything and kind of do you know a

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.199 
everything and kind of do you know a
pretty<00:03:25.680> good<00:03:25.769> job<00:03:26.040> of<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.340> but<00:03:26.610> not<00:03:26.760> actually

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
pretty good job of it but not actually

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.550 
pretty good job of it but not actually
really<00:03:27.420> specialize<00:03:27.959> on<00:03:27.989> anything

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
really specialize on anything

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.400 
really specialize on anything
whereas<00:03:29.250> Corel<00:03:29.610> Painter<00:03:29.970> is<00:03:30.120> like<00:03:30.410> straight

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
whereas Corel Painter is like straight

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.680 
whereas Corel Painter is like straight
up<00:03:31.590> for<00:03:31.890> painting<00:03:32.250> so<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.060> recommend<00:03:33.450> if<00:03:33.570> you're

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
up for painting so I recommend if you're

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.170 
up for painting so I recommend if you're
using<00:03:33.840> Photoshop<00:03:34.220> give<00:03:35.220> Corel<00:03:35.489> Painter<00:03:35.820> a<00:03:35.850> try

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
using Photoshop give Corel Painter a try

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.479 
using Photoshop give Corel Painter a try
try<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.720> 30-day<00:03:36.959> trial<00:03:37.560> and<00:03:37.950> see<00:03:38.130> if<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:38.340> like

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
try the 30-day trial and see if you like

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.610 
try the 30-day trial and see if you like
it<00:03:38.550> it's<00:03:39.209> actually<00:03:39.450> quite<00:03:40.170> similar<00:03:40.470> to

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
it it's actually quite similar to

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.080 
it it's actually quite similar to
photoshop<00:03:41.010> in<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.519> layout<00:03:41.700> of<00:03:41.940> all<00:03:42.030> the

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
photoshop in the layout of all the

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.490 
photoshop in the layout of all the
palettes<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.810> way<00:03:42.900> that<00:03:43.050> the<00:03:43.110> brushes

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
palettes and the way that the brushes

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.710 
palettes and the way that the brushes
work<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:43.920> so<00:03:44.040> on<00:03:44.070> so<00:03:44.940> it<00:03:45.090> really<00:03:45.300> wouldn't<00:03:45.600> be

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
work and so on so it really wouldn't be

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.380 
work and so on so it really wouldn't be
that<00:03:45.930> hard<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.320> transfer<00:03:46.860> over<00:03:47.040> but<00:03:47.820> if<00:03:48.120> you're

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
that hard to transfer over but if you're

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.060 
that hard to transfer over but if you're
comfortable<00:03:48.600> with<00:03:48.930> Adobe<00:03:49.440> Photoshop<00:03:49.860> and

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
comfortable with Adobe Photoshop and

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.440 
comfortable with Adobe Photoshop and
that's<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.370> way<00:03:50.430> you<00:03:50.489> like<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:50.730> paint<00:03:51.000> by<00:03:51.330> all

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
that's the way you like to paint by all

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.870 
that's the way you like to paint by all
means<00:03:51.720> stick<00:03:52.260> with<00:03:52.470> that<00:03:52.620> that's<00:03:52.920> fine<00:03:53.010> so

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
means stick with that that's fine so

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.160 
means stick with that that's fine so
there<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:54.060> go<00:03:54.180> that's<00:03:54.330> my<00:03:54.540> two<00:03:54.600> cents<00:03:54.959> on

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
there you go that's my two cents on

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.750 
there you go that's my two cents on
painting<00:03:55.590> with<00:03:55.709> Photoshop<00:03:56.160> versus<00:03:56.580> other

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
painting with Photoshop versus other

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.000 
painting with Photoshop versus other
software<00:03:57.300> applications<00:03:57.390> if<00:03:58.080> you<00:03:58.739> enjoyed
