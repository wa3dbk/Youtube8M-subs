00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.400
 Nakano: I think there is a way of thinking that it gives a transfer-like effect 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:22.080
 The world's largest pyramid pyramid 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:25.000
 The average height of 137 meters to one 1 cubic meters of stone about 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:31.779
 It has been used more than 2.3 million units 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:33.690
 Looking at it from below, which is said to be the largest thing in store constructions made by mankind, is overwhelmingly pressing force 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.230
 To come 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:44.180
 Face each direction of north, south, east and west 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.180
 It is said that this pyramid of square pyramid originally had mysterious power 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:55.170
 Where corresponding to one of the height of 3 minutes from the lower i.e. the height from the bottom to the top 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:01:01.010
 Power is concentrated 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.010
 Commitment of devising Sakura has been designed in two its position 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:15.530
 Experiments are being conducted to prove that pyramids produce mysterious power in reality 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:22.579
 One orange is in the pyramid of a 15 cm high model 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:24.149
 It is two years ago by what kind of thing it is and if you can see it clearly 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.450
 If you understand the difference 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.530
 I say so, so what 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.940
 Let's have a look 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:42.210
 I will paint and there are two in China, but this one is about a week ago 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:43.370
 Yes this is it now the season of about 1 week ago oranges in the third year of the experiment of the third 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.770
 I bought it 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:51.090
 It will have passed now this week 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:57.210
 I even after a week it takes in the eyes this is that 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:02:01.890
 I like the amazing gloss I hope the color value field're put into the Paris pyramid 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.280
 If you don't have it, you 'll soon see something like the child shriveled 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.930
 ãƒ¼ 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.819
 This photo is from November 4 of last year last year 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.330
 I got up with a mandarin orange 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:18.210
 The orange orange in the middle 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:20.940
 I'm put in the reservoir this is already how much is passed that state I it roughly August 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:25.020
 So I when I was standing about 9 months 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.750
 9 months 9 months later even if the was put into this pyramid 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.550
 Mikan is thus 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:35.100
 It is ugly 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:37.840
 Kedomo form of that outside is left Kaiserslautern in clean that red thread 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.379
 Allies are very light inside 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:46.060
 I angle does not mean it always this way is 2 ne is also 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:50.340
 It 's okay, but please come and have some people come and sleep 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:54.930
 Become lighter eye shoulder more than it is I got thinking, 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.819
 I guess I Tteyuu Well group people mummified say Well 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:02.249
 What kind of state is that 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:06.150
 So we are not tried there are two in the early of this period October 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:07.569
 If you do so, Nakano will be getting smaller. 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.370
 Oh my little school 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.860
 Is good outside of Kawaa you clean to put the I Naka 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.090
 To small 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:23.160
 Not even in the state, such as managed a comment 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:28.280
 It looks like the pyramid has some mysterious features that are hard to explain 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.280
 How should we interpret this at all?
