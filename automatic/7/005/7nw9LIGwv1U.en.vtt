between the for name and the cernium and

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.389 
between the for name and the cernium and
maybe<00:00:57.750> that's<00:00:57.960> something<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.399> Samsung

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
could look at you know make make a

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.540 
could look at you know make make a
little<00:01:01.379> bit<00:01:01.530> smarter<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.219> can<00:01:02.399> actually

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
little bit smarter that it can actually

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.729 
little bit smarter that it can actually
put<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.629> space<00:01:03.870> between<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.350> names<00:01:04.500> it's

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739

very minor complained but it's

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:07.880 
very minor complained but it's
definitely<00:01:07.110> something<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.590> could<00:01:07.680> be

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
definitely something that could be

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.109 
definitely something that could be
