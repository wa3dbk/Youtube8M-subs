Suicide Squad take place in batman vs.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.730 
Suicide Squad take place in batman vs.
superman<00:00:30.090> let<00:00:30.750> me<00:00:30.840> say<00:00:30.960> this<00:00:30.990> again<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.590> is

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
superman let me say this again this is

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.160 
superman let me say this again this is
just<00:00:31.800> my<00:00:32.009> theories<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.489> what<00:00:32.880> i<00:00:32.940> think<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
just my theories of what i think the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.170 
just my theories of what i think the
place<00:00:34.410> takes<00:00:34.800> place<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.219> everything<00:00:35.399> else<00:00:35.640> so

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
place takes place and everything else so

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.569 
place takes place and everything else so
I<00:00:36.210> think<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.750> Suicide<00:00:37.290> Squad<00:00:37.469> now<00:00:38.340> hear<00:00:38.550> me

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
I think that Suicide Squad now hear me

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.690 
I think that Suicide Squad now hear me
out<00:00:38.670> Suicide<00:00:39.239> Squad<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.719> actually<00:00:40.700> taking

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
out Suicide Squad is actually taking

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.540 
out Suicide Squad is actually taking
place<00:00:41.730> at<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.480> same<00:00:42.510> time<00:00:42.960> as<00:00:43.340> Batman<00:00:44.340> vs

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
place at the same time as Batman vs

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.600 
place at the same time as Batman vs
Superman<00:00:44.579> now<00:00:45.210> what<00:00:45.390> do<00:00:45.480> i<00:00:45.539> say<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.780> because

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
Superman now what do i say that because

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.000 
Superman now what do i say that because
batman<00:00:47.690> just<00:00:48.690> got<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.840> retirement<00:00:49.530> remember

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
batman just got a retirement remember

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.319 
batman just got a retirement remember
that<00:00:50.160> because<00:00:50.430> he<00:00:50.730> comes<00:00:50.969> out<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.239> retirement

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
that because he comes out of retirement

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.650 
that because he comes out of retirement
in<00:00:52.070> batman<00:00:53.070> vs.<00:00:53.280> superman<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:54.300> he<00:00:54.480> doesn't

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
in batman vs. superman so he doesn't

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
in batman vs. superman so he doesn't
take<00:00:54.870> he<00:00:55.020> doesn't<00:00:55.320> come<00:00:55.379> out<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.530> retirement

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
take he doesn't come out of retirement

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.799 
take he doesn't come out of retirement
and<00:00:56.129> Suicide<00:00:56.789> Squad<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.239> don't<00:00:57.510> think<00:00:57.570> that's

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
and Suicide Squad I don't think that's

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.500 
and Suicide Squad I don't think that's
the<00:00:57.870> cost<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.010> think<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.670> Suicide<00:01:00.390> Squad

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
the cost so I think that Suicide Squad

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.450 
the cost so I think that Suicide Squad
and<00:01:00.840> Batman<00:01:01.230> for<00:01:01.379> Superman<00:01:01.680> are<00:01:01.829> happening<00:01:02.309> at

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
and Batman for Superman are happening at

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.509 
and Batman for Superman are happening at
the<00:01:02.820> same<00:01:03.180> time<00:01:03.989> why<00:01:04.710> do<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.860> say<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.129> okay

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
the same time why do I say that okay

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.120 
the same time why do I say that okay
because<00:01:06.090> Amanda<00:01:06.780> Waller<00:01:06.960> gets<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.740> group

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
because Amanda Waller gets this group

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.890 
because Amanda Waller gets this group
right<00:01:08.670> she<00:01:08.909> wants<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.180> get<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.390> group<00:01:09.600> to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
right she wants to get this group to

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.320 
right she wants to get this group to
neutralize<00:01:10.890> any<00:01:11.159> kind<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.580> threat<00:01:11.790> because<00:01:12.299> of

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
neutralize any kind of threat because of

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.000 
neutralize any kind of threat because of
Superman<00:01:12.840> she<00:01:12.990> even<00:01:13.170> mentioned<00:01:13.320> Superman<00:01:13.860> in

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
Superman she even mentioned Superman in

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.850 
Superman she even mentioned Superman in
the<00:01:14.580> trailer<00:01:15.000> now<00:01:15.540> because<00:01:15.930> there's<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.350> war

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
the trailer now because there's a war

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.460 
the trailer now because there's a war
going<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.430> right<00:01:17.880> because<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.659> my<00:01:18.869> theory<00:01:19.290> in

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
going on right because in my theory in

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.590 
going on right because in my theory in
my<00:01:19.710> breakdown<00:01:20.009> video<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.700> explained<00:01:21.450> that

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
my breakdown video I explained that

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.499 
my breakdown video I explained that
Joker<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.770> just<00:01:22.979> gonna<00:01:23.070> cause<00:01:23.310> chaos<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:24.030> bomb

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
Joker it's just gonna cause chaos a bomb

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.870 
Joker it's just gonna cause chaos a bomb
and<00:01:24.720> all<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.020> because<00:01:25.200> why<00:01:25.650> because<00:01:25.950> Batman

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
and all that because why because Batman

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.940 
and all that because why because Batman
is<00:01:27.090> dealing<00:01:27.630> with<00:01:27.659> another<00:01:28.110> issue<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.860> that

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
is dealing with another issue and that

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.310 
is dealing with another issue and that
is<00:01:29.340> Superman<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.210> he<00:01:30.360> feels<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.750> he<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:30.960> let

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
is Superman so he feels that he can let

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.740 
is Superman so he feels that he can let
loose<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.829> do<00:01:31.950> whatever<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.490> want<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.570> that's

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
loose and do whatever you want so that's

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.210 
loose and do whatever you want so that's
why<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.930> think<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:34.650> kind<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.040> takes

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
why I think that it's kind of takes

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.920 
why I think that it's kind of takes
place<00:01:35.400> at<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.549> same<00:01:35.640> time<00:01:35.970> also<00:01:36.420> there's

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
place at the same time also there's

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.590 
place at the same time also there's
another<00:01:37.020> theory<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:38.009> maybe<00:01:38.759> when<00:01:39.119> bamas<00:01:39.479> in

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
another theory that maybe when bamas in

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.899 
another theory that maybe when bamas in
it<00:01:39.720> it's<00:01:39.930> kind<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.320> prequel<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:41.040> like<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.400> you

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
it it's kind of a prequel of like a you

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.330 
it it's kind of a prequel of like a you
know<00:01:41.939> before<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:43.140> Suicide<00:01:43.530> Squad<00:01:43.649> begins<00:01:44.130> and

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
know before the Suicide Squad begins and

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.280 
know before the Suicide Squad begins and
all<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.610> which<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.000> another<00:01:45.420> good<00:01:45.630> thing<00:01:45.689> but

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
all that which is another good thing but

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.840 
all that which is another good thing but
I<00:01:46.350> just<00:01:46.619> think<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.890> just<00:01:47.159> takes<00:01:47.460> place<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
I just think it just takes place the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.270 
I just think it just takes place the
same<00:01:48.060> time<00:01:48.390> because<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.200> would<00:01:49.619> see<00:01:49.829> Superman

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
same time because you would see Superman

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.090 
same time because you would see Superman
zip<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.119> stop<00:01:51.479> all<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:51.990> possibly<00:01:52.619> who

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
zip in and stop all this possibly who

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.260 
zip in and stop all this possibly who
knows<00:01:53.310> what<00:01:53.520> happens<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:53.939> Batman<00:01:54.180> V<00:01:54.210> Superman

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
knows what happens in Batman V Superman

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.719 
knows what happens in Batman V Superman
also<00:01:55.200> there's<00:01:55.380> another<00:01:55.560> theory<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.189> Aquaman

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
also there's another theory that Aquaman

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.940 
also there's another theory that Aquaman
is<00:01:56.909> going<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.299> be<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.540> Suicide<00:01:57.930> Squad<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.439> that

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
is going to be in Suicide Squad and that

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.950 
is going to be in Suicide Squad and that
his<00:01:59.159> one<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.490> his<00:01:59.579> armies<00:02:00.090> are<00:02:00.329> trying<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.899> get

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
his one of his armies are trying to get

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.980 
his one of his armies are trying to get
them<00:02:01.110> out<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.409> Amanda<00:02:02.130> Waller<00:02:02.310> has<00:02:02.990> Aquaman

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
them out and Amanda Waller has Aquaman

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.230 
them out and Amanda Waller has Aquaman
and<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.380> trying<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.799> ease<00:02:04.950> into<00:02:05.130> jail<00:02:05.460> cell<00:02:05.729> so

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
and is trying to ease into jail cell so

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.300 
and is trying to ease into jail cell so
who<00:02:06.390> knows<00:02:06.570> what<00:02:06.840> happens<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.409> but<00:02:08.280> I

who knows what happens in that but I

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.580 
who knows what happens in that but I
feel<00:02:08.489> like<00:02:08.520> Suicide<00:02:09.000> Squad<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.569> gonna<00:02:10.170> have<00:02:10.410> a

feel like Suicide Squad is gonna have a

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.309 
feel like Suicide Squad is gonna have a
lot<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.039> flashbacks<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:12.000> between<00:02:12.900> what's

going<00:02:14.040> on<00:02:14.159> in<00:02:14.310> Batman<00:02:14.580> Superman<00:02:14.819> you<00:02:15.480> know

all<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.269> ever<00:02:18.360> heard<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.569> the<00:02:18.690> Superman<00:02:19.080> guys

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
all you ever heard of the Superman guys

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.140 
all you ever heard of the Superman guys
like<00:02:19.560> yeah<00:02:19.739> last<00:02:20.010> night<00:02:20.220> on<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.459> news<00:02:20.489> him<00:02:21.030> and

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
like yeah last night on the news him and

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.880 
like yeah last night on the news him and
super<00:02:21.330> him<00:02:21.569> and<00:02:21.750> Batman<00:02:22.049> were<00:02:22.170> going<00:02:22.409> at<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.590> so

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
super him and Batman were going at it so

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.550 
super him and Batman were going at it so
I<00:02:22.920> think<00:02:23.280> we<00:02:23.430> should<00:02:23.459> be<00:02:23.700> okay<00:02:24.060> for<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.140> for

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
I think we should be okay for this for

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.539 
I think we should be okay for this for
this<00:02:25.590> mission<00:02:25.890> because<00:02:26.159> I<00:02:26.310> don't<00:02:26.519> think

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
this mission because I don't think

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.100 
this mission because I don't think
Batman's<00:02:27.000> gonna<00:02:27.090> try<00:02:27.360> stop<00:02:27.599> is<00:02:27.780> doing<00:02:28.019> this

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
Batman's gonna try stop is doing this

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.960 
Batman's gonna try stop is doing this
right<00:02:28.290> now<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:28.890> that's<00:02:29.040> why<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.670> would<00:02:29.819> make

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
right now so that's why it would make

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.160 
right now so that's why it would make
sense<00:02:30.000> because<00:02:30.390> if<00:02:30.629> you<00:02:30.690> think<00:02:30.720> about<00:02:30.870> suicide

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
sense because if you think about suicide

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.559 
sense because if you think about suicide
squad<00:02:31.709> are<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.640> bunch<00:02:32.819> of<00:02:32.909> group<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.269> Batman

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
squad are a bunch of group that Batman

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:34.910 
squad are a bunch of group that Batman
just<00:02:33.750> don't<00:02:34.019> like<00:02:34.170> they're<00:02:34.379> criminals<00:02:34.590> he

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
just don't like they're criminals he

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.350 
just don't like they're criminals he
wants<00:02:35.159> to<00:02:35.220> stop<00:02:35.400> them<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:35.730> he<00:02:35.819> can't<00:02:36.030> do<00:02:36.329> that

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
wants to stop them but he can't do that

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.869 
wants to stop them but he can't do that
while<00:02:37.019> he<00:02:37.260> has<00:02:37.530> something<00:02:37.950> going<00:02:38.099> on<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.849> that

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
while he has something going on and that

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.460
