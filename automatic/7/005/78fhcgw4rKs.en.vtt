00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:04.569
 hello we will measure now 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:06.500
 acceleration 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:08.990
 acceleration to 100 kilometers per hour 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:13.039
 cars chevrolet cruze with engine 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.610
 1 and 4 turbocharged release end of 2013 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:18.110
 of the year 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:22.660
 more precisely November automatic transmission star I will 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.660
 produce not dead pedals us 1 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:30.380
 I have disabled thematic system now 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:36.579
 make sure that there are no pedestrians by car 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.579
 let's go just write now will pass 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.370
 so we go 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.560
 I hope it was visible because the phone 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:20.869
 more precisely the camera I do not have only 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.780
 the phone also I measured acceleration downloaded 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.490
 on the phone program so it is called 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:30.349
 measurement acceleration program showed 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.130
 10 whole and one tenth of a second 

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:36.409
 although it was stated by the manufacturer overclocking 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.579
 up to hundreds of 10 and 3 despite the fact that when now 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:43.810
 winter rather slippery asphalt tires 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:47.149
 are winter studded and full tank 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:51.319
 all my feeling was I 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:56.060
 engine 18 car was 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:58.009
 the tenth year of release but of course 14 obviously 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.670
 cheerfully and there I was also a box on 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.670
 automatic machine 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.760
 Well, it feels like traction and overtaking 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.360
 I've been a little ride on the track 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.170
 overtaking is given much easier around the city 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.170
 riding 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.740
 but I do not know, I do not exceed 3000 rpm and 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.470
 quite a dynamic car behaves 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.870
 while the engine at 18 needed it 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.540
 twist well so thousand to four with 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.280
 half 5 turns to move 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.500
 so more menie dynamic because 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.010
 regiment torque not your if 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.080
 I am not mistaken it was 4800 and in this there is 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:39.210
 available 2 and a half just pam there 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:44.640
 up to 400 already in this range the car is very 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:46.700
 dynamically accelerates the problem is not all 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.700
 thank
