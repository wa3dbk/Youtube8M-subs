00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.770 
edge but it was so accurate like I see
it<00:03:09.109> because<00:03:10.100> it's<00:03:10.370> like<00:03:10.519> not<00:03:10.850> just<00:03:11.150> hair<00:03:11.420> but

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
it because it's like not just hair but

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.920 
it because it's like not just hair but
there<00:03:11.959> are<00:03:12.049> crumbs<00:03:12.319> in<00:03:12.560> there<00:03:12.709> too
