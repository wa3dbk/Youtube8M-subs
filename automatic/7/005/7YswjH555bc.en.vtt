00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.119
 a turn in this new sorento 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.119
 accompany please 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.060
 and 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.420
 we leave 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.790
 in charge you know we always say the same thing 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.610
 that is , there is already a little bit how 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.470
 unwraps this new kia sorento 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.590
 four-wheel drive single engine 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.200
 of 200 horses automatic change of 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.710
 six speeds and at this moment I have 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.480
 connected this little button here that what 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.860
 what it does to you is to spread the attraction 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.380
 between the rear axle and the front axle 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.720
 to solve better then any 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.670
 difficulty of the terrain as you see this is 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.650
 quite easy and me and for this case 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.040
 slow does not have any problem in 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:08.040
 solve these potholes not these small 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.320
 unevenness because well despite 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.310
 the dimensions in the entry angle 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.860
 exit angle of the beltra angle 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.360
 central have gone down a little bit 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.050
 worsened with respect to the previous kia 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.640
 sorento it 's clear that still this guy 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.680
 of terrain unfolds very well not 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.170
 have any problem we can paste a 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.320
 good acceleration and check that it is 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.410
 pretty stable pretty 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.360
 the problem in this regard 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.460
 you already saw it by four meters and 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.280
 seventy-eight centimeters of a car 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:40.400
 that has been completely renewed that has 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.620
 changed his philosophy and this I tell you 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.880
 Because honestly in Spain 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.230
 example will only come with seven places 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.880
 If you take a look at the cas, you will see that they are 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.980
 mounted all the squares the second and 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.230
 the third row of seats that by 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.060
 true is reclining are described from 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.910
 up to 27 centimeters which is a 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.170
 barbarity and facilitates access 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.850
 to some rear seats that we have 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.480
 pretty much advertised because with 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.410
 a meter 80 the truth there are times that with 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.030
 rozas 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.620
 in the on the roof for very little 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.150
 with very little less than an 80 would be 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.640
 some great places we have 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.280
 disconnected already the traction distribution 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.330
 right now this front wheel drive 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.280
 every way the system 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.720
 If you detect any difficulty or that is 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.670
 necessary to send a little bit of traction 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.650
 back he will do it without you having to 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.760
 do anything else that I can 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.650
 say good 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.720
 here he has chosen to bring Spain alone 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.300
 the 200 horsepower diesel engine and the 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.650
 truth is that to replace masters that 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.270
 turns to the engines we also raise them 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.150
 well because the truth is that it is suitable 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.090
 to move from the almost 1,800 kilos of a 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.400
 car that is still a suv but that 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.800
 does not renounce that aspect of 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.560
 monovolume that has then well then 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.050
 with this habitability with this good 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.240
 because with seven seats you'll say 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.150
 only 148 liters of luggage compartment but with 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.610
 five seats that is a configuration 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.260
 more normal we have more than 600 liters of 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.360
 trunk that is very good and in itself 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.730
 It was not enough, I can tell you that everything 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.220
 what you see here comes standard in the 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.480
 emotional finish with the luxury pack is 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.090
 true that is the top of range that 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.470
 we are at 43 thousand euros but if 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.570
 you want four times two if you want it with 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.880
 manual change and with a finished one 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.800
 little bit lower you have it from 29 thousand 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.150
 euros in this case I can 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.830
 ensure that it is a premium finish in 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.040
 how much in settings regarding 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.630
 materials as soon as 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.280
 and in terms of driving sensation 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.980
 because one of the things that has most 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.980
 liked this case slow is definitely 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:38.320
 the softness that presides over everything so much 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.840
 roll as it is a simple blink 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.150
 of doors 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.580
 the fact of operating any command 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.230
 any roulette any button on the 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.390
 browser with touch screen that like 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.340
 you see works great and super fast 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.500
 has a software that honestly does not 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.660
 It surprised us because it works a lot 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.360
 and very well heated seats 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:02.530
 ventilated seats including the steering wheel 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.760
 heated and cameras of all kinds for 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.090
 see ahead protas when you're 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.520
 doing 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.310
 when you are parking, you even have a 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.650
 parking assistant and you will not miss 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.300
 nothing is missing and you will not have less than 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.190
 what has any premium and yes 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.920
 for a lot less money is a car 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.870
 very complete maybe the feeling of 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.850
 driving is nothing dynamic 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.700
 obviously it's nothing sports 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.580
 you are sitting very high you have to be 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.430
 aware of the weight and volume that 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.730
 evictions but 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.260
 is that it has been slow to renew the sorento 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.480
 but I have done it very wisely 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.570
 bet on doing that crossover that 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.310
 is so fashionable now with a 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:43.120
 MPV and it's a very valid SUV 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.120
 well then 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:48.830
 let's say it's very complete that it has 

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:50.509
 many things this version has then 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.769
 how do you see a panoramic roof that 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:53.900
 it's amazing and it's not only panoramic 

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:55.520
 but it is to open 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.650
 In short, it could be talking like 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.470
 we always say hours and hours of a 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.210
 Very complete car very well finished is 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.340
 a step forward that is going to help 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.680
 very much to place the brand much more 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.840
 above the generalists and if you want 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.820
 know more you know reference of the 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.350
 world to the motor portal cars.net there 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:16.030
 you have this test and all the ones that you 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.030
 you want to always be there
