00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.949
 do not 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.949
 do not 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.039
 in yungas it is one of the most 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.770
 Biodiversity of Argentina along with the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.480
 missionary jungle between both represent 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.809
 2 percent of Argentine territory 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.320
 and it contains more than 50% of the plants and 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.420
 animals of the country so as they see is in 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.970
 a very small territory there is a 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.020
 variety of plants and animals 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.570
 impressive there are several parks 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.390
 that protect the ecosystem of 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.800
 Yungas or subtropical mountain jungle the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.469
 calilegua national park is one of the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.809
 larger with 76 thousand hectares that was 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.960
 donated about 40 years ago by ingenuity 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.960
 ledesma 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.689
 pro yungas is an organization of the 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:19.490
 civil society that good as its name 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:21.259
 indicates that the problem of 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.780
 the yunga fundamentally what is the 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.149
 the conservation of biodiversity but 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.390
 also support for production 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.390
 sustainable 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.100
 and 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.760
 ingenuity has also been a company 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.250
 visionary in this conservation of the 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.870
 biodiversity and land rights 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.370
 40 years ago to make the park 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.220
 national calilegua this is a fact 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.230
 unpublished within the business sector in 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.070
 Argentina and many there are very few cases 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:08.729
 that somehow in the same 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.440
 address but for a few years 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.250
 we have made an order plan 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.570
 with the time more which is this company 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.090
 compromises the preservation of 100 thousand 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.210
 additional hectares as area of 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.340
 damping and also a plan of 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.070
 no biodiversity monitoring 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.230
 only ledesma contributes to the 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.560
 preservation of its biodiversity 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.580
 own environment this environmental but that 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.730
 come up is contributing 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.740
 significantly to value the 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.640
 ecoregion 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:46.300
 in general these commitments this vision 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.820
 is synthesized in the concept of a brand 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.070
 what is yungas products that is owned 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.680
 of the proyungas foundation and that 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.540
 justly certifies compliance with 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.520
 these environmental standards of this 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.790
 commitment to preserve the 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.329
 long-term biodiversity 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.329
 yes 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.989
