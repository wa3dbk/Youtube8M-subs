00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
the comments but let's go ahead and jump

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.130 
the comments but let's go ahead and jump
into<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> Pokemon<00:00:51.449> hit<00:00:51.690> number<00:00:51.930> five

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
into this so the Pokemon hit number five

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.200 
into this so the Pokemon hit number five
on<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.500> list<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.890> hair<00:00:53.309> cross<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.789> here

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
on this list is hair cross and here

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.819 
on this list is hair cross and here
across<00:00:54.390> hits<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:55.020> because<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.500> really

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
across hits is this because I really

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.650 
across hits is this because I really
want<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.039> see<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.219> hair<00:00:56.520> across<00:00:56.699> pre<00:00:57.090> evolution

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
want to see a hair across pre evolution

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.139 
want to see a hair across pre evolution
more<00:00:58.500> than<00:00:58.710> evolution<00:00:59.460> actually<00:00:59.940> just

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
more than evolution actually just

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.510 
more than evolution actually just
because<00:01:00.480> hair<00:01:01.050> cross<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.559> already<00:01:02.070> strong

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
because hair cross is already strong

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.000 
because hair cross is already strong
enough<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.120> feel<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.080> hair<00:01:04.260> cross<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.680> pretty

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
enough I feel that hair cross is pretty

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.820 
enough I feel that hair cross is pretty
strong<00:01:05.309> as<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.909> especially<00:01:06.900> with<00:01:07.110> his<00:01:07.560> dream

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
strong as is especially with his dream

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.130 
strong as is especially with his dream
world<00:01:08.010> ability<00:01:08.400> moxie<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.180> everything

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
world ability moxie and everything

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.440 
world ability moxie and everything
everything<00:01:10.830> like<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:10.979> it's<00:01:11.460> just<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.790> very

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
everything like that it's just a very

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.020 
everything like that it's just a very
powerful<00:01:12.780> Pokemon<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.040> thing<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.340> big

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
powerful Pokemon and this thing is a big

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.710 
powerful Pokemon and this thing is a big
big<00:01:15.689> threat<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.920> don't<00:01:17.369> necessarily<00:01:17.970> really

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
big threat so I don't necessarily really

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.289 
big threat so I don't necessarily really
want<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.049> see<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.979> evolution<00:01:20.549> but<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.970> pre

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
want to see a in evolution but a pre

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.030 
want to see a in evolution but a pre
evolution<00:01:21.810> would<00:01:21.990> be<00:01:22.170> pretty<00:01:22.380> cool<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.830> know

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
evolution would be pretty cool I know

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.380 
evolution would be pretty cool I know
some<00:01:23.430> people<00:01:23.460> were<00:01:23.759> saying<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.090> they<00:01:24.150> want

some people were saying that they want

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.420 
some people were saying that they want
to<00:01:24.450> see<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.080> pre<00:01:25.500> evolution<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.070> penseron

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
to see like a pre evolution of penseron

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.670 
to see like a pre evolution of penseron
hair<00:01:26.850> cross<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.390> they<00:01:27.869> like<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.380> pre

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
hair cross and they like the pre

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.319 
hair cross and they like the pre
evolution<00:01:29.130> when<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.369> evolves<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.060> branch

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
evolution when it evolves it can branch

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.630 
evolution when it evolves it can branch
off<00:01:30.570> between<00:01:30.900> hair<00:01:31.170> across<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.470> pincer<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.189> mean

they're<00:01:43.649> both<00:01:43.770> beetle<00:01:44.189> Pokemon<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:44.700> i<00:01:44.729> can<00:01:45.030> see

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
they're both beetle Pokemon so i can see

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.270 
they're both beetle Pokemon so i can see
i<00:01:45.450> see<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.079> correlation<00:01:46.259> between<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.950> plus

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
i see the correlation between that plus

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.130 
i see the correlation between that plus
they're<00:01:47.549> both<00:01:47.759> they<00:01:48.060> both<00:01:48.090> are<00:01:48.509> pretty

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
they're both they both are pretty

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.740 
they're both they both are pretty
similar<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:49.829> terms<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.399> stats<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.149> move<00:01:51.360> sets

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
similar in terms of stats and move sets

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.999 
similar in terms of stats and move sets
and<00:01:51.990> everything<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.530> they're<00:01:52.829> both

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
and everything like that they're both

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.490 
and everything like that they're both
pretty<00:01:53.250> similar<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.899> mean<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.259> would<00:01:55.470> be

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
pretty similar so I mean that would be

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.289 
pretty similar so I mean that would be
pretty<00:01:56.219> cool<00:01:56.369> actually<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:57.000> would<00:01:57.210> be

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
pretty cool actually that would be

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.969 
pretty cool actually that would be
pretty<00:01:57.479> cool<00:01:57.570> but<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.259> feel<00:01:58.469> like<00:01:58.500> hair<00:01:58.770> cross

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
pretty cool but I feel like hair cross

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.800 
pretty cool but I feel like hair cross
is<00:01:59.130> already<00:01:59.460> strong<00:01:59.700> enough<00:02:00.000> as<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.780> I

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
is already strong enough as is so I

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.810 
is already strong enough as is so I
would<00:02:01.170> rather<00:02:01.350> see<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.680> pre<00:02:01.950> evolution<00:02:02.460> that

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
would rather see a pre evolution that

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.340 
would rather see a pre evolution that
means<00:02:03.090> another<00:02:03.360> Pokemon<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.960> can<00:02:04.049> use<00:02:04.140> the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
means another Pokemon that can use the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.380 
means another Pokemon that can use the
evil<00:02:05.040> eye<00:02:05.189> item<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.729> they<00:02:05.850> brought<00:02:06.060> out<00:02:06.240> in

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
evil eye item that they brought out in

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.830 
evil eye item that they brought out in
jan<00:02:06.659> 5<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:08.340> would<00:02:08.550> be<00:02:08.700> pretty<00:02:09.300> cool<00:02:09.420> in<00:02:09.810> my

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
jan 5 so that would be pretty cool in my

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.559 
jan 5 so that would be pretty cool in my
opinion<00:02:10.069> maybe<00:02:11.069> not<00:02:11.280> yours<00:02:11.670> but<00:02:11.910> in<00:02:12.330> my

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
opinion maybe not yours but in my

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.340 
opinion maybe not yours but in my
opinion

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
opinion

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.860 
opinion
cool<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.580> Pokemon<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.180> hit<00:02:15.360> number<00:02:15.660> four

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
cool so the Pokemon to hit number four

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.290 
cool so the Pokemon to hit number four
on<00:02:15.990> this<00:02:16.080> top<00:02:16.290> five<00:02:16.530> list<00:02:16.560> Skarmory<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.580> I

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
on this top five list Skarmory and I

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.270 
on this top five list Skarmory and I
feel<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.900> scar<00:02:19.200> me<00:02:19.320> hits<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:19.650> list<00:02:19.950> mainly

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
because I want to see a free evolution

because I want to see a free evolution
of<00:02:22.020> skarmory<00:02:22.470> skarmory<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.400> bird<00:02:23.790> Pokemon

that's how I feel about it personally

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.710 
that's how I feel about it personally
like<00:02:43.950> it's<00:02:44.190> a<00:02:44.340> bird<00:02:44.520> pokemon<00:02:45.000> right<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.240> if

it's a bird well shouldn't birds start
out<00:02:49.920> small<00:02:50.550> I<00:02:51.210> mean<00:02:52.110> that's<00:02:52.470> that's<00:02:53.070> what<00:02:53.340> I

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
out small I mean that's that's what I

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.530 
out small I mean that's that's what I
think<00:02:53.670> they<00:02:53.790> should<00:02:53.940> just<00:02:54.060> start<00:02:54.240> out<00:02:54.330> small

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
think they should just start out small

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.840 
think they should just start out small
you<00:02:54.900> know<00:02:55.020> so<00:02:55.560> that's<00:02:55.950> why<00:02:56.190> i<00:02:56.220> once<00:02:56.490> called<00:02:56.730> me

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
you know so that's why i once called me

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.270 
you know so that's why i once called me
to<00:02:57.060> have<00:02:57.240> a<00:02:57.270> pre<00:02:57.570> evolution<00:02:58.050> so<00:02:58.710> the<00:02:58.860> Pokemon

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
to have a pre evolution so the Pokemon

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.800 
to have a pre evolution so the Pokemon
to<00:02:59.400> hit<00:02:59.520> number<00:02:59.850> three<00:03:00.030> on<00:03:00.090> this<00:03:00.390> list<00:03:00.660> is

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
to hit number three on this list is

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.320 
to hit number three on this list is
girafarig<00:03:01.590> girafarig<00:03:02.220> hits<00:03:02.910> this<00:03:03.060> list

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
girafarig girafarig hits this list

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.360 
girafarig girafarig hits this list
mainly<00:03:03.900> because<00:03:03.930> i<00:03:04.290> feel<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:04.650> giraffe<00:03:05.100> rick

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
mainly because i feel that giraffe rick

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.400 
mainly because i feel that giraffe rick
is<00:03:05.520> one<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:05.940> many<00:03:06.150> forgotten<00:03:06.750> pokemon<00:03:07.200> of

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
is one of the many forgotten pokemon of

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.740 
is one of the many forgotten pokemon of
Game<00:03:07.680> Freak<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.940> its<00:03:09.180> tax<00:03:09.450> could<00:03:09.630> be<00:03:09.720> a

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
Game Freak and that its tax could be a

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.810 
Game Freak and that its tax could be a
little<00:03:10.170> bit<00:03:10.410> better<00:03:10.650> so<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.220> feel<00:03:11.550> that<00:03:11.670> it

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
little bit better so I feel that it

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.120 
little bit better so I feel that it
deserves<00:03:12.240> an<00:03:12.420> evolution<00:03:13.020> but<00:03:13.290> not<00:03:13.530> just<00:03:13.950> an

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
deserves an evolution but not just an

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.310 
deserves an evolution but not just an
evolution<00:03:14.700> but<00:03:14.820> also<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.240> pre<00:03:15.630> evolution<00:03:16.200> i

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
evolution but also a pre evolution i

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.980 
evolution but also a pre evolution i
feel<00:03:16.800> i'll<00:03:17.100> feel<00:03:17.340> very<00:03:17.670> comfortable<00:03:17.910> if<00:03:18.480> draft

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
feel i'll feel very comfortable if draft

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.350 
feel i'll feel very comfortable if draft
red<00:03:19.200> just<00:03:19.410> got<00:03:19.560> an<00:03:19.770> entire<00:03:20.250> evolution<00:03:21.060> line

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
red just got an entire evolution line

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.200 
red just got an entire evolution line
because<00:03:22.200> that<00:03:22.380> would<00:03:22.500> be<00:03:22.530> very<00:03:23.220> very<00:03:23.580> cool<00:03:23.940> in

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
because that would be very very cool in

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.690 
because that would be very very cool in

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.690 
my opinion draft rig stacks aren't as
bad<00:03:27.150> as<00:03:27.480> some<00:03:28.050> other<00:03:28.260> pokemon<00:03:28.740> so<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.370> know

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
bad as some other pokemon so you know

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.670 
bad as some other pokemon so you know
directory<00:03:30.210> can<00:03:30.420> probably<00:03:30.690> hold<00:03:30.780> his<00:03:30.960> own<00:03:31.080> in<00:03:31.140> a

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
directory can probably hold his own in a

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.410 
directory can probably hold his own in a
battle<00:03:32.010> but<00:03:32.460> i<00:03:32.610> just<00:03:32.820> want<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.000> see<00:03:33.150> it<00:03:33.270> evolve

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
battle but i just want to see it evolve

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.290 
battle but i just want to see it evolve
and<00:03:34.020> have<00:03:34.560> a<00:03:34.590> pre<00:03:34.860> evolution<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.850> boot<00:03:36.060> and

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
and have a pre evolution to boot and

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.750 
and have a pre evolution to boot and
that<00:03:37.110> would<00:03:37.320> just<00:03:37.350> be<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:38.100> greatest<00:03:38.490> thing<00:03:38.640> in

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
that would just be the greatest thing in

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.120 
that would just be the greatest thing in
the<00:03:38.850> world<00:03:38.910> I<00:03:39.240> can't<00:03:39.600> even<00:03:39.750> give<00:03:40.110> a<00:03:40.320> very<00:03:40.860> good

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
the world I can't even give a very good

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.370 
the world I can't even give a very good
reason<00:03:41.340> for<00:03:41.580> Drake<00:03:42.090> I<00:03:42.210> just<00:03:42.510> want<00:03:42.780> draft<00:03:43.110> rig

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
reason for Drake I just want draft rig

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.740 
reason for Drake I just want draft rig
to<00:03:43.530> have<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.920> full<00:03:44.400> evolution<00:03:45.000> line<00:03:45.150> that's<00:03:45.540> it

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
to have a full evolution line that's it

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.350 
to have a full evolution line that's it
point-blank<00:03:46.230> done<00:03:46.860> so<00:03:47.580> the<00:03:47.700> pokemon<00:03:48.090> that<00:03:48.270> is

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
point-blank done so the pokemon that is

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.810 
point-blank done so the pokemon that is
hitting<00:03:48.630> number<00:03:48.810> two<00:03:49.080> on<00:03:49.320> my<00:03:49.350> list<00:03:49.560> is<00:03:49.980> melting

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
hitting number two on my list is melting

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.240 
hitting number two on my list is melting
and<00:03:51.000> I<00:03:51.210> feel<00:03:51.480> that<00:03:51.630> miltank<00:03:52.050> deserves<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:53.070> be

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
and I feel that miltank deserves to be

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.660 
and I feel that miltank deserves to be
on<00:03:53.490> this<00:03:53.760> list<00:03:54.060> because<00:03:54.690> as<00:03:55.260> a<00:03:55.320> cow<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.370> feel

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
on this list because as a cow I feel

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.780 
on this list because as a cow I feel
that<00:03:56.820> miltank<00:03:57.180> should<00:03:57.420> start<00:03:57.660> off<00:03:57.780> as<00:03:58.050> a<00:03:58.790> baby

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
that miltank should start off as a baby

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.690 
that miltank should start off as a baby
calf<00:04:00.260> not<00:04:01.260> only<00:04:01.530> miltank<00:04:01.890> but<00:04:02.070> Toros<00:04:02.460> too

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
calf not only miltank but Toros too

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.430 
calf not only miltank but Toros too
because<00:04:03.060> Toros<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.510> miltank<00:04:03.840> again<00:04:04.230> are

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
because Toros a miltank again are

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.140 
because Toros a miltank again are
practically<00:04:05.040> from<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.640> same<00:04:05.880> species

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
practically from the same species

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.120 
practically from the same species
because<00:04:06.720> you<00:04:06.870> know<00:04:07.020> Taurus<00:04:07.410> is<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.590> bull<00:04:07.890> and

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
because you know Taurus is a bull and

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.360 
because you know Taurus is a bull and
bulls<00:04:08.790> are<00:04:09.000> mailed<00:04:09.240> miltank<00:04:09.870> is<00:04:10.020> a<00:04:10.050> female<00:04:10.770> and

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
bulls are mailed miltank is a female and

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.660 
bulls are mailed miltank is a female and
you<00:04:12.150> know<00:04:12.300> cows<00:04:12.600> are<00:04:12.870> all<00:04:13.020> female<00:04:13.290> so<00:04:14.250> in<00:04:14.610> a

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
you know cows are all female so in a

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.340 
you know cows are all female so in a
sense<00:04:15.210> they're<00:04:15.480> practically<00:04:16.020> the<00:04:16.109> same<00:04:16.290> thing

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
sense they're practically the same thing

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.800 
sense they're practically the same thing
in<00:04:16.890> my<00:04:17.070> opinion<00:04:17.460> so<00:04:17.970> I<00:04:18.000> feel<00:04:18.359> that<00:04:18.540> both<00:04:18.780> of

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
in my opinion so I feel that both of

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.960 
in my opinion so I feel that both of
them<00:04:19.109> actually<00:04:19.380> should<00:04:20.070> have<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.549> pre

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
them actually should have a pre

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.670 
them actually should have a pre
evolution<00:04:21.690> of

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
evolution of

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.230 
evolution of
you<00:04:22.889> know<00:04:23.070> a<00:04:23.280> pre<00:04:23.520> evolution<00:04:23.940> that<00:04:24.060> is<00:04:24.180> the

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
you know a pre evolution that is the

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.939 
you know a pre evolution that is the
same<00:04:24.449> thing<00:04:24.479> and<00:04:24.900> will<00:04:25.080> evolve<00:04:25.350> based<00:04:25.680> on

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
same thing and will evolve based on

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.730 
same thing and will evolve based on
gender<00:04:26.310> I<00:04:26.669> don't<00:04:27.090> need<00:04:27.300> miltank<00:04:27.900> or<00:04:28.199> torus<00:04:28.590> or

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
gender I don't need miltank or torus or

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.379 
gender I don't need miltank or torus or
anything<00:04:29.160> to<00:04:29.340> evolve<00:04:29.759> because<00:04:30.210> they're

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
anything to evolve because they're

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.990 
anything to evolve because they're
pretty<00:04:30.690> strong<00:04:30.960> as<00:04:31.169> is<00:04:32.009> Whitney<00:04:32.550> and<00:04:32.729> her

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
pretty strong as is Whitney and her

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.510 
pretty strong as is Whitney and her
miltank<00:04:33.449> okay<00:04:33.840> that<00:04:34.169> thing<00:04:34.410> run<00:04:35.009> right

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
miltank okay that thing run right

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.770 
miltank okay that thing run right
through<00:04:35.759> your<00:04:35.880> team<00:04:36.120> if<00:04:36.300> you're<00:04:36.419> not<00:04:36.600> prepared

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
through your team if you're not prepared

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.770 
through your team if you're not prepared
for<00:04:37.139> it<00:04:37.490> but<00:04:38.490> that<00:04:38.970> is<00:04:39.180> how<00:04:39.330> i<00:04:39.360> feel<00:04:39.720> about

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
for it but that is how i feel about

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.600 
for it but that is how i feel about
miltank<00:04:40.560> i<00:04:40.740> just<00:04:40.949> feel<00:04:41.070> that<00:04:41.100> miltank

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
miltank i just feel that miltank

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.390 
miltank i just feel that miltank
deserves<00:04:42.060> a<00:04:42.240> pre<00:04:42.479> evolution<00:04:42.990> that<00:04:43.680> you<00:04:44.190> know

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
deserves a pre evolution that you know

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.249 
deserves a pre evolution that you know
would<00:04:45.090> have<00:04:45.240> a<00:04:45.270> branch<00:04:45.630> evolution<00:04:46.110> between

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
would have a branch evolution between

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.439 
would have a branch evolution between
male<00:04:46.620> or<00:04:46.770> female<00:04:47.100> to<00:04:47.910> you<00:04:48.180> know<00:04:48.300> between

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
male or female to you know between

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.749 
male or female to you know between
Tauros<00:04:48.990> and<00:04:49.020> miltank<00:04:49.500> and<00:04:49.830> i<00:04:50.400> just<00:04:50.550> feel<00:04:50.729> that

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
Tauros and miltank and i just feel that

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.520 
Tauros and miltank and i just feel that
it<00:04:51.030> will<00:04:51.120> also<00:04:51.210> you<00:04:51.690> know<00:04:51.810> it<00:04:52.050> just<00:04:52.080> makes<00:04:52.350> more

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
it will also you know it just makes more

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.710 
it will also you know it just makes more
sense<00:04:52.830> because<00:04:53.130> you<00:04:53.280> know<00:04:53.430> cows<00:04:53.820> start<00:04:54.300> off<00:04:54.449> as

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
sense because you know cows start off as

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.040 
sense because you know cows start off as
baby<00:04:55.169> calves<00:04:55.500> so<00:04:56.030> it<00:04:57.030> just<00:04:57.270> makes<00:04:57.449> a<00:04:57.660> lot<00:04:57.840> of

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
baby calves so it just makes a lot of

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.370 
baby calves so it just makes a lot of
sense<00:04:58.110> a<00:04:58.560> lot<00:04:59.039> sense<00:04:59.400> a<00:04:59.669> lot<00:05:00.090> more<00:05:00.419> sense<00:05:00.750> to<00:05:01.229> me

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
sense a lot sense a lot more sense to me

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.430 
sense a lot sense a lot more sense to me
if<00:05:01.620> it<00:05:01.800> does<00:05:02.250> if<00:05:02.460> it<00:05:02.610> happens<00:05:02.759> that<00:05:02.970> way<00:05:03.289> so<00:05:04.289> we

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
if it does if it happens that way so we

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.050 
if it does if it happens that way so we
make<00:05:04.620> it<00:05:04.740> to<00:05:04.830> my<00:05:04.949> number<00:05:05.220> one<00:05:05.400> if<00:05:05.639> you<00:05:05.759> couldn't

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
make it to my number one if you couldn't

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.180 
make it to my number one if you couldn't
tell<00:05:06.120> my<00:05:06.630> number<00:05:06.900> one<00:05:07.020> is<00:05:07.199> Dunsparce<00:05:07.830> and<00:05:08.099> it

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
tell my number one is Dunsparce and it

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.770 
tell my number one is Dunsparce and it
will<00:05:08.310> always<00:05:08.550> be<00:05:08.699> done<00:05:09.030> sparse<00:05:09.360> because<00:05:09.630> i

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
will always be done sparse because i

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.450
