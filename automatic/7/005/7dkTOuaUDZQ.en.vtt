 Hi, people here are more faithful and in the video of 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.829
 Today I'm going to prove this makeup is 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.920
 heat comes 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:39.879
 I think it's so financial and that's the 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:43.320
 new movie star wars villain new 7 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:46.839
 which will launch in December of this year and 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.199
 He does not use a makeup on a mask. 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:52.540
 also made as close as possible I 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.989
 I hope you like it or not open 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:01:03.040
 Look, it's very difficult. 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:07.270
 I'm felt weird is then the maximum 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.549
 possible of what is the mark of the 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.770
 character I hope to achieve 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.030
 represent this if you liked not 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.939

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:28.390
 if you like or there is still a 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:31.780
 kiss and until the next beginning happening the 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.940
 one treats the whole face then 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.730
 cell makeup as translucent powder 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.830
 because the clown is oily 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:43.260
 first I make the display format of the 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.260
 mafra and then fills in black 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.110
 these markings design and cut out the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.110
 bottom 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:08.920
 pinto neck of black is to hide it 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:13.620
 the mask is well curved so they chose 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.620
 right side of the center stay well 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:22.609
 the speech also the central part of 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.689
 which is still lighter than the 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:29.689
 lateral trot then I do all the 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:32.709
 deeper drawings the top 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.709
 are many details 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:44.930
 in the middle also the side of the top 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:47.390
 to give the acclaimed then it is cut another 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:52.940
 I make a shade to leave more air 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:56.959
 complete the format of the 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.030
 the brand's chin quotes and in that part 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.920
 underneath it also has some records 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.920
 so do your drawing too 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:14.239
 these traces of the nose is the air outlet 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:16.720
 which the character now breathes to hide 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.280
 the ears do not appear 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.930
 choices a little more this part with a 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.300
 little more black in the parts with more 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.510
 light of mouth and nose to try 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.990
 to neutralize as much as possible and 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.740
 It was like this and I hope you like it. 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.740
 a kiss
