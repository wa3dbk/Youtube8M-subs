00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.790 
servings per day food containing water
is<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.239> second-largest<00:04:12.840> way<00:04:13.320> that<00:04:13.620> you

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
is the second-largest way that you

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.259 
is the second-largest way that you
should<00:04:14.040> be<00:04:14.220> obtaining<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:14.760> correct<00:04:15.030> amount

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
should be obtaining the correct amount

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.000 
should be obtaining the correct amount
of<00:04:15.360> water<00:04:15.600> and<00:04:15.780> as<00:04:16.320> you<00:04:16.440> can<00:04:16.560> see<00:04:16.739> from<00:04:16.859> the

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
of water and as you can see from the

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.880

table<00:04:17.340> at<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.700> right<00:04:17.910> there's<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.840> sample<00:04:19.769> of

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
table at the right there's a sample of

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.190 
table at the right there's a sample of
foods<00:04:20.190> and<00:04:20.459> their<00:04:20.820> percent<00:04:21.239> of<00:04:21.450> water<00:04:21.720> by

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
foods and their percent of water by

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.610 
their weight all the way at the bottom
there<00:04:24.300> you<00:04:24.450> have<00:04:24.600> an<00:04:24.720> example<00:04:25.020> of<00:04:25.260> roasted

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
there you have an example of roasted

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.710 
there you have an example of roasted
chicken<00:04:25.950> which<00:04:26.160> has<00:04:26.340> about<00:04:26.550> 65%<00:04:27.120> of<00:04:27.570> it

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
chicken which has about 65% of it

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.630 
chicken which has about 65% of it
wait<00:04:27.870> being<00:04:28.140> water<00:04:28.380> all<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:29.160> way<00:04:29.280> up<00:04:29.400> to<00:04:29.520> the

top with lettuce being about 95% water

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.240 
top with lettuce being about 95% water
so<00:04:33.180> eating<00:04:33.420> more<00:04:33.810> foods<00:04:34.170> that<00:04:34.470> have<00:04:34.680> a<00:04:34.950> higher

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
so eating more foods that have a higher

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.850 
so eating more foods that have a higher
percentage<00:04:35.280> of<00:04:35.970> water<00:04:36.150> per<00:04:36.630> weight<00:04:36.810> will<00:04:37.590> give
