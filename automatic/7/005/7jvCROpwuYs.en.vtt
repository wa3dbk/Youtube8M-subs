00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hi everyone is 6 67 and we get 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.870
 found for a new video 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.630
 minecraft so today I'm going to you 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.940
 present the novelties beyond the setting 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.799
 1.5 which will come out in the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.940
 next in the next few weeks 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:21.150
 per year so that's it so I'm going 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.640
 start with the trapped chests so 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.949
 the vaults that differentiates 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.609
 other chests by a small trace 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.800
 red around the look and its chests 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.329
 red sends electrical impulses 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.719
 so we can connect them to the red 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.600
 stone and more there are people who 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.860
 look in the trunk more 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.570
 the impulse will be important 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.620
 so here I am alone so the impulse 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.090
 will be 1 so that would activate the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.829
 dispensary that lit the flame 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.410
 it was just to show there is 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.170
 many there is a lot of 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.460
 possibilities especially with the tnt this 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.980
 kind of things 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.449
 the simple crafter is a safe with 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.030
 a hook then the redstone block 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.060
 finally he is there the redstone block 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.010
 he even went themselves 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.310
 features that red stone finally 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.450
 press except who can move so 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.430
 with a piston but precisely he can not 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.320
 not turn off a reston torch on 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.640
 him but underneath unlike a 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.409
 other redstone torch 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:32.520
 so see his kraft is very simple 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.340
 it's easy redstone nef to store from 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.920
 blow and have costs it may not be 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.630
 badly then 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.670
 I will talk about pressure plates 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.520
 which works according to the weight 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.470
 it's a bit heavy but here I am 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.060
 actually explains to you they have they have 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:55.159
 created two pressure plates it's their 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.159
 name there I put times time this date 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.740
 they created pressure plates 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.939
 so who that works according to the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.750
 weight that's what I just said 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.880
 so if we put a cube it lights up the 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.739
 first is stone but to turn on the 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:17.420
 second one takes four 2 3 5 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.420
 so it's been five years 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.220
 So here is sent it lights up 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.810
 now for the 2nd so that in 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:32.240
 iron one always needs one for 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.220
 turn on the first but forty two 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:40.310
 for the second so there I will not 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:43.220
 to show you how nice it can be for 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.640
 adventure maps they mostly did this 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:51.770
 updated in the red stone so the 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:54.080
 craft is simple it is for the plate 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.170
 in gold these two gold ingots and for the 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.030
 iron plate these two ingots to do 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.180
 then we move on to what I call 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:09.830
 solar panels then the panels 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:13.280
 solar it was then they send 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.690
 of an electrical impulse that 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.860
 depends on the position of the sun 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:23.390
 see there so I put to them my leu and 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.320
 here I put the day so early 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.620
 at dawn 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.430
 it lit the first torch finally the 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.650
 first at the amp 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.540
 but the second came on but at 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.280
 after a while then the sun 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.670
 the time the sun comes up 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.170
 So here is the craft these three halves 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.360
 wooden slab 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.380
 three new new item that I'm going 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.900
 show you after and three glasses 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.890
 then we go to the funnel 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.500
 the funnel which is a little bit buggy 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:56.630
 in the in in the inventory that 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.230
 so I'll show if we drop a 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.200
 object on it is sucked up and they 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.280
 fall into 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.110
 in the trunk example that we put in 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:15.550
 below in the east in the oven 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:19.030
 his simple crafter c5 rock sound +1 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.859
 chest then then the one who ask me 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.760
 the most trouble is the comparator 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:27.370
 of redstone that I did not quite understand the 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.380
 interest but finally short as his name 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.180
 the indicated will compare the circuits of 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.500
 redstone 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.360
 so I 'm going to take a torch and the 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.550
 red stone 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.400
 so what comes in here is the 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.960
 circuit to whoever goes there this is the 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:50.050
 circuit b and that's the circuit it's 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:56.650
 if the circuit is longer than the 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:05:02.080
 circuit b it does not go that puts him but 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:04.510
 on the other hand if the circuit aa and more 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.510
 short or equal to the circuit b it goes 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.330
 to light up here on the other hand it is still 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.400
 a bit buggy since we can turn on the 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.910
 third torch but it's useless 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.380
 for the moment 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.670
 finally, I did not find what it was 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:20.540
 served 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:24.370
 let's go crafts and three rocks three 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:27.440
 slices of redstone and the new item 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.120
 after even a small change in 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:35.060
 inventory 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:42.050
 so if I if we keep the right click on 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:45.770
 a stack and that we tell him separates it 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.780
 will actually separate it from the number of cases 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:57.170
 what we flew over with the mouse 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:06:00.290
 here she is a two-three so 30.64 / 4 it 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.370
 well done to all 16 and submit its 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:06.780
 double left click 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:09.630
 so here are the next ones 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.560
 but the next inventions are in 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.560
 the nether 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.800
 the greatest invention in the air 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:27.509
 it's the quartz so the new item the 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.880
 quartz that is in the natural state 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:41.009
 on the other hand it is necessary to recreate a map in 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:43.889
 1.5 to my letting go 0 here you are 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:45.270
 see and we win xp also have not 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:50.010
 we need to cook the drop 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:54.660
 directly like that and a thousand the decor 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:07:00.949
 you are served because now the year 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:02.840
 the rack can be cooked and it gives 

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:05.130
 broth breeders 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.080
 so there is more need to find 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:11.639
 dungeons to end of the Rich 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:12.270
 simply leather that is found here 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:16.259
 nezzar bricks 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:18.479
 just leather of the year zarac d'en 

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:20.810
 to have four to make a block where I 

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:20.810
 will show you 

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:28.710
 I find 

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:28.710
 but game mode 1 

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:39.070
 here I have not prepared his share against 

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:42.900
 here we still need a way there 

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:46.200
 we need four to create so 

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:51.880
 the rich year we already know 

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:54.010
 so in cubes that's so thank you 

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:56.140
 have listened to me I tell you see you soon 

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:58.090
 for new videos on minecraft 

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.530
 do not forget to love this video if 

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.700
 you loved it and subscribe to 

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:03.810
