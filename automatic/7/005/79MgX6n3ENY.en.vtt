00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:09.360
 deejay calls this Italy radio deejay 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.219
 of the historical dj a mechanism which 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.960
 we insert three songs from time to time 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.580
 that sometimes have a connection between them 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.070
 and sometimes they don't have it in this case 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.940
 the bond was there but it was a bit difficult 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.439
 actually locate a small one 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.630
 route we built for 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.670
 introduce the law more effectively 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.650
 our guest then the first song 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.630
 it was from chaka khan and the title was i'm 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.050
 every woman I represent all the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.029
 women 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.180
 the second was bryan adams and he will say 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.370
 I will still run for a moment 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.860
 racing and the third of yesterday jacques his 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.210
 was in panne state of mind and that is one 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.550
 song dedicated to new york 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.620
 so there is a woman running that 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.980
 he was running in new york and he is stranger valeria 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.200
 hello hello valeria i never have that 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.340
 make it such a michael presentation 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.960
 paris in those short, a beautiful song I 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.780
 I understand the choir and listening to music 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.239
 sorry I always wear absolutely myself 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.770
 I always listen to music when some 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.580
 time even when I do repeated 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.930
 yes even yes yes because it is beautiful me 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.250
 pass but picanto helps me finish all 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.369
 training given that ours are 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.100
 very long workouts so it helps me 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.170
 end well that singer you 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.360
 gives the bust problems but look at me 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.640
 I listen more than anything else to the songs I hear 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.290
 the radio which I then unload so I don't have 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.579
 I like my favorite singer 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:33.180
 so much titanium direct felt indeed 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.189
 for the French and then the linen one for 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.070
 on the very sky even on the phone like 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.200
 ringtone as xfactor then saw that 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.710
 even the acronym of ease is certainly true 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.509
 of course 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.250
 no I meant that the story of valeria 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.780
 it is a story that may please 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.600
 regardless even of people 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.360
 sedentary because there is something much 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.640
 curious and even a little I don't say 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.520
 fairy tale but it's a good story here is the 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.159
 tell you yes we say that mine 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.360
 surely it is definitely a journey 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.610
 not normal because I started 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.710
 practically choir for a lifetime though 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.440
 I practically started doing it 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.480
 seriously so at your own tiered 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.480
 tall 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.810
 35 years since a couple of years a year two yes 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.730
 exact oh well I think now more or less 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.440
 my story more or less broad lines yes 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.090
 I know I am that they know it well 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.069
 fans of the sector but the 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.629
 great public surely not because of 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.670
 marathon may only know those 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.620
 that break the balls like me are already of 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.690
 moral or maybe stefano baldini who has 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.739
 won the Olympics 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.049
 this is our little bit 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.970
 vegetable garden you reached 35 years old a 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.160
 make this leap of crazy qualities 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.950
 going from amateur athlete I own 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.640
 more in place but you know Italian promise me 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.930
 as an Italian and the representative 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.060
 Italian Olympic Games where it arrived 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.269
 first or second among the Europeans we create 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.700
 fourth of Parma friends 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:58.220
 in front of me since yesterday has arrived eighth 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.980
 yes yes eighth absolute octave of the ipi 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.859
 what company did you do 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.810
 this gap is practically right 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.519
 as I said before I suffer from one 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.120
 congenital dysfunction of the red blood cell 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.220
 which is called spero cytosine la nissa Ã¨ 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.910
 the cause of blood cell destruction 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.130
 red 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.200
 I say broad lines because I'm not at 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.549
 specifically enter you not being 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.410
 but a doctor by now the only exact one 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.109
 therefore the spleen destroys the globules 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.359
 red and leads to an anemia situation 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.880
 practically perennial so I always have 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.500
 course with hematocrit demo value 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.019
 china very low so there is a 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.959
 marathon runner who has anemia is not that 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.419
 both just friends and rare then 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.310
 in 2003 without gasoline foundation but 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:45.349
 fundamentally yes though for me it was the 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.750
 normal situation so it's not that there 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:51.370
 I was just never meaning I was tired not 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.739
 I certainly couldn't express myself 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.430
 in short, however, let's say at great levels 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:59.650
 I had 12 41 in the marathon and 114 in the 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.879
 half was not so bad either 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.310
 then what happened 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.890
 and then it happened that in 2010 it was 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.110
 really bad to the point I did 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.659
 just fatigue in everyday life since 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.959
 even sami from the chair then after 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:15.579
 having done a thousand tests they found that 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:19.239
 my mills had grown in a manner 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:22.000
 disproportionate 26 cm of practically nice 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.710
 he came under my navel and me 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.169
 destroys red variables indeed it is 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.620
 been hospitalized with a 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.030
 then the value of said hemoglobin 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.190
 very low indeed they wanted to do me 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.860
 transfusions then sum in the end not me 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.510
 they did it but I got a drip on an IV 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.000
 to pull up a little 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.160
 absolute rest because it is not me 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.110
 they had absolutely forbidden to do 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.880
 any kind of activity and then seen 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.160
 that the mass so big my closed 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.560
 also a part of the intestine 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.289
 that is, removal was required 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.880
 who took the mind what 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:04.990
 involves removing the spleen in a 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:06.789
 being a human being and then ok makes me 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.849
 bad the mixture of hurts friendship is 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.500
 a mass more harm if I never do 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:13.150
 when the heart is no longer the problem 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.130
 my face must remain a 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.669
 problem but you can live though 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.669
 of course 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.010
 we eat human beings inside a 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.010
 sandwich that of the handcuffs in Palermo 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:29.290
 for a week, however, too disgusting 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.960
 live without it 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:34.180
 yes surely I had to make gods 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.080
 vaccines for which logically the spleen in 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.710
 organ 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.940
 yes therefore it also defends you from the 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.710
 infections 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.140
 this one especially during 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.820
 childhood an adult we say 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.240
 which is not so necessary had had 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:51.820
 who gave it let's say let's say 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:54.390
 and agrees that without a spleen instead 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:57.250
 costa tiri came out more image then me 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:59.380
 no I think I had also stopped 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.000
 to make competition I had phoned to 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.850
 president of my team the runner 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.590
 foxish team 99 saying look at me 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.510
 I'll just do some direct like that for 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.420
 have fun but the competitive spirit I stop 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:13.270
 because I worked young children anyway 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:16.030
 I could not go on anymore and 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.010
 then slowly recovered with mi anyway 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.510
 I remember doing trails because 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.420
 I also like the south lane a lot 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:25.150
 among others of the mountain with itself 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:30.790
 mountain trails therefore without having 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:33.340
 the anxiety of the swan guarantees tips that 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:36.550
 I always enjoyed myself 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.530
 do no because I always say that 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.900
 I quit I wanted to stop need 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.700
 train but I don't say why the race 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.750
 for me too much I like it 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.820
 lot 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.860
 I lose you a second oar on account of it 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:51.460
 we do after this song that the 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:53.669
 last servile director 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.669
 no no
