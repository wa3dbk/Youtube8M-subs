00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
hair where I wanted it so in this case i

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.280 
hair where I wanted it so in this case i
smushed<00:02:01.119> it<00:02:01.360> at<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:02.080> very<00:02:02.350> bottom<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:04.020> then<00:02:05.020> I

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
smushed it at the very bottom and then I

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.240 
smushed it at the very bottom and then I
took<00:02:05.409> a<00:02:06.130> bobby<00:02:06.640> pin<00:02:06.790> or<00:02:07.270> hairpin<00:02:08.229> and<00:02:08.500> I<00:02:09.009> just

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
took a bobby pin or hairpin and I just

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.699 
took a bobby pin or hairpin and I just
intertwined<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.450> hair<00:02:10.750> so<00:02:11.200> it<00:02:11.319> would<00:02:11.440> stay

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
intertwined the hair so it would stay

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.979 
intertwined the hair so it would stay
and<00:02:12.040> I<00:02:12.160> use<00:02:12.430> maybe<00:02:12.850> like<00:02:13.120> three<00:02:13.420> or<00:02:13.510> four<00:02:13.569> pins

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
and I use maybe like three or four pins

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.380 
and I use maybe like three or four pins
in<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.260> back<00:02:14.470> so<00:02:15.190> something<00:02:15.640> very<00:02:15.819> loose<00:02:16.150> so

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
in the back so something very loose so

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.440 
in the back so something very loose so
it<00:02:16.420> doesn't<00:02:16.870> look<00:02:17.050> too<00:02:17.440> man<00:02:18.069> it<00:02:18.250> down<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:18.880> then

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
it doesn't look too man it down and then

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.930 
it doesn't look too man it down and then
I<00:02:19.750> just<00:02:19.810> kind<00:02:20.170> of<00:02:20.380> pushed<00:02:21.250> my<00:02:21.459> hair<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.910> the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
I just kind of pushed my hair to the

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.820 
I just kind of pushed my hair to the
front<00:02:22.269> so<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.569> would<00:02:22.720> look<00:02:22.750> more<00:02:23.170> like<00:02:23.440> a<00:02:23.500> bob

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
front so it would look more like a bob

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.050 
front so it would look more like a bob
and<00:02:24.250> then<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:24.790> left<00:02:25.030> these<00:02:25.300> side<00:02:25.600> pieces<00:02:26.040> down

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
and then I left these side pieces down

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.860 
and then I left these side pieces down
to<00:02:28.060> give<00:02:28.900> that<00:02:29.110> illusion<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:33.970> if<00:02:34.239> you're<00:02:34.450> kind
