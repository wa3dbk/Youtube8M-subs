00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
this gigantic Alice we made this dress

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.960 
this gigantic Alice we made this dress
in<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.900> couple<00:02:13.230> different<00:02:13.350> scales<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.340> play

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
in a couple different scales to play

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.570 
in a couple different scales to play
with<00:02:15.470> for<00:02:16.470> Alice<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.069> then<00:02:17.160> they<00:02:17.280> made<00:02:17.459> the

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
with for Alice and then they made the

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.000 
with for Alice and then they made the
curtains<00:02:18.000> in<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.239> bigger<00:02:18.480> wider<00:02:18.810> stripe<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.650> to

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
curtains in a bigger wider stripe to to

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.009 
curtains in a bigger wider stripe to to
play<00:02:20.160> with<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.519> scale<00:02:21.150> of<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.450> curtains<00:02:21.810> on<00:02:21.989> a

play with the scale of the curtains on a
bigger<00:02:22.590> person<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.370> smaller<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.050> a

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
bigger person to smaller so this is a

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.140 
bigger person to smaller so this is a
sketch<00:02:25.500> for<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:25.950> costume<00:02:26.519> it's<00:02:26.730> an<00:02:26.790> early

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
sketch for this costume it's an early

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.690 
sketch for this costume it's an early
version<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.110> it's<00:02:28.260> close<00:02:29.130> but<00:02:29.550> not

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
version of it and it's close but not

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.569 
version of it and it's close but not
exactly<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:30.829> this<00:02:31.829> is<00:02:32.010> one<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.250> the

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
exactly that this is one of the

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.850 
exactly that this is one of the
preliminary<00:02:32.820> sketches<00:02:33.570> for<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.260> Red<00:02:34.470> Queen

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
preliminary sketches for the Red Queen

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.670 
preliminary sketches for the Red Queen
we<00:02:35.700> had<00:02:35.880> a<00:02:35.910> lot<00:02:36.209> of<00:02:36.239> exercises<00:02:37.079> with<00:02:37.500> her

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
we had a lot of exercises with her

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.830 
we had a lot of exercises with her
costume<00:02:38.400> because<00:02:38.579> we<00:02:38.910> played<00:02:39.180> with<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.510> scale

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
costume because we played with the scale

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.930 
costume because we played with the scale
of<00:02:39.870> her<00:02:40.200> head<00:02:40.440> her<00:02:40.590> head<00:02:40.799> is<00:02:40.920> technically<00:02:41.610> many

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
of her head her head is technically many

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.880 
of her head her head is technically many
different<00:02:42.420> sizes<00:02:42.600> in<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.110> movie<00:02:43.440> so<00:02:43.650> we<00:02:43.769> were

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
different sizes in the movie so we were

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.650 
different sizes in the movie so we were
trying<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.250> work<00:02:44.459> out<00:02:44.670> what<00:02:44.910> was<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.390> best

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
trying to work out what was the best

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.449 
trying to work out what was the best
sort<00:02:45.959> of<00:02:46.019> approach<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.709> costume<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.310> this

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
sort of approach to the costume and this

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.270 
sort of approach to the costume and this
was<00:02:47.640> an<00:02:47.760> early<00:02:48.150> version<00:02:48.440> it's<00:02:49.440> fairly<00:02:49.829> close

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
was an early version it's fairly close

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.310 
was an early version it's fairly close
but<00:02:50.670> we<00:02:50.790> ultimately<00:02:51.000> ended<00:02:51.420> up<00:02:51.810> changing<00:02:52.079> the

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
but we ultimately ended up changing the

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.920 
but we ultimately ended up changing the
neck<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.010> costume<00:02:53.670> because<00:02:54.269> her<00:02:54.630> collar

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
neck of the costume because her collar

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.500 
neck of the costume because her collar
needed<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.530> come<00:02:55.739> up<00:02:55.769> like<00:02:56.100> this<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.850> divide

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
needed to come up like this and divide

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.930 
needed to come up like this and divide
her<00:02:58.079> neck<00:02:58.320> so<00:02:58.620> she<00:02:58.709> actually<00:02:59.100> had<00:02:59.549> a<00:02:59.579> neck

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
her neck so she actually had a neck

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.759 
her neck so she actually had a neck
otherwise<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:00.959> starts<00:03:01.290> looking<00:03:01.410> like<00:03:01.590> a

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
otherwise it starts looking like a

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.069 
otherwise it starts looking like a
gigantic<00:03:02.310> head<00:03:02.760> just<00:03:03.000> sitting<00:03:03.359> on<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.510> little

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079

gigantic head just sitting on a little

body we did this black outline here to

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.680 
body we did this black outline here to
give<00:03:07.829> her<00:03:07.950> even<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.370> more<00:03:08.609> kind<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:09.030> wasp<00:03:09.269> like

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
give her even a more kind of wasp like

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.960 
give her even a more kind of wasp like
