00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:51.210 

okay<00:05:38.289> oh<00:05:41.819> there<00:05:42.819> she<00:05:43.120> goes<00:05:48.120> but<00:05:49.120> that's<00:05:49.360> it<00:05:50.220> the

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
okay oh there she goes but that's it the

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.270 
okay oh there she goes but that's it the
contours<00:05:51.910> to<00:05:51.940> your<00:05:52.240> system<00:05:52.900> you<00:05:53.830> can<00:05:54.039> take

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
contours to your system you can take

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:04.339 
contours to your system you can take
these<00:05:54.520> modules<00:05:54.880> apart<00:06:00.330> take<00:06:01.330> them<00:06:01.509> apart<00:06:02.550> and

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:04.349 
these modules apart take them apart and

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:06.659 
these modules apart take them apart and
later<00:06:05.349> on<00:06:05.620> I<00:06:05.650> guess<00:06:06.009> they're<00:06:06.220> going<00:06:06.370> to<00:06:06.430> have<00:06:06.639> a

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
later on I guess they're going to have a

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:11.400 
later on I guess they're going to have a
SD<00:06:07.539> card<00:06:08.940> reader<00:06:09.940> you<00:06:10.300> can<00:06:10.330> attach<00:06:10.810> to<00:06:10.840> here

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
SD card reader you can attach to here

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:23.210 
SD card reader you can attach to here
like<00:06:11.620> this<00:06:18.419> this<00:06:19.419> is<00:06:19.659> going<00:06:19.840> to<00:06:19.900> be<00:06:20.050> so<00:06:20.259> cool

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.120 

but<00:06:24.220> as<00:06:24.610> soon<00:06:24.849> as<00:06:25.000> i<00:06:25.120> get<00:06:25.180> my<00:06:25.330> ps3<00:06:25.840> i'll<00:06:26.440> do<00:06:26.740> an

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.130 
but as soon as i get my ps3 i'll do an

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.580 
but as soon as i get my ps3 i'll do an
unboxing<00:06:27.370> to<00:06:28.000> that<00:06:28.240> and<00:06:28.690> i<00:06:29.699> will<00:06:30.699> show<00:06:31.030> you

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
unboxing to that and i will show you

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:37.289 
unboxing to that and i will show you
what<00:06:32.590> this<00:06:32.800> looks<00:06:32.860> like<00:06:33.280> on<00:06:33.639> there<00:06:34.289> okay
