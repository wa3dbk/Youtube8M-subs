00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.160 
ctr360 maestri elite or regular whatever
you<00:00:13.920> want<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.130> call<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.750> the<00:00:15.750> Mizuno

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
you want to call it and the Mizuno

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.670 
you want to call it and the Mizuno
supersonic<00:00:16.920> wave<00:00:17.130> -<00:00:17.779> now<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:19.500> might<00:00:19.650> be

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
supersonic wave - now you might be

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.950 
supersonic wave - now you might be
asking<00:00:20.039> why<00:00:20.190> am<00:00:20.280> i<00:00:20.369> comparing<00:00:20.760> these<00:00:21.000> two<00:00:21.210> the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
asking why am i comparing these two the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.330 
asking why am i comparing these two the
reason<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.289> am<00:00:22.410> comparing<00:00:22.830> them<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.190> because

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
reason I am comparing them is because

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.700 
reason I am comparing them is because
they're<00:00:23.640> really<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.780> only<00:00:24.960> two<00:00:25.230> boots<00:00:25.500> that

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
they're really the only two boots that

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.920 
they're really the only two boots that
implement<00:00:26.310> um<00:00:27.140> memory<00:00:28.140> foam<00:00:28.440> in<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:29.039> upper<00:00:29.369> as

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
implement um memory foam in the upper as

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.049 
implement um memory foam in the upper as
like<00:00:30.930> kind<00:00:31.350> of<00:00:31.440> a<00:00:31.529> control<00:00:32.009> element<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.759> guess

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
like kind of a control element I guess

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.290 
like kind of a control element I guess
you<00:00:33.210> could<00:00:33.359> call<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.719> right<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.250> just<00:00:35.969> want

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
you could call it right so I just want

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.790 
you could call it right so I just want
to<00:00:36.390> talk<00:00:36.479> a<00:00:36.539> little<00:00:36.749> bit<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.229> little<00:00:37.379> bit<00:00:37.620> about

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
to talk a little bit a little bit about

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.509 
to talk a little bit a little bit about
how<00:00:38.010> each<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.519> these<00:00:38.789> shoes<00:00:38.999> implements<00:00:39.569> a

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:40.519 
how each of these shoes implements a

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.329 
how each of these shoes implements a
memory<00:00:41.519> foam<00:00:41.899> and<00:00:42.899> if<00:00:43.199> it<00:00:43.350> does<00:00:43.499> in<00:00:43.710> fact<00:00:43.769> work

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
memory foam and if it does in fact work

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:45.079 
memory foam and if it does in fact work
or<00:00:44.699> not

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:45.089 
or not

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.009 
or not
now<00:00:46.069> the<00:00:47.069> ctr360<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.359> made<00:00:48.569> of<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.780> king

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
now the ctr360 is made of a king

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:51.349 
now the ctr360 is made of a king
primarily<00:00:49.499> Kangol<00:00:49.979> it<00:00:50.249> is<00:00:50.399> kangalite<00:00:50.969> upper

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359 
primarily Kangol it is kangalite upper

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:54.559 
primarily Kangol it is kangalite upper
which<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.319> nike<00:00:52.710> synthetic<00:00:53.280> upper<00:00:53.670> that's

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:54.569 
which is nike synthetic upper that's

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:57.459 
which is nike synthetic upper that's
basically<00:00:55.019> supposed<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.530> mimic<00:00:56.069> the<00:00:56.579> feel<00:00:56.879> of

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
basically supposed to mimic the feel of

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.139 
basically supposed to mimic the feel of
kangaroo<00:00:58.469> leather<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.639> actually<00:00:59.819> does<00:01:00.120> a

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
kangaroo leather and it actually does a

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.619 
kangaroo leather and it actually does a
pretty<00:01:00.449> good<00:01:00.539> job<00:01:00.799> um<00:01:02.149> here<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.179> guys<00:01:03.389> see<00:01:03.600> I

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
pretty good job um here you guys see I

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.190 
pretty good job um here you guys see I
have<00:01:03.869> the<00:01:03.989> elite<00:01:04.260> version<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> ctr360<00:01:06.200> but

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
have the elite version of the ctr360 but

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.080 
have the elite version of the ctr360 but
the<00:01:07.320> same<00:01:07.530> upper<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.160> on<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.520> version<00:01:08.790> as

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
the same upper is on that version as

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.060 
the same upper is on that version as
well<00:01:09.120> as<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.540> regular<00:01:09.840> version<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.410> there's

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
well as the regular version so there's

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.310 
well as the regular version so there's
no<00:01:11.250> difference<00:01:11.610> at<00:01:11.760> all<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.210> terms<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.630> upper

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.100 

the<00:01:16.320> kangalite<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.920> very<00:01:17.130> soft<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:18.020> it's<00:01:19.020> not

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
the kangalite is very soft and it's not

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.050 
the kangalite is very soft and it's not
exactly<00:01:19.650> kangaroo<00:01:20.100> leather<00:01:20.250> but<00:01:20.550> it's<00:01:20.700> pretty

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
exactly kangaroo leather but it's pretty

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.390 
exactly kangaroo leather but it's pretty
close<00:01:21.390> for<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:22.320> synthetic<00:01:22.800> and<00:01:23.160> it's<00:01:23.250> probably

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
close for a synthetic and it's probably

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.790 
close for a synthetic and it's probably
the<00:01:23.610> best<00:01:23.760> synthetic<00:01:24.480> leather<00:01:25.020> material<00:01:25.650> that

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
the best synthetic leather material that

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.930 
the best synthetic leather material that
you<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:26.040> get<00:01:27.620> these<00:01:28.620> two<00:01:28.860> big<00:01:29.160> pads<00:01:29.550> you<00:01:29.760> see

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
you can get these two big pads you see

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.690 
you can get these two big pads you see
here<00:01:30.270> are<00:01:30.740> where<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.950> memory<00:01:32.250> foam<00:01:32.490> is

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
here are where the memory foam is

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.210 
here are where the memory foam is
implemented<00:01:33.410> and<00:01:34.410> as<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.710> can<00:01:34.830> see<00:01:35.010> if<00:01:35.130> you

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
implemented and as you can see if you

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.730 
implemented and as you can see if you
can<00:01:35.370> see<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.870> love<00:01:36.870> it's<00:01:37.110> actually<00:01:37.410> a<00:01:37.470> pretty

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
can see this love it's actually a pretty

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.970 
can see this love it's actually a pretty
thick<00:01:38.330> piece<00:01:39.330> of<00:01:39.360> memory<00:01:39.810> foam<00:01:40.050> here<00:01:40.650> these

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
thick piece of memory foam here these

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.480 
thick piece of memory foam here these
two<00:01:41.190> triangles<00:01:42.500> it's<00:01:43.500> pretty<00:01:43.740> thick<00:01:43.950> piece<00:01:44.460> of

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
two triangles it's pretty thick piece of

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.280 
two triangles it's pretty thick piece of
memory<00:01:44.850> foam<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.420> when<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.750> do<00:01:45.870> touch<00:01:46.080> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
memory foam so when you do touch the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.890 
memory foam so when you do touch the
ball<00:01:46.470> there<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.210> it<00:01:48.210> definitely<00:01:48.690> does

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
ball there it is it definitely does

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.600 
ball there it is it definitely does
dampen<00:01:49.530> they<00:01:49.890> were<00:01:49.950> touching<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.430> ball

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
dampen they were touching the ball

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.160 
dampen they were touching the ball
that's<00:01:50.940> basically<00:01:51.300> the<00:01:51.480> idea<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.900> memory

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
that's basically the idea of the memory

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.220 
that's basically the idea of the memory
foam<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:53.190> to<00:01:53.460> really<00:01:53.670> provide<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.510> extra

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
foam is to really provide that extra

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.740 
foam is to really provide that extra
cushion<00:01:55.740> on<00:01:55.980> the<00:01:56.010> ball<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.550> I<00:01:57.090> really<00:01:57.390> do<00:01:57.540> feel

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
cushion on the ball and I really do feel

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.380 
cushion on the ball and I really do feel
like<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.170> does<00:01:58.380> help<00:01:58.770> your<00:01:59.010> touch<00:01:59.190> I<00:01:59.520> think<00:02:00.270> it

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
like it does help your touch I think it

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.770 
like it does help your touch I think it
is<00:02:01.380> thick<00:02:01.800> enough<00:02:01.830> and<00:02:02.250> covers<00:02:03.210> enough<00:02:03.420> area

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
is thick enough and covers enough area

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.600 
is thick enough and covers enough area
where<00:02:04.650> that<00:02:04.740> if<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:04.950> are<00:02:05.100> going<00:02:05.220> to<00:02:05.310> take<00:02:05.460> the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
where that if you are going to take the

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.680 
where that if you are going to take the
ball<00:02:05.729> down<00:02:05.940> from<00:02:06.150> the<00:02:06.270> air

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
ball down from the air

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.830

this<00:02:07.320> will<00:02:07.530> dampen<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.399> ball<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:09.239> impact<00:02:09.629> of

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
this will dampen the ball the impact of

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.849 
this will dampen the ball the impact of
the<00:02:09.989> ball<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.500> your<00:02:11.280> foot<00:02:11.549> a<00:02:12.709> fair<00:02:13.709> amount

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:13.859 
the ball and your foot a fair amount

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:15.920 
the ball and your foot a fair amount
that<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.489> will<00:02:14.700> definitely<00:02:15.209> improve<00:02:15.780> your

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
that it will definitely improve your

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:16.530 
that it will definitely improve your

touch

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.330

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
like if you if you had if you stood

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.649 
like if you if you had if you stood
there<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.849> let<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.120> ball<00:02:22.239> hit<00:02:22.299> your<00:02:22.510> foot

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.190 
with this shoe I can guarantee you that
would<00:02:24.730> dampen<00:02:24.939> a<00:02:25.209> lot<00:02:25.390> less<00:02:25.629> than<00:02:25.810> if<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.049> are

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
would dampen a lot less than if you are

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.089 
would dampen a lot less than if you are
like<00:02:26.379> a<00:02:26.409> thin<00:02:26.709> synthetic<00:02:27.280> like<00:02:27.459> an<00:02:27.579> adizero<00:02:28.079> so

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
like a thin synthetic like an adizero so

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.490 
like a thin synthetic like an adizero so
it<00:02:30.099> definitely<00:02:30.819> does<00:02:31.000> work<00:02:31.239> and<00:02:31.510> I'm

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
it definitely does work and I'm

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.850 
it definitely does work and I'm
definitely<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.040> fan<00:02:33.310> of<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.610> CTR<00:02:34.409> the<00:02:35.409> Musial

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
not exactly sure how many you know did

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.619 
not exactly sure how many you know did
it<00:02:59.139> but<00:03:00.099> if<00:03:00.220> you<00:03:00.280> can<00:03:00.459> eat<00:03:00.639> its<00:03:00.909> you<00:03:01.420> can't

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
it but if you can eat its you can't

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.430 
it but if you can eat its you can't
really<00:03:01.780> see<00:03:02.079> but<00:03:03.060> on<00:03:04.060> this<00:03:04.510> out<00:03:04.750> step<00:03:05.109> out<00:03:05.290> step

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
really see but on this out step out step

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.119 
really see but on this out step out step
so<00:03:05.920> from<00:03:06.400> here<00:03:06.760> all<00:03:06.909> the<00:03:07.030> way<00:03:07.299> around<00:03:07.950> then<00:03:08.950> you

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
so from here all the way around then you

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.849 
so from here all the way around then you
see<00:03:09.280> this<00:03:09.459> seam<00:03:09.849> that<00:03:09.879> goes<00:03:10.359> right<00:03:10.720> here<00:03:10.859> to

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
see this seam that goes right here to

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.940 
see this seam that goes right here to
there<00:03:12.040> here's<00:03:12.849> where<00:03:13.090> there<00:03:13.299> would<00:03:13.389> be<00:03:13.420> thin

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
there here's where there would be thin

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.580 
there here's where there would be thin
memory<00:03:14.950> foam<00:03:15.190> so<00:03:16.000> every<00:03:16.299> single<00:03:16.659> part<00:03:17.440> of<00:03:17.500> the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
memory foam so every single part of the

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.680 
memory foam so every single part of the
boot<00:03:17.769> here<00:03:17.920> is<00:03:18.700> very<00:03:18.970> thin<00:03:19.299> memory<00:03:19.690> foam<00:03:19.959> and

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
boot here is very thin memory foam and

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.800 
boot here is very thin memory foam and
it<00:03:22.690> provides<00:03:23.019> just<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.410> little<00:03:23.709> bit<00:03:23.799> of<00:03:23.889> cushion

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
it provides just a little bit of cushion

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.750 
it provides just a little bit of cushion
for<00:03:26.010> basically<00:03:27.010> what<00:03:27.220> means<00:03:27.400> you<00:03:27.459> know<00:03:27.549> did

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
for basically what means you know did

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.979 
for basically what means you know did
with<00:03:27.879> this<00:03:28.000> boot<00:03:28.150> is<00:03:28.299> create<00:03:28.660> a<00:03:28.720> boot<00:03:28.959> that's

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
with this boot is create a boot that's

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.650 
with this boot is create a boot that's
supposed<00:03:29.410> to<00:03:29.500> be<00:03:29.590> good<00:03:29.709> for<00:03:29.889> dribbling<00:03:30.480> not<00:03:31.480> so

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
supposed to be good for dribbling not so

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.659 
supposed to be good for dribbling not so
much<00:03:31.810> for<00:03:32.049> touch<00:03:32.260> like<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.680> CCR<00:03:33.099> is<00:03:33.129> marketed

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669 
much for touch like the CCR is marketed

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:36.479 
much for touch like the CCR is marketed
as<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:34.120> then<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.139> instep<00:03:35.530> here<00:03:35.829> which<00:03:36.220> goes

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
as and then the instep here which goes

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.000 
as and then the instep here which goes
from<00:03:36.849> the<00:03:37.410> edge<00:03:38.410> of<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.650> Meuse<00:03:38.769> you<00:03:38.889> know

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
from the edge of the Meuse you know

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.629 
from the edge of the Meuse you know
label<00:03:39.459> logo<00:03:40.449> to<00:03:41.440> this<00:03:41.620> stitch<00:03:41.889> and<00:03:42.190> then<00:03:42.370> on

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
label logo to this stitch and then on

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.240 
label logo to this stitch and then on
this<00:03:42.910> side<00:03:43.180> of<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.480> stitch<00:03:43.720> you<00:03:44.049> can<00:03:44.799> see<00:03:45.099> that

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
this side of the stitch you can see that

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.250 
this side of the stitch you can see that
there's<00:03:45.430> thicker<00:03:45.940> padding<00:03:46.569> it's<00:03:46.930> thicker

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
there's thicker padding it's thicker

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.930 
there's thicker padding it's thicker
padded<00:03:47.680> leather<00:03:47.769> because<00:03:48.400> there's<00:03:48.669> also<00:03:48.790> a

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
padded leather because there's also a

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.080 
padded leather because there's also a
thicker<00:03:49.269> memory<00:03:49.870> foam<00:03:50.139> inside<00:03:50.470> of<00:03:50.680> this<00:03:51.090> in

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
thicker memory foam inside of this in

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.210 
thicker memory foam inside of this in
between<00:03:52.150> these<00:03:52.629> stitches<00:03:53.049> so<00:03:53.829> you<00:03:53.889> have<00:03:54.190> a

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
between these stitches so you have a

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.089 
between these stitches so you have a
little<00:03:54.549> bit<00:03:54.669> more<00:03:54.760> padding<00:03:55.000> on<00:03:55.299> the<00:03:55.419> instep<00:03:56.099> so

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
little bit more padding on the instep so

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.309 
little bit more padding on the instep so
basically<00:03:57.489> you're<00:03:57.940> getting<00:03:58.060> a<00:03:58.419> thinner<00:03:58.870> out

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
basically you're getting a thinner out

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.699 
basically you're getting a thinner out
step<00:03:59.919> out<00:04:00.220> step<00:04:01.090> for<00:04:01.419> dribbling<00:04:01.810> and<00:04:01.989> thicker

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
step out step for dribbling and thicker

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.500 
step out step for dribbling and thicker
instep<00:04:03.220> for<00:04:03.459> a<00:04:03.489> little<00:04:03.730> bit<00:04:03.819> of<00:04:03.909> more<00:04:04.060> control

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
instep for a little bit of more control

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.509 
instep for a little bit of more control
when<00:04:04.690> touching<00:04:05.109> the<00:04:05.199> ball<00:04:05.349> and<00:04:05.500> stuff<00:04:05.709> and

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
when touching the ball and stuff and

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.000 
when touching the ball and stuff and
does<00:04:06.760> it<00:04:06.879> work<00:04:07.000> yes<00:04:07.389> it<00:04:07.419> does<00:04:07.810> work<00:04:08.049> does<00:04:08.889> it

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
does it work yes it does work does it

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.399

feel too far off kangaroo leather not a

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:12.930 
feel too far off kangaroo leather not a
whole<00:04:11.709> lot<00:04:11.919> but<00:04:12.129> you<00:04:12.190> can<00:04:12.280> tell<00:04:12.639> there's<00:04:12.849> the

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
whole lot but you can tell there's the

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.089 
whole lot but you can tell there's the
difference<00:04:13.269> there<00:04:13.449> and<00:04:14.139> overall<00:04:14.590> these<00:04:14.829> shoes

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
difference there and overall these shoes

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:16.849 
difference there and overall these shoes
both<00:04:15.340> do<00:04:15.519> a<00:04:15.549> really<00:04:16.060> good<00:04:16.209> job<00:04:16.269> of

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
both do a really good job of

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.289 
both do a really good job of
implementing<00:04:17.859> memory<00:04:18.159> foam<00:04:18.459> and<00:04:18.760> I<00:04:19.090> really

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
implementing memory foam and I really

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.569 
implementing memory foam and I really
think<00:04:19.510> it<00:04:19.599> is<00:04:20.260> one<00:04:20.919> of<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.070> ways<00:04:21.250> of<00:04:21.430> the

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
think it is one of the ways of the

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.070 
think it is one of the ways of the
future<00:04:21.940> as<00:04:22.060> far<00:04:22.210> our<00:04:22.330> soccer<00:04:22.570> shoes<00:04:22.870> go

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
future as far our soccer shoes go

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.990 
future as far our soccer shoes go
because<00:04:23.770> it's<00:04:23.979> a<00:04:24.039> technology<00:04:24.400> that<00:04:24.820> really

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
because it's a technology that really

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.629 
because it's a technology that really
can<00:04:25.360> help<00:04:25.659> your<00:04:26.409> touch<00:04:26.620> if<00:04:26.950> implemented

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
can help your touch if implemented

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.700 
can help your touch if implemented
correctly<00:04:28.139> because<00:04:29.139> it<00:04:29.229> adds<00:04:29.380> very<00:04:29.590> little

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
correctly because it adds very little

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:30.500 
correctly because it adds very little
bulk

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
bulk

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.630 
bulk
it's<00:04:30.630> very<00:04:30.810> lightweight<00:04:31.050> and<00:04:31.530> it's<00:04:32.460> very

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
it's very lightweight and it's very

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.510 
it's very lightweight and it's very
