really decent results a couple of off
key<00:01:41.450> results<00:01:41.960> obviously<00:01:42.560> a<00:01:42.590> win<00:01:42.920> at<00:01:43.160> the

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
key results obviously a win at the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.070 
key results obviously a win at the
weekend<00:01:43.760> which<00:01:43.940> leads<00:01:44.180> us<00:01:44.300> into<00:01:44.510> the<00:01:44.720> ranges

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
weekend which leads us into the ranges

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.540 
weekend which leads us into the ranges
match<00:01:45.260> how'd<00:01:45.470> you<00:01:45.590> assess<00:01:45.830> our<00:01:45.950> chances<00:01:46.370> going

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
match how'd you assess our chances going

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.850 
match how'd you assess our chances going
into<00:01:46.820> that<00:01:46.940> one<00:01:47.120> well<00:01:48.050> the<00:01:48.170> defeats<00:01:48.530> were<00:01:48.680> five

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
into that one well the defeats were five

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.880 
into that one well the defeats were five
way<00:01:49.100> probably<00:01:49.610> been<00:01:49.820> a<00:01:49.850> rock<00:01:50.060> if<00:01:50.240> she<00:01:50.360> loved

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
way probably been a rock if she loved

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.350 
way probably been a rock if she loved
play<00:01:51.890> picked<00:01:52.700> up<00:01:52.820> something<00:01:53.030> from<00:01:53.150> their

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
play picked up something from their

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.670 
play picked up something from their
button<00:01:53.659> positive<00:01:54.020> end<00:01:54.140> don't<00:01:54.290> get<00:01:54.380> 10<00:01:54.530> men

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
button positive end don't get 10 men

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.700 
button positive end don't get 10 men
then<00:01:55.540> probably<00:01:56.540> that's<00:01:56.900> why<00:01:57.020> we<00:01:57.170> got<00:01:57.260> beat<00:01:57.440> by

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
then probably that's why we got beat by

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.280 
then probably that's why we got beat by
a<00:01:58.300> looking<00:01:59.300> confident<00:01:59.659> got<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.960> rangers<00:02:00.260> game

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
a looking confident got the rangers game

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.230 
a looking confident got the rangers game
as<00:02:00.590> long<00:02:00.710> as<00:02:00.800> it<00:02:00.890> can<00:02:00.979> play<00:02:01.729> there<00:02:01.909> like<00:02:02.060> move

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
as long as it can play there like move

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.570 
as long as it can play there like move
we<00:02:02.600> should<00:02:02.750> win<00:02:02.900> I'll<00:02:03.620> see<00:02:03.800> hearts<00:02:04.100> at<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.370> top

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
opportunities and I midfield is quite

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.240 
opportunities and I midfield is quite
overloaded<00:02:33.540> at<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:34.319> minute<00:02:34.590> but<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.040> feel

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
overloaded at the minute but you feel

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.830

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
that you've got a realistic transfer

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.880 
that you've got a realistic transfer
perhaps<00:02:37.020> make<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.319> breakthrough<00:02:37.530> at<00:02:37.709> some

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
perhaps make the breakthrough at some

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.410 
perhaps make the breakthrough at some
point<00:02:38.100> in<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.250> near<00:02:38.370> future<00:02:38.430> as<00:02:39.120> long<00:02:39.270> as<00:02:39.360> I

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
and play well then hopefully movie put

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.030 
and play well then hopefully movie put
off<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.930> bench<00:02:43.110> for<00:02:43.200> reserves<00:02:43.590> on<00:02:43.739> that<00:02:43.890> and

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
off the bench for reserves on that and

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.600 
off the bench for reserves on that and
catch<00:02:44.940> his<00:02:45.120> eye<00:02:45.239> down<00:02:45.300> and<00:02:45.660> then<00:02:45.750> maybe<00:02:46.610> she

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
catch his eye down and then maybe she

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.220 
catch his eye down and then maybe she
sees<00:02:47.790> that<00:02:47.940> just<00:02:48.269> gives<00:02:48.480> us<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.780> fuse<00:02:49.019> on<00:02:49.140> my

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
sees that just gives us a fuse on my

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.710 
sees that just gives us a fuse on my
shot<00:02:49.470> in<00:02:49.590> that<00:02:49.709> then<00:02:50.360> hopefully<00:02:51.360> see<00:02:51.540> what<00:02:51.630> it

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
shot in that then hopefully see what it
