harder to maintain its gonna show it's

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.300 
harder to maintain its gonna show it's
gonna<00:03:04.430> show<00:03:04.760> any<00:03:05.060> kind<00:03:05.330> of<00:03:05.420> ships<00:03:06.130> sooner<00:03:07.130> it's

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
gonna show any kind of ships sooner it's

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.850 
gonna show any kind of ships sooner it's
gonna<00:03:07.460> do<00:03:07.730> it's<00:03:08.390> just<00:03:08.570> basically<00:03:08.960> yes<00:03:09.650> it's

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
gonna do it's just basically yes it's

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.970 
gonna do it's just basically yes it's
more<00:03:10.040> maintenance<00:03:10.490> but<00:03:10.970> I<00:03:11.320> feel<00:03:12.320> like<00:03:12.530> it<00:03:12.770> was

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
more maintenance but I feel like it was

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.720 
more maintenance but I feel like it was
a<00:03:13.040> small<00:03:13.310> price<00:03:13.520> to<00:03:13.640> pay<00:03:13.820> for<00:03:14.330> being<00:03:15.730> different

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
a small price to pay for being different

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.110 
a small price to pay for being different
than<00:03:17.090> almost<00:03:17.660> everything<00:03:18.080> else<00:03:18.170> out<00:03:18.470> there<00:03:19.120> as

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
than almost everything else out there as

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:27.030 
than almost everything else out there as
far<00:03:20.510> as<00:03:20.570> wheel<00:03:20.960> color<00:03:21.320> goes

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.710 

but<00:03:28.040> another<00:03:28.760> thing<00:03:28.970> that<00:03:29.299> I<00:03:29.330> actually<00:03:29.450> just

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
but another thing that I actually just

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.210 
but another thing that I actually just
want<00:03:29.870> to<00:03:29.959> talk<00:03:30.080> about<00:03:30.200> is<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.530> fact<00:03:30.769> that<00:03:30.890> I'm

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
want to talk about is the fact that I'm

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.039 
want to talk about is the fact that I'm
sorry<00:03:32.150> if<00:03:32.360> I<00:03:32.959> seem<00:03:33.650> kind<00:03:34.129> of<00:03:34.569> kind<00:03:35.569> of<00:03:35.629> dark<00:03:35.900> at

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
sorry if I seem kind of kind of dark at

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.259 
sorry if I seem kind of kind of dark at
the<00:03:36.140> moment<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:37.040> only<00:03:37.069> reason<00:03:37.670> for<00:03:37.700> that<00:03:37.849> is

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
the moment the only reason for that is

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.360 
the moment the only reason for that is
because<00:03:38.299> I<00:03:38.989> recording<00:03:39.590> this

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
because I recording this

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:48.020 
because I recording this
at<00:03:41.989> 8:46<00:03:42.989> right<00:03:43.590> now<00:03:43.769> so<00:03:45.470> it's<00:03:46.470> not<00:03:46.680> quite<00:03:47.099> it's

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
at 8:46 right now so it's not quite it's

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.839 
at 8:46 right now so it's not quite it's
not<00:03:48.180> very<00:03:48.769> very<00:03:49.769> bright<00:03:50.069> outside<00:03:50.519> but<00:03:51.450> again<00:03:52.019> I

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
not very very bright outside but again I

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.740 
not very very bright outside but again I
didn't<00:03:53.849> want<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.030> make<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.150> video<00:03:54.450> for<00:03:54.510> you<00:03:54.690> guys

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
didn't want to make a video for you guys

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.490 
didn't want to make a video for you guys
as<00:03:55.050> soon<00:03:55.200> as<00:03:55.319> I<00:03:55.410> possibly<00:03:55.620> could<00:03:56.160> so<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:57.379> guess<00:03:58.379> I

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
as soon as I possibly could so I guess I

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.130 
as soon as I possibly could so I guess I
could<00:03:58.650> have<00:03:58.709> waited<00:03:58.950> till<00:03:59.040> tomorrow<00:03:59.099> but<00:03:59.760> I

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
could have waited till tomorrow but I

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:13.050 
could have waited till tomorrow but I
didn't<00:04:01.140> really<00:04:01.470> want<00:04:01.709> to

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.880 

now<00:04:13.569> I<00:04:13.840> know<00:04:13.959> this<00:04:14.350> still<00:04:14.620> little<00:04:14.830> bit

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
now I know this still little bit

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.720 
now I know this still little bit
overspray<00:04:16.109> left<00:04:17.109> on<00:04:17.470> the<00:04:17.590> tires<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:18.220> the

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
overspray left on the tires and the

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.610 
overspray left on the tires and the
reason<00:04:19.090> for<00:04:19.239> that<00:04:19.299> guys<00:04:19.750> is<00:04:20.109> because<00:04:20.290> of<00:04:20.560> the

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
reason for that guys is because of the

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.250 
reason for that guys is because of the
fact<00:04:20.859> that<00:04:21.220> yes<00:04:22.030> we<00:04:22.300> did<00:04:22.450> overspray<00:04:22.960> onto<00:04:23.169> the

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
fact that yes we did overspray onto the

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.050 
fact that yes we did overspray onto the
tires<00:04:23.500> we<00:04:23.740> didn't<00:04:23.980> mask<00:04:24.190> the<00:04:24.400> tires<00:04:24.639> we<00:04:24.820> part

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
tires we didn't mask the tires we part

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.050 
tires we didn't mask the tires we part
we<00:04:25.180> mast<00:04:25.389> the<00:04:25.600> car<00:04:25.810> but<00:04:26.800> we<00:04:26.889> didn't<00:04:27.130> mask<00:04:27.370> the

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
we mast the car but we didn't mask the

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.280 
we mast the car but we didn't mask the
tires<00:04:28.330> and<00:04:28.690> we<00:04:28.840> because<00:04:29.620> starting<00:04:30.220> out<00:04:30.810> we<00:04:31.810> had

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
tires and we because starting out we had

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.990 
tires and we because starting out we had
you<00:04:32.440> know<00:04:32.470> we'd<00:04:32.770> watch<00:04:32.950> some<00:04:33.250> tutorials<00:04:33.850> and

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
you know we'd watch some tutorials and

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.860 
you know we'd watch some tutorials and
something<00:04:34.180> like<00:04:34.270> that<00:04:34.360> and<00:04:34.480> they<00:04:34.540> all<00:04:34.720> said

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
something like that and they all said

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.390 
something like that and they all said
yeah<00:04:35.050> it<00:04:35.200> just<00:04:35.380> peels<00:04:35.560> off<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.919> tires<00:04:36.130> which

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
yeah it just peels off the tires which

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.310 
yeah it just peels off the tires which
for<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:36.639> most<00:04:36.790> part<00:04:37.090> it<00:04:37.210> did<00:04:37.450> there's<00:04:38.020> only<00:04:38.230> a

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
for the most part it did there's only a

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.870 
for the most part it did there's only a
little<00:04:38.530> bit<00:04:38.650> of<00:04:38.800> a<00:04:38.889> dusting<00:04:39.340> left<00:04:39.610> on<00:04:39.790> the

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
little bit of a dusting left on the

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.420 
little bit of a dusting left on the
tires<00:04:40.150> but<00:04:40.780> since<00:04:41.080> it's<00:04:41.230> white<00:04:41.590> that<00:04:42.010> dusting

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
tires but since it's white that dusting

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.340 
tires but since it's white that dusting
is<00:04:42.550> noticeable<00:04:43.000> if<00:04:43.150> it<00:04:43.240> was<00:04:43.389> black<00:04:43.660> plastidip

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
is noticeable if it was black plastidip

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.409 
is noticeable if it was black plastidip
you<00:04:45.100> wouldn't<00:04:45.430> see<00:04:45.580> that<00:04:45.610> white<00:04:45.910> dusting<00:04:46.330> you

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
you wouldn't see that white dusting you

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.470 
you wouldn't see that white dusting you
wouldn't<00:04:46.660> see<00:04:46.810> it<00:04:46.960> whatsoever<00:04:47.560> but<00:04:47.830> I<00:04:48.480> feel

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
wouldn't see it whatsoever but I feel

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.970 
wouldn't see it whatsoever but I feel
like<00:04:49.600> that's<00:04:50.169> the<00:04:50.260> only<00:04:50.380> thing<00:04:50.680> I<00:04:50.740> would<00:04:50.860> do

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
like that's the only thing I would do

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.590 
like that's the only thing I would do
differently<00:04:51.370> if<00:04:51.520> I<00:04:51.640> did<00:04:51.820> it<00:04:51.910> again<00:04:52.150> like<00:04:52.390> if<00:04:52.510> I

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
differently if I did it again like if I

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.480 
differently if I did it again like if I
started<00:04:53.050> from<00:04:53.200> scratch<00:04:53.260> again<00:04:53.860> which<00:04:54.220> I<00:04:54.310> may

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
started from scratch again which I may

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.640 
started from scratch again which I may
may<00:04:55.120> eventually<00:04:55.390> do<00:04:55.690> at<00:04:55.840> some<00:04:56.050> point<00:04:56.290> I'm<00:04:56.470> just

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
may eventually do at some point I'm just

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.870 
may eventually do at some point I'm just
gonna<00:04:56.740> at<00:04:57.070> this<00:04:57.100> point<00:04:57.430> I'm<00:04:57.550> just<00:04:57.610> going<00:04:57.820> to

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
gonna at this point I'm just going to

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.280 
gonna at this point I'm just going to
touch<00:04:58.090> up<00:04:58.300> some<00:04:58.480> things<00:04:58.720> because<00:04:59.020> there<00:04:59.140> are<00:04:59.260> a

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
touch up some things because there are a

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.080 
touch up some things because there are a
couple<00:04:59.500> of<00:04:59.650> spots<00:04:59.950> that<00:05:00.250> don't<00:05:00.970> look

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
couple of spots that don't look

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.900 
couple of spots that don't look
brilliant<00:05:01.570> but<00:05:01.950> and<00:05:02.950> a<00:05:03.040> couple<00:05:03.250> of<00:05:03.400> spots<00:05:03.730> that

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
brilliant but and a couple of spots that

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.790 
brilliant but and a couple of spots that
didn't<00:05:04.180> quite<00:05:04.360> get<00:05:04.690> 100%<00:05:05.080> coverage<00:05:05.850> but<00:05:06.850> I

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
didn't quite get 100% coverage but I

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.430 
didn't quite get 100% coverage but I
will<00:05:08.800> be<00:05:08.919> redoing<00:05:09.580> those<00:05:10.090> spots<00:05:10.419> and<00:05:10.840> like<00:05:11.350> I

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
will be redoing those spots and like I

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.390 
will be redoing those spots and like I
said<00:05:11.590> before<00:05:11.710> also<00:05:12.690> also<00:05:13.919> kind<00:05:14.919> of<00:05:14.979> clearing

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
said before also also kind of clearing
