every time you do speed test it varies
you<00:01:26.770> don't<00:01:26.950> always<00:01:27.100> get<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.399> same<00:01:27.550> results

first this result here some is actually
over<00:01:47.440> exaggerated<00:01:48.310> because<00:01:48.460> i<00:01:49.860> don't<00:01:50.860> really

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
over exaggerated because i don't really

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.840 
over exaggerated because i don't really
get<00:01:51.729> that<00:01:51.970> that's<00:01:52.270> just<00:01:53.369> sometimes<00:01:54.369> it<00:01:54.520> just

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
get that that's just sometimes it just

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.160 
get that that's just sometimes it just
does<00:01:55.600> this<00:01:55.750> college<00:01:56.080> where<00:01:56.259> it<00:01:56.350> goes<00:01:56.409> to<00:01:56.679> high

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
does this college where it goes to high

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.590 
does this college where it goes to high
bar<00:01:59.170> for<00:01:59.200> is<00:01:59.590> quite<00:01:59.979> funny<00:02:00.610> so<00:02:00.850> i<00:02:00.909> just<00:02:01.060> safely

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
bar for is quite funny so i just safely

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.830 
bar for is quite funny so i just safely
anyway<00:02:01.869> but<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.590> point<00:02:02.830> is<00:02:03.009> i<00:02:03.460> do<00:02:04.360> actually

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
anyway but the point is i do actually

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.570 
anyway but the point is i do actually
get<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.289> speed<00:02:05.710> that<00:02:05.860> I'm<00:02:05.950> supposed<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.399> get

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
get the speed that I'm supposed to get

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.309 
get the speed that I'm supposed to get
that's<00:02:06.819> that's<00:02:07.149> what<00:02:07.330> matters<00:02:07.690> because<00:02:08.019> a<00:02:08.050> lot

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
that's that's what matters because a lot

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.590 
that's that's what matters because a lot
of<00:02:08.350> Internet<00:02:08.830> companies<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.489> they<00:02:10.209> give<00:02:10.509> you

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
of Internet companies the they give you

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.550 
of Internet companies the they give you
a<00:02:10.660> certain<00:02:11.019> speed<00:02:11.290> especially<00:02:11.500> with<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:13.560> ADSL

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
a certain speed especially with the ADSL

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.810 
a certain speed especially with the ADSL
is<00:02:14.709> it<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.010> one<00:02:15.100> that<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.340> have<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.549> connect

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
is it the one that you have to connect

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.780 
is it the one that you have to connect
to<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.060> phone<00:02:16.269> line<00:02:16.829> because<00:02:17.829> you<00:02:17.980> they

you're<00:02:20.620> from<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.920> exchange<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:22.410> you're<00:02:23.410> never

you're from the exchange so you're never

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
going to get the top speed but with

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.400 
going to get the top speed but with
virgin<00:02:25.360> media<00:02:25.660> because<00:02:25.930> he<00:02:26.019> goes<00:02:26.200> through

virgin media because he goes through

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.830 
virgin media because he goes through
cable<00:02:26.829> you<00:02:27.310> always<00:02:27.640> get<00:02:27.850> what<00:02:27.880> you<00:02:28.120> what<00:02:28.810> you

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
cable you always get what you what you

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.350 
cable you always get what you what you
pay<00:02:29.140> for<00:02:29.410> which<00:02:29.650> is<00:02:29.860> what<00:02:30.790> you<00:02:30.910> want<00:02:31.120> really

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
pay for which is what you want really

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.050 
pay for which is what you want really
and<00:02:31.709> especially<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:33.310> good<00:02:33.549> thing<00:02:33.700> about<00:02:33.790> the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
and especially the good thing about the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.979 
and especially the good thing about the
50<00:02:34.510> mega<00:02:34.690> is<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:35.079> son<00:02:35.910> it's<00:02:36.910> not<00:02:37.269> on<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:37.450> traffic

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
50 mega is it son it's not on a traffic

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.289 
50 mega is it son it's not on a traffic
management<00:02:38.380> line<00:02:39.070> it's<00:02:39.400> like<00:02:39.549> on<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.790> separate

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
management line it's like on a separate

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:45.509 
management line it's like on a separate
network<00:02:41.049> so<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:42.340> peak<00:02:42.970> times<00:02:43.329> and<00:02:44.070> at<00:02:45.070> all<00:02:45.340> the

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
network so I peak times and at all the

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.460 
network so I peak times and at all the
times<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:46.000> get<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.420> same<00:02:46.690> speed<00:02:47.079> as<00:02:47.290> you

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
times you get the same speed as you

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.990 
times you get the same speed as you
would<00:02:47.650> so<00:02:47.859> you<00:02:47.920> don't<00:02:48.130> actually<00:02:48.280> lose<00:02:48.640> speed

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
would so you don't actually lose speed

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.660 
would so you don't actually lose speed
remember<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.750> 20<00:02:50.079> Megan<00:02:50.440> old<00:02:50.709> other<00:02:50.950> speeds

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
remember the 20 Megan old other speeds

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.520 
remember the 20 Megan old other speeds
that<00:02:51.850> virgin<00:02:52.239> media<00:02:52.600> provide<00:02:52.930> or<00:02:53.200> even<00:02:53.410> other

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
that virgin media provide or even other

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.890 
that virgin media provide or even other
connections<00:02:54.160> they're<00:02:54.880> all<00:02:55.030> traffic<00:02:55.329> managed

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
connections they're all traffic managed

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.870 
connections they're all traffic managed
so<00:02:56.320> what<00:02:56.590> happens<00:02:56.980> when<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.340> servers<00:02:57.730> get

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
so what happens when the servers get

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.979 
so what happens when the servers get
busy<00:02:58.530> they<00:02:59.530> start<00:02:59.890> doing<00:03:00.160> like<00:03:00.989> this

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
busy they start doing like this

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.930 
busy they start doing like this
management<00:03:02.530> thing<00:03:02.739> with<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.160> network<00:03:03.489> to<00:03:03.730> try

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
management thing with the network to try

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.220 
management thing with the network to try
and<00:03:04.120> give<00:03:04.329> everyone<00:03:04.630> like<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:05.079> know<00:03:05.200> a

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
and give everyone like you know a

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.440 
and give everyone like you know a
certain<00:03:05.549> speed<00:03:06.549> and<00:03:06.790> what<00:03:06.940> that<00:03:07.120> does<00:03:07.299> it

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
certain speed and what that does it

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.970 
certain speed and what that does it
reduces<00:03:07.930> your<00:03:08.079> speech<00:03:08.380> so<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:08.590> don't<00:03:08.799> get

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
reduces your speech so you don't get

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.650 
reduces your speech so you don't get
your<00:03:09.130> maximum<00:03:09.880> speed<00:03:10.150> but<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.480> good<00:03:10.630> thing

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
your maximum speed but the good thing

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.970 
your maximum speed but the good thing
about<00:03:10.810> this<00:03:11.140> one<00:03:11.380> is<00:03:11.410> because<00:03:11.620> it's<00:03:11.859> on<00:03:11.950> a

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
about this one is because it's on a

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.680 
about this one is because it's on a
separate<00:03:12.790> line<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.269> it's<00:03:13.390> not<00:03:13.510> traffic

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
separate line and it's not traffic

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.750 
separate line and it's not traffic
manage<00:03:14.140> because<00:03:14.530> it's<00:03:14.680> like<00:03:14.799> if<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.310> handlery

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
manage because it's like if the handlery

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.800 
manage because it's like if the handlery
as<00:03:15.879> a<00:03:15.909> VIP<00:03:16.390> network<00:03:17.670> so<00:03:18.670> you<00:03:19.120> always<00:03:19.420> get<00:03:19.599> top

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
as a VIP network so you always get top

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:20.850 
as a VIP network so you always get top
speed

quite low my average upload speed result

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.790 
quite low my average upload speed result
is<00:03:30.070> about<00:03:30.280> one<00:03:30.490> point<00:03:30.670> 65<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.540> that's<00:03:32.470> really

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
is about one point 65 and that's really

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.900 
is about one point 65 and that's really
