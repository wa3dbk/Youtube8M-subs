00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.039
 Aymara study as you, for those who do not 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.470
 I know called me forget that fear 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.810
 has a youtube channel called pink kit 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.560
 or is also part of the family is 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.779
 good 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.329
 today I come here to teach you to 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.399
 customize a super beach bag 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.079
 cute I think're super helpful for 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.390
 the heat you're doing here in the 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.920
 Brazil we like and to check 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.100
 How do you start? We'll go. 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.610
 use an epoch berg the anchor template 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.579
 light blue dark blue fabric paint 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.170
 double-sided tape and also a zircon brush 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.449
 round tip 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.000
 The first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.750
 take a cardboard and put it inside the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.699
 handbag 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.100
 to prevent ink from transferring from the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.500
 top to bottom 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.830
 Let's get a little model put by 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.979
 use the crepe tape or 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.170
 double-sided tape or one of the checks is 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.080
 there what you have to stick the edges 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.720
 and prevent the mold from moving and 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.440
 get out of the position that we need to use 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.900
 OK 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.550
 now you will separate a pot and 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:30.330
 put the two paints that we go 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.330
 use them to dark and light blue 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.060
 with that condom potential 460 that he 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.520
 has this tip more round 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.829
 We'll get the ink and start doing it. 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.130
 contained little dots that give a 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:49.640
 It was a pretty good effect, I started with the blue one. 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.689
 clear and I'm going halfway down the anchor 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.689
 making those little dots 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.590
 after having done half the UN 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.320
 we'll take another shade of blue and 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:23.050
 continue the same procedure 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.050
 various dots dots and dots 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.040
 when you are approaching the monkey 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.260
 another is too simple to form that 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.450
 It should be beautiful, just keep doing it. 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.099
 dots with mixed colors for 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.230
 conclude from the course a little 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.520
 dark blue and blend the two things 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.520
 give a cool gradient 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.290
 after doing this, just take the 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.270
 mold and let the bag accept that it 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.710
 will be all ready prontinho prontinho 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.710
 for you to destroy the preview 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.180
