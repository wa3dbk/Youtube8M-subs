 whether he learn I said that in our 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.620
 the country is all equal for all the law 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.690

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.730
 disabled child he will also be trained 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.260

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.040
 do everything not to distract children from 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.770
 this because it was at the end of the lesson 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.590
 and just not with that not the whole child 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.009
 I twisted it means his hands to me 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.299

 school director problems with 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.220
 Mishaniâ€™s classmates were more likely to 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.920
 parents did not want to study in class 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.049
 disabled children took the boy not a reason

 boycott refused to interview them 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.009
 The position is set out in a statement left in 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.049
 school parents are sure that one kind 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.979
 seizures may adversely affect 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.689
 all children 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.670
 action against disabled people would be 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.010
 impossible without some support 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.240
 or say he began to spoil the performance

 however mom Misha does not agree to home 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.009
 learning she confidently her son should not 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.990
 only gain knowledge but also learn 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.520

 abroad for example in Europe always 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.280
 wonder how many people with disabilities are everywhere 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.870
 on the streets of the shops of museums but here we have 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.420
 people with disabilities 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.400
 over the years do not leave their apartments here and 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.709
 Misha Rybkin may be forced 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.030
