00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.810
 space rangers 2 dominators 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:09.510
 reboot revolution revolution wait 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:12.030
 evolutions of shady if there is no such thing 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.150

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.130
 no no no what is dominator and 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.470
 if my memory serves me 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.320
 dudes from harry potter and no this 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.119
 Dementors create a character, see here 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.130
 many times these greens are not for me 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.210
 like that doesn't mean I'm a racist 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.369
 because good means here to chicks 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.800
 they are not very similar to dominators and 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.440
 by the way where is emma watson hands and 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.930
 the corset is not meaning then what have 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.879
 harry potter is generally still here you can search 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.950
 different things on non-habitable planets 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.690
 for example find drugs on jupiter and 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.270
 sell them on mars and sit down for the stage 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.399
 jail in space nobody will hear your 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.680
 scream if you donâ€™t 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.199
 speak you look might be in danger 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.780
 anyone let's try because of this 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.149
 I am again in the jail can take a loan and 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.390
 then do not pay in the newspaper that for it 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.979
 will be up again to the jail Lord why in 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.909
 this game is so easy to go to jail 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.159
 It was clear where we swing the characteristics 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.840
 I will pump over it probably it means that 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.299
 I will put more likes on 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.100
 youtube and look black hole but on 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.220
 in fact it is odd it is different 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.140
 colors although i call black window horse 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.909
 what are we waiting for you in black holes 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.950
 of course death from breaking apart 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.840
 gravitational arcade shooter under 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.630
 rhythmic music for the victory in which you 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.280
 give artifacts let's improve 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.500
 equipment to pay a green intern 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.270
 trainees are those hot girls in white 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.369
 gowns I correctly understood judging 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.400
 because like kirov they improved yes it 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.390
 female scientists this was sexism this is bad 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.390
 on for porn 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.619
 i think rangers but damn wrong 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.509
 because according to him the coolest 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.299
 ranger is not chuck noris from cool 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.399
 walker and not even here these guys are some 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.380
 unknown dude in general I could 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.929
 be further criticize this game them and 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.719
 so sue george lucas for the word droid 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:06.479
 and I'm tired of becoming a pirate perfectly 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.489
 these pirate base that jack sparrow so 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.530
 he looks without a wig and eyeliner and 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.470
 he does not offer to step pirate 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.269
 fraternity yes of course it's worse than me 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:30.870
 I expected I thought now will be constantly 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:33.079
 playing not ok it's still not 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:38.220
 work you can receive orders and awards 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:40.079
 nothing of this name is urgant maybe u 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.030
 he has his culinary show where he is 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.340
 says something like chop the greenfinch 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.530
 into pieces like coalition ships 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.040
 ray all years text quest lie 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:53.420
 read what is it a book or game what else 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.760
 here you can shoot down asteroids and rockets 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.370
 recruit mate take out planetary 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.739
 some fights and collect dominate hell 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.709
 weapons improve equipment treat 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.880
 diseases take stimulant not treat 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:11.190
 diseases and even buying scanners 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.959
 use search and can 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.720
 install in equipment big on 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:19.440
 models see this is called a moment 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.560
 the execution of micro stihl is definitely not about 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:27.260
 me because about me there would be a magician 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:30.409
 shooting well, you understand magician shooting 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.140
 in general, a good game to buy it personally 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:36.430
 I did not buy it new buy and why I 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:40.269
 did not buy because i'm pen 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.269
 no-no-no-no-not passed channel 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.079
