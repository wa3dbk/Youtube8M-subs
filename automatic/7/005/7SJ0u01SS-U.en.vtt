00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 jo people here is your super micro 20 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:10.650
 This time I was a very small one 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.389
 mini tutorial video how to do this 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.040
 Naruto game for the pc 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.680
 which is not really that right now 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:22.820
 will work for the following reasons 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:25.619
 I 'm just going to count on it 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:31.309
 although some play the biggest 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:34.460
 problem is just that here 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:38.670
 you think you're finally coming out 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.520
 yes, one man writes waldherr another 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.489
 So frank namco describes next 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.000
 year they wait verny want out 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.820
 do 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.370
 Of course, that's where they come from 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.050
 but said that they work on it 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.739
 also has such a garbage here and 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.399
 Just wait, you can say a lot yes 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.660
 and many more comments and that 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.430
 excite me on truth of this 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.150
 Connection error comes all the time 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.990
 So not connection error but 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.500
 transmission error, transmission 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.530
 error 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.060
 and that's annoying, but go now 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:18.930
 Let's go to the programmer over and 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.799
 Although the program ds3 is yours clicks 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.030

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.840

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.840

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.460
 now there is no controller then 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.860
 Just take it from your ps3 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.860

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.780

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.570

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:54.549
 then available here fall on meat 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:59.580
