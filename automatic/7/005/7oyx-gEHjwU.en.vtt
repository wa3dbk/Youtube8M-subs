00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.630
 very good first to be that they are me

 92 in a new section that I hope will 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.830
 like and about the many legends that 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:12.170
 there is minecraft but this time 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.389
 this section there is a video explaining the 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.070
 legend or the capi pasta and in others 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.350
 videos to very apart and it's theory 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.580
 specific this legend so 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.120
 we started with the best known 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.220
 worldwide and yes 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.740
 observing that of the legend of hero 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.020
 bright the brother death of our 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.820
 the one that doubles minecraft so here the 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.820
 clip to this day urban legend 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.050
 recently exposing a single world 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.149
 Minecraft player everything was normal to 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.339
 beginning so I started cutting down 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.800
 trees and create items in my box to 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.930
 caritas 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.489
 I realized that something was moving in the 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.590
 heavy fog 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.840
 I have a very slow computer so 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.510
 I have to play with a small network of 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.399
 resistance 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.890
 while more images of that option 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.760
 the less you look around you or the more 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.650
 fog 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.080
 I thought it was a cow so the 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.510
 chases hoping to take a little 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.970
 leather to make the armor was not 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.130
 a cow looking at me was another character 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.510
 with the favor skin but his eyes 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.770
 they were empty he did not see a pp like with his 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.289
 first name 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.049
 that is the name that comes out of one 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:28.969
 when I played line and double check to 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.750
 make sure I was not in the world 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:33.510
 multiplayer 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.760
 and he did not stay long he looked at me and 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.470
 quickly ran towards the fog not 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.110
 pursue out of curiosity but you already 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.060
 had gone 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.370
 and continues with the game not sure that 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.830
 to think while exposing myself around the world 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.410
 I saw some things out of place for 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.840
 that a random app could make tunnels 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.550
 two by two on the small rocks 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.890
 perfect pyramids made of flour in 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.050
 the ocean and tree groves with 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.910
 all his leaves cut me 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.740
 consciously I thought I had seen 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.320
 the other player was deep fog but 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.250
 I never had another good view of him 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.790
 try to increase by erasing 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.630
 distances thinking what could have 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.030
 but it was in vain 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.410
 save the map of I went to the forums for 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.530
 see if anyone else had found 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.860
 this 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.320
 pseudo player 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.120
 there was no one I created my own theme 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.530
 commenting on the name and asking 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.590
 if there is nobody had an experience 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.240
 similar the well erased before the 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.250
 five minutes 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.819
 I tried again and the subject was deleted to 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.340
 a fast 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:37.239
 I received a private message from just one 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.420
 called hero brain contained only one 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.420
 word 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.380
 I wanted to look at the rain spin profile but 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.030
 I knew the typical mistake of the page error 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.030
 404 page 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.060
 received an email from another floor of the forum 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.860
 he said moderators can read 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.050
 the messages of the users in the forum 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.610
 so we were safer using 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.680
 e-mail 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.420
 this user said that he had seen in 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.980
 a mysterious player also who has 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.800
 a small directory of other users 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.390
 who claims to have seen his 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.410
 worlds were full of with 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.910
 obvious constructions made by men 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.140
 also and they described that our player 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.000
 I did not have batteries 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.830
 it happened about a month until I heard 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.690
 news of the informant also 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.820
 some players that have been found 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.220
 to the name mystery I made a look 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.230
 to the name hero brain and they told that this 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.110
 name will be used frequently by a 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.880
 Swedish player 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.580
 after recovering more information 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:42.020
 we discovered that he was the brother of night 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.020
 the game developer 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:48.200
 I personally sent him an email last night and 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.210
 I asked him if he having brother took 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.660
 a time could he answered me back 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:56.140
 with a very short message I had but already 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.140
 he was not with us 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.400
 I have seen the mysterious name of our 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.900
 first encounter and I have not noticed another 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.720
 change in the world more than the ones that I have 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.180
 done press the x and screen key to 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.329
 take a picture when I first saw it 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:15.519
 time here is the only evidence that 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.519
 I have subsistence of what
