two<00:01:27.479> different<00:01:27.630> windscreens<00:01:28.430> they<00:01:29.430> got<00:01:29.580> the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
two different windscreens they got the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.520 
two different windscreens they got the
touring<00:01:30.390> version<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.990> then<00:01:31.050> the<00:01:31.170> sport

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
touring version and then the sport

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.040 
touring version and then the sport
version<00:01:31.590> i'm<00:01:32.550> not<00:01:32.789> sure<00:01:32.850> which<00:01:33.270> color<00:01:33.570> i<00:01:33.720> got

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
version i'm not sure which color i got

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.230 
version i'm not sure which color i got
honestly<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.740> was<00:01:35.100> really<00:01:35.130> difficult<00:01:35.759> to

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
honestly it was really difficult to

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.570 
honestly it was really difficult to
decide<00:01:36.630> between<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.440> different<00:01:37.710> colors<00:01:37.979> you

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
decide between the different colors you

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.850 
decide between the different colors you
can<00:01:38.670> go<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:38.970> like<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.119> clear<00:01:39.479> one<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.410> you<00:01:40.740> know

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
can go for like a clear one to you know

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.070 
can go for like a clear one to you know
almost<00:01:41.250> well<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.240> course<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.689> still<00:01:42.900> see

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
almost well of course you can still see

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.469 
almost well of course you can still see
you<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.290> it's<00:01:43.409> there<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:43.799> not<00:01:44.040> as

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
you that it's there but not as

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.750 
you that it's there but not as
distracting<00:01:45.479> i<00:01:45.570> guess<00:01:45.750> from<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:45.990> bike<00:01:46.290> or<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
distracting i guess from the bike or the

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.210 
distracting i guess from the bike or the
dark<00:01:48.000> smoke<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.630> try<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.020> match<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.950> know<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
dark smoke to try to match you know the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.240 
dark smoke to try to match you know the
black<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:51.090> here<00:01:51.770> so<00:01:52.770> i<00:01:52.799> guess<00:01:52.979> i'll<00:01:53.100> be<00:01:53.220> a

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
black on here so i guess i'll be a

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.950 
black on here so i guess i'll be a
surprise<00:01:53.610> when<00:01:53.820> i<00:01:53.909> open<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.270> up<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.869> was

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
surprise when i open it up and it was

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.270 
surprise when i open it up and it was
actually<00:01:55.320> difficult<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.799> decide<00:01:56.009> if<00:01:56.159> i<00:01:56.250> should

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
actually difficult to decide if i should

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.200 
actually difficult to decide if i should
get<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.729> touring<00:01:57.330> or<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.600> sport<00:01:59.000> for<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
get the touring or the sport for the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.510 
get the touring or the sport for the
touring<00:02:01.110> version<00:02:01.140> that's<00:02:01.740> i<00:02:02.070> don't<00:02:02.220> like<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
touring version that's i don't like the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.370 
touring version that's i don't like the
look<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:02.939> because<00:02:03.119> it's<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.900> know<00:02:03.960> sit<00:02:04.229> so

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
look of it because it's you know sit so

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.289 
look of it because it's you know sit so
much<00:02:04.500> higher<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.100> course<00:02:05.340> on<00:02:05.790> long<00:02:06.090> rides

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
much higher but of course on long rides

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.139 
much higher but of course on long rides
it's<00:02:06.659> nicer<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:08.009> sport<00:02:08.340> one<00:02:08.610> it's<00:02:08.880> not<00:02:09.030> going

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
it's nicer the sport one it's not going

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.330 
it's nicer the sport one it's not going
to<00:02:09.239> deflect<00:02:09.750> as<00:02:09.899> much<00:02:10.110> air<00:02:10.380> but<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.130> looks

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
to deflect as much air but it looks

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.830 
to deflect as much air but it looks
nicer

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
nicer

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.640 
nicer

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
in like this you know just one for the

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.140 
in like this you know just one for the
whole<00:03:22.470> block<00:03:22.709> just<00:03:23.010> one<00:03:23.160> box<00:03:23.340> with<00:03:23.819> a<00:03:23.850> bunch<00:03:24.060> of

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
whole block just one box with a bunch of

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.370 
whole block just one box with a bunch of
key<00:03:24.329> you<00:03:24.510> know<00:03:24.600> you<00:03:24.690> get<00:03:24.810> your<00:03:24.930> key<00:03:25.079> and<00:03:25.290> then

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
key you know you get your key and then

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.229 
key you know you get your key and then

months<00:06:38.440> or<00:06:38.680> just<00:06:38.830> whatever<00:06:39.040> so<00:06:39.430> I<00:06:39.490> have

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
months or just whatever so I have

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.100 
months or just whatever so I have
something<00:06:39.729> to<00:06:39.880> kind<00:06:40.120> of<00:06:40.180> fall<00:06:40.360> back<00:06:40.630> on<00:06:40.870> as

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
something to kind of fall back on as

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.460 
something to kind of fall back on as
like<00:06:41.860> a<00:06:42.030> back-up<00:06:43.030> plan<00:06:43.060> I<00:06:43.389> guess<00:06:43.600> until<00:06:44.020> i<00:06:44.350> get

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.470 
like a back-up plan I guess until i get

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.060 
like a back-up plan I guess until i get
my<00:06:44.620> income<00:06:45.010> up<00:06:45.160> and<00:06:45.310> it<00:06:45.400> stabilizes<00:06:46.710> so<00:06:47.710> that's

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070 
my income up and it stabilizes so that's

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.550 
my income up and it stabilizes so that's
the<00:06:48.160> plan<00:06:48.400> hopefully<00:06:49.030> if<00:06:49.660> that<00:06:49.930> happens<00:06:50.290> once

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 
the plan hopefully if that happens once

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.710 
the plan hopefully if that happens once
it<00:06:50.710> happens<00:06:51.070> I'll<00:06:51.220> be<00:06:51.340> able<00:06:51.430> to<00:06:51.580> make<00:06:51.720> more
