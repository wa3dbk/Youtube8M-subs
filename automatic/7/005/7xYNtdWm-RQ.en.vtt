that range that's why the food of the

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.190 
that range that's why the food of the

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
symbiosis ah excellent they grow bigger

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.020

forest Giants head and he has also

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.280 
forest Giants head and he has also
unlocked<00:03:20.579> a<00:03:20.640> new<00:03:20.760> ability<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.600> fruit<00:03:21.840> aspect

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
unlocked a new ability the fruit aspect

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.449 
unlocked a new ability the fruit aspect
ability<00:03:24.170> aspect<00:03:25.170> abilities<00:03:25.590> are<00:03:25.799> not<00:03:26.070> our<00:03:26.190> big

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
ability aspect abilities are not our big

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.910 
ability aspect abilities are not our big
part<00:03:26.700> of<00:03:26.850> shaping<00:03:27.090> your<00:03:27.329> ecosystem<00:03:27.739> you<00:03:28.739> can

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
part of shaping your ecosystem you can

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.979 
part of shaping your ecosystem you can
change<00:03:29.250> any<00:03:29.489> natural<00:03:30.000> source<00:03:30.269> with<00:03:30.540> an<00:03:30.660> aspect

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
change any natural source with an aspect

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.410 
change any natural source with an aspect
basically<00:03:31.650> like<00:03:31.829> a<00:03:31.860> sort<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.220> upgrade<00:03:32.459> for

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
basically like a sort of upgrade for

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.330 
basically like a sort of upgrade for
example<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:34.049> can<00:03:34.350> make<00:03:34.470> my<00:03:34.590> blueberries<00:03:35.130> more

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
example I can make my blueberries more

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.670 
example I can make my blueberries more
fruity<00:03:35.820> with<00:03:36.360> this<00:03:36.510> fruit<00:03:36.780> aspect<00:03:37.230> ability

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
fruity with this fruit aspect ability

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.560 
fruity with this fruit aspect ability
but<00:03:38.250> natural<00:03:38.640> sources<00:03:39.000> can<00:03:39.150> only<00:03:39.329> have<00:03:39.540> a

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
but natural sources can only have a

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.930 
but natural sources can only have a
limited<00:03:39.780> number<00:03:39.989> of<00:03:40.320> aspects<00:03:40.769> this<00:03:41.459> blueberry

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
limited number of aspects this blueberry

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.940 
limited number of aspects this blueberry
can<00:03:42.150> only<00:03:42.329> have<00:03:42.600> one<00:03:42.840> so<00:03:43.410> let's<00:03:43.620> see<00:03:43.799> what

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
can only have one so let's see what

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.259 
can only have one so let's see what
happens

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
happens

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.610 
happens
here<00:03:46.269> you<00:03:46.390> can<00:03:46.569> see<00:03:46.780> that<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.080> natural<00:03:47.230> source

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
here you can see that the natural source

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.920 
here you can see that the natural source
is<00:03:47.830> now<00:03:47.980> boosted<00:03:48.400> by<00:03:48.549> an<00:03:48.610> aspect<00:03:49.060> giving<00:03:49.810> an

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
is now boosted by an aspect giving an

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.440 
is now boosted by an aspect giving an
extra<00:03:50.200> fruit<00:03:50.590> and<00:03:51.220> thus<00:03:51.489> extra<00:03:52.000> filter

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
extra fruit and thus extra filter

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.289 
extra fruit and thus extra filter
aspects<00:03:53.379> also<00:03:53.739> give<00:03:53.890> us<00:03:54.010> another<00:03:54.250> option<00:03:54.519> we

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
aspects also give us another option we

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.149 
aspects also give us another option we
