I<00:02:16.549> remember<00:02:17.390> feeling<00:02:17.799> pretty<00:02:18.799> relieved<00:02:19.220> but

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
I remember feeling pretty relieved but

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.600 
I remember feeling pretty relieved but
it<00:02:21.260> didn't<00:02:21.620> really<00:02:21.709> hit<00:02:21.920> me<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.190> so<00:02:22.340> later

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
it didn't really hit me and so later

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.140 
it didn't really hit me and so later
when<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:22.880> talked<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.120> my<00:02:23.180> family<00:02:23.360> on<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:23.630> phone

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
when I talked to my family on the phone

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.140 
when I talked to my family on the phone
that<00:02:26.150> was<00:02:26.269> when<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:26.750> gets<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:26.989> little<00:02:27.019> bit<00:02:27.349> more

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
that was when it gets a little bit more

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.520 
that was when it gets a little bit more
personal<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:29.450> like<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:30.049> think<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:30.349> the

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
personal I like to think that the

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.640 
personal I like to think that the
varsity<00:02:30.980> has<00:02:31.160> us<00:02:31.549> to<00:02:31.790> think<00:02:32.030> for<00:02:32.390> their

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
varsity has us to think for their

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.589 
varsity has us to think for their
success<00:02:33.650> because<00:02:34.340> they<00:02:34.610> can<00:02:34.849> continually

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
success because they can continually

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.390 
success because they can continually
like<00:02:36.290> work<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:37.209> outlast<00:02:38.209> everyone<00:02:39.190> and<00:02:40.190> I

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
like work to outlast everyone and I

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.770 
like work to outlast everyone and I
think<00:02:40.610> it<00:02:40.730> just<00:02:40.760> gives<00:02:41.060> them<00:02:41.239> something<00:02:41.450> to

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
think it just gives them something to

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.690 
think it just gives them something to
like<00:02:41.959> aim<00:02:42.319> for<00:02:42.590> which<00:02:42.799> is<00:02:42.980> great<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.430> the

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
like aim for which is great is the

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.460 
like aim for which is great is the
pressure<00:02:43.910> on<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.269> repeat<00:02:44.599> or<00:02:44.810> do<00:02:45.079> even<00:02:45.260> think

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
pressure on to repeat or do even think

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.530 
pressure on to repeat or do even think
about<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.860> I<00:02:46.010> don't<00:02:46.370> feel<00:02:46.610> like<00:02:46.849> we<00:02:47.239> had<00:02:47.390> that

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
about it I don't feel like we had that

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.259 
about it I don't feel like we had that
much<00:02:47.720> pressure<00:02:47.930> for<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.590> 4th<00:02:48.829> because<00:02:49.269> every

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
much pressure for the 4th because every

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.190 
much pressure for the 4th because every
year<00:02:50.319> is<00:02:51.319> brand<00:02:51.829> new<00:02:52.000> it<00:02:53.000> was<00:02:53.209> fantastic<00:02:53.989> for

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
year is brand new it was fantastic for

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.440

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
the 1st 2nd and 3rd but this year is a

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.390 
the 1st 2nd and 3rd but this year is a
totally<00:02:59.870> different<00:03:00.170> year<00:03:00.350> we<00:03:00.680> set<00:03:00.889> goals<00:03:01.160> out

in the end of the year we don't talk
about<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.989> past<00:03:03.170> or<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.650> future<00:03:03.709> it's<00:03:04.400> just

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
about the past or the future it's just

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.729

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
widest part of the boat so they're

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.229 
widest part of the boat so they're
pretty<00:03:56.580> comfy<00:03:57.030> sitting<00:03:57.390> in<00:03:57.480> there

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
pretty comfy sitting in there

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.839 
pretty comfy sitting in there
and<00:03:58.420> then<00:03:58.510> about<00:03:58.840> there<00:03:59.230> they<00:04:00.129> have<00:04:00.489> to<00:04:00.519> be

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
and then about there they have to be

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.199 
and then about there they have to be
there<00:04:01.299> you<00:04:01.359> typically<00:04:02.019> your<00:04:02.170> lighter<00:04:02.469> kids

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
there you typically your lighter kids

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.459

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
they could throw the set of the boat off

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.800 
they could throw the set of the boat off
