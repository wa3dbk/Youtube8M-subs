like blemishes and stuff and it just

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.140 
like blemishes and stuff and it just
really<00:04:22.080> covers<00:04:22.560> it<00:04:22.650> up<00:04:22.770> really<00:04:23.039> well<00:04:23.190> and<00:04:23.490> the

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
really covers it up really well and the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.720 
really covers it up really well and the
best<00:04:24.419> thing

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
best thing

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.630 
best thing
about<00:04:24.940> this<00:04:25.270> is<00:04:25.510> that<00:04:26.320> once<00:04:27.130> you<00:04:27.250> put<00:04:27.280> it<00:04:27.490> on

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
about this is that once you put it on

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.060 
about this is that once you put it on
any<00:04:27.790> blended<00:04:28.390> it<00:04:28.540> it<00:04:28.750> just<00:04:29.050> dries<00:04:29.440> instantly

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
any blended it it just dries instantly

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.610 
any blended it it just dries instantly
so<00:04:30.730> you<00:04:30.790> do<00:04:31.150> have<00:04:31.180> to<00:04:31.570> work<00:04:31.930> with<00:04:32.200> it<00:04:32.350> pretty

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.070 
so you do have to work with it pretty
quick<00:04:32.890> but<00:04:33.790> at<00:04:34.030> least<00:04:34.210> you<00:04:34.360> know<00:04:34.540> that<00:04:34.570> it's

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
quick but at least you know that it's

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.680 
quick but at least you know that it's
gonna<00:04:35.320> dry<00:04:35.650> in<00:04:35.830> place<00:04:36.100> and<00:04:36.400> with<00:04:36.970> both<00:04:37.330> these

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
gonna dry in place and with both these

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.620 
gonna dry in place and with both these
products<00:04:38.230> you<00:04:38.620> don't<00:04:39.400> feel<00:04:39.790> the<00:04:40.000> need<00:04:40.030> to

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630

powder your skin or to set your makeup
which<00:04:43.420> is<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:44.080> best<00:04:44.500> thing<00:04:44.800> I<00:04:45.130> think<00:04:45.460> all<00:04:45.970> of

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
which is the best thing I think all of

it<00:04:46.630> as<00:04:46.780> well<00:04:47.020> because<00:04:47.700> whenever<00:04:48.700> you<00:04:48.880> put<00:04:49.210> on

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
it as well because whenever you put on

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.780 
it as well because whenever you put on
your<00:04:49.720> foundation<00:04:50.530> or<00:04:50.680> concealer<00:04:50.860> you<00:04:51.400> always

feel<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.270> need<00:04:52.300> to<00:04:53.220> actually<00:04:54.220> like<00:04:54.400> powder

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
feel the need to actually like powder

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.300 
feel the need to actually like powder
your<00:04:55.150> skin<00:04:55.450> just<00:04:55.630> so<00:04:55.810> it<00:04:55.960> sets<00:04:56.440> and<00:04:56.800> just<00:04:56.830> keeps

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
it all in place but with these you just

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.890 
it all in place but with these you just
don't<00:04:59.980> need<00:05:00.130> to<00:05:00.310> do<00:05:00.460> that<00:05:00.700> as<00:05:01.030> you<00:05:01.090> can<00:05:01.300> see<00:05:01.450> I
