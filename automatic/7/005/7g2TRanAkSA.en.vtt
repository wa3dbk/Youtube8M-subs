today because the buzzing season is over
and<00:00:28.830> all<00:00:28.949> they're<00:00:29.160> doing<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.519> nesting<00:00:30.060> up<00:00:30.210> in

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
and all they're doing is nesting up in

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.459 
and all they're doing is nesting up in
the<00:00:30.449> holes<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.050> wood<00:00:32.510> now<00:00:33.510> we<00:00:33.660> up<00:00:34.200> several

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
the holes in the wood now we up several

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.229 
the holes in the wood now we up several
different<00:00:34.829> types<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.219> B<00:00:35.430> traps<00:00:35.760> when<00:00:36.030> we<00:00:36.120> were

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
different types of B traps when we were

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.260 
different types of B traps when we were
designing<00:00:36.420> these<00:00:36.930> traps<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:38.850> reason<00:00:39.180> we

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
designing these traps and the reason we

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.910 
designing these traps and the reason we
use<00:00:39.300> several<00:00:39.780> different<00:00:40.200> types<00:00:40.379> we<00:00:40.559> wanted<00:00:40.829> to

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
use several different types we wanted to

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.350 
use several different types we wanted to
find<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.219> one<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.399> would<00:00:41.579> really<00:00:41.790> catch<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
find the one that would really catch the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.630 
find the one that would really catch the
bees<00:00:42.600> if<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.440> wonder<00:00:43.680> why<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.040> trap<00:00:44.309> looks

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
bees if you wonder why this trap looks

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.639 
bees if you wonder why this trap looks
this<00:00:44.820> way<00:00:45.090> it's<00:00:45.690> because<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> carpenter<00:00:46.500> bee

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
this way it's because a carpenter bee

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.500 
this way it's because a carpenter bee
like<00:00:46.860> certain<00:00:47.309> things<00:00:47.340> he<00:00:48.120> likes<00:00:48.360> a

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
like certain things he likes a

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.549 
like certain things he likes a
sheltering<00:00:48.930> roof

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
sheltering roof

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.560 
sheltering roof
he<00:00:50.039> likes<00:00:50.280> an<00:00:50.489> angled<00:00:50.969> hole<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.539> goes

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
he likes an angled hole that goes

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.830 
he likes an angled hole that goes
upwards<00:00:52.440> he<00:00:52.980> likes<00:00:53.219> an<00:00:53.399> angled<00:00:53.910> side<00:00:54.210> because

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
upwards he likes an angled side because

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.720 
upwards he likes an angled side because
it's<00:00:55.079> protection<00:00:55.770> from<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.070> weather<00:00:56.250> he

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
it's protection from the weather he

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.520 
it's protection from the weather he
doesn't<00:00:57.030> want<00:00:57.210> any<00:00:57.360> rain<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.930> get<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> hole

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
doesn't want any rain to get in the hole

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.459 
doesn't want any rain to get in the hole
to<00:00:58.829> get<00:00:58.920> at<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> baby<00:00:59.399> bees<00:00:59.899> they<00:01:00.899> don't<00:01:01.140> eat

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
to get at the baby bees they don't eat

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.860 
to get at the baby bees they don't eat
the<00:01:01.710> wood<00:01:01.949> they<00:01:02.609> just<00:01:02.820> drill<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> hole<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the wood they just drill a hole in the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.130 
the wood they just drill a hole in the
wood<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.670> lay<00:01:05.670> their<00:01:05.880> eggs<00:01:06.060> inside<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.930> raise

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
wood and lay their eggs inside and raise

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.740

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
their babies in there so a lot of times

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.480 
their babies in there so a lot of times
if<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.020> spray<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.619> outside<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:11.189> your<00:01:11.280> wood

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
if you spray the outside of your wood

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.300 
if you spray the outside of your wood
with<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.760> pesticide<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:13.229> bee<00:01:13.439> doesn't<00:01:13.710> eat<00:01:14.159> it

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
with a pesticide the bee doesn't eat it

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.030 
with a pesticide the bee doesn't eat it
and<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:15.060> doesn't<00:01:15.270> kill<00:01:15.659> him<00:01:15.840> he<00:01:16.380> goes<00:01:16.560> right<00:01:16.830> in

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
now I don't know how many bees are in

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.140 
now I don't know how many bees are in
this<00:01:21.210> bottle<00:01:21.720> lots<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.770> them<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.850> we'll<00:01:24.000> look

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
this bottle lots of them and we'll look

this bottle lots of them and we'll look
at<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.420> bottle<00:01:24.960> up<00:01:25.080> here<00:01:25.290> at<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.470> peak<00:01:25.710> of

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
at this bottle up here at the peak of

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.690 
at this bottle up here at the peak of
his<00:01:26.009> building<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:27.829> we'll<00:01:28.829> zoom<00:01:29.130> up<00:01:29.340> there<00:01:29.549> and

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
his building and we'll zoom up there and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.630 
his building and we'll zoom up there and
check<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:29.909> out<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:31.439> can<00:01:31.770> see<00:01:31.979> he's<00:01:32.610> been

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
check that out and you can see he's been

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:46.070 
check that out and you can see he's been
catching<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.329> good<00:01:33.540> many<00:01:33.780> carpenter<00:01:34.259> bees
