00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
like the show and as you can see his

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.760 
like the show and as you can see his
helmet<00:00:56.610> does<00:00:56.850> have<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.300> kind<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.230> red<00:00:58.440> glow

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.860 
helmet does have that kind of red glow
stuff<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.910> kind<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.180> looks<00:01:00.359> like<00:01:00.420> an<00:01:00.600> actual

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
stuff so it kind of looks like an actual

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.260 
stuff so it kind of looks like an actual
visor<00:01:01.680> or<00:01:01.920> helmet<00:01:02.520> which<00:01:02.670> i<00:01:02.760> think<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.000> really

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
visor or helmet which i think is really

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.700 
visor or helmet which i think is really
really<00:01:03.390> cool<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.870> think<00:01:04.350> they<00:01:04.439> did<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> really

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
really cool I think they did a really

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.649 
really cool I think they did a really
really<00:01:05.100> good<00:01:05.309> job<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.060> figure<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.450> think

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
really good job but that figure I think

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.080 
really good job but that figure I think
this<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.930> really<00:01:07.140> awesome<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.890> next<00:01:08.430> up<00:01:08.580> we

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
of in a little bit different than the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.700 
of in a little bit different than the
older<00:01:15.270> ones<00:01:15.540> as<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:15.990> see<00:01:16.140> he<00:01:16.290> kind<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.560> has

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
older ones as you can see he kind of has

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.080 
older ones as you can see he kind of has
a<00:01:16.740> lot<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:16.979> detail<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.460> his<00:01:17.580> helmet<00:01:17.939> and

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
a lot of detail on his helmet and

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.330 
a lot of detail on his helmet and
disease<00:01:18.689> poor<00:01:19.229> souls<00:01:19.470> really<00:01:19.799> detailed<00:01:20.159> out

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
disease poor souls really detailed out

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.520 
disease poor souls really detailed out
there<00:01:20.610> not<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.119> lot<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.330> back<00:01:21.509> printing<00:01:21.990> but

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
there not a lot of back printing but

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.600 
there not a lot of back printing but
that's<00:01:22.710> okay<00:01:23.009> because<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.250> don't<00:01:23.460> really

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
that's okay because you don't really

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.340 
that's okay because you don't really
like<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.939> back<00:01:24.090> anyway<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.200> that

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
like the back anyway and you have that

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.929 
like the back anyway and you have that
kind<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.650> standard<00:01:26.490> angry-looking

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
kind of standard angry-looking

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.940 
kind of standard angry-looking
stormtrooper<00:01:27.869> thing<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.290> he<00:01:28.350> does<00:01:28.530> come<00:01:28.770> with

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
stormtrooper thing and he does come with

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.030 
stormtrooper thing and he does come with
a<00:01:29.659> blaster<00:01:30.659> there<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.200> his<00:01:31.290> expression<00:01:31.799> really

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
a blaster there so his expression really

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.499 
a blaster there so his expression really
isn't<00:01:32.280> all<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.400> fancy<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.150> think<00:01:33.390> they

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
isn't all that fancy but I think they

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.880 
isn't all that fancy but I think they
did<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> pretty<00:01:33.780> good<00:01:34.049> job<00:01:34.110> with<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.500> figure

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
did a pretty good job with this figure

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.660 
did a pretty good job with this figure
and<00:01:35.630> next<00:01:36.630> up<00:01:36.810> we<00:01:37.079> have<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.770> an<00:01:37.979> imperial

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
thick fire missiles which if you turn

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.550 
thick fire missiles which if you turn
around<00:02:55.530> like<00:02:55.859> this<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:57.450> can<00:02:57.720> pull<00:02:58.139> what

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
around like this you can pull what

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.530 
around like this you can pull what

come out pretty powerful and you get two
of<00:03:03.209> those<00:03:03.510> which<00:03:03.780> i<00:03:03.870> think<00:03:03.930> is<00:03:04.079> really<00:03:04.290> cool

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
of those which i think is really cool

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.649 
of those which i think is really cool
but<00:03:04.950> let<00:03:05.220> go<00:03:05.370> also<00:03:05.519> includes<00:03:06.030> another<00:03:06.359> one<00:03:06.569> so

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
but let go also includes another one so

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.780 
but let go also includes another one so
you<00:03:06.750> actually<00:03:06.930> get<00:03:07.200> three<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:08.190> that<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.549> can

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
you actually get three so that you can

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.360 
you actually get three so that you can
put<00:03:09.120> right<00:03:09.750> back<00:03:09.780> in<00:03:10.079> here<00:03:10.200> like<00:03:10.409> that<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:10.980> you

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
put right back in here like that and you

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.399 
put right back in here like that and you
can<00:03:11.519> load<00:03:11.670> it's<00:03:12.150> really<00:03:12.420> easy<00:03:12.599> but<00:03:13.139> I<00:03:13.200> think

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
can load it's really easy but I think

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.559 
can load it's really easy but I think
this<00:03:13.530> is<00:03:13.590> probably<00:03:13.769> one<00:03:14.370> of<00:03:14.400> my<00:03:14.519> favorite<00:03:15.120> as

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
this is probably one of my favorite as

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.750 
this is probably one of my favorite as
you<00:03:15.750> can<00:03:15.870> see<00:03:16.019> you<00:03:16.199> can<00:03:16.440> really<00:03:17.040> really<00:03:17.220> do

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
you can see you can really really do

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.150 
you can see you can really really do
some<00:03:17.970> damage<00:03:18.120> with<00:03:18.359> those<00:03:18.720> missiles<00:03:19.199> I<00:03:19.379> think

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
some damage with those missiles I think

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.550 
some damage with those missiles I think
this<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.340> one<00:03:20.639> of<00:03:20.669> my<00:03:20.879> favorite<00:03:21.419> ships<00:03:22.199> out<00:03:22.410> of

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
this is one of my favorite ships out of

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.710 
this is one of my favorite ships out of
the<00:03:22.680> new<00:03:22.889> Star<00:03:23.250> Wars<00:03:23.280> line<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.150> rebels<00:03:24.510> I

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
the new Star Wars line of the rebels I

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.420 
the new Star Wars line of the rebels I
think<00:03:25.290> they<00:03:25.410> did<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.590> really<00:03:25.680> really<00:03:26.040> good<00:03:26.280> job

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
think they did a really really good job

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.879 
think they did a really really good job
on<00:03:26.879> this<00:03:27.060> ship<00:03:27.449> I<00:03:27.660> think<00:03:27.989> it<00:03:28.199> is<00:03:28.379> probably<00:03:28.590> one

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
on this ship I think it is probably one

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.680 
on this ship I think it is probably one
of<00:03:28.919> my<00:03:28.980> favorites<00:03:29.459> of<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:30.239> new<00:03:30.389> Star<00:03:30.660> Wars
