demo<00:03:54.810> once<00:03:55.290> again<00:03:55.470> is<00:03:55.829> coming<00:03:56.250> in<00:03:56.370> August<00:03:56.910> 26

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
demo once again is coming in August 26

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.319 
demo once again is coming in August 26
and<00:03:57.810> is<00:03:58.440> coming<00:03:58.950> up<00:03:59.040> for<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.250> xbox<00:03:59.850> one<00:04:00.150> and

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
and is coming up for the xbox one and

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.110 
and is coming up for the xbox one and
the<00:04:00.660> PlayStation<00:04:01.620> 4<00:04:01.980> so<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.430> don't<00:04:02.910> believe

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
the PlayStation 4 so I don't believe

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.330 
the PlayStation 4 so I don't believe
this<00:04:03.540> can<00:04:03.750> be<00:04:03.900> coming<00:04:04.200> out<00:04:04.290> for<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.530> 360<00:04:05.160> and

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
this can be coming out for the 360 and

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.120 
this can be coming out for the 360 and
the<00:04:05.370> ps3<00:04:06.090> so<00:04:06.690> it<00:04:06.810> really<00:04:07.230> does<00:04:07.470> suck<00:04:07.769> for<00:04:08.040> the

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
the ps3 so it really does suck for the

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.930 
the ps3 so it really does suck for the
360<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.350> ps3<00:04:10.350> users<00:04:10.560> but<00:04:11.340> you<00:04:11.489> never<00:04:11.640> know

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
360 and the ps3 users but you never know

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.150 
360 and the ps3 users but you never know
always<00:04:12.480> give<00:04:12.660> it<00:04:12.750> a<00:04:12.810> check<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:13.380> never<00:04:13.620> know<00:04:13.920> um

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
always give it a check you never know um

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.569 
always give it a check you never know um
but<00:04:15.140> it's<00:04:16.140> most<00:04:16.380> likely<00:04:16.500> going<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:17.100> be<00:04:17.310> just

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
but it's most likely going to be just

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.640 
but it's most likely going to be just
for<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:17.880> next<00:04:18.180> generation<00:04:18.720> consoles<00:04:19.410> so<00:04:19.590> if
