00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
any experience with this wheel on them

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.200 
any experience with this wheel on them
but<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.350> know<00:01:49.500> for<00:01:49.920> sure<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.399> works<00:01:50.729> great<00:01:51.060> with

but I know for sure it works great with
Syrian<00:01:51.600> hamsters<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.040> first<00:01:53.310> pro<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.909> this

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
Syrian hamsters so the first pro of this

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.780 
Syrian hamsters so the first pro of this
wheel<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.350> fact<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.100> completely

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
wheel is the fact that it is completely

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.149 
wheel is the fact that it is completely
silent<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.810> cannot<00:01:58.140> hear<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> thing<00:01:58.619> I've<00:01:59.130> been

really then this is definitely the best

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.080

wheel<00:02:21.660> as<00:02:22.020> far<00:02:22.230> as<00:02:22.400> silent<00:02:23.400> as<00:02:23.460> far<00:02:23.850> as<00:02:23.940> being

quiet<00:02:24.360> in<00:02:24.570> my<00:02:24.660> opinion<00:02:25.050> definitely<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:26.760> next

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
quiet in my opinion definitely the next

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.860 
quiet in my opinion definitely the next
Pro<00:02:27.660> would<00:02:28.370> probably<00:02:29.370> be<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:30.270> fact<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.630> it's

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870

PVC pipe away and you can even buy the

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.020 
PVC pipe away and you can even buy the
wheel<00:03:55.230> cheaper<00:03:55.860> without<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.459> stand<00:03:56.730> if<00:03:56.910> you

do want to connect it to a wire cage so
yeah<00:03:59.670> those<00:04:00.209> are<00:04:00.480> all<00:04:00.600> the<00:04:00.690> pros<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:01.080> can<00:04:01.260> think

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
yeah those are all the pros I can think

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.800 
yeah those are all the pros I can think
of<00:04:01.560> right<00:04:01.709> now<00:04:01.769> now<00:04:02.610> for<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.000> cons<00:04:03.239> I<00:04:03.540> really

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
of right now now for the cons I really

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.320 
of right now now for the cons I really
don't<00:04:03.989> have<00:04:04.170> any<00:04:04.620> cons<00:04:05.400> that<00:04:05.670> I<00:04:05.790> can<00:04:05.940> think<00:04:06.150> of

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
don't have any cons that I can think of

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.360 
don't have any cons that I can think of
well<00:04:06.720> I<00:04:06.780> do<00:04:06.870> have<00:04:07.170> one<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.650> only<00:04:07.830> thing<00:04:08.070> that<00:04:08.280> I

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
well I do have one the only thing that I

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.810 
well I do have one the only thing that I
can<00:04:08.549> think<00:04:08.850> of<00:04:09.090> is<00:04:09.540> if<00:04:10.350> you<00:04:10.560> can<00:04:10.860> see<00:04:11.190> right

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
can think of is if you can see right

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.500 
can think of is if you can see right
here<00:04:12.440> maybe<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.590> camera<00:04:13.799> to<00:04:13.860> focus<00:04:14.030> um<00:04:15.030> it

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
here maybe the camera to focus um it

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.930 
here maybe the camera to focus um it
just<00:04:15.570> has<00:04:15.900> this<00:04:16.229> little<00:04:16.650> grip<00:04:16.979> that<00:04:17.370> has<00:04:17.609> like

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
just has this little grip that has like

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.909 
just has this little grip that has like
one<00:04:18.209> gallon<00:04:18.510> it<00:04:18.959> used<00:04:19.169> to<00:04:19.260> be<00:04:19.349> a<00:04:19.380> bucket<00:04:19.560> that's

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
one gallon it used to be a bucket that's

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.080 
one gallon it used to be a bucket that's
why<00:04:19.979> I<00:04:20.010> thought<00:04:20.160> it's<00:04:20.340> a<00:04:20.400> bucket<00:04:20.700> because<00:04:20.820> it

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
why I thought it's a bucket because it

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.540 
why I thought it's a bucket because it
has<00:04:21.209> these<00:04:21.450> measurements<00:04:22.169> but<00:04:22.800> other

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
has these measurements but other

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.059 
has these measurements but other
that<00:04:23.729> there's<00:04:24.060> no<00:04:24.270> grips<00:04:24.569> on<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:24.930> wheel<00:04:25.050> so<00:04:25.440> my

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:26.069 
that there's no grips on the wheel so my

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:28.189 
that there's no grips on the wheel so my
hamsters<00:04:26.520> had<00:04:26.819> a<00:04:26.849> little<00:04:27.150> bit<00:04:27.300> of<00:04:27.479> a<00:04:27.720> hard<00:04:28.110> time

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
hamsters had a little bit of a hard time

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.460 
hamsters had a little bit of a hard time
at<00:04:28.860> first<00:04:29.599> getting<00:04:30.599> used<00:04:30.900> to<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.110> wheel<00:04:31.259> that

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
at first getting used to the wheel that

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.490 
at first getting used to the wheel that
kind<00:04:31.650> of<00:04:31.770> slipped<00:04:32.340> around<00:04:32.900> and<00:04:33.900> had<00:04:34.319> a<00:04:34.349> little

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
kind of slipped around and had a little

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.960 
kind of slipped around and had a little
bit<00:04:34.680> of<00:04:34.710> a<00:04:34.830> hard<00:04:34.979> time<00:04:35.009> getting<00:04:35.250> a<00:04:35.460> grip<00:04:35.639> of<00:04:35.699> it

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
bit of a hard time getting a grip of it

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.990 
bit of a hard time getting a grip of it
they<00:04:36.960> caught<00:04:37.229> on<00:04:37.259> really<00:04:37.740> fast<00:04:38.009> so<00:04:38.490> it's<00:04:38.819> not

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
they caught on really fast so it's not

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.559 
they caught on really fast so it's not
really

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:39.569 
really

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:41.540 
really
it<00:04:40.020> could<00:04:40.289> be<00:04:40.409> something<00:04:40.650> depending<00:04:41.220> on<00:04:41.400> the

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
it could be something depending on the

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.640 
it could be something depending on the
hamster<00:04:41.909> you<00:04:42.030> have<00:04:42.180> but<00:04:42.930> they<00:04:43.289> caught<00:04:43.500> on

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
hamster you have but they caught on

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.589 
hamster you have but they caught on
really<00:04:43.889> fast<00:04:44.159> and<00:04:44.370> they<00:04:44.460> they<00:04:44.789> go<00:04:45.000> really<00:04:45.270> fast

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
really fast and they they go really fast
