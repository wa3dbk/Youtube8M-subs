such<00:05:34.560> as<00:05:34.740> a<00:05:34.770> rock<00:05:35.070> I<00:05:35.430> saw<00:05:36.000> that<00:05:36.240> hope<00:05:36.570> could<00:05:36.900> be

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
such as a rock I saw that hope could be

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.590 
such as a rock I saw that hope could be
like<00:05:37.320> that<00:05:37.620> in<00:05:37.830> my<00:05:37.979> life<00:05:38.190> an<00:05:38.490> anchor<00:05:39.090> passing

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
like that in my life an anchor passing

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.630 
like that in my life an anchor passing
through<00:05:39.810> the<00:05:39.930> turmoil<00:05:40.470> and<00:05:40.770> instability<00:05:41.190> of

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
through the turmoil and instability of

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.420 
through the turmoil and instability of
this<00:05:41.850> life<00:05:42.150> and<00:05:42.390> fastened<00:05:43.380> forever<00:05:43.770> on<00:05:44.010> to<00:05:44.280> the

eternal rock of ages' Jesus as I

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.550 
eternal rock of ages' Jesus as I
reflected<00:05:48.060> on<00:05:48.180> this<00:05:48.390> however<00:05:48.840> I<00:05:49.140> realized

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
reflected on this however I realized

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.620 
reflected on this however I realized
there's<00:05:50.220> a<00:05:50.310> difference<00:05:50.760> between<00:05:50.910> hope<00:05:51.419> and

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
there's a difference between hope and

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.590 
there's a difference between hope and
wishful<00:05:52.050> thinking<00:05:52.530> reading<00:05:53.400> on<00:05:53.580> in<00:05:53.850> Hebrews<00:05:54.330> I

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
wishful thinking reading on in Hebrews I

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.230 
wishful thinking reading on in Hebrews I
saw<00:05:55.320> that<00:05:55.590> faith<00:05:55.919> is<00:05:56.220> the<00:05:56.460> substance<00:05:56.490> of

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
saw that faith is the substance of

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.870 
saw that faith is the substance of
things<00:05:57.300> hoped<00:05:57.690> for<00:05:58.080> the<00:05:58.530> kind<00:05:59.310> of<00:05:59.490> hope<00:05:59.700> I

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
things hoped for the kind of hope I

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.210 
things hoped for the kind of hope I
needed<00:06:00.330> as<00:06:00.510> an<00:06:00.660> anchor<00:06:01.050> had<00:06:01.320> to<00:06:01.500> be<00:06:01.650> based<00:06:01.890> on<00:06:02.190> a

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.370 
needed as an anchor had to be based on a
solid<00:06:02.789> foundation<00:06:02.970> of<00:06:03.570> faith<00:06:03.810> in<00:06:04.080> the

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
solid foundation of faith in the

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.730 
solid foundation of faith in the
statements<00:06:04.979> and<00:06:05.160> promises<00:06:05.789> of<00:06:06.030> God's<00:06:06.330> Word

statements and promises of God's Word
without<00:06:07.740> this<00:06:08.039> biblical<00:06:08.460> foundation<00:06:09.360> hope

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
without this biblical foundation hope

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.080 
without this biblical foundation hope
could<00:06:10.320> prove<00:06:10.620> to<00:06:10.650> be<00:06:10.890> nothing<00:06:11.430> but<00:06:11.640> wishful
