00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
to be winning this fact I think most of

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.870 
to be winning this fact I think most of
them<00:00:30.470> are<00:00:30.619> pretty<00:00:30.769> well<00:00:30.919> aware<00:00:31.310> of<00:00:31.369> that<00:00:31.550> they

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
them are pretty well aware of that they

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.330 
them are pretty well aware of that they
I<00:00:32.260> don't<00:00:33.260> think<00:00:33.410> are<00:00:33.500> really<00:00:33.620> ready<00:00:33.859> to<00:00:33.920> win

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
I don't think are really ready to win

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.880 
I don't think are really ready to win
they<00:00:35.030> just<00:00:35.180> want<00:00:35.329> to<00:00:35.390> do<00:00:35.480> it<00:00:35.600> to<00:00:35.719> succeed<00:00:36.170> I'm
