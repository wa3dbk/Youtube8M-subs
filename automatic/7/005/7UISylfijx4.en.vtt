sure<00:00:27.750> yay<00:00:28.140> were<00:00:28.320> hoping<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:29.490> course<00:00:29.519> as

sure yay were hoping and of course as
was<00:00:30.390> expected<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.170> largely<00:00:31.560> due<00:00:31.650> to

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
was expected this is largely due to

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.650 
was expected this is largely due to
server<00:00:32.340> load<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.120> fact<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.510> game

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
server load and the fact that the game

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.590 
server load and the fact that the game
does<00:00:33.899> require<00:00:34.140> always<00:00:34.680> online<00:00:34.920> connectivity

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
does require always online connectivity

does require always online connectivity
the<00:00:36.600> main<00:00:36.780> problem<00:00:37.020> here<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.710> very<00:00:38.010> similar<00:00:38.280> to

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
the main problem here is very similar to

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.979 
the main problem here is very similar to
diablo<00:00:38.850> 3's<00:00:39.180> launched<00:00:39.420> about<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.690> year<00:00:39.960> ago

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
it's actually plagued by some very

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.430 
it's actually plagued by some very
similar<00:00:41.790> problems<00:00:42.329> both<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> games

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
similar problems both of the games

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.799 
similar problems both of the games
introduced<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.250> always<00:00:44.579> online<00:00:44.850> necessity

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
introduced that always online necessity

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.810 
introduced that always online necessity
to<00:00:45.960> play<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.410> game<00:00:46.590> which<00:00:46.890> was<00:00:47.070> not<00:00:47.280> very<00:00:47.579> well

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
to play the game which was not very well

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
received before the launch even and then

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.709 
received before the launch even and then
once<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.610> game<00:00:50.760> was<00:00:50.940> launched<00:00:51.420> they<00:00:51.660> were

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
once the game was launched they were

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.240 
once the game was launched they were
obviously<00:00:51.899> problems<00:00:52.559> with<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.739> server<00:00:52.890> load

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
obviously problems with the server load

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.459 
obviously problems with the server load
people<00:00:54.090> are<00:00:54.210> unable<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.690> get<00:00:54.809> online<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.110> even

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.260 
fixed when I go to the game up last
night<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.470> managed<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.920> do<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:32.520> fine<00:01:32.790> it

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
night I managed to do it in just fine it

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.390 
night I managed to do it in just fine it
defaulted<00:01:33.780> me<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.079> an<00:01:34.170> overseas<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:34.860> because<00:01:35.220> I

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
defaulted me to an overseas so because I

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.520 
defaulted me to an overseas so because I
guess<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.790> local<00:01:36.270> server<00:01:36.479> full<00:01:37.110> but<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.409> was

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
guess the local server full but that was

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.170 
guess the local server full but that was
fine<00:01:37.770> didn't<00:01:38.070> impact<00:01:38.250> my<00:01:38.460> plane<00:01:38.700> town<00:01:38.909> at<00:01:39.030> all

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
fine didn't impact my plane town at all

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.060 
fine didn't impact my plane town at all
and<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.930> worked<00:01:40.110> out<00:01:40.259> great<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:40.619> as<00:01:40.890> long<00:01:41.009> as

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
and it worked out great so as long as

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.679 
and it worked out great so as long as
the<00:01:41.220> games<00:01:41.369> actually<00:01:41.579> loading<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.360> remaining

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
the games actually loading and remaining

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.870 
the games actually loading and remaining
connected<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.290> working<00:01:43.530> out<00:01:43.590> really<00:01:43.829> well<00:01:43.950> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
connected to working out really well the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.490 
connected to working out really well the
problem<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.479> with<00:01:45.750> these<00:01:45.930> constant

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
problem is that with these constant

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.410 
problem is that with these constant
disconnections<00:01:47.070> when

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
disconnections when

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.570 
disconnections when
is<00:01:47.659> busy<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.170> not<00:01:48.770> being<00:01:48.950> able<00:01:49.040> to<00:01:49.250> learn<00:01:49.310> all

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
is busy and not being able to learn all

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.730 
is busy and not being able to learn all
along<00:01:50.119> with<00:01:50.270> problems<00:01:50.780> about<00:01:51.200> people<00:01:51.619> losing

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
along with problems about people losing

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.440 
along with problems about people losing
their<00:01:51.950> saved<00:01:52.280> our<00:01:52.490> people<00:01:52.759> losing<00:01:53.060> entire

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
their saved our people losing entire

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
their saved our people losing entire
cities<00:01:53.979> it's<00:01:54.979> just<00:01:55.430> not<00:01:56.020> nearly<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.229> launch

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
cities it's just not nearly the launch

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.170 
cities it's just not nearly the launch
they<00:01:57.649> could<00:01:57.799> have<00:01:57.890> wanted<00:01:58.070> it<00:01:58.159> to<00:01:58.280> be<00:01:58.399> and<00:01:59.060> I

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
they could have wanted it to be and I

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.179 
they could have wanted it to be and I
think<00:01:59.210> this<00:01:59.509> was<00:01:59.720> partially<00:02:00.049> to<00:02:00.409> be<00:02:00.530> expected

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
think this was partially to be expected

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.280 
think this was partially to be expected
again<00:02:01.790> like<00:02:02.000> diablo<00:02:02.420> three<00:02:02.750> people<00:02:03.170> were

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
again like diablo three people were

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.050 
again like diablo three people were
obviously<00:02:03.770> going<00:02:03.979> to<00:02:04.070> be<00:02:04.220> expecting<00:02:04.759> some

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
obviously going to be expecting some

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.460 
obviously going to be expecting some
sort<00:02:05.090> of<00:02:05.390> problems<00:02:05.810> of<00:02:05.930> game<00:02:06.140> that<00:02:06.259> does

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
sort of problems of game that does

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.160 
sort of problems of game that does
require<00:02:06.680> online<00:02:07.280> connectivity<00:02:07.929> however<00:02:08.929> if

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
require online connectivity however if

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.660 
require online connectivity however if
they'd<00:02:09.319> only<00:02:09.410> just<00:02:09.649> put<00:02:09.860> in<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:09.979> single<00:02:10.369> player

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
they'd only just put in a single player

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:11.710 
they'd only just put in a single player
mode<00:02:10.880> we<00:02:11.030> could<00:02:11.150> have<00:02:11.239> at<00:02:11.300> least<00:02:11.330> play<00:02:11.660> it

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
mode we could have at least play it

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.540
