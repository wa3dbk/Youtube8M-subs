and my windows explorer
key<00:04:26.530> one<00:04:26.830> is<00:04:27.070> going<00:04:27.280> to<00:04:27.400> bring<00:04:27.670> up<00:04:27.850> Internet

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
key one is going to bring up Internet

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.210 
key one is going to bring up Internet
Explorer<00:04:28.660> and<00:04:28.870> if<00:04:28.960> it's<00:04:29.110> not<00:04:29.170> already<00:04:29.740> open<00:04:29.890> it

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
Explorer and if it's not already open it

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.020 
Explorer and if it's not already open it
will<00:04:30.340> launch<00:04:30.490> it<00:04:30.730> so<00:04:31.020> when<00:04:32.020> key<00:04:32.290> one<00:04:32.790> when<00:04:33.790> key

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
will launch it so when key one when key

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.530 
will launch it so when key one when key
to<00:04:34.270> will<00:04:34.600> bring<00:04:35.170> up<00:04:35.410> or<00:04:35.650> launch<00:04:36.210> Chrome<00:04:37.210> and

to will bring up or launch Chrome and

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.750 
to will bring up or launch Chrome and
for<00:04:38.380> me<00:04:38.560> when<00:04:38.770> key<00:04:38.920> three<00:04:39.220> is<00:04:39.340> going<00:04:39.580> to<00:04:39.640> be

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
for me when key three is going to be

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.050 
for me when key three is going to be
sublime<00:04:40.030> text<00:04:40.450> and<00:04:41.040> when<00:04:42.040> key<00:04:42.280> for<00:04:42.640> is<00:04:42.850> going

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
sublime text and when key for is going

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.270 
sublime text and when key for is going
to<00:04:43.120> be<00:04:43.180> powershell<00:04:44.010> so<00:04:45.010> that<00:04:45.160> would

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
to be powershell so that would

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.490 
to be powershell so that would
essentially<00:04:45.970> bring<00:04:46.270> up<00:04:46.450> any<00:04:46.720> application

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
essentially bring up any application

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.220 
essentially bring up any application
that<00:04:47.530> you<00:04:47.740> have<00:04:47.980> down<00:04:48.340> in<00:04:49.060> your<00:04:49.600> start<00:04:50.080> bar

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
that you have down in your start bar

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.620 
that you have down in your start bar
pinned<00:04:50.560> its<00:04:51.370> like<00:04:51.520> before<00:04:51.670> if<00:04:52.150> you<00:04:52.330> hit

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
pinned its like before if you hit

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.080 
pinned its like before if you hit
windows<00:04:53.290> are<00:04:53.710> that<00:04:54.370> is<00:04:54.550> going<00:04:54.760> to<00:04:54.820> bring<00:04:54.880> up

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
windows are that is going to bring up

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.130 
windows are that is going to bring up
your<00:04:55.210> run<00:04:55.450> command<00:04:57.420> and<00:04:58.420> that<00:04:58.570> also<00:04:58.750> works

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
your run command and that also works

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.020 
your run command and that also works
from<00:04:59.350> within<00:04:59.650> the<00:04:59.770> start<00:05:00.010> experience<00:05:00.460> itself

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
from within the start experience itself

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:09.210 
from within the start experience itself
so<00:05:01.390> windows<00:05:01.690> are<00:05:01.900> run<00:05:02.380> command<00:05:05.580> and<00:05:08.070> you<00:05:09.070> can

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
so windows are run command and you can

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.860 
so windows are run command and you can
run<00:05:09.400> whatever<00:05:09.550> commands<00:05:10.000> you<00:05:10.330> used<00:05:10.660> to<00:05:10.780> be
