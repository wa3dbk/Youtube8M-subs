 dude who immediately starts to enjoy it 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.739
 sit down but let 's take a look 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.879
 where the and emmies can come from 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.370
 now one from there 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.590
 yes, they are the one there 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.120

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.420

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.649
 gladly up to you 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.670
 So let's see where the throat is now 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.090
 maybe he sat down here no me 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:04.080
 saw how he just sits behind someone 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:07.729
 next to death and we mouth and they sit 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.729
 just all around the shows the Kempen 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:22.130
 and i have them that is 1 plus 2 plus 3 and 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.130
 reload and take it easy 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:31.050
 wow wow you are pro wou 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.180
 packed shit 0 holy shit well in everyone 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.750
 taking a case is not very good either 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.750
 that's him 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.270
 let's see where the and emmy's come from 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.270
 because they have one again 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.790
 he just wanted to sit with his iron 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.760
 and I know I have super sweet once 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.230
 healthier with the bedspread times done on stupid 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.460
 but then again it's just sucks if you 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.350
 that gets up and this can't be right 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.630
 I shot much earlier and I have p90 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.160
 with rapid fire sizer 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.160
 but good will be my fault 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.869
 observers do poor home article and 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.570
 that is him 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.440
 and I already saw one walking here and me 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.440
 get shot at behind me 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:23.330

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.330

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.280
 that he stupid him hard 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.460

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.170

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.580
 then again ksg or something 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.200
 and somehow 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.750
 my bullets don't register but well 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.290
 I'll be okay 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.440

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.380

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.920
 in and I have the only thing with rapid fire 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.920
