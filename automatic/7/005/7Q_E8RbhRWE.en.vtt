00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
is still very impressive it's able to

quality is also top-notch I mean it's

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.550

just<00:04:33.460> really<00:04:33.700> nice<00:04:33.910> to<00:04:33.970> look<00:04:34.330> at<00:04:34.510> the<00:04:35.170> z3v

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
just really nice to look at the z3v

stabilization<00:04:39.610> but<00:04:40.330> it<00:04:40.450> still<00:04:40.660> manages<00:04:40.780> to

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140

which<00:04:43.480> is<00:04:43.690> pretty<00:04:43.900> impressive<00:04:44.170> considering

uses<00:04:57.940> the<00:04:58.180> same<00:04:58.420> camera<00:04:58.810> sensor<00:04:59.140> found<00:04:59.440> on<00:04:59.650> the

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
uses the same camera sensor found on the

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.310 
uses the same camera sensor found on the
Xperia<00:05:00.220> z2<00:05:00.540> instead<00:05:01.540> of<00:05:01.630> the<00:05:01.750> newer<00:05:01.960> and

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
Xperia z2 instead of the newer and

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.500 
Xperia z2 instead of the newer and
improved<00:05:02.740> camera<00:05:03.070> sensor<00:05:03.550> on<00:05:03.670> the<00:05:03.790> z3

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
improved camera sensor on the z3

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.450 
improved camera sensor on the z3
so<00:05:04.960> basically<00:05:05.440> image<00:05:05.800> quality<00:05:06.010> could<00:05:06.430> be

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
so basically image quality could be

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.550 
so basically image quality could be
better<00:05:06.850> it's<00:05:07.240> great<00:05:07.510> now<00:05:07.690> but<00:05:08.170> it<00:05:08.260> could<00:05:08.440> be

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
better it's great now but it could be

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.100 
better it's great now but it could be
even<00:05:08.620> better<00:05:08.890> with<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:09.310> z3<00:05:09.580> sensor<00:05:10.180> and<00:05:10.390> I

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
even better with the z3 sensor and I

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.230 
even better with the z3 sensor and I
mentioned<00:05:11.470> these<00:05:11.680> iii-v<00:05:12.310> does<00:05:12.610> have<00:05:12.850> a<00:05:12.880> couple

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
of unique features one of them is that

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.970 
of unique features one of them is that
it<00:05:15.340> actually<00:05:15.490> has<00:05:15.820> a<00:05:16.060> larger<00:05:16.570> 3200<00:05:17.530> milliamp<00:05:17.919> a

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
it actually has a larger 3200 milliamp a

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.920 
it actually has a larger 3200 milliamp a
battery<00:05:18.280> inside<00:05:18.640> the<00:05:19.270> other<00:05:19.390> is<00:05:19.600> that<00:05:19.750> it

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
battery inside the other is that it

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.630 
battery inside the other is that it

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
but battery life on here is really good

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.740 
but battery life on here is really good
as<00:05:27.100> you<00:05:27.130> can<00:05:27.310> see<00:05:27.550> I<00:05:27.580> can<00:05:27.910> easily<00:05:28.030> get<00:05:28.270> one<00:05:28.540> day

my phone and if I really need to squeeze

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.870 
my phone and if I really need to squeeze
out<00:05:34.990> every<00:05:35.169> last<00:05:35.350> drop<00:05:35.919> of<00:05:36.100> battery<00:05:36.400> life<00:05:36.550> they

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
out every last drop of battery life they

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.150 
out every last drop of battery life they
have<00:05:37.060> an<00:05:37.240> ultra<00:05:37.600> stamina<00:05:38.080> mode<00:05:38.230> which<00:05:38.770> creates

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
have an ultra stamina mode which creates

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.640 
have an ultra stamina mode which creates
more<00:05:39.250> efficient<00:05:39.910> power<00:05:40.150> consumption<00:05:40.870> and<00:05:41.080> so

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
more efficient power consumption and so

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.770 
more efficient power consumption and so
overall<00:05:41.979> standby<00:05:42.550> time<00:05:42.760> is<00:05:42.940> great<00:05:43.180> wireless
