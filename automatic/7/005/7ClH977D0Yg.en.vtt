because of the building walls look for

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.590 
because of the building walls look for

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
site do I have to turn the steering

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.710 
site do I have to turn the steering
wheel<00:00:50.739> and<00:00:50.920> backing<00:00:51.280> up<00:00:51.430> people<00:00:52.420> tend<00:00:52.660> to

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
wheel and backing up people tend to

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.260 
wheel and backing up people tend to
believe<00:00:52.900> that<00:00:53.380> for<00:00:53.800> example<00:00:54.280> if<00:00:54.670> you<00:00:55.000> want<00:00:55.180> to

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
believe that for example if you want to

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.390 
believe that for example if you want to
back<00:00:55.480> up<00:00:55.690> to<00:00:55.840> the<00:00:55.960> right<00:00:56.140> we<00:00:56.800> have<00:00:56.950> to<00:00:57.070> turn<00:00:57.250> the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
back up to the right we have to turn the

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.400 
back up to the right we have to turn the
wheel<00:00:57.430> to<00:00:57.580> the<00:00:57.760> left<00:00:58.020> meaning<00:00:59.020> we<00:00:59.110> have<00:00:59.260> to

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
wheel to the left meaning we have to

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.140 
wheel to the left meaning we have to
invert<00:00:59.710> the<00:00:59.920> way<00:01:00.070> we<00:01:00.250> turn<00:01:00.400> the<00:01:00.550> wheel<00:01:00.760> since

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
invert the way we turn the wheel since

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.630 
invert the way we turn the wheel since
we're<00:01:01.360> backing<00:01:01.750> up<00:01:01.870> it's<00:01:02.199> very<00:01:02.530> simple<00:01:03.010> you

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
we're backing up it's very simple you

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.070 
we're backing up it's very simple you
always<00:01:03.970> turn<00:01:04.150> the<00:01:04.300> steering<00:01:04.540> wheel<00:01:04.720> to<00:01:04.900> the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
always turn the steering wheel to the

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.260 
always turn the steering wheel to the
side<00:01:05.379> where<00:01:05.590> you<00:01:05.620> want<00:01:05.890> to<00:01:06.010> go<00:01:06.160> no<00:01:06.820> matter<00:01:07.090> if

side where you want to go no matter if
you're<00:01:07.420> backing<00:01:07.659> up<00:01:07.960> or<00:01:08.200> moving<00:01:08.530> forward<00:01:08.920> if<00:01:09.159> I

you're backing up or moving forward if I

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.280 
you're backing up or moving forward if I
turn<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.790> wheel<00:01:09.820> to<00:01:10.120> the<00:01:10.180> left<00:01:10.270> I<00:01:10.750> move

back up to the left - if I turn the

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.220 
back up to the left - if I turn the

wheel especially when doing 90 degrees
spark<00:01:42.030> exists<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.690> wouldn't<00:01:43.380> know<00:01:43.470> if<00:01:43.620> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
spark exists I wouldn't know if the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.920 
spark exists I wouldn't know if the
wheels<00:01:44.010> are<00:01:44.160> straight<00:01:44.490> for<00:01:45.300> the<00:01:45.390> wheels<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.810> be

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
wheels are straight for the wheels to be

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.020 
wheels are straight for the wheels to be
straight<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.860> steering<00:01:47.280> wheel<00:01:47.430> also<00:01:47.640> has<00:01:47.760> to

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
straight the steering wheel also has to

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.580 
straight the steering wheel also has to
be<00:01:48.180> straight<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:49.110> there<00:01:49.260> are<00:01:49.380> three

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
be straight but there are three

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.050 
be straight but there are three
positions<00:01:50.100> where<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.400> steering<00:01:50.760> wheel<00:01:50.910> can

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
positions where the steering wheel can

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.200 
positions where the steering wheel can
be<00:01:51.240> straight<00:01:51.509> wheel<00:01:52.380> straight<00:01:52.860> one<00:01:53.790> turn<00:01:54.000> to

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
be straight wheel straight one turn to

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.890 
be straight wheel straight one turn to
the<00:01:54.330> left<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.780> one<00:01:55.530> turn<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.100> right<00:01:56.270> so<00:01:57.270> to

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
the left and one turn to the right so to

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.719 
the left and one turn to the right so to
know<00:01:58.050> if<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.320> wheels<00:01:58.530> are<00:01:58.740> straight<00:01:58.920> we

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
know if the wheels are straight we

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.130 
know if the wheels are straight we

forward a bit if we go straight it means

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.229
