00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.309

 then if you do not know the truth very easy 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.140

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.660
 It does not matter 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.270
 we can look like this installed this 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.600
 in this way I did not do it as you see 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.580

 North is caesar creator gardi 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.020
 here you have to change the route 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:49.740
 of destination and in my case will be the 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.740
 folders that says to be in a following 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.140
 not the next one next here you 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.620
 they will just expect 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.520
 to fill is bar 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.800
 you have to finish loading after what 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.280
 who is going to face this series then 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.070

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.500
 the nose in hd so that it looks very very 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.900
 good not 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.430
 Well, everything will continue and later 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.579
 we will pass gameplays 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.780
 Of course they are going to make gameplays 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:25.209
 commented and 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.209
 there will be a variety of games 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:32.120
 like the one that says copyright 2012 caesar 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.850
 yard 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.520
 well this to give 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:43.310
 such credits to him because he is the 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.659
 creator and for the truth yes yes it raffled 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.109
 I forgot one thing too 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:52.740
 they are going to use this mode do not expect demon 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:54.900
 fitz yes yes 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:58.950
 gta are going to start happening 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:02.610
 the textures and forms already active is the 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.940
 afraid of how to do it for how to do 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.700
 so you do not make fun of textures and 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.380
 going to do percent function speak for 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.380
 the truth if then to serve 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:20.910
 we hope that it ends here 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.910
 How would I win? 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:36.920
 and it's already finished in the folder where 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:42.040
 they chose and normal to do all 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.040
 those files the elections 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:49.730
 this is so that it does not give any kind of 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:55.629
 mistake and the first thing we're going to do is 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.629

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:06.520

 then forgive you for the voice that I have 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:07.750
 a little hoarse but 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:10.750
 when I make these applications of all 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.660
 the files but when they are selected 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.820

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.270
 here in our folder is enough of subject 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.270
 of 9 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:27.190
 in your good with this you already had already 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:30.820
 they would have installed their toy 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:35.710
