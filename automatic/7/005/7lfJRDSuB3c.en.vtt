you've<00:00:13.420> been<00:00:13.570> following<00:00:13.719> the<00:00:14.020> build<00:00:14.230> of<00:00:14.380> the

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 
you've been following the build of the

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.289 
you've been following the build of the
Astro<00:00:14.799> doll<00:00:15.010> you<00:00:15.129> know<00:00:15.160> the<00:00:15.520> back<00:00:16.000> wall<00:00:16.270> of

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
Astro doll you know the back wall of

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.600 
Astro doll you know the back wall of
this<00:00:16.540> box<00:00:16.810> can<00:00:17.590> be<00:00:17.740> moved<00:00:17.980> to<00:00:18.160> adjust<00:00:18.460> for

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:18.610 
this box can be moved to adjust for

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.990 
this box can be moved to adjust for
volume<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.810> in<00:00:20.140> order<00:00:20.470> to<00:00:20.529> get<00:00:20.710> back<00:00:20.890> to<00:00:21.520> the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
volume so in order to get back to the

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.710 
volume so in order to get back to the
box<00:00:22.770> we<00:00:23.770> have<00:00:23.800> mega<00:00:24.189> so<00:00:24.430> the<00:00:24.820> amp<00:00:25.240> rack<00:00:25.420> could

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
box we have mega so the amp rack could

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.569 
box we have mega so the amp rack could
be<00:00:25.869> moved<00:00:26.220> obviously<00:00:27.220> if<00:00:27.279> you<00:00:27.340> have<00:00:27.430> to<00:00:27.520> do

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:27.579 
be moved obviously if you have to do

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.880 
be moved obviously if you have to do
that<00:00:27.730> show<00:00:27.910> that'd<00:00:28.119> be<00:00:28.210> very<00:00:28.239> difficult<00:00:28.890> it's

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
that show that'd be very difficult it's

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.319 
that show that'd be very difficult it's
very<00:00:29.919> heavy

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
very heavy

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.440 
very heavy
it's<00:00:31.660> around<00:00:32.169> a<00:00:32.320> hundred<00:00:32.619> and<00:00:32.829> fifty<00:00:33.450> 170

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
it's around a hundred and fifty 170

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.860 
it's around a hundred and fifty 170
pounds<00:00:34.870> with<00:00:35.860> all<00:00:36.040> the<00:00:36.340> the<00:00:36.790> wood<00:00:36.970> and<00:00:37.239> amps

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
pounds with all the the wood and amps

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.530 
pounds with all the the wood and amps
wire<00:00:38.230> all<00:00:38.470> that<00:00:38.649> so<00:00:39.610> in<00:00:40.059> order<00:00:40.180> to<00:00:40.329> make<00:00:40.420> that

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
wire all that so in order to make that

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.299 
wire all that so in order to make that
easy

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
easy

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.760 
easy
we<00:00:42.309> made<00:00:42.489> it<00:00:42.520> motorized<00:00:43.060> and<00:00:43.530> if<00:00:44.530> you<00:00:44.680> know

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
we made it motorized and if you know

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.350 
we made it motorized and if you know
anything<00:00:44.950> about<00:00:44.980> motorization<00:00:45.640> you<00:00:46.180> can<00:00:46.270> go

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
anything about motorization you can go

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.540 
anything about motorization you can go
one<00:00:46.600> of<00:00:46.690> two<00:00:46.720> ways<00:00:46.960> with<00:00:47.230> it<00:00:47.380> you<00:00:47.980> can<00:00:48.100> go<00:00:48.220> fast

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
one of two ways with it you can go fast

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.010 
one of two ways with it you can go fast
but<00:00:48.790> it<00:00:48.850> won't<00:00:48.970> be<00:00:49.030> very<00:00:49.210> strong<00:00:49.540> or<00:00:49.840> you<00:00:49.900> can

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
but it won't be very strong or you can

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.660 
but it won't be very strong or you can
go<00:00:50.110> strong<00:00:50.410> it'll<00:00:50.710> be<00:00:50.890> slower<00:00:51.190> they<00:00:51.460> use<00:00:51.610> the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
go strong it'll be slower they use the

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.160 
go strong it'll be slower they use the
same<00:00:51.790> motors<00:00:52.150> they<00:00:52.300> change<00:00:52.570> the<00:00:52.660> gearing<00:00:52.960> in

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
same motors they change the gearing in

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.200 
same motors they change the gearing in
it<00:00:53.290> so<00:00:53.890> in<00:00:54.010> this<00:00:54.100> case<00:00:54.280> it<00:00:54.430> is<00:00:54.460> kind<00:00:54.880> of<00:00:54.940> slow<00:00:55.180> to

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
it so in this case it is kind of slow to

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.390 
it so in this case it is kind of slow to
support<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:55.900> weight<00:00:56.079> but<00:00:57.040> it<00:00:57.130> is<00:00:57.250> very

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
support the weight but it is very

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.430 
support the weight but it is very
effective<00:00:57.850> so<00:00:57.910> we<00:00:58.000> can<00:00:58.090> get<00:00:58.210> back<00:00:58.570> to<00:00:59.020> the<00:00:59.200> back

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
effective so we can get back to the back

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:38.220 
effective so we can get back to the back
of<00:00:59.560> the<00:00:59.650> box<00:00:59.829> and<00:01:00.100> wiring<00:01:01.030> if<00:01:01.180> we<00:01:01.270> need<00:01:01.420> to

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.510 

so<00:01:39.230> now<00:01:39.380> I<00:01:39.410> have<00:01:39.680> access<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.010> the<00:01:40.190> back<00:01:40.310> of<00:01:40.460> the

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
so now I have access to the back of the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.120 
so now I have access to the back of the
box<00:01:40.700> I<00:01:41.090> just<00:01:41.840> have<00:01:41.930> to<00:01:42.020> get<00:01:42.110> over<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.440> battery

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
box I just have to get over the battery

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.190 
box I just have to get over the battery
bank<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:43.610> I<00:01:44.150> can<00:01:44.240> get<00:01:44.330> to<00:01:44.420> all<00:01:44.510> the<00:01:44.630> wiring<00:01:44.810> or

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
bank and I can get to all the wiring or

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.480 
bank and I can get to all the wiring or
the<00:01:45.290> back<00:01:45.440> of<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:45.650> box<00:01:45.830> or<00:01:46.040> anything<00:01:46.340> back

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
the back of the box or anything back

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.960 
the back of the box or anything back
there<00:01:47.410> and<00:01:48.410> it'd<00:01:48.530> all<00:01:48.590> be<00:01:48.800> safe<00:01:49.010> because<00:01:49.250> these

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
there and it'd all be safe because these

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.540 
there and it'd all be safe because these
actuators<00:01:50.930> were<00:01:51.170> actually<00:01:51.500> hold<00:01:51.710> 400<00:01:52.250> pounds

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
actuators were actually hold 400 pounds

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.510 
actuators were actually hold 400 pounds
of<00:01:52.610> each<00:01:53.080> dead<00:01:54.080> weight<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:54.560> they<00:01:55.100> can<00:01:55.250> lift

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
of each dead weight and they can lift

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.820 
of each dead weight and they can lift
200<00:01:56.000> pounds<00:01:56.330> that<00:01:56.750> I've<00:01:56.840> got<00:01:57.020> two<00:01:57.229> of<00:01:57.380> them<00:01:57.560> so

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
200 pounds that I've got two of them so

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.520 
200 pounds that I've got two of them so
I'm<00:01:57.950> well<00:01:58.340> in<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.580> clear<00:01:58.850> for<00:01:59.810> anything<00:02:00.290> I'll

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
I'm well in the clear for anything I'll

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.469 
I'm well in the clear for anything I'll
have<00:02:00.680> on<00:02:00.830> here<00:02:01.160> it'll<00:02:01.610> be<00:02:01.790> safe<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:02.180> easy<00:02:02.330> to

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
have on here it'll be safe and easy to

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:03.730 
have on here it'll be safe and easy to
get<00:02:02.630> back<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:02.900> anything<00:02:03.170> I<00:02:03.260> can<00:02:03.440> do<00:02:03.530> it<00:02:03.650> by

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
get back to anything I can do it by
