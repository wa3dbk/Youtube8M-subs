00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.639 
I think with hair a woman's biggest
mistake<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.750> they<00:02:03.899> either<00:02:04.049> try<00:02:04.380> too<00:02:04.439> hard

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
mistake is that they either try too hard

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.789 
mistake is that they either try too hard
or<00:02:05.219> they<00:02:06.090> just<00:02:06.119> think<00:02:06.780> it's<00:02:06.990> not<00:02:07.110> worth<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.590> so

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
or they just think it's not worth it so

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.499 
or they just think it's not worth it so
they<00:02:07.920> don't<00:02:08.069> put<00:02:08.250> any<00:02:08.459> effort<00:02:08.670> into<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.450> I

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
they don't put any effort into it and I

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.270 
they don't put any effort into it and I
think<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.869> there<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.080> an<00:02:10.289> in-between<00:02:10.770> find

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
think that there is an in-between find

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.100 
think that there is an in-between find
the<00:02:11.459> right

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
the right

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.610 
the right
find<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.100> right<00:02:13.250> stylist<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.150> colorist<00:02:14.690> and

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
find the right stylist and colorist and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.590 
find the right stylist and colorist and
you<00:02:16.250> could<00:02:16.430> really<00:02:16.610> make<00:02:16.760> your<00:02:17.030> hair<00:02:17.270> in<00:02:17.450> its

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
you could really make your hair in its

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.050 
you could really make your hair in its
natural<00:02:17.660> texture<00:02:18.350> look<00:02:18.590> amazing<00:02:19.130> on<00:02:19.220> you<00:02:19.430> one

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
natural texture look amazing on you one

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.670 
natural texture look amazing on you one
thing<00:02:20.420> I<00:02:20.690> think<00:02:20.750> every<00:02:21.230> woman<00:02:21.470> should<00:02:21.620> have

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
thing I think every woman should have

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.030 
thing I think every woman should have
this<00:02:22.040> fall<00:02:22.340> is<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:23.120> tuxedo<00:02:23.540> jacket<00:02:23.990> a<00:02:24.170> black<00:02:24.740> or

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
this fall is a tuxedo jacket a black or

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.160 
this fall is a tuxedo jacket a black or
a<00:02:25.100> white<00:02:25.370> one<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:26.030> I<00:02:26.510> think<00:02:26.660> it<00:02:26.960> makes

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
a white one and I think it makes

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.900 
a white one and I think it makes
everything<00:02:27.440> looks<00:02:27.740> chic<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:28.190> elegant<00:02:28.400> people

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
everything looks chic and elegant people

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.870 
everything looks chic and elegant people
