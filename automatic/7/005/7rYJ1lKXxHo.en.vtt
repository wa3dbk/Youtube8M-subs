00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.190
 We're coming back again 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.190
 to continue the model the modeling of tarragon 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:12.379
 and now we're going to model initially 

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:16.390
 the front leg 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.619
 before I want you to see the following ass reference image as 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.070
 I said earlier you only have 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.609
 he warned in the end different 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.369
 and this is not very good with regard to own pain pain 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.650
 that we are not using so what I heard it 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.070
 I hit a few ceding pictures of some animals day or decide how to do 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.490
 the front paw of the dragon 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.839
 equal to the leg of the cerrato 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:47.839
 some make a difference for us we have notion 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.700
 the paw of the fleece is the performance 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.700
 three of them forward with their due guarantees 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.310
 between games are focused on 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.490
 only for one position 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.780
 ling have opposing thumb like we have in hand 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.759
 here is another reference image 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.510
 how would he become the pope too? 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.450
 Indian and rested 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.990
 even remembered a little in the cenimar our dragon this year 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.970
 with paw rested 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.400
 also wins more differentiated 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.400
 he with the wrong leg 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.050
 the following month gives a sense of the size of how it would 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.380
 the tough man bring us what we are going to do a meeting of bosses one day that 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.400
 I've opened with the exception of one 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.260
 and here too 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.700
 mantra giving us laughter we have the notion of how it will be for every citizen 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.570
 I'm going to do this part, but if you want to do it 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.040
 otherwise no problem, including for example thinking about 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.679
 make a cheeky paw with the right forearm 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.869
 would give 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.000
 the front paw what they want are three claws facing forward 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.520
 and one facing backwards 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.520
 only to save time 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.129
 and also be faster 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.840
 today quickly shows the modeling I'm going to make of veloster's production 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.359
 only three claws facing forward with no mutu bid behind or 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.119
 any other detail 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:24.999
 and those are the ones that will be our reference image 

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:31.909
 What I'm going to do initially was do one of three times 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.100
 do more if you need to be two turrets 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:46.859
 under the leg 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.059
 so I'm going to leave here 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:52.799
 minimized st 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.799
 and I will go 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.339
 put on 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:59.339
 all this to ensure visible 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.109
 the selected one of maria 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.239
 press h 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.239
 but who visits 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.719
 puts top view and options would be the 5 chistian 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:16.169
 the circles 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:19.619
 these days I've done some tests before 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:22.289
 to know how it is and how it would be better 

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:25.199
 positioned the year 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:31.309
 the most developed and geophysical relation of - were five or six 

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:32.389
 times 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:37.090
 will not hurt later because after as it was applied common modifiers 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.969
 only this is my address at the surf fest 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:45.629
 In addition to the cycling of Christianity if it rains this will give no problem 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.959
 P 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.429
 seems to be a business of this 

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:56.469
 only come back because our vision and called to stagger here 

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:58.989
 incisive 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.399
 autarchy lot h to go back show all I'll make a copy 

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:07.579
 dc if he gets more here 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.279
 Let's go to the dragon. 

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:11.439
 I'll give you a tpm chip. 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:13.829
 I heard here 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.519
 leave it here differently now yes back make it all visible 

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:20.989
 It can make work easier. 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.989
 to kill 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.909
 are 1 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:31.199
 so it needs some 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.199
 like this 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.909
 I have a slight I'm going to do it 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:40.499
 boy 

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:43.330
 the finantia 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.059
 moreover, on the stairway that wore a diminutive one on the rio-sampa axis 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:50.069
 to the point of one with this 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:52.580
 and here as siege day 16 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.969
 phases 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:56.969
 she still notice a month and a half right at the time that I was going to continue 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:02.219
 irony or are you fixing it here 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:06.249
 this cycle is greater than 8 hours and 508 times 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:10.469
 they have their ends these two months here 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.740
 so what I'm going to do 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.229
 the six months 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.610
 and it was the general so that this deficit that this end 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:27.490
 parallel 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.219
 those that those these two packs felt the eight-stage cycle 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:34.849
 in eight of them 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:38.580
 As cheap as you live here, I'll get a lot closer to the vision. 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.909
 here i am the case on top of the z-axis 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.259
 only I'm not going digital amount because I do not know then who has to 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:49.059
 be good of an infusion grab them to weigh and thalis up 

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:52.639
 and who else needs to understand training notice that the beautification of the small 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.240
 deformation of the mogillar a little bit 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.190
 made a new training generated millimetric thing right here 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:07.509
 it's still not good, I'm going to get a little closer to the vision 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.300
 including all the information that in life showing 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.419
 we will direct Nazi luiz inacio lula da silva santos the most beautiful 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:21.220
 and in addition also went up then it means that here is a good position we go 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:24.219
 Confirm 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:26.349
 now 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:30.340
 is not that leaves a prediction of anything now let's get a musician too 

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:33.639
 sensitive systems are setting here 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:38.810
 teaching chiesse shafts 90 degrees does not get totally straight 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.629
 now to aguiar 

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:46.629
 Just checked the time here. 

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:51.599
 I'll close the structure and awlaki 

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:53.569
 this first part of the hand 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:57.569
 because our time finishing what it has indicating that it acts close to 7 8 

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:00.039
 minutes then next time we'll start 

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:02.279
 the bbc modeling 

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:03.629
 starting 

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:09.099
 this six-sided deficit of six races took five out of six months 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.930
 It shows how we're going to do it. 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.639
 one of the claws of the velociraptor 

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:18.639
 each of the fingers and then the claws and then 

00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:22.299
 in the next tutorial we will continue
