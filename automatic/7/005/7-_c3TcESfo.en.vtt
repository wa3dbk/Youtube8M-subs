00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.340
 montebourg which is the cause 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.340
 you like 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.790
 hello to all and scrivens authors 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.439
 of today for a video a little 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.950
 special a little different from usual 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.430
 already because you see and I have not 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.689
 the habit 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.060
 and yes I have a good honest I'm not 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.470
 styled sim young people the real but 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.570
 it's just to show me all that 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.109
 I have the video will talk about gestures 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.210
 techniques 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:36.980
 it took me a while to get out of the castle 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:39.309
 all how I went there we are opposed to him 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.309
 flows 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.320
 2 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.590
 an episode 3 technical gesture of the most 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.320
 useful up to the most whimsical we 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.100
 call it expectations and say that by 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.300
 example his fantasies 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.070
 Yesterday it's good when you do not miss 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.040
 do a tutorial and you miss it here 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.140
 it's fantasy and in addition I had 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.360
 not even so we left the gesture the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.250
 more used and I find in my opinion the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.409
 more useful in in fifa anyway 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.420
 on the 15 the players are very fast 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.640
 defenders subject to a lot unless 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:34.380
 you now obviously want to go there 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:35.460
 you break your balls this thing that 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.610
 I have it breaks my balls 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.229
 juncker it's going to be roulette then 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.210
 I hope the point of view will be good 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.190
 on the net if not I explain you a 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.869
 little bit do you imagine that this joystick 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.600
 this is a clock 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.509
 the crowd is actually you take six 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.940
 hours until noon you make a 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.420
 half arc of a circle like that for 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.429
 the right 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.310
 if you want to go to the left you 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.869
 take charge of the circle from 6am to noon 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.209
 in the sense simply that's it 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.640
 a roulette more simply 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.720
 so that's it's a very easy gesture 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.550
 very effective because what it takes 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.590
 know is when it's effective is 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.200
 that it's easy to do for example this 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.060
 gesture effective but not always 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.640
 easy to execute 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.720
 so me second very easy technique 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.330
 I think he does not hurt who the 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.080
 know the feint of typing a little 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.030
 modified the scooter that's how the 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.200
 to do then I must explain 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.300
 this may be a little complicated to 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.560
 understand 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.670
 the basic strike shake it's me 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.800
 i'm using this because i always have 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.420
 to impress me like that but that's it 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.800
 I have my cb to work too 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.410
 b ah no it was bea where x saw two 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.800
 work and when we do the woman 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.599
 typing 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.340
 you're going to the side actually in the 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.319
 diagonals rather diagonal technique 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.489
 on the side it can make a choice 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.230
 side that to make go down of France 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.370
 during his walk also here is actually 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.480
 in the direction where you have them you 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.329
 makes trap drawings simply 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.650
 before it was running now 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.389
 because they go to bed 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.249
 crazy time had to go to work 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:07.319
 when I go astray 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:08.879
 so here is the scooter very easy because it 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.290
 is so much of the workout that can 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.989
 early month I was struggling to master 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.569
 but once you master it's fatal 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.919
 it's fatal and the last gesture 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.260
 technical that is not least 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:21.359
 since it is hyper use in all 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.889
 case we're going out two kobe passes 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.579
 transforms a little so that's what 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:27.269
 count stunters that's how 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.849
 mock-up pin's and the failures 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.989
 bouquiner wen against it by my 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.409
 predatory instinct you see I had 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.609
 want to score or there roulette 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:37.439
 at the cottage zidane I think I 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:40.040
 call him to sindia like that because that 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:42.750
 looks like that of zidane like that 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.879
 that's this crowd is there different from 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.409
 this one because that you do the 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.060
 all right and that's where you needed 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:51.629
 her side yes she looks a bit like a 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.549
 stop hunger price so how does 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:58.049
 rest to the panthers imagine that you 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:04:01.709
 are stopped at the top right all 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.989
 just here in the direction where 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.909
 you go if you know if you want 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.799
 know more precisely with the microphone 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.659
 between well in the direction where you 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.250
 so go there as I go on the 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.439
 left of my left screen and after I 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.790
 will their water here and bal'ouf 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:15.509
 direction you are going right now and the 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.130
 direction you and go 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:20.400
 knowing that it must be an art side if 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.570
 you do that is behind his wife I 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.710
 know click we'll see in the episode where 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.659
 besides that but I was a little girl 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.159
 very useful 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:28.409
 so stop hunter luggage where you have and 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:30.990
 the erection where you want to go so that 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:32.159
 actually allows players exceeded when 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.139
 you overflow on the sides for example 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:36.000
 like that you overflow someone you 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.909
 take on the hop side you eliminate it 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.800
 like that you come back you hit it's 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:42.659
 as simple as that simple that it has 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.550
 a gesture that strongly resembles 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:45.680
 but who practiced by the players four 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.050
 stars 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.300
 it's the grail the technique the little 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.039
 hole is to zidane two hits on the 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.570
 diagonal left hexagonal right in 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.449
 makes you you do it twice 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:01.100
 verbally it's been 5 hours and 7 hours 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:03.229
 at 5 am and at this hour that's all 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.970
 simply these same principles that 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:06.940
 stephen jones eliminates on the side 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.870
 it allows you to get into max 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.789
 I also use it I do not have 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.690
 but because there are few 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:12.979
 people who say like this so it's 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.870
 not a surprise when you are like 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.699
 it's coming back into focus and that 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.770
 the players often the defense b in front 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:21.110
 you can come back with the painter where 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.190
 the gesture that's it eliminates perfect it's 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.250
 very effective 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.570
 what is my advice to me for for 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.229
 well master the technical gestures that 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.289
 i will show you in the east 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.360
 several future episodes will require 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:37.270
 it will take practice hello watch 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:39.820
 the six-hour roulette from 6h to 12h 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:43.880
 please thank you 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:46.460
 the scoop turn up and then the scop hunter 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.750
 or there the little wheel and Italy 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.280
 quite simply 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.270
 that's it for the first episode that's all 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.539
 I will try to improve because I 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.010
 think I did not show well tell me 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:56.870
 if you like a little tutorial like that 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.039
 from time to time I will try to 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.419
 go out at least one a week I 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:00.380
 begins to take a pace where years 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:02.150
 by last week where I was not 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.820
 there but I think to take a rhythm 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.729
 ie an episode of the series with 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.870
 the blues an episode a little fun there 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:10.789
 it was this week it's on grindr 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.680
 we need to talk about small mines 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:14.330
 episode on hyman and then why not 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.090
 a tutorial and then after one surely 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.590
 episodes that I will decide or 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.729
 I will improvise for example if I want 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.240
 to episodes that displease the 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:21.650
 fifa 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.070
 that's all about me not break 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:27.530
 balls neumann guests we talk about 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.830
 the episode came out yesterday ie 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.050
 Tuesday 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.030
 he tells them no on Wednesdays 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.430
 fly away Wednesday joe biden is out 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:37.820
 Wednesday and so this one comes out Thursday 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:40.550
 if all goes well we make the 1st 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.360
 April and go out human I do not think that 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.199
 you can see it again because 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.599
 that in fact it does not depend on me his 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:45.800
 youtube's costs they decided did 

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:47.389
 once you get your video 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.500
 she's sending them on knowing about 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:49.909
 youtube as I already explained 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.930
 and then there is the treatment and the 

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:53.360
 treatment is still not completed 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.710
 it's just five o'clock 5 am crisis 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.669
 and to check if there are any rights 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.330
 copyright 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:58.440
 you thought I was going to put a 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.510
 music what about germany has nothing 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.830
 epic and it's just funny so 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:05.520
 so here I hope it will come out 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:08.639
 before the before the tutorial I was so 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.030

 Technical games 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.650
 ten months ago if I forget already 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:20.780
 technique if you think that one of the most 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.780
 easy worse guys got more
