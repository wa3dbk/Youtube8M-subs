00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
shoe not an OG colorway but it's

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.080 
shoe not an OG colorway but it's
definitely<00:00:40.170> nice<00:00:40.579> so<00:00:41.579> starting<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
definitely nice so starting in the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.650 
definitely nice so starting in the
outsole<00:00:42.450> it's<00:00:43.320> white<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.800> black<00:00:44.420> now<00:00:45.420> my

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
outsole it's white and black now my

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.930 
outsole it's white and black now my
suggestion<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.350> um<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:47.579> would<00:00:47.730> have<00:00:47.820> like

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
suggestion is um it would have like

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.369 
suggestion is um it would have like
different<00:00:48.149> wouldn't<00:00:48.719> match<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.200> shoe

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
different wouldn't match the shoe

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.319 
different wouldn't match the shoe
completely<00:00:49.950> but<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.460> think<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.820> black<00:00:51.030> parts

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
completely but I think the black parts

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.569 
completely but I think the black parts
would<00:00:51.480> look<00:00:51.660> nice<00:00:51.870> with<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:52.110> charcoal<00:00:52.649> outsole

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
would look nice with a charcoal outsole

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.100 
would look nice with a charcoal outsole
kind<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.910> like<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.120> motorsport<00:00:54.570> sixes<00:00:54.960> and
