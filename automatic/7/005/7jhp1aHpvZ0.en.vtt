00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.450
Now you can have all kinds of different background
options, even if you are just shooting in

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.270
your home and you don't have a big garage
studio but I am going to start out by showing

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.779
you what I do have. Right now, behind me is
a nine foot white seamless paperwall and you

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.369
can buy these at any camera supply store.
They are great because although you probably

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.190
can't see the background in this shot I can
raise this up as high as my stands can go

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.620
and I can put the paper all the way out and
it gives the look like you are in a really

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.210
high-end studio. Now you can also buy the
seamless paper in smaller four foot rolls

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.730
and you can get these in all different colors,
this one happens to be a nice middle gray,

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.930
but you can get blues, and greens and reds
and sometimes you can even get patterns and

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.830
things that have different gradients in them
if you want to really get crazy. One great

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.420
thing with this though, is let's say your
are shooting someone with green eyes, and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.630
you get a paper background that is similar
to their eyes, it can really make their eyes

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.530
pop and totally make your picture. Another
even least, less expensive way to go is just

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.730
some fabric, I bought this fabric it was like
I don't know, probably twelve dollars, I think

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.550
it was three dollars each yard and I got four
yards so this is great because you don't even

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.223
need a sturdy stand like that, you can just
tape it up to your wall or you could have

00:01:34.223 --> 00:01:35.223
an assistant hold it up for you in front of
your subject. Now these are a little bit narrower

00:01:35.223 --> 00:01:36.223
so they are really better for just one person
or a still life for your pet or something.

00:01:36.223 --> 00:01:37.223
Where something larger like this nine foot
roll is good for groups or if you want to

00:01:37.223 --> 00:01:37.235
get a full body model or a dancer or something
like that.
