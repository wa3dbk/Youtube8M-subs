00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
what happened hello everyone with you

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.449 
what happened hello everyone with you
here<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.299> Russia<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.780> Arab<00:00:13.020> gamer<00:00:13.260> vgs<00:00:14.100> and

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:14.459 
here is Russia the Arab gamer vgs and

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:15.980 
here is Russia the Arab gamer vgs and
today<00:00:15.030> I'm<00:00:15.299> going<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.510> be<00:00:15.570> doing<00:00:15.719> an<00:00:15.900> unboxing

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
today I'm going to be doing an unboxing

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.560 
today I'm going to be doing an unboxing
of<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:17.279> geforce<00:00:17.820> gtx<00:00:18.420> 780<00:00:18.930> ti<00:00:19.230> superclocked

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
of the geforce gtx 780 ti superclocked

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.120 
of the geforce gtx 780 ti superclocked
so<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.859> one<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.849> the<00:00:24.000> more<00:00:24.150> recent<00:00:25.130> nvidia

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
so this is one of the more recent nvidia

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.769 
so this is one of the more recent nvidia
cards<00:00:26.429> released<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.880> nvidia<00:00:28.220> it's<00:00:29.779> arguably

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
cards released I nvidia it's arguably

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.740 
cards released I nvidia it's arguably
the<00:00:31.289> most<00:00:31.320> powerful<00:00:31.740> GPU<00:00:32.130> card<00:00:32.730> ever<00:00:33.270> built

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
the most powerful GPU card ever built

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.880 
the most powerful GPU card ever built
which<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.770> capable<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.340> outputting<00:00:36.860> 4k<00:00:37.860> gaming

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
which is capable of outputting 4k gaming

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.150 
which is capable of outputting 4k gaming
at<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.430> very<00:00:39.270> reasonable<00:00:39.540> 30fps<00:00:40.380> frame<00:00:40.980> rate

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
at a very reasonable 30fps frame rate

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160 
at a very reasonable 30fps frame rate
for<00:00:41.370> most<00:00:41.640> games<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.540> that's<00:00:42.960> obviously

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
for most games so that's obviously

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.680 
for most games so that's obviously
really<00:00:43.890> really<00:00:44.280> awesome<00:00:44.430> because<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:45.150> know

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
really really awesome because you know

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.690 
really really awesome because you know
how<00:00:45.900> many<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.320> actually<00:00:46.470> have<00:00:46.740> a<00:00:46.770> 4k<00:00:47.010> TV<00:00:47.160> I

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
how many of you actually have a 4k TV I

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.240 
how many of you actually have a 4k TV I
still<00:00:48.270> don't<00:00:48.420> have<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.570> 4k<00:00:48.840> TV<00:00:48.990> I'm<00:00:49.500> honestly

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
still don't have a 4k TV I'm honestly

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.510 
still don't have a 4k TV I'm honestly
really<00:00:50.340> satisfied<00:00:51.030> with<00:00:51.270> full<00:00:51.480> HD<00:00:52.160> but<00:00:53.160> having

heck<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> super<00:01:30.270> clock<00:01:30.479> now<00:01:30.749> a<00:01:31.310> lot<00:01:32.310> of

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
heck is a super clock now a lot of

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.599 
heck is a super clock now a lot of
hardcore<00:01:33.390> PC<00:01:33.719> gamers<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.130> overclock

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
hardcore PC gamers like to overclock

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:38.629 
hardcore PC gamers like to overclock
their<00:01:35.850> graphic<00:01:36.479> cards<00:01:37.280> because<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.549> gives

00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:38.639 
their graphic cards because it gives

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:40.279 
their graphic cards because it gives
them<00:01:38.789> a<00:01:38.909> little<00:01:38.939> bit<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.389> more<00:01:39.600> performance<00:01:40.229> a

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
them a little bit of more performance a

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:41.809 
them a little bit of more performance a
bit<00:01:40.469> of<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.619> boost<00:01:40.799> like<00:01:41.100> ten<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.520> fifteen

00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:41.819 
bit of a boost like ten to fifteen

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:44.239 
bit of a boost like ten to fifteen
percent<00:01:42.179> boost<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.679> one<00:01:43.889> has<00:01:44.039> already

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:44.249 
percent boost so this one has already

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:47.239 
percent boost so this one has already
readymade<00:01:45.380> overclock<00:01:46.380> because<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.009> know<00:01:47.100> to

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:47.249 
readymade overclock because you know to

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:48.620 
readymade overclock because you know to
a<00:01:47.280> typical<00:01:47.759> fashion<00:01:47.939> if<00:01:48.179> you<00:01:48.270> want<00:01:48.509> to

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
a typical fashion if you want to

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.149 
a typical fashion if you want to
overclock<00:01:49.020> your<00:01:49.139> graphics<00:01:49.679> card<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.950> got<00:01:50.069> to

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
overclock your graphics card you got to

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.739 
overclock your graphics card you got to
go<00:01:50.249> into<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.520> bios<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:50.999> got<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.209> do<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.509> got

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:51.749 
go into the bios you got to do you got

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:53.809 
go into the bios you got to do you got
to<00:01:51.899> get<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> bit<00:01:52.259> techie<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:53.100> one<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.729> know

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
to get a bit techie this one is you know

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:55.639 
to get a bit techie this one is you know
straight<00:01:54.090> out<00:01:54.179> of<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.359> box<00:01:54.539> overclocked<00:01:55.350> and

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
straight out of the box overclocked and

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.099 
straight out of the box overclocked and
hopefully<00:01:56.520> much<00:01:56.729> safer<00:01:57.149> because<00:01:57.600> from<00:01:57.899> what<00:01:58.049> I

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:58.109 
hopefully much safer because from what I

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:01.609 
hopefully much safer because from what I
hear<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.649> overclocking<00:01:59.159> your<00:01:59.429> GPU<00:02:00.619> manually

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
hear that overclocking your GPU manually

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.599 
hear that overclocking your GPU manually
could<00:02:01.920> pretty<00:02:02.249> much<00:02:02.340> burn<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> hole<00:02:03.509> into<00:02:03.749> it<00:02:03.990> so

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.609 
could pretty much burn a hole into it so

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:07.969 
could pretty much burn a hole into it so
hopefully<00:02:05.609> the<00:02:05.789> nvidia<00:02:06.469> safely<00:02:07.469> superclocked

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
hopefully the nvidia safely superclocked

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.790 
hopefully the nvidia safely superclocked
this<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:08.910> here's<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.509> box<00:02:09.720> it's<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.709> know
