two<00:00:25.230> pounds<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.740> weight<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.070> know<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.519> could

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
two pounds of weight you know you could

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.450 
two pounds of weight you know you could
put<00:00:26.970> down<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.269> anything<00:00:27.480> I'm<00:00:28.380> talking<00:00:28.920> tens<00:00:29.310> of

f<00:00:49.020> adrene<00:00:49.410> caffeine<00:00:49.950> stack<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:51.270> it's<00:00:51.629> simply

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
f adrene caffeine stack and it's simply

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.160 
f adrene caffeine stack and it's simply
when<00:00:52.199> set<00:00:52.949> doses<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.520> these<00:00:53.640> products<00:00:54.390> are

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
when set doses of these products are

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.099 
when set doses of these products are
taken<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.680> combination<00:00:56.100> at<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.610> same<00:00:56.820> time<00:00:57.120> or

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
taken in combination at the same time or

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.389 
taken in combination at the same time or
stack<00:00:58.680> together<00:00:59.070> hence<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.670> name<00:01:01.129> and<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
stack together hence the name and the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.759 
stack together hence the name and the
the<00:01:02.579> dosing<00:01:03.030> or<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.329> concentration<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.140> very

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
the dosing or the concentration is very

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.810 
the dosing or the concentration is very
important<00:01:05.189> if<00:01:05.280> you're<00:01:05.400> going<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.610> get<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
important if you're going to get the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.210 
important if you're going to get the
best<00:01:06.030> from<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.330> but<00:01:07.260> I'll<00:01:07.740> talk<00:01:07.979> more<00:01:08.040> about

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
best from it but I'll talk more about

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.940 
best from it but I'll talk more about
that<00:01:08.430> later<00:01:09.170> about<00:01:10.170> showing<00:01:10.470> now<00:01:10.680> how

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
that later about showing now how

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.160 
that later about showing now how
actually<00:01:11.159> works

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.950 

ok<00:01:16.040> firstly<00:01:16.630> this<00:01:17.630> product<00:01:18.080> burns<00:01:18.799> away<00:01:18.979> fat

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
ok firstly this product burns away fat

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.749 
ok firstly this product burns away fat
taking<00:01:20.960> effigy<00:01:21.320> kneecap<00:01:21.650> and<00:01:21.890> caffeine<00:01:22.670> in

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
taking effigy kneecap and caffeine in

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.999 
taking effigy kneecap and caffeine in
combination<00:01:23.390> causes<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.470> body<00:01:24.649> to<00:01:24.710> release<00:01:24.979> a

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
combination causes the body to release a

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.179 
combination causes the body to release a
chemical<00:01:25.250> called<00:01:25.990> noradrenaline<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.200> this

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
chemical called noradrenaline and this

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.139 
chemical called noradrenaline and this
triggers<00:01:28.640> a<00:01:28.670> process<00:01:28.750> called<00:01:29.750> thermogenesis

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
triggers a process called thermogenesis

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.350 
triggers a process called thermogenesis
and<00:01:32.149> thermogenesis<00:01:32.750> is<00:01:33.049> when<00:01:33.229> the<00:01:33.320> body<00:01:33.560> burns

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
and thermogenesis is when the body burns

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.090 
and thermogenesis is when the body burns
stored<00:01:35.360> fat<00:01:35.720> in<00:01:35.899> order<00:01:36.140> to<00:01:36.259> raise<00:01:36.380> its<00:01:36.680> core

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
stored fat in order to raise its core

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.120 
stored fat in order to raise its core
temperature<00:01:38.200> this<00:01:39.200> normally<00:01:39.590> happens<00:01:39.890> when

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
temperature this normally happens when

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.690 
temperature this normally happens when
you<00:01:40.250> you're<00:01:41.240> exposed<00:01:41.689> to<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:41.930> cold<00:01:42.280> but<00:01:43.280> this

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
you you're exposed to the cold but this

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.179 
you you're exposed to the cold but this
generation<00:01:44.420> of<00:01:44.570> heat<00:01:44.750> it<00:01:45.350> uses<00:01:45.770> up<00:01:45.799> a<00:01:46.009> lot<00:01:46.039> of

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
generation of heat it uses up a lot of

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.700 
generation of heat it uses up a lot of
energy<00:01:46.369> and<00:01:46.789> the<00:01:46.939> body<00:01:47.479> uses<00:01:47.869> stored<00:01:48.229> fat<00:01:48.530> to

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
energy and the body uses stored fat to

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.270 
energy and the body uses stored fat to
do<00:01:48.830> this<00:01:52.390> ok<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:54.080> the<00:01:54.110> noradrenaline<00:01:55.009> release

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
do this ok the the noradrenaline release

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.050 
do this ok the the noradrenaline release
is<00:01:55.880> also<00:01:56.090> gonna<00:01:56.600> kill<00:01:57.020> your<00:01:57.170> appetite

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
is also gonna kill your appetite

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
is also gonna kill your appetite
basically<00:01:59.060> you're<00:01:59.179> not<00:01:59.299> going<00:01:59.509> to<00:01:59.569> feel<00:01:59.929> like

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
basically you're not going to feel like

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.859 
basically you're not going to feel like
eating<00:02:00.289> when<00:02:00.649> you<00:02:00.770> take<00:02:01.369> in<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:01.610> stack<00:02:01.880> so

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
eating when you take in the stack so

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.149 
eating when you take in the stack so
you're<00:02:02.990> going<00:02:03.110> to<00:02:03.140> consume<00:02:03.560> less<00:02:03.799> food<00:02:04.130> and

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
you're going to consume less food and

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.789 
you're going to consume less food and
obviously<00:02:04.700> therefore<00:02:05.060> less<00:02:05.420> calories<00:02:05.869> and

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
obviously therefore less calories and

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.770 
obviously therefore less calories and
the<00:02:07.250> appetite<00:02:07.580> suppression<00:02:07.940> is<00:02:08.209> a<00:02:08.239> very

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
the appetite suppression is a very

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.229 
the appetite suppression is a very
important<00:02:09.229> factor<00:02:09.649> in<00:02:09.739> how's<00:02:10.009> that<00:02:10.310> works<00:02:13.239> ok

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
important factor in how's that works ok

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.449 
important factor in how's that works ok
the<00:02:14.450> F<00:02:14.750> Ginny<00:02:14.989> caffeine<00:02:15.440> is<00:02:15.739> also<00:02:16.190> kind<00:02:16.430> of

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
the F Ginny caffeine is also kind of

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.180 
the F Ginny caffeine is also kind of
boost<00:02:16.700> your<00:02:16.850> energy<00:02:16.940> levels<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:18.010> this<00:02:19.010> can
