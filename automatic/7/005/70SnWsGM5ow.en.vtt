00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
the battery as you like which isn't

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.229 
the battery as you like which isn't
always<00:00:31.859> possible<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.550> lot<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.820> new<00:00:32.969> phones

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
always possible on a lot of new phones

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.810 
always possible on a lot of new phones
nowadays<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.739> does<00:00:34.890> use<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> normal<00:00:35.550> sized

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
nowadays and it does use a normal sized

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.209 
nowadays and it does use a normal sized
SIM<00:00:36.239> card<00:00:37.430> so<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.790> screen<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.890> 3.5<00:00:40.890> inch

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
SIM card so the screen is a 3.5 inch

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.959 
SIM card so the screen is a 3.5 inch
screen<00:00:41.579> with<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> resolution<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.870> 320<00:00:43.770> x<00:00:44.370> 480

although<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.899> resolution<00:00:58.410> on<00:00:58.469> paper<00:00:58.739> is

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
although the resolution on paper is

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.849 
although the resolution on paper is
quite<00:00:59.370> low<00:00:59.640> it<00:01:00.329> does<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.660> job<00:01:00.840> perfectly<00:01:01.260> in

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
quite low it does the job perfectly in

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.440 
quite low it does the job perfectly in
my<00:01:02.039> opinion<00:01:03.470> so<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.769> runs<00:01:04.890> android<00:01:05.430> 2.3<00:01:06.030> point

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
my opinion so it runs android 2.3 point

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
one a lot quicker and you can create

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.100 
one a lot quicker and you can create
folders<00:01:31.290> like<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.530> showed<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.829> there<00:01:33.110> although

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
folders like I showed you there although

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.719 
folders like I showed you there although
you<00:01:34.170> can't<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.680> drag<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.920> up<00:01:35.159> on<00:01:35.310> top<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.520> an

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
you can't just drag it up on top of an

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.160 
you can't just drag it up on top of an
app<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.000> make<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> folder<00:01:36.630> like<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.869> can't<00:01:37.079> on

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
app to make a folder like you can't on

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.140 
app to make a folder like you can't on
some<00:01:37.380> phones<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:38.400> can't<00:01:38.640> still<00:01:38.880> create

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
some phones you can't still create

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.850 
some phones you can't still create
folders<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:39.720> it's<00:01:39.840> still<00:01:40.020> quite<00:01:40.200> useful<00:01:40.650> as

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
folders so it's still quite useful as

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.039 
folders so it's still quite useful as
you<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.579> see<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:41.790> I've<00:01:42.420> put<00:01:42.659> something<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:42.990> a

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
you can see that I've put something in a

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.630 
you can see that I've put something in a
folder<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.530> could<00:01:43.680> put<00:01:43.860> quite<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.250> few<00:01:44.430> things

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
folder you could put quite a few things

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.810 
folder you could put quite a few things
in<00:01:44.759> there<00:01:45.259> so<00:01:46.259> if<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.560> hold<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.640> main

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
in there so if you hold the the main

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.249 
in there so if you hold the the main
button<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> middle<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.659> opens<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.049> task

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
button in the middle I opens a task

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.830 
button in the middle I opens a task
manager<00:01:50.070> which<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.340> pretty<00:01:50.490> cool<00:01:50.759> too<00:01:50.820> if<00:01:51.659> you

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
manager which is pretty cool too if you

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.359 
manager which is pretty cool too if you
want<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.049> exit<00:01:52.380> out<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.500> your<00:01:52.799> apps<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.250> you

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
want to exit out of your apps and you

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.910 
want to exit out of your apps and you
know<00:01:53.490> free<00:01:53.729> up<00:01:53.820> some<00:01:53.970> space<00:01:54.049> then<00:01:55.049> that's<00:01:55.770> a

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
know free up some space then that's a

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.590 
know free up some space then that's a
really<00:01:56.250> easy<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.610> convenient<00:01:57.030> way<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.299> do

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
really easy and convenient way to do

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.630 
really easy and convenient way to do
that<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.170> I'm<00:01:58.560> glad<00:01:58.829> they<00:01:59.009> put<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.490> there

day-to-day<00:03:04.390> stuff<00:03:04.900> wasn't<00:03:05.470> an<00:03:05.710> issue<00:03:05.830> while<00:03:06.190> I

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
day-to-day stuff wasn't an issue while I

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.590 
day-to-day stuff wasn't an issue while I
was<00:03:06.460> using<00:03:06.640> this<00:03:06.850> phone<00:03:07.060> so<00:03:07.270> I<00:03:07.300> was<00:03:07.480> really

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
was using this phone so I was really

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.110 
was using this phone so I was really
impressed<00:03:07.840> with<00:03:08.110> that<00:03:08.700> mainly<00:03:09.700> because<00:03:09.940> I

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
impressed with that mainly because I

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.380 
impressed with that mainly because I
expected<00:03:10.660> it<00:03:10.720> to<00:03:10.840> be<00:03:10.870> really<00:03:11.200> slow<00:03:12.060> so<00:03:13.060> some

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
expected it to be really slow so some

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.380 
expected it to be really slow so some
are<00:03:13.510> statistics<00:03:14.340> memory<00:03:15.340> wise<00:03:15.550> it<00:03:15.970> comes<00:03:16.180> with

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
are statistics memory wise it comes with

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.500 
are statistics memory wise it comes with
a<00:03:16.570> microSD<00:03:17.350> slot<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:18.610> internal<00:03:18.940> memory<00:03:19.330> isn't

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
a microSD slot the internal memory isn't

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.050 
a microSD slot the internal memory isn't
really<00:03:19.900> all<00:03:20.140> that<00:03:20.320> but<00:03:21.220> it<00:03:21.459> does<00:03:21.700> come<00:03:21.880> with<00:03:21.910> a

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
really all that but it does come with a

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.330 
really all that but it does come with a
2<00:03:22.240> gigabyte<00:03:22.780> memory<00:03:22.959> card<00:03:23.380> and<00:03:23.650> you<00:03:24.310> can

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
2 gigabyte memory card and you can
