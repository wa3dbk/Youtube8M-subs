species<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:16.260> lizard<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:17.400> found<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.180> be<00:00:18.210> much

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
species of lizard I found it to be much

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.510 
species of lizard I found it to be much
more<00:00:19.199> convenient<00:00:19.590> than<00:00:19.830> any<00:00:20.010> type<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.369> wire

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520

that is small enough to house a

hatchling now a standard 10 gallon is

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.529 
hatchling now a standard 10 gallon is
the<00:00:28.560> right<00:00:28.740> size<00:00:28.949> for<00:00:28.980> one<00:00:29.640> leopard<00:00:29.849> gecko<00:00:30.330> but

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
the right size for one leopard gecko but

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.240 
the right size for one leopard gecko but
if<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.750> plan<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.140> getting<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.500> pair<00:00:31.800> or<00:00:31.980> even

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
if you plan on getting a pair or even

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.950 
if you plan on getting a pair or even
three<00:00:32.550> you're<00:00:33.239> probably<00:00:33.450> going<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.690> want<00:00:33.870> to

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
three you're probably going to want to

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.950 
three you're probably going to want to
go<00:00:34.110> with<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.320> 20<00:00:34.739> long<00:00:34.980> which<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.840> 20<00:00:36.840> gallon

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
go with a 20 long which is a 20 gallon

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.470 
go with a 20 long which is a 20 gallon
aquarium<00:00:37.380> it's<00:00:37.890> just<00:00:38.219> elongated<00:00:38.969> rather<00:00:39.180> than

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
aquarium it's just elongated rather than

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.720 
aquarium it's just elongated rather than
tall<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.129> something<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.579> can

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
tall so this is something that you can

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.200 
tall so this is something that you can
find<00:00:41.910> at<00:00:42.030> your<00:00:42.059> local<00:00:42.180> pet<00:00:42.660> store<00:00:43.430> also<00:00:44.430> these

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
find at your local pet store also these

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.840 
find at your local pet store also these
are<00:00:45.270> desert<00:00:45.870> animals<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.010> substrate<00:00:47.520> you

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
are desert animals so the substrate you

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.060 
are desert animals so the substrate you
use<00:00:48.149> you're<00:00:49.079> gonna<00:00:49.200> probably<00:00:49.500> want<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.890> use<00:00:49.950> a

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
use you're gonna probably want to use a

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.729 
use you're gonna probably want to use a
sand<00:00:50.750> this<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.809> something<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.320> really<00:00:52.350> like

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
sand this is something I really like

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.459 
sand this is something I really like
it's<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.010> calcium<00:00:53.489> substrate<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:55.020> calcium

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
it's a calcium substrate this calcium

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.680 
it's a calcium substrate this calcium
substrate<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.309> one<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.820> my<00:00:56.940> favorite<00:00:57.329> products

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
substrate is one of my favorite products

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.900 
substrate is one of my favorite products
to<00:00:57.719> use<00:00:58.020> because<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.039> made<00:00:59.219> out<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.430> from<00:00:59.820> a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
to use because it is made out of from a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.250 
to use because it is made out of from a
calcium<00:01:00.480> base<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.949> easily<00:01:02.390> digestible<00:01:03.390> not

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
calcium base it's easily digestible not

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.280 
calcium base it's easily digestible not
always<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.369> smaller<00:01:05.790> hatchlings<00:01:06.540> your

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
always in the smaller hatchlings your

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.320 
always in the smaller hatchlings your
when<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.650> having<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.979> very<00:01:08.010> newborn<00:01:08.729> leopard

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
when you having a very newborn leopard

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.700 
when you having a very newborn leopard
gecko<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.840> may<00:01:10.049> want<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.350> try<00:01:10.530> using

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
gecko you may want to try using

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.039 
gecko you may want to try using
newspaper<00:01:11.369> or<00:01:11.580> paper<00:01:11.760> towels<00:01:12.060> at<00:01:12.689> least<00:01:12.900> till

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
newspaper or paper towels at least till

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.240 
newspaper or paper towels at least till
they<00:01:13.140> get<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.290> little<00:01:13.650> bit<00:01:13.770> bigger

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
they get a little bit bigger

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.310 
they get a little bit bigger
the<00:01:14.520> calcium<00:01:14.700> substrate<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.720> sometimes

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
the calcium substrate can sometimes

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.870 
the calcium substrate can sometimes
cause<00:01:16.619> impaction<00:01:18.020> from<00:01:19.020> ingesting<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.130> it

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
cause impaction from ingesting it and it

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.090 
cause impaction from ingesting it and it
can<00:01:21.000> also<00:01:21.180> build<00:01:21.540> up<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> toes<00:01:22.229> -<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.040> you

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
can also build up on the toes - so you

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.410 
can also build up on the toes - so you
that's<00:01:23.400> something<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.850> might<00:01:23.970> want<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.210> watch

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
that's something you might want to watch

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.719 
that's something you might want to watch
for<00:01:25.430> you<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:26.580> also<00:01:26.790> use<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.150> sand<00:01:27.600> soil<00:01:27.990> mix

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
for you can also use a sand soil mix

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.190 
for you can also use a sand soil mix
some<00:01:29.729> people<00:01:30.060> like<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.329> mix<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.689> together<00:01:30.810> in

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
some people like to mix it together in

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.700 
some people like to mix it together in
one<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:32.340> like<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.689> have<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.960> separated<00:01:34.500> a

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
one I like I like to have it separated a

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.319 
one I like I like to have it separated a
little<00:01:34.950> bit<00:01:35.100> what<00:01:35.520> I've<00:01:35.640> done<00:01:35.790> here<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.119> I've

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
little bit what I've done here is I've

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.660 
little bit what I've done here is I've
put<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.229> sand<00:01:37.500> over<00:01:37.770> here<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.220> side<00:01:38.460> so

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
put the sand over here on this side so

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.490 
put the sand over here on this side so
we<00:01:38.790> have<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.119> dry<00:01:39.390> desert<00:01:39.689> area<00:01:40.170> over<00:01:40.470> here

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
we have the dry desert area over here

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.420 
we have the dry desert area over here
and<00:01:40.950> then<00:01:41.579> over<00:01:41.700> here<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.799> soil<00:01:43.799> bark

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
and then over here I have the soil bark

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.730 
and then over here I have the soil bark
mix<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.570> holds<00:01:45.840> moisture<00:01:46.020> really<00:01:46.320> well

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
mix and this holds moisture really well

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.219 
mix and this holds moisture really well
so<00:01:46.950> I'm<00:01:47.070> able<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.549> miss<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.360> give<00:01:48.960> him<00:01:49.200> a

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
so I'm able to miss this and give him a

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.810 
so I'm able to miss this and give him a
little<00:01:49.320> bit<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.740> humidity<00:01:50.040> every<00:01:50.460> now<00:01:50.610> and

little bit of humidity every now and

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.990

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
to use orchid bark which is also

local pet store orchid bark is a very

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.080 
local pet store orchid bark is a very
fine<00:02:18.630> soil<00:02:19.140> this<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.250> something<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.640> mixes

fine soil this is something that mixes

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.820 
fine soil this is something that mixes
very<00:02:21.120> well<00:02:21.330> with<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.750> sand<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.230> also<00:02:22.470> holds

very well with the sand and also holds

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.010 
very well with the sand and also holds
moisture<00:02:23.069> really<00:02:23.940> well<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:24.600> it's<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.870> good

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
moisture really well so it's a good

here<00:03:18.600> I've<00:03:18.810> created<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:19.410> little<00:03:19.620> bit<00:03:19.739> of<00:03:19.829> an

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
here I've created a little bit of an

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.610 
here I've created a little bit of an
elevated<00:03:20.370> site<00:03:20.730> with<00:03:21.510> those<00:03:21.660> flat<00:03:21.959> rocks<00:03:22.230> not

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
elevated site with those flat rocks not

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.170 
elevated site with those flat rocks not
only<00:03:22.860> does<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.010> provide<00:03:23.310> shelter<00:03:23.730> but<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:24.000> also

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
only does it provide shelter but it also

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.060 
only does it provide shelter but it also
provides<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.900> elevated<00:03:25.290> site<00:03:25.620> there<00:03:25.860> and

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
provides the elevated site there and

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.420 
provides the elevated site there and
this<00:03:26.910> this<00:03:27.650> stick<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.829> have<00:03:29.010> in<00:03:29.190> here<00:03:29.370> is

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
this this stick I have in here is

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.259 
this this stick I have in here is
actually<00:03:30.410> not<00:03:31.410> real<00:03:32.280> it's<00:03:32.579> made<00:03:32.790> from<00:03:33.060> a

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
actually not real it's made from a

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.690 
actually not real it's made from a
rubbery<00:03:33.720> material<00:03:33.840> with<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.530> wire<00:03:34.829> inside<00:03:35.130> I

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
rubbery material with a wire inside I

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.060 
rubbery material with a wire inside I
picked<00:03:36.299> that<00:03:36.450> up<00:03:36.510> at<00:03:36.750> my<00:03:36.870> local<00:03:37.110> pet<00:03:37.440> store<00:03:37.739> and

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
picked that up at my local pet store and

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.300 
picked that up at my local pet store and
I<00:03:38.970> like<00:03:39.930> it<00:03:40.110> because<00:03:40.380> you<00:03:40.530> can<00:03:40.560> bend<00:03:41.040> it<00:03:41.160> to

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
I like it because you can bend it to

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.580 
I like it because you can bend it to
shape<00:03:41.549> however<00:03:41.940> you'd<00:03:42.150> like<00:03:42.180> I've<00:03:42.870> put<00:03:43.320> it<00:03:43.440> to

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
shape however you'd like I've put it to

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.289 
shape however you'd like I've put it to
where<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:43.920> leopard<00:03:44.280> gecko<00:03:44.579> is<00:03:44.700> able<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.090> climb
