that folds back in now what would be

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.289 
that folds back in now what would be
here<00:02:03.570> why<00:02:03.810> they<00:02:04.110> would<00:02:04.320> be<00:02:04.470> this<00:02:04.680> plate<00:02:05.520> that's

colored<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:25.530> one<00:02:25.739> that's<00:02:25.950> off<00:02:26.160> colored

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
colored the one that's off colored

colored the one that's off colored
always<00:02:28.230> goes<00:02:28.500> either<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.370> feed<00:02:29.670> or<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.660> goes

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
always goes either the feed or it goes

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.479 
always goes either the feed or it goes
up<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.380> light<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.870> red<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.470> black<00:02:34.739> go

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
up to the light the red and the black go

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.600 
up to the light the red and the black go
on<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.880> same<00:02:36.120> colored<00:02:36.540> screws<00:02:37.400> so<00:02:38.400> that's

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
on the same colored screws so that's

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:47.449 
on the same colored screws so that's
pretty<00:02:38.849> simple<00:02:39.680> you<00:02:40.680> just<00:02:40.709> take<00:02:41.099> time<00:02:46.310> put<00:02:47.310> the

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
pretty simple you just take time put the

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.100 
pretty simple you just take time put the
red<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:47.940> black<00:02:48.180> on<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.540> same<00:02:48.750> colored

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
red and the black on the same colored

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:56.479 
red and the black on the same colored
screw<00:02:53.840> everything<00:02:54.840> goes<00:02:54.989> clockwise<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:56.280> wire

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
screw everything goes clockwise the wire

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:04.430 
screw everything goes clockwise the wire
around<00:02:56.760> clockwise<00:03:02.480> now<00:03:03.480> they<00:03:03.630> make<00:03:03.870> switches

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
around clockwise now they make switches

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.710 
around clockwise now they make switches
where<00:03:04.650> you<00:03:04.739> just<00:03:05.030> shove<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.150> wire<00:03:06.359> in<00:03:06.690> the

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
where you just shove the wire in the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.860 
where you just shove the wire in the
back<00:03:07.019> let's<00:03:07.590> stay<00:03:07.950> away<00:03:07.980> from<00:03:08.190> them<00:03:08.660> you<00:03:09.660> don't

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
back let's stay away from them you don't

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.870 
back let's stay away from them you don't
give<00:03:10.049> a<00:03:10.079> lot<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.350> good<00:03:10.620> surface<00:03:11.130> area<00:03:11.459> like<00:03:11.730> you

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
give a lot of good surface area like you

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.809 
give a lot of good surface area like you
do<00:03:12.090> here<00:03:12.739> so<00:03:13.739> here<00:03:13.950> we<00:03:14.100> have<00:03:14.310> these<00:03:14.639> are

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
do here so here we have these are

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.990 
do here so here we have these are
actually<00:03:15.150> called<00:03:15.329> the<00:03:15.480> traveler<00:03:15.989> wires<00:03:17.000> and

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
actually called the traveler wires and

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000 
actually called the traveler wires and
then<00:03:18.209> you<00:03:18.389> come<00:03:18.540> up<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.870> here<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.380> odd<00:03:19.530> colored

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
then you come up to here the odd colored

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.910 
then you come up to here the odd colored
screw<00:03:20.340> gets<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.880> feed<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.690> of<00:03:22.500> course<00:03:22.739> we

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
screw gets the feed and of course we

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.840 
screw gets the feed and of course we
shut<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.310> power<00:03:23.489> off<00:03:25.010> now<00:03:26.010> it<00:03:26.130> won't<00:03:26.280> kill<00:03:26.579> you

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
we just bring the ground wire around

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.759 
we just bring the ground wire around
