was just a mock-up yes this is only a
demo<00:00:43.469> how<00:00:44.040> big<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.460> screen<00:00:44.550> like<00:00:45.450> like

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
demo how big is the screen like like

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.959 
demo how big is the screen like like
this<00:00:45.899> one<00:00:46.079> twelve<00:00:46.469> point<00:00:46.710> three<00:00:46.770> five<00:00:47.730> point

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
this one twelve point three five point

three same sizes here you can see here

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.220 
three same sizes here you can see here
you<00:00:50.430> can<00:00:50.460> make<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.030> comparison<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:52.110> it's

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
you can make the comparison so it's

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.900 
you can make the comparison so it's
actually<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.530> same<00:00:52.680> designer<00:00:53.399> or<00:00:53.610> not<00:00:53.760> we

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
which resolution so badly we talked

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.740 
which resolution so badly we talked
about<00:01:05.939> sera<00:01:06.330> sera<00:01:06.979> sera<00:01:09.619> 916<00:01:10.619> multiplied<00:01:11.750> 540

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
about sera sera sera 916 multiplied 540
