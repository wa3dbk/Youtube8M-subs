00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
and you can actually have some really

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.490 
and you can actually have some really
fun<00:03:57.160> times<00:03:57.640> on<00:03:57.849> the<00:03:57.970> Prairie<00:03:58.360> animals<00:03:58.630> if<00:03:59.410> you

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
fun times on the Prairie animals if you

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.199 
fun times on the Prairie animals if you
shoot<00:03:59.739> them<00:03:59.830> off<00:03:59.980> and<00:04:00.220> stuff<00:04:02.819> which<00:04:03.819> no<00:04:04.060> I'm

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
shoot them off and stuff which no I'm

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.000 
shoot them off and stuff which no I'm
not<00:04:04.390> going<00:04:04.510> to<00:04:04.569> try<00:04:04.780> because<00:04:05.019> it's<00:04:05.620> really

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
not going to try because it's really

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.940 
not going to try because it's really
really<00:04:06.280> difficult<00:04:06.519> and<00:04:07.080> why<00:04:08.080> it's<00:04:08.709> going<00:04:08.860> to

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
really difficult and why it's going to

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:27.379 
really difficult and why it's going to
take<00:04:09.100> the<00:04:09.250> ages<00:04:11.100> okay

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.640 

I'm<00:04:27.900> hoping<00:04:28.199> we<00:04:28.349> can<00:04:28.379> find<00:04:28.740> it<00:04:28.979> pretty<00:04:29.009> soon

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
I'm hoping we can find it pretty soon

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.559 
I'm hoping we can find it pretty soon
I'm<00:04:31.650> also<00:04:31.860> hoping<00:04:32.129> we<00:04:32.460> don't<00:04:32.580> get<00:04:32.879> raped<00:04:33.150> by<00:04:33.509> a

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:33.569 
I'm also hoping we don't get raped by a

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:36.769 
I'm also hoping we don't get raped by a
deer<00:04:33.840> or<00:04:33.870> something<00:04:35.210> then<00:04:36.210> our<00:04:36.360> character

00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:36.779 
deer or something then our character

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:47.290 
deer or something then our character
could<00:04:36.960> never<00:04:37.229> truly<00:04:37.560> be<00:04:37.860> clean<00:04:38.159> again

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300
