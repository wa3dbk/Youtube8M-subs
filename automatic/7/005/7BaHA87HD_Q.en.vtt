-<00:00:11.750> a<00:00:12.050> -<00:00:12.110> 8<00:00:12.470> and<00:00:13.420> we'll<00:00:14.420> go<00:00:14.570> through<00:00:14.599> around<00:00:15.019> what

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:15.290 
- a - 8 and we'll go through around what

Ascot<00:00:15.710> is<00:00:16.189> not<00:00:16.430> God<00:00:16.700> and<00:00:17.170> it<00:00:18.170> is<00:00:18.200> basically

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
Ascot is not God and it is basically

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.310

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
comparable to the blue beats beats pills

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.400 
comparable to the blue beats beats pills
so<00:00:22.310> it's<00:00:22.490> exactly<00:00:23.060> the<00:00:23.210> same<00:00:23.570> design<00:00:23.810> sort<00:00:24.320> of

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
so it's exactly the same design sort of

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.010 
so it's exactly the same design sort of
it<00:00:24.500> but<00:00:24.680> a<00:00:24.890> couple<00:00:25.400> of<00:00:25.460> extra<00:00:25.789> features<00:00:25.970> so<00:00:26.930> I'm

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
it but a couple of extra features so I'm

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.870 
it but a couple of extra features so I'm
calling<00:00:27.230> with<00:00:27.500> a<00:00:27.560> bit<00:00:27.830> of<00:00:27.859> compromise<00:00:28.490> on<00:00:28.730> it

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
calling with a bit of compromise on it

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.259 
calling with a bit of compromise on it
but<00:00:29.240> price<00:00:29.840> is<00:00:29.869> also<00:00:30.350> big<00:00:31.070> reason<00:00:31.820> behind<00:00:31.939> it

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:32.269 
but price is also big reason behind it

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:35.290 
but price is also big reason behind it
as<00:00:32.449> well<00:00:32.480> so<00:00:33.250> let's<00:00:34.250> go<00:00:34.370> through<00:00:34.580> that<00:00:34.610> couple
