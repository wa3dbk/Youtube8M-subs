00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.609

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.900
 facebook posted link to facebook 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.779
 in the video description lassmann 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.660
 I like to instagram skype etc 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.619
 also and friends i have again 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.760
 posted that you ask me a few 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.539
 should and I have now 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.539
 a few designed 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.870
 who is your favorite player on the 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.940
 world and why is in riehl apple 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.350
 definitely royce because i think so 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.899
 program not only bundesliga is coming 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.660
 not somehow league bbva or something 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.120
 and more than bundesliga I find up 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.210
 in any case, that's the best thing to do 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.129
 in fifa it is summer definitely 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.960
 or never both right 15 it 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.640
 exactly with which one can work well 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.149
 Of course there's cristiano ronaldo 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.190
 but christian could give me until now 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.080
 can not afford and therefore read 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.180
 question would you rather a year not 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.580
 gamble for that you should fifa 16 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.479
 develop or gamble and fifa 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:23.640
 do not develop 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:25.200
 greetings you make people of ea do that 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.909
 Well, and I would actually do a lot 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.030
 That's why it's better to change one year 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.229
 instead of developing gambling as you have 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.200
 you met with danny 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.400
 yes, because I have one ounce, we have it 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.970
 We have met just once here 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.350

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.659

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.070

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.420

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.450

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.660

 At that time there was a lot of gallery 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.850
 what do you want to do with the 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.459
 finished school and you think that you 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.510
 another tradition is what you want 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.220
 When I finish school I am 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.480

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.790

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.180

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.970
 So it is even thinner film itself 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.280

 but until now, no player 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.250

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.810
