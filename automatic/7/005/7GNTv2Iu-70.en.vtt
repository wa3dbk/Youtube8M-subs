we've also got this is oh this is the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.060 
we've also got this is oh this is the
actual<00:02:35.740> charging<00:02:36.310> dock<00:02:36.490> for<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.270> gamepad<00:02:38.070> so

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
actual charging dock for the gamepad so

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.800 
actual charging dock for the gamepad so
that's<00:02:39.220> pretty<00:02:39.400> cool<00:02:39.730> -<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.209> charging<00:02:40.630> dock

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
that's pretty cool - the charging dock

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.550 
that's pretty cool - the charging dock
put<00:02:41.680> that<00:02:41.830> to<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:41.980> side<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:43.260> we<00:02:44.260> have<00:02:44.410> our

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
put that to the side and we have our

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.190 
put that to the side and we have our
sensor<00:02:45.010> bar<00:02:45.220> of<00:02:46.180> course<00:02:46.480> just<00:02:46.690> like<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:47.050> we

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
sensor bar of course just like the we

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.650 
sensor bar of course just like the we
came<00:02:47.560> had<00:02:48.070> one<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:48.580> is<00:02:48.730> also<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.360> one<00:02:49.480> that

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
came had one this is also the one that

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.190 
came had one this is also the one that
comes<00:02:49.900> with<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.320> Wii<00:02:51.190> U<00:02:51.690> so<00:02:52.690> we<00:02:52.720> have<00:02:53.020> this

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
comes with the Wii U so we have this

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.840 
comes with the Wii U so we have this
here<00:02:54.330> that<00:02:55.330> size<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:56.620> that's<00:02:57.520> the<00:02:57.640> first

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
here that size and that's the first

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.790 
here that size and that's the first
layer<00:02:58.860> now<00:02:59.860> the<00:02:59.920> second<00:03:00.700> layer<00:03:01.560> let's<00:03:02.560> see

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
layer now the second layer let's see

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.670 
layer now the second layer let's see
this<00:03:03.100> is<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.610> actual<00:03:04.209> Wii<00:03:04.480> U<00:03:04.690> I<00:03:04.720> believe<00:03:05.200> so

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
this is the actual Wii U I believe so

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.800 
this is the actual Wii U I believe so
let's<00:03:06.270> pull<00:03:07.270> this<00:03:07.450> out<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:09.480> on<00:03:10.480> first

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
let's pull this out and on first

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.210 
let's pull this out and on first
impression<00:03:11.350> I<00:03:11.440> must<00:03:11.650> say<00:03:11.770> this<00:03:11.860> is<00:03:11.980> pretty

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
impression I must say this is pretty

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.940 
impression I must say this is pretty
hefty<00:03:12.700> not<00:03:13.660> bad<00:03:13.900> definitely<00:03:14.470> heavier<00:03:14.770> than

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
hefty not bad definitely heavier than

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.990 
hefty not bad definitely heavier than
the<00:03:15.160> original<00:03:15.880> Wii<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:17.560> let's<00:03:18.010> see<00:03:18.250> here<00:03:18.580> and

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
the original Wii and let's see here and

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.479 
the original Wii and let's see here and
of<00:03:19.450> course<00:03:19.690> we've<00:03:19.870> got<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:20.110> glossy<00:03:20.860> finish<00:03:20.890> here

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
of course we've got a glossy finish here

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.770 
of course we've got a glossy finish here
this<00:03:22.299> is<00:03:22.450> going<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:22.810> be<00:03:22.930> a<00:03:22.959> fingerprint<00:03:23.709> magnet

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
this is going to be a fingerprint magnet

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.270 
this is going to be a fingerprint magnet
so<00:03:25.780> let's<00:03:26.110> finish<00:03:26.830> unwrapping<00:03:27.430> this<00:03:29.280> there's

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
so let's finish unwrapping this there's

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.810 
so let's finish unwrapping this there's
a<00:03:30.340> very<00:03:30.610> sticky<00:03:31.060> styrofoam<00:03:33.900> all<00:03:34.900> right<00:03:35.170> cool

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
a very sticky styrofoam all right cool

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.640 
a very sticky styrofoam all right cool
so<00:03:36.820> here<00:03:37.120> we<00:03:37.239> are<00:03:37.269> this<00:03:37.480> is<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.810> Wii<00:03:38.019> U<00:03:38.290> this<00:03:38.590> is

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
so here we are this is the Wii U this is

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.759 
so here we are this is the Wii U this is
the<00:03:38.950> back<00:03:39.190> and<00:03:39.810> here<00:03:40.810> we<00:03:40.900> have<00:03:41.019> the<00:03:41.170> front<00:03:41.380> lots

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
the back and here we have the front lots

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.580 
the back and here we have the front lots
of<00:03:41.890> plastic<00:03:42.100> covering<00:03:42.730> everything<00:03:43.350> let's<00:03:44.350> put

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
of plastic covering everything let's put

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.550 
of plastic covering everything let's put
this<00:03:44.709> down<00:03:44.769> for<00:03:45.220> now<00:03:45.810> well<00:03:46.810> let's<00:03:47.170> make<00:03:47.350> some

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
this down for now well let's make some

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.620 
this down for now well let's make some
space<00:03:47.830> first<00:03:48.190> all<00:03:49.060> right<00:03:49.180> so<00:03:49.269> there's<00:03:49.450> a<00:03:49.510> lot

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
space first all right so there's a lot

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.270 
space first all right so there's a lot
of<00:03:49.750> stuff<00:03:49.930> that<00:03:50.049> comes<00:03:50.350> with<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:50.650> deluxe<00:03:51.010> set

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
of stuff that comes with the deluxe set

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.900 
of stuff that comes with the deluxe set
so<00:03:51.670> just<00:03:52.000> have<00:03:52.750> declutter<00:03:53.380> of<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:53.769> and<00:03:54.580> move

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
so just have declutter of the and move

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.620 
so just have declutter of the and move
things<00:03:55.120> around<00:03:55.330> so<00:03:56.200> that<00:03:56.230> was<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.590> system<00:03:56.799> and

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
things around so that was the system and

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.660 
things around so that was the system and
this<00:03:58.630> is<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:58.959> actual<00:03:59.380> gamepad<00:04:00.130> let's<00:04:00.489> get

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
this is the actual gamepad let's get

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.710 
this is the actual gamepad let's get
this<00:04:01.470> cardboard<00:04:02.470> out<00:04:02.590> of<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:02.769> way<00:04:03.450> and<00:04:04.450> take<00:04:04.660> a

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
this cardboard out of the way and take a

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.940 
this cardboard out of the way and take a
look<00:04:04.930> at<00:04:05.049> the<00:04:05.170> actual<00:04:05.440> gamepad

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.009 

and<00:04:09.950> it's<00:04:10.430> tearing<00:04:11.269> right<00:04:11.420> through<00:04:11.480> the

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
and it's tearing right through the

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.410 
and it's tearing right through the
styrofoam<00:04:12.640> that's<00:04:13.640> all<00:04:13.819> right<00:04:13.970> so<00:04:14.269> this<00:04:14.360> is

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
styrofoam that's all right so this is

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.640 
styrofoam that's all right so this is
also<00:04:15.459> plastic<00:04:16.459> and<00:04:16.699> shiny<00:04:17.630> so<00:04:18.109> it's<00:04:18.260> going<00:04:18.470> to

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
also plastic and shiny so it's going to

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.039 
also plastic and shiny so it's going to
be<00:04:18.769> another<00:04:19.010> fingerprint<00:04:19.579> magnet<00:04:19.870> but<00:04:20.870> this

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
be another fingerprint magnet but this

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.420 
be another fingerprint magnet but this
looks<00:04:21.229> pretty<00:04:21.380> cool<00:04:23.740> pretty<00:04:24.740> light<00:04:25.039> very

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
looks pretty cool pretty light very

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.020 
looks pretty cool pretty light very
