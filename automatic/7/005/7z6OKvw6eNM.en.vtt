about c50 I've got a page that has all
the<00:00:21.090> photos<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.720> bit<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.050> story<00:00:22.650> about<00:00:22.830> it

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
the photos and a bit of a story about it

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.160 
the photos and a bit of a story about it
so<00:00:23.939> we<00:00:24.119> have<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.269> lot<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.480> hits<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.140> I

so we have a lot of hits to it so I

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.950 
so we have a lot of hits to it so I
thought<00:00:25.410> I'd<00:00:25.619> do<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.070> video<00:00:26.310> for<00:00:26.699> it

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
thought I'd do a video for it

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.330 
thought I'd do a video for it
basically<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.710> c50<00:00:29.189> comes<00:00:29.400> with<00:00:29.810> foot<00:00:30.810> pegs

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
basically the c50 comes with foot pegs

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.340 
basically the c50 comes with foot pegs
and<00:00:34.100> we<00:00:35.100> do<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.250> lot<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.489> long-distance<00:00:36.350> riding

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
and we do a lot of long-distance riding

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.150 
and we do a lot of long-distance riding

little<00:00:41.460> doodads<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:43.079> we<00:00:43.200> thought<00:00:43.350> we'd<00:00:43.530> get<00:00:43.649> us

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
little doodads so we thought we'd get us

some<00:00:43.980> floorboards<00:00:44.520> Suzuki<00:00:45.239> doesn't<00:00:45.690> actually

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
some floorboards Suzuki doesn't actually

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.160

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
make floorboards for the c50 they've

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.630 
make floorboards for the c50 they've
only<00:00:49.320> got<00:00:49.410> him<00:00:49.590> for<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.629> 109<00:00:51.629> R<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:53.010> we

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
only got him for the the one 109 R so we

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.220 
only got him for the the one 109 R so we
had<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> bit<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.180> search<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:55.140> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
had a bit of a search on the on the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.319 
had a bit of a search on the on the
internet<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.710> we<00:00:55.770> found<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.399> Cobra<00:00:57.030> makes

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
internet and we found that Cobra makes
