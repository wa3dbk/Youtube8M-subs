00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.760 
event so it stays in pretty well
obviously<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:44.050> mean<00:00:44.170> I<00:00:44.230> hear<00:00:44.379> spread<00:00:44.590> it<00:00:44.710> a

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770

obviously and I mean I hear spread it a
little<00:00:44.920> bit<00:00:45.160> but<00:00:45.309> it<00:00:45.460> really<00:00:45.610> doesn't<00:00:45.850> take

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
little bit but it really doesn't take

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.080 
little bit but it really doesn't take
too<00:00:46.210> much<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.680> I<00:00:47.739> did<00:00:47.920> it<00:00:48.040> pretty<00:00:48.550> thick<00:00:48.850> braid

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
too much and I did it pretty thick braid

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.810 
too much and I did it pretty thick braid
because<00:00:49.420> I<00:00:49.660> was<00:00:49.750> feeling<00:00:50.050> him<00:00:50.140> at<00:00:50.290> it<00:00:50.440> but<00:00:50.830> you

was<00:00:53.199> i<00:00:53.350> separated<00:00:53.980> out<00:00:54.760> my<00:00:55.030> hair<00:00:55.590> like<00:00:56.590> I<00:00:56.739> would

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
was i separated out my hair like I would

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.120 
was i separated out my hair like I would
like<00:00:57.160> I<00:00:57.460> was<00:00:57.640> doing<00:01:00.000> pigtail<00:01:01.000> braids<00:01:01.270> on<00:01:01.540> this

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
like I was doing pigtail braids on this

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.719 
like I was doing pigtail braids on this
and<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.930> like<00:01:05.110> and<00:01:05.350> two<00:01:05.890> half<00:01:06.040> and<00:01:06.580> then

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
and so like and two half and then

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.210 
and so like and two half and then
perhaps<00:01:09.149> then<00:01:10.149> I<00:01:10.690> obviously<00:01:11.560> kept<00:01:11.890> on<00:01:12.009> side

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
perhaps then I obviously kept on side

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.740 
perhaps then I obviously kept on side
down<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:14.320> other<00:01:14.470> side<00:01:14.560> I<00:01:15.360> fishtailed<00:01:16.360> but

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
down the other side I fishtailed but

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.300 
down the other side I fishtailed but
instead<00:01:17.020> of<00:01:17.140> fishtailing<00:01:17.649> like<00:01:17.830> starting

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
instead of fishtailing like starting

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.950 
instead of fishtailing like starting
here<00:01:18.670> starting<00:01:18.910> here<00:01:19.869> going<00:01:20.649> down<00:01:20.950> I<00:01:21.960> like

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
here starting here going down I like

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.529 
here starting here going down I like
turn<00:01:23.410> my<00:01:23.680> head<00:01:23.920> like<00:01:24.280> this<00:01:24.550> that<00:01:25.240> makes<00:01:25.450> it

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
turn my head like this that makes it

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:29.040 
turn my head like this that makes it
easier<00:01:25.899> and<00:01:26.140> I<00:01:27.069> fishtailed<00:01:27.610> up<00:01:28.020> till<00:01:29.020> about

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
easier and I fishtailed up till about

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.440 
easier and I fishtailed up till about
right<00:01:29.770> here<00:01:30.100> so<00:01:30.429> you<00:01:30.520> can<00:01:30.640> kind<00:01:30.850> of<00:01:30.910> see<00:01:30.970> where

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
right here so you can kind of see where

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.130 
right here so you can kind of see where
I<00:01:31.720> was<00:01:31.810> fished<00:01:32.289> in<00:01:32.500> like<00:01:33.399> adding<00:01:33.729> in<00:01:33.899> and<00:01:34.899> then

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
I was fished in like adding in and then

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.130 
I was fished in like adding in and then
I<00:01:35.470> just<00:01:36.459> started<00:01:36.910> a<00:01:37.030> regular<00:01:37.360> fishtail<00:01:37.600> and

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
I just started a regular fishtail and

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.400 
I just started a regular fishtail and
did<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.069> rest<00:01:39.250> of<00:01:39.399> it<00:01:39.520> like<00:01:39.789> a<00:01:40.140> pigtail<00:01:41.140> braids

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410

or<00:01:41.590> something

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
or something

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.080 
or something
side<00:01:44.180> braid<00:01:48.159> so<00:01:49.159> when<00:01:49.370> all<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.580> way<00:01:49.970> around

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
side braid so when all the way around

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.469 
side braid so when all the way around
but<00:01:50.540> as<00:01:50.720> you<00:01:50.990> can<00:01:51.430> probably<00:01:52.430> see<00:01:52.670> ya<00:01:53.030> as<00:01:53.300> you

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
but as you can probably see ya as you

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.840 
but as you can probably see ya as you
can<00:01:53.630> see<00:01:53.900> it's<00:01:54.680> not<00:01:54.800> quite<00:01:55.100> attached<00:01:55.520> to<00:01:55.729> my

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.090 
can see it's not quite attached to my
head<00:01:56.030> at<00:01:56.570> all<00:01:57.190> except<00:01:58.190> for<00:01:58.340> right<00:01:58.430> here<00:01:58.630> so<00:01:59.630> I

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
head at all except for right here so I

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.060 
head at all except for right here so I
used<00:02:01.100> those<00:02:01.509> clear<00:02:02.619> little<00:02:03.619> tiny<00:02:03.860> hair

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.940 
used those clear little tiny hair
elastics<00:02:04.520> I<00:02:04.610> love<00:02:04.880> those<00:02:05.060> they're<00:02:05.540> awesome

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.090 
elastics I love those they're awesome
and<00:02:07.959> I<00:02:08.959> attached<00:02:09.229> it<00:02:09.410> to<00:02:09.470> like<00:02:09.709> a<00:02:09.739> piece<00:02:10.070> of

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
and I attached it to like a piece of

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.910 
and I attached it to like a piece of
hair<00:02:10.970> over<00:02:11.270> here<00:02:11.570> so<00:02:12.230> that<00:02:12.500> it<00:02:12.650> would<00:02:12.770> just

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
hair over here so that it would just

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.820 
hair over here so that it would just
stay<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:15.140> then<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.800> took<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.959> air<00:02:18.140> for<00:02:18.350> my<00:02:18.470> ear

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
stay and then I took the air for my ear

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.699 
stay and then I took the air for my ear
and<00:02:20.800> graded<00:02:21.800> it<00:02:21.950> in<00:02:22.100> with<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.730> end<00:02:23.260> of<00:02:24.260> this

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
and graded it in with the end of this

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.290 
and graded it in with the end of this
pigtail<00:02:25.340> if<00:02:25.580> that<00:02:25.700> makes<00:02:25.820> any<00:02:25.910> sense<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:28.300> so

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
pigtail if that makes any sense so so

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.390 
pigtail if that makes any sense so so
that<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.690> end<00:02:29.870> of<00:02:30.080> this<00:02:30.350> wasn't<00:02:31.250> like

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
that the end of this wasn't like

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.940 
that the end of this wasn't like
sticking<00:02:32.060> out<00:02:32.209> right<00:02:32.239> here<00:02:32.739> since<00:02:33.739> it<00:02:33.860> was

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
sticking out right here since it was

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.550 
sticking out right here since it was
short<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:35.480> i<00:02:35.540> braided<00:02:35.750> that<00:02:35.959> in<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.290> i<00:02:36.350> just

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
short so i braided that in and i just

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.370 
short so i braided that in and i just
did<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:36.709> tiny<00:02:37.040> little<00:02:37.250> fish<00:02:37.519> tail<00:02:38.140> all<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.260> way
