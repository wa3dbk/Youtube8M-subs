00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:07.080
 well wait out the weather in the chalet 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.719
 but what do feathered like and what 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.400
 feed birds in the winter will give advice Olga 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.590
 platonov 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.890
 the most useful of birds that lives in 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.060
 over the wall and read big tit 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.090
 despite the fact that the great tit 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.210
 quite large bird it is bright and very 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.430
 gluttonous couple of tits can per day 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.340
 rid of harmful insects 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.859
 40 fruit trees but unfortunately from 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.800
 ten tit only 2 live until spring 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.649
 so of course you need to lure them 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.129
 but 7 thousand still interesting they can step 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.690
 eat feed upside down therefore 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.309
 for them you can come up with some 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.800
 suspended structures 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.870
 sparrows on a shaky platform never 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.910
 I have a peat pot in my hands 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.350
 which all gardeners know how 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.350
 use for seedlings 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.989
 I took with the help of the wire made here 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.090
 such a tongue fixing the buttons to 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.730
 the wire did not fall through the top 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.570
 part of it can be hung to the tree now 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:12.140
 I have to cook the mixture in beef 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.140
 melted fat i add seed mixture 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.920
 It is desirable that the fat was beef because 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.860
 that he is better 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.500
 freezes though tits anyway 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.650
 be with pork 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.510
 Now we wait until everything hardens and 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.850
 hang down the tongue you can 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.930
 ask your children to help you beautifully 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.300
 checkout and pots 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.400
 their fantasies will help you see if you can 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.740
 use and bells bumps and 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.230
 other plant items even apples 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.240
 well, if there are no pots in your 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.850
 the house you can just do such 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.250
 cookies using any form by putting 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.050
 in the fridge freeze fat do not forget 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.070
 Only now add this from the rope 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.100
 for hanging 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.070
 now that all birds love 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.860
 it is of course cereal cereal seeds 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.800
 plants are very fond of larch seeds 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.920
 can go to the forest and collect their birds 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.520
 She loves chips not only my children 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.400
 birds 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.980
 can I take potatoes for example green 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.810
 which is already unsafe to rub on 

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:15.230
 grater and dry in the oven when 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.260
 temperature 80 degrees make beads from 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.630
 hawthorn from other terrestrial berries from 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.060
 unsalted biscuits and remember what to 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.930
 cynical bread can be consumed about black 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.930
 in no case 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:32.970
 Well, some feeders may be 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.970
 real works of art 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.349
 today the birds will have a feast but not 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.689
 flatter yourself for a moment 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.379
 birds need constantly and regularly in 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.379
 throughout the winter
