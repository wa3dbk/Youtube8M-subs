00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.989
 9 absolutely 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:13.120
 yes where i will be very nice place at school 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.650
 just to enter into that dialogue I think I need to 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.220
 shares how the world works 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.419
 there are 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.769
 That's a serious ht because they have a lot of students on March 8 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.500
 The nice thing about it is just talking to yourself a lot 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.960
 and if there is anyone 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.720
 it was very exciting 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.910
 And sometimes there are people who you yourself 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.910
 take in there 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.280
 from 12 years on to the video and and 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.790
 that does something to children 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.790
 is going to ask questions 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.340
 they see it as a teacher 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.300
 the fourth time in the week 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.230
 they also think that the duel is conditional that they change something quickly 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.310
 that is one of the teachers 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.649
 what are your can do is 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.040
 people often come to my game 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.880
 children start talking about it together in a group 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.210
 but sometimes also in the group 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.460
 the more groups of very lively discussion arise 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.230
 also quite a few subjects 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.940
 and where they are not there anyway to form their own opinion and think 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.220
 about what 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.970
 why should you actually have relationships and sexuality within relationships 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.460
 I hope that network but in practice 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.460
 I don't really know about that 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.440
 yes I think so absolutely 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.830
 I have noticed that 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.820
 the formula very pleasant a healthy snack injured also for research 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.130
 to spa topic 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.040
 we talk 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.770
 we did not have pig winners
