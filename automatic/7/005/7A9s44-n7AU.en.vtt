00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.040
 Gerd Golle loves long walks with his dog Blacky 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.120
 For hours, the two are on the way 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.689
 for the 68-year-old a blessing 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:18.460
 if it were not for the sick heart 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.750
 Two years ago, he had a serious heart attack 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.750
 an operation at Tesla 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.370
 Nevertheless, there is still the risk of an infarction and if exactly that again 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.410
 What happened then on one of his walks? 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.580
 nobody is to be seen far and wide 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.580
 how should the quick help come here 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.980
 in order to 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.430
 This device is called Body Phone comes from Saxony and he is one month 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.640
 available 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.640
 it has a large and you emergency button 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.610
 A push of a button is enough and already help is called into the body phone 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.170
 a mobile phone integrated 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.510
 the picture now a previously set Grandma 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.670
 in this case it is the son of Richard Golz 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.340
 He instantly recognizes on his cell phone that his father needs help 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.570
 yes I am 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.010
 I'm not feeling well, I really need help 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.820
 Naked scenes phone calls the device has a handsfree of the 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.450
 Horror is not possible has problems with 0 4 0 2 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.020
 and already the son can come to help his father 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.060
 so far so good 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.799
 but what if the son can not accept the distress call of the father because he is 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.880
 out of the cell phone has left in the car 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.880
 then the emergency call from Gerd Goll remains unheard 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.600
 The developers have also thought of that 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.810
 if the son does not pick up the device automatically dials a second number 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.810
 namely the one emergency call center 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.679
 Euro per seat and squat Group Inc 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:15.779
 Here, too, a voice connection is established 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:19.089
 the experts in the emergency call center can get a picture of the situation 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:20.889
 do 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:22.279
 Rust he locked out 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:23.959
 Klose must be at the highest level 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.310
 an important question to send help to the right place 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.420
 but what if the person becomes unconscious before she can say where she is 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.389
 Euro 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:35.389
 can you hear me 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:40.199
 how should the help come to the right place? 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:44.189
 Also with the body forums the notebook phone can be similar over the 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.929
 Transmitting antennas can be located in the area 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:49.929
 so the location is determined in no time 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.799
 this location is shown on a map and the rescuers have to 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.799
 where the journey should go because every minute counts 

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:13.339
 the inventor of this emergency phone is Andrea kosher from Saxony 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:18.319
 hard to believe, but true 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.409
 The idea came to the nurse and mother Dreier children in their sleep 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:27.359
 she was thinking of a bracelet with an alarm button and waste to herself 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:28.200
 old pure 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.109
 a model 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.499
 I already have no idea at all about technology 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:36.199
 the biggest difficulty I have cup test is just putting my words down 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:40.789
 I know no technical symbols or any formulation 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:42.219
 for this 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:45.130
 so she was looking for a manufacturer and 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.339
 canteens 

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:51.019
 In the future, the Boarding Phone is even more than just an emergency call 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.349
 depose 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.889
 With additional systems like a chest strap, it can even curbs data 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:00.509
 transmit not only for the elderly is the notebook phone thought 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:07.430
 for all actually side that but especially for children 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:12.889
 For example, four-year-old women of the age of 80 may need one 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:15.889
 Little ones will finally be on the safe side for everyone 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.029
 also for the safety of Bernd Rudolf 

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:24.419
 Incidentally, he enjoys best health only for just the years 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.830
 he has recreated the possible emergency situations 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.580
 but in case 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.580
 precarious that Buddy Phone always with you 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.249
 a keystroke and already God picture
