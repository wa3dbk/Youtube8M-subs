drum lesson what you just saw was a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.630 
drum lesson what you just saw was a
basic<00:00:47.960> approach<00:00:48.320> using<00:00:48.800> sixteenth<00:00:49.370> note

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
basic approach using sixteenth note

single<00:00:55.519> pedal<00:00:55.819> here<00:00:55.969> but<00:00:56.120> you<00:00:56.239> can<00:00:56.269> of<00:00:56.449> course

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
single pedal here but you can of course

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:58.450 
single pedal here but you can of course
incorporate<00:00:57.350> a<00:00:57.379> double<00:00:57.739> pedal<00:00:58.039> or<00:00:58.159> double

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
triplet three triplet and triplet four

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.540 
triplet three triplet and triplet four
triplet<00:01:05.690> and<00:01:06.320> triplet<00:01:06.770> those<00:01:07.100> are<00:01:07.280> notice

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
triplet and triplet those are notice

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.120 
triplet and triplet those are notice
sixteenth<00:01:08.000> note<00:01:08.210> triplets<00:01:08.659> the<00:01:09.350> first<00:01:09.680> group

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
sixteenth note triplets the first group

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.990 
sixteenth note triplets the first group
was<00:01:10.850> right<00:01:11.360> left<00:01:11.780> right<00:01:12.110> left<00:01:12.170> foot<00:01:12.950> foot<00:01:16.000> the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
was right left right left foot foot the

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.179 
was right left right left foot foot the
second<00:01:17.540> group<00:01:17.780> was<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.320> same<00:01:18.590> thing

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.160 

so<00:01:22.189> the<00:01:22.310> first<00:01:22.490> two<00:01:22.850> sixteenth<00:01:23.420> note<00:01:23.659> triplets

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
so the first two sixteenth note triplets

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:31.959 
so the first two sixteenth note triplets
simply<00:01:24.530> sound<00:01:24.799> like<00:01:24.979> this<00:01:29.920> I'm<00:01:30.920> three<00:01:31.429> triplet

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
simply sound like this I'm three triplet

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:34.809 
simply sound like this I'm three triplet
and<00:01:32.090> triplet<00:01:32.659> it's<00:01:32.869> right<00:01:33.530> left<00:01:33.979> foot<00:01:34.369> foot

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819 
and triplet it's right left foot foot

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:40.929 
and triplet it's right left foot foot
right<00:01:35.149> left<00:01:37.299> and<00:01:38.560> on<00:01:39.560> 4<00:01:39.920> triplet<00:01:40.280> it's<00:01:40.609> all

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
right left and on 4 triplet it's all

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.389 
right left and on 4 triplet it's all
hands<00:01:41.509> right<00:01:41.780> left<00:01:42.079> right<00:01:42.319> left<00:01:42.679> right<00:01:42.829> left<00:01:43.060> 4

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
hands right left right left right left 4

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.819 
hands right left right left right left 4
so<00:01:46.399> here's<00:01:46.609> the<00:01:46.759> entire<00:01:47.030> pattern<00:01:47.390> slowly<00:01:47.899> 1

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
so here's the entire pattern slowly 1

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.190 
so here's the entire pattern slowly 1
triplet<00:01:49.189> and<00:01:49.520> triplet<00:01:50.240> 2<00:01:50.539> triplet<00:01:50.569> and

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
triplet and triplet 2 triplet and

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.889 
triplet and triplet 2 triplet and
triplet<00:01:51.859> 3<00:01:52.159> triplet<00:01:52.189> and<00:01:52.849> triplet<00:01:53.539> 4<00:01:53.869> triplet

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
triplet 3 triplet and triplet 4 triplet

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:03.369 
triplet 3 triplet and triplet 4 triplet
and<00:01:54.619> triplet<00:01:55.219> I<00:02:01.899> kind<00:02:02.899> of<00:02:03.020> just<00:02:03.170> put<00:02:03.349> a

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:03.379 
and triplet I kind of just put a

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:22.720 
and triplet I kind of just put a
balanced<00:02:03.860> funk<00:02:04.250> groove<00:02:04.610> to<00:02:04.879> it<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:22.310> again

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
balanced funk groove to it and again

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.210 
balanced funk groove to it and again
this<00:02:22.940> is<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.150> real<00:02:23.569> common<00:02:24.410> way<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.620> phrase<00:02:25.190> a

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
this is a real common way to phrase a

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.220 
this is a real common way to phrase a
sixteenth<00:02:25.940> note<00:02:26.150> triplet<00:02:26.599> especially<00:02:27.109> the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
sixteenth note triplet especially the

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.060 
sixteenth note triplet especially the
right<00:02:27.410> left<00:02:27.799> right<00:02:28.069> left<00:02:28.130> foot<00:02:28.700> foot

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.990 

so<00:02:35.070> again<00:02:35.310> let's<00:02:35.490> go<00:02:35.610> back<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:35.820> the

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
so again let's go back to the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.400 
so again let's go back to the
performance<00:02:36.570> video<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.050> then<00:02:37.140> we'll<00:02:37.230> check

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
performance video and then we'll check

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.780 
performance video and then we'll check
out<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.620> transcription<00:02:38.400> on<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.670> end

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
out the transcription on the end

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.610 
out the transcription on the end
remember<00:02:39.240> to<00:02:39.360> experiment<00:02:40.140> with<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:40.350> type<00:02:40.590> of

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
remember to experiment with this type of

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.890 
remember to experiment with this type of
idea<00:02:41.070> there's<00:02:41.280> just<00:02:41.460> so<00:02:41.790> many<00:02:41.940> kind<00:02:42.780> of

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
idea there's just so many kind of

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.840 
idea there's just so many kind of
combinations<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.710> can<00:02:43.800> come<00:02:44.070> up<00:02:44.220> with<00:02:44.400> so

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
combinations you can come up with so

00:02:44.850 --> 00:03:25.100 
combinations you can come up with so
here's<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.120> performance<00:02:45.630> tempo<00:02:45.990> again<00:03:24.110> alright

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
here's a performance tempo again alright

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.199 
here's a performance tempo again alright
so<00:03:25.350> there<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.739> go<00:03:25.920> a<00:03:25.950> basic<00:03:26.459> way<00:03:26.640> of<00:03:26.820> using<00:03:26.970> a

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
so there you go a basic way of using a

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.750 
so there you go a basic way of using a
sixteenth<00:03:27.780> note<00:03:28.050> triplet<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:28.770> throwing<00:03:29.670> in

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
sixteenth note triplet and throwing in

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.490 
sixteenth note triplet and throwing in
some<00:03:29.970> bass<00:03:30.209> drum<00:03:30.570> within<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:30.959> idea<00:03:31.350> as<00:03:31.470> well

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
some bass drum within the idea as well

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.160 
some bass drum within the idea as well
these<00:03:32.220> are<00:03:32.459> extremely<00:03:32.940> popular<00:03:33.330> in<00:03:33.690> today's

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
these are extremely popular in today's

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.650 
these are extremely popular in today's
playing<00:03:34.640> especially<00:03:35.640> when<00:03:35.760> you're<00:03:35.940> executing

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660
