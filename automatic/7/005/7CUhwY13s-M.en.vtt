you about a mushroom very large one

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.960 
you about a mushroom very large one
called<00:00:16.480> reishi<00:00:16.720> mushroom<00:00:17.380> also<00:00:17.970> Ganoderma

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
called reishi mushroom also Ganoderma

lucidum<00:00:19.539> or<00:00:20.080> ling<00:00:20.529> Jie<00:00:20.800> in<00:00:21.070> Chinese<00:00:21.519> this<00:00:21.910> is

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
lucidum or ling Jie in Chinese this is

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.720 
lucidum or ling Jie in Chinese this is
actually<00:00:22.509> half<00:00:22.750> of<00:00:22.929> a<00:00:23.019> mushroom<00:00:23.320> the<00:00:23.740> was<00:00:24.490> so

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
actually half of a mushroom the was so

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.730 
actually half of a mushroom the was so
big<00:00:25.029> and<00:00:25.359> I<00:00:25.420> couldn't<00:00:25.720> break<00:00:25.990> it<00:00:26.230> there's<00:00:26.529> like

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
big and I couldn't break it there's like

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.679 
big and I couldn't break it there's like
wood<00:00:27.070> I<00:00:27.339> took<00:00:27.699> it<00:00:27.820> over<00:00:27.880> to<00:00:28.029> Home<00:00:28.210> Depot<00:00:28.240> and

the guy videoed him using his saw to cut

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.090 
the guy videoed him using his saw to cut
the<00:00:31.720> mushroom<00:00:32.050> because<00:00:32.230> he<00:00:32.590> thought<00:00:32.770> I<00:00:32.830> was

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
the mushroom because he thought I was

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.340 
the mushroom because he thought I was
the<00:00:33.130> strangest<00:00:33.790> customer<00:00:34.330> that<00:00:34.750> he<00:00:34.930> had<00:00:35.140> had

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
the strangest customer that he had had

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.920 
the strangest customer that he had had
all<00:00:35.620> year<00:00:36.039> and<00:00:36.219> so<00:00:36.300> he<00:00:37.300> put<00:00:37.539> that<00:00:37.629> on<00:00:37.690> Facebook

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
all year and so he put that on Facebook

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.840 
all year and so he put that on Facebook
I<00:00:38.260> thought<00:00:38.379> that<00:00:38.530> was<00:00:38.649> very<00:00:38.710> funny<00:00:38.950> but<00:00:39.550> anyway

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
I thought that was very funny but anyway

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
let me just show you that they do come

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.020 
let me just show you that they do come

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
natural killer cells which is good you

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:02.849 
natural killer cells which is good you
want<00:01:01.570> your<00:01:01.719> natural<00:01:02.109> killer<00:01:02.320> cells<00:01:02.620> do<00:01:02.800> not

want your natural killer cells do not
truly<00:01:03.190> kill<00:01:03.550> off<00:01:03.820> organisms<00:01:04.600> and<00:01:04.870> these<00:01:05.710> will

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
truly kill off organisms and these will

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.340 
truly kill off organisms and these will
also<00:01:06.400> do<00:01:06.850> a<00:01:06.880> number<00:01:07.090> of<00:01:07.240> things<00:01:07.360> to<00:01:07.810> increase

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
also do a number of things to increase

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.130 
also do a number of things to increase
interferon<00:01:09.159> gamma<00:01:09.400> that's<00:01:10.180> very<00:01:10.479> good<00:01:10.780> and

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
interferon gamma that's very good and

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.980 
interferon gamma that's very good and
also<00:01:11.409> to<00:01:11.710> suppress<00:01:12.580> and<00:01:12.909> raise<00:01:13.570> certain

also to suppress and raise certain

cancer<00:01:24.610> and<00:01:24.820> gastric<00:01:25.570> cancer<00:01:26.369> one<00:01:27.369> of<00:01:27.400> the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
cancer and gastric cancer one of the

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.980 
cancer and gastric cancer one of the
things<00:01:27.850> they<00:01:28.000> do<00:01:28.060> that<00:01:28.180> I<00:01:28.360> think<00:01:28.479> is<00:01:28.720> really

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
things they do that I think is really

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.350 
things they do that I think is really
neat<00:01:29.170> is<00:01:29.350> they<00:01:29.530> reduce<00:01:30.130> angiogenesis<00:01:31.030> which

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
neat is they reduce angiogenesis which

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.429 
neat is they reduce angiogenesis which
is<00:01:31.509> a<00:01:31.540> big<00:01:31.810> word<00:01:32.170> that<00:01:32.560> basically<00:01:33.520> means<00:01:34.439> blood

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
is a big word that basically means blood

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.789 
is a big word that basically means blood
vessels<00:01:36.040> are<00:01:36.310> feeding<00:01:37.060> cancer<00:01:37.869> so<00:01:38.320> when<00:01:38.590> you

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
vessels are feeding cancer so when you

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.420 
vessels are feeding cancer so when you
reduce<00:01:39.280> or<00:01:39.490> inhibit<00:01:40.060> or<00:01:40.299> block<00:01:40.659> angiogenesis

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
reduce or inhibit or block angiogenesis

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.090 
reduce or inhibit or block angiogenesis
you<00:01:42.430> start<00:01:42.909> off<00:01:43.119> cancer<00:01:43.659> cells<00:01:44.079> very<00:01:44.710> good

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
you start off cancer cells very good

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.539 
you start off cancer cells very good
also<00:01:45.909> these<00:01:46.329> induce<00:01:46.810> a<00:01:46.960> pitocin<00:01:47.469> which<00:01:48.219> means

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
also these induce a pitocin which means

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.179 
also these induce a pitocin which means
they<00:01:49.030> send<00:01:49.450> a<00:01:49.509> signal<00:01:49.540> out<00:01:50.049> that<00:01:50.380> tells<00:01:50.680> cancer

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
they send a signal out that tells cancer

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.539 
they send a signal out that tells cancer
cells<00:01:51.520> go<00:01:52.240> kill<00:01:52.570> yourself<00:01:52.750> get<00:01:53.619> out<00:01:53.799> which<00:01:54.399> is

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
cells go kill yourself get out which is

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.600 
cells go kill yourself get out which is
a<00:01:54.579> good<00:01:54.790> thing<00:01:55.000> you<00:01:55.450> want<00:01:55.719> to<00:01:55.960> induce<00:01:56.409> a<00:01:56.710> ptosis

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
a good thing you want to induce a ptosis

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.340 
a good thing you want to induce a ptosis
it<00:01:57.759> tells<00:01:58.030> cancer<00:01:58.509> cells<00:01:58.719> to<00:01:58.899> commit<00:01:59.170> suicide

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
it tells cancer cells to commit suicide

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.950 
it tells cancer cells to commit suicide
now<00:02:00.310> how<00:02:00.640> do<00:02:00.700> you<00:02:00.789> make<00:02:00.850> this<00:02:01.360> because<00:02:01.750> I<00:02:01.899> know

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
now how do you make this because I know
