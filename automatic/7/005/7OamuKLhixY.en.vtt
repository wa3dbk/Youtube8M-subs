it I think you'll be a lot better off

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.020 
it I think you'll be a lot better off
with<00:04:13.410> a<00:04:13.440> Ford<00:04:13.800> s-max<00:04:14.100> because<00:04:14.670> that<00:04:14.790> really<00:04:14.940> is

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
with a Ford s-max because that really is

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.270 
with a Ford s-max because that really is
it<00:04:15.210> have<00:04:15.420> your<00:04:15.600> cake<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:15.870> eat<00:04:16.200> it<00:04:16.230> car<00:04:16.650> whereas

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
it have your cake and eat it car whereas

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.240 
it have your cake and eat it car whereas
the<00:04:17.400> Chiron<00:04:17.700> it's<00:04:18.660> sensible<00:04:19.130> that's<00:04:20.130> for

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
the Chiron it's sensible that's for

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:29.510 
the Chiron it's sensible that's for
entertaining<00:04:20.810> not<00:04:21.810> so<00:04:22.049> much<00:04:28.280> there<00:04:29.280> are<00:04:29.400> some

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
entertaining not so much there are some

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.040 
entertaining not so much there are some
other<00:04:29.670> problems<00:04:29.790> with<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.300> Chiron<00:04:30.690> for

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
other problems with the Chiron for

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.390 
other problems with the Chiron for
instance<00:04:31.320> even<00:04:31.530> though<00:04:31.620> you<00:04:31.680> sit<00:04:31.950> nice<00:04:32.160> and

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
instance even though you sit nice and

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.610 
instance even though you sit nice and
high<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:32.630> door<00:04:33.630> mirrors<00:04:33.840> a<00:04:34.110> little<00:04:34.380> bit<00:04:34.530> on

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
high the door mirrors a little bit on

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.960 
high the door mirrors a little bit on
the<00:04:34.710> small<00:04:35.010> side<00:04:35.040> it's<00:04:35.460> a<00:04:35.520> bit<00:04:35.670> of<00:04:35.730> a<00:04:35.790> pain

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
the small side it's a bit of a pain

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.850 
the small side it's a bit of a pain
considering<00:04:36.450> how<00:04:36.690> long<00:04:37.020> this<00:04:37.260> vehicle<00:04:37.740> is

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
considering how long this vehicle is

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.460 
considering how long this vehicle is
speaking<00:04:38.580> of<00:04:38.700> which<00:04:38.910> it's<00:04:39.720> not<00:04:39.930> much<00:04:40.140> fun<00:04:40.410> to

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
speaking of which it's not much fun to

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.290 
speaking of which it's not much fun to
navigate<00:04:41.130> around<00:04:41.310> town<00:04:41.730> because<00:04:41.910> it's<00:04:42.060> just

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
navigate around town because it's just

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.210 
navigate around town because it's just
so<00:04:42.540> huge<00:04:42.960> I<00:04:43.110> don't<00:04:43.140> particularly<00:04:43.770> like<00:04:43.920> doing

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
so huge I don't particularly like doing

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.330 
so huge I don't particularly like doing
really<00:04:44.400> roundabouts<00:04:44.970> such<00:04:45.210> as<00:04:45.390> this<00:04:45.540> because

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
really roundabouts such as this because

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.530 
really roundabouts such as this because
God<00:04:47.340> it's<00:04:48.060> a<00:04:48.120> little<00:04:48.360> bit<00:04:48.480> embarrassing

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
God it's a little bit embarrassing

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.230 
God it's a little bit embarrassing
almost<00:04:49.230> hit<00:04:49.350> the<00:04:49.440> curb<00:04:49.710> there<00:04:50.010> and<00:04:50.220> you<00:04:51.060> can

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
almost hit the curb there and you can

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.110 
almost hit the curb there and you can
take<00:04:51.510> an<00:04:51.720> absolute<00:04:52.590> age<00:04:52.940> looking<00:04:53.940> for<00:04:54.090> a

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
take an absolute age looking for a

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.470 
take an absolute age looking for a
parking<00:04:54.480> space<00:04:54.690> that's<00:04:54.960> big<00:04:55.230> enough

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.400 

however<00:05:01.480> the<00:05:01.570> biggest<00:05:01.960> problem<00:05:02.200> with<00:05:02.290> the

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
however the biggest problem with the

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.230 
however the biggest problem with the
Chiron<00:05:02.680> is<00:05:02.860> its<00:05:03.160> price<00:05:03.460> because<00:05:03.820> it<00:05:03.970> costs

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
Chiron is its price because it costs

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.390 
Chiron is its price because it costs
more<00:05:04.390> and<00:05:04.900> let's<00:05:05.080> say<00:05:05.260> it<00:05:05.410> alhambra<00:05:05.920> it's

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
more and let's say it alhambra it's

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.280 
more and let's say it alhambra it's
exactly<00:05:06.910> the<00:05:07.060> same<00:05:07.210> car<00:05:07.540> pretty<00:05:07.780> much<00:05:07.870> apart

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
exactly the same car pretty much apart

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.930 
exactly the same car pretty much apart
from<00:05:08.410> the<00:05:08.530> badge<00:05:08.830> that<00:05:09.280> said<00:05:09.520> you<00:05:09.670> might<00:05:09.820> be

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
from the badge that said you might be

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.700 
from the badge that said you might be
willing<00:05:10.090> to<00:05:10.210> pay<00:05:10.330> that<00:05:10.450> little<00:05:10.570> bit<00:05:10.810> extra<00:05:11.020> to

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
willing to pay that little bit extra to

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.980 
willing to pay that little bit extra to
own<00:05:11.890> a<00:05:12.130> box<00:05:12.550> right

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.990 

haha
