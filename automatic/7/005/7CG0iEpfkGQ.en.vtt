you to the application so what you are
noticing<00:03:33.449> here<00:03:33.930> actually<00:03:34.470> is<00:03:34.620> one<00:03:34.919> of<00:03:34.949> the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
noticing here actually is one of the

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.069 
noticing here actually is one of the
hiccups<00:03:35.579> and<00:03:35.760> using<00:03:36.209> this<00:03:36.389> and<00:03:36.599> I'm<00:03:36.690> glad<00:03:36.900> it

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
hiccups and using this and I'm glad it

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.479 
hiccups and using this and I'm glad it
happened<00:03:37.109> because<00:03:37.530> now<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:37.739> can<00:03:37.949> see<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.280> but

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
happened because now you can see it but

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.250 
happened because now you can see it but
basically<00:03:38.639> what<00:03:39.120> I've<00:03:39.239> noticed<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.810> using<00:03:40.139> I

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
basically what I've noticed and using I

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.319 
basically what I've noticed and using I
Connor<00:03:40.560> is<00:03:40.799> that<00:03:41.010> it<00:03:41.220> will<00:03:41.400> sometimes<00:03:41.879> change

I had up here when I was showing you a

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.930 
I had up here when I was showing you a
demonstration<00:03:49.799> of<00:03:50.190> how<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:50.459> looked<00:03:50.669> was

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
demonstration of how it looked was

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.000 
demonstration of how it looked was
called<00:03:51.239> TMO<00:03:51.930> which<00:03:52.139> is<00:03:52.290> called<00:03:52.500> tag<00:03:52.739> me<00:03:52.889> out

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
called TMO which is called tag me out

which<00:03:53.430> is<00:03:53.639> where<00:03:53.790> you<00:03:53.879> can<00:03:54.000> call<00:03:54.209> one<00:03:54.389> of<00:03:54.419> your

contacts from your home screen so if you

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:58.580 
contacts from your home screen so if you
don't<00:03:57.209> mind<00:03:57.510> possibly<00:03:58.230> having<00:03:58.440> to

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
don't mind possibly having to

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.069 
don't mind possibly having to
reconfigure<00:03:59.370> your<00:03:59.970> icons<00:04:00.449> then<00:04:00.780> this<00:04:00.930> is

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
reconfigure your icons then this is

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.629 
reconfigure your icons then this is
something<00:04:01.440> that<00:04:01.470> you<00:04:01.739> may<00:04:01.889> like<00:04:02.129> but<00:04:02.430> my

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
something that you may like but my

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.849 
something that you may like but my
workaround<00:04:03.209> that<00:04:03.269> I<00:04:03.389> found<00:04:03.750> where<00:04:04.169> this<00:04:04.500> does

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
workaround that I found where this does

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.580 
workaround that I found where this does
not<00:04:05.040> happen<00:04:05.310> as<00:04:05.699> often<00:04:06.000> is<00:04:06.389> if<00:04:06.659> I<00:04:06.810> go<00:04:07.049> into<00:04:07.290> our

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
not happen as often is if I go into our

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.500 
not happen as often is if I go into our
Conner<00:04:07.889> and<00:04:08.220> when<00:04:08.340> I<00:04:08.370> choose<00:04:08.699> the<00:04:08.760> icon<00:04:09.299> that<00:04:09.449> I

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
Conner and when I choose the icon that I

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.599 
Conner and when I choose the icon that I
want<00:04:09.810> say<00:04:10.019> for<00:04:10.169> instance<00:04:10.290> this<00:04:10.590> one<00:04:10.829> if<00:04:10.949> I<00:04:11.250> save

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
want say for instance this one if I save

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:18.680 
want say for instance this one if I save
it<00:04:11.819> and<00:04:13.129> then<00:04:14.129> I'll<00:04:14.310> go<00:04:14.519> to<00:04:14.549> my<00:04:14.909> favorites<00:04:17.539> if<00:04:18.539> I

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
it and then I'll go to my favorites if I

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.349 
it and then I'll go to my favorites if I
were<00:04:18.840> to<00:04:18.959> do<00:04:19.139> this<00:04:19.380> instead<00:04:19.919> then<00:04:20.340> it<00:04:20.669> tends<00:04:21.060> to

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
were to do this instead then it tends to

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.930 
were to do this instead then it tends to
work<00:04:21.539> better<00:04:21.840> if<00:04:22.169> I<00:04:22.289> were<00:04:22.500> to<00:04:22.680> add<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:23.280> icon

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
work better if I were to add the icon

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.480 
work better if I were to add the icon
from<00:04:24.300> my<00:04:24.539> favorites<00:04:25.020> instead<00:04:25.440> of<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:26.250> theme

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
from my favorites instead of the theme

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.330 
from my favorites instead of the theme
itself

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
itself

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.290 
itself
so<00:04:27.430> if<00:04:27.490> I<00:04:27.610> were<00:04:27.730> to<00:04:27.760> go<00:04:27.940> through<00:04:28.090> the<00:04:28.180> motions

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
so if I were to go through the motions

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.450 
so if I were to go through the motions
like<00:04:28.600> already<00:04:28.870> showed<00:04:29.169> you<00:04:29.320> from<00:04:29.470> here<00:04:29.800> versus

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
like already showed you from here versus

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.040 
like already showed you from here versus
from<00:04:30.730> the<00:04:30.880> theme<00:04:31.060> where<00:04:31.300> all<00:04:31.419> of<00:04:31.600> the<00:04:31.690> icons

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
from the theme where all of the icons

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.390 
from the theme where all of the icons
are<00:04:32.290> and<00:04:32.530> that's<00:04:32.710> just<00:04:32.889> something<00:04:33.100> I've

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
are and that's just something I've

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.430 
are and that's just something I've
noticed<00:04:33.820> but<00:04:34.090> generally<00:04:34.540> once<00:04:34.780> this<00:04:34.990> happens

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
noticed but generally once this happens

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.710 
noticed but generally once this happens
it<00:04:35.710> doesn't<00:04:36.250> revert<00:04:36.699> back<00:04:36.910> so<00:04:37.270> just<00:04:37.479> keep<00:04:37.690> that

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
it doesn't revert back so just keep that

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.450 
it doesn't revert back so just keep that
in<00:04:37.900> mind<00:04:38.020> that<00:04:38.380> is<00:04:38.500> one<00:04:38.740> of<00:04:38.860> the<00:04:38.949> hiccups<00:04:39.310> of

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
in mind that is one of the hiccups of

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.310 
in mind that is one of the hiccups of
this<00:04:39.820> particular<00:04:40.360> application<00:04:40.780> but<00:04:41.199> if

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
this particular application but if

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.689 
this particular application but if
