00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.490
 good morning everyone today we are with a 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.980
 new video about music in minecraft and 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.020
 Well I've been looking for how to do 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.029
 Super Mario Bros song and when 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.849
 has gotten I say with what has 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.800
 cost to me let's help others 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:30.559
 okay and here I have the first piece 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.559
 of the song, it's pretty long 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.550
 pretty long 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.260
 there it comes, that 's the first piece 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.329
 of the song and I've put all the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.760
 notes worth 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.070
 the safest if you ask me if you like the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.050
 video because it is safest to go 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.040
 going up in parts for requests worth 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.990
 there are nine parts this is the first 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.990
 and well let's try it 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.620
 then I will pass slowly because you see the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.620
 notes 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.200
 and it's pretty short, it's worth 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.000
 first part think that there are nine 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.000
 requests as I said 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.830
 I will pass to show you the notes and 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.830
 that you can copy in your world 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.900
 I'm going to take my hand off this 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.850
 there is 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.670
 I'm sorry for the micro but it's a bit 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.720
 fucked up okay it's got his good years I'm going 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.720
 to pass like this directly 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.940
 here are three attentive vouchers 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.900
 Yes better 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.530
 and good 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.570
 It seems to me a foolish thing that takes 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.360
 to do something like that the truth you say 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.310
 it's nothing in twenty special seconds 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.760
 the song 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.520
 but he's thinking that I've taken a 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.280
 aunt score is not worth and that they are two 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.490
 notes for every time 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.140
 not minimum but two notes per time 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.750
 I want to say that it is not the same as 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.340
 there they dropped a note every time and it was 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.950
 a flute score is much more 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.210
 simple that of pirates of the Caribbean that 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.200
 is 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:39.410
 and well you will have noticed that there are shades that 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.840
 does not reach the right point what has 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.870
 passed here one now the other is everything 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.270
 What has happened to me is that the song is worth 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.300
 to do it correctly 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:54.440
 I needed 25 clicks in one in two or three 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.360
 of the blocks and they only have 24 so 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.930
 I had to lower the whole scale a 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.610
 number is worth all the notes are a 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.130
 number of descents 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.780
 I have corrected all the posters and 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.910
 except this is the original part 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.200
 this part is not changed at all 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.200
 rest is worked a number 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.909
 You see to go you have noticed 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.650
 and here again these are the sites in 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.760
 the ones that I had to deal with 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.159
 because the notes do not finish arriving 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.620
 and well I ask again that if someone 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:42.189
 he knows how to make white notes that he does not 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.970
 Say it and good is a tutorial of how 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:48.129
 do it that I passed the same tutorial 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:53.459
 because it's good to know it's worth I leave it 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:53.459
 Here I hope you liked it and goodbye
