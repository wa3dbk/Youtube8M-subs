00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:55.010 

I<00:05:50.840> just<00:05:51.840> finished<00:05:52.050> up<00:05:52.350> the<00:05:52.410> 335i<00:05:53.570> twin<00:05:54.570> turbo

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
I just finished up the 335i twin turbo

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.110 
I just finished up the 335i twin turbo
upgrade<00:05:58.070> it<00:05:59.070> actually<00:05:59.460> turned<00:05:59.730> out<00:05:59.880> really

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
upgrade it actually turned out really

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.560 
upgrade it actually turned out really
nice<00:06:01.280> the<00:06:02.280> clearances<00:06:02.790> on<00:06:02.970> these<00:06:03.150> are<00:06:03.360> like

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
nice the clearances on these are like

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.540 
nice the clearances on these are like
super<00:06:04.110> tight<00:06:04.410> I<00:06:04.650> guess<00:06:04.860> because<00:06:05.130> they're<00:06:05.340> so

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
super tight I guess because they're so

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.720 
super tight I guess because they're so
tiny

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:10.730 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.140 

we<00:06:11.730> also<00:06:11.940> had<00:06:12.330> the<00:06:12.540> turbines<00:06:12.990> clipped<00:06:14.150> and

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
we also had the turbines clipped and

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.370 
we also had the turbines clipped and
balanced<00:06:16.850> one<00:06:17.850> idea<00:06:18.210> that<00:06:18.510> I<00:06:18.540> had<00:06:18.930> for

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
balanced one idea that I had for

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.130 
balanced one idea that I had for
upgrading<00:06:19.920> that's<00:06:20.100> the<00:06:20.490> 335<00:06:21.270> eyes<00:06:21.570> her<00:06:21.870> bows

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
upgrading that's the 335 eyes her bows

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.750 
upgrading that's the 335 eyes her bows
is<00:06:22.680> if<00:06:23.640> you<00:06:23.910> just<00:06:23.940> cut<00:06:24.450> this<00:06:24.720> part<00:06:25.020> off<00:06:25.260> and

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:25.760 
is if you just cut this part off and

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.800 
is if you just cut this part off and
welded<00:06:26.760> a<00:06:27.060> flange<00:06:27.780> for<00:06:28.080> the<00:06:28.290> teal<00:06:29.810> v-band

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
welded a flange for the teal v-band

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.550 
welded a flange for the teal v-band
housing<00:06:31.650> and<00:06:31.860> then<00:06:32.130> put<00:06:32.340> like<00:06:32.370> a<00:06:32.550> GT<00:06:33.090> 28<00:06:33.600> 60<00:06:34.350> or

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
housing and then put like a GT 28 60 or

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.660 
housing and then put like a GT 28 60 or
30<00:06:34.950> are<00:06:35.900> inside<00:06:36.900> that<00:06:37.160> to<00:06:38.160> make<00:06:38.340> them<00:06:38.490> do<00:06:38.640> a

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:38.670 
30 are inside that to make them do a

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.970 
30 are inside that to make them do a
ball<00:06:38.940> bearing<00:06:39.180> I<00:06:39.630> think<00:06:40.320> that<00:06:40.500> makes<00:06:40.740> more

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:40.980 
ball bearing I think that makes more

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.330 
ball bearing I think that makes more
sense<00:06:41.310> and<00:06:42.050> this<00:06:43.050> part<00:06:43.440> right<00:06:43.680> here<00:06:43.740> already

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 
sense and this part right here already

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.360 
sense and this part right here already
appears<00:06:44.760> to<00:06:44.940> be<00:06:45.090> stainless<00:06:45.480> heal<00:06:46.050> so<00:06:46.470> you

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 
appears to be stainless heal so you

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.880 
appears to be stainless heal so you
could<00:06:47.520> just<00:06:47.700> weld<00:06:48.000> they're<00:06:48.300> stainless<00:06:48.890> flange

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:49.890 
could just weld they're stainless flange

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:58.250 
could just weld they're stainless flange
on<00:06:50.220> there<00:06:50.520> I<00:06:56.360> think<00:06:57.360> that<00:06:57.570> makes<00:06:57.930> a<00:06:58.080> lot<00:06:58.110> more

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:58.260 
on there I think that makes a lot more

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.250 
on there I think that makes a lot more
sense<00:06:58.470> than<00:06:58.980> upgrading<00:06:59.190> these<00:06:59.990> unless<00:07:00.990> you're

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:01.260 
sense than upgrading these unless you're

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:04.660 
sense than upgrading these unless you're
just<00:07:01.410> kind<00:07:01.710> of<00:07:01.770> looking<00:07:01.890> for<00:07:02.280> a<00:07:02.310> small<00:07:02.640> upgrade

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:04.670 
just kind of looking for a small upgrade

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:09.020 
just kind of looking for a small upgrade
also<00:07:05.670> this<00:07:06.090> this<00:07:06.480> right<00:07:06.720> here<00:07:06.780> is<00:07:07.140> nickel<00:07:08.030> so

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.030 
also this this right here is nickel so

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.690 
also this this right here is nickel so
well<00:07:09.840> it's<00:07:10.050> it's<00:07:10.410> got<00:07:10.650> a<00:07:10.680> nickel<00:07:10.980> in<00:07:11.190> the<00:07:11.220> in

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:11.700 
well it's it's got a nickel in the in

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.820 
well it's it's got a nickel in the in
the<00:07:11.880> metal<00:07:12.210> so<00:07:12.570> that's<00:07:12.840> really<00:07:13.110> easy<00:07:13.230> to<00:07:13.530> weld

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:13.830 
the metal so that's really easy to weld

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:19.340 
the metal so that's really easy to weld
onto<00:07:14.040> even<00:07:14.460> if<00:07:14.730> you<00:07:14.850> cut<00:07:15.090> it<00:07:15.240> lower<00:07:17.630> but<00:07:18.630> as<00:07:18.990> far

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:19.350 
onto even if you cut it lower but as far

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.370 
onto even if you cut it lower but as far
as<00:07:19.380> like<00:07:19.680> if<00:07:19.890> you<00:07:19.980> did<00:07:20.160> like<00:07:20.310> a<00:07:20.340> 30<00:07:20.640> or<00:07:20.730> upgrade

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:21.380 
as like if you did like a 30 or upgrade

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.780 
as like if you did like a 30 or upgrade
you<00:07:22.380> could<00:07:22.530> probably<00:07:22.800> get<00:07:23.250> like<00:07:23.520> 800

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:23.790 
you could probably get like 800

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.610 
you could probably get like 800
horsepower<00:07:24.450> out<00:07:24.870> of<00:07:24.990> the<00:07:25.050> car

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:25.620 
horsepower out of the car

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.850 
horsepower out of the car
rather<00:07:26.520> than<00:07:26.820> like<00:07:27.260> you<00:07:28.260> can<00:07:28.380> probably<00:07:28.560> get

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:28.860 
rather than like you can probably get

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.020 
rather than like you can probably get
like<00:07:29.570> 400<00:07:30.570> out<00:07:30.720> of<00:07:30.840> this<00:07:31.050> maybe<00:07:31.950> 450<00:07:32.490> if<00:07:32.850> you're

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:33.030 
like 400 out of this maybe 450 if you're

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:38.330 
like 400 out of this maybe 450 if you're
lucky<00:07:33.890> but<00:07:35.330> that's<00:07:36.330> what<00:07:36.660> I<00:07:36.690> would<00:07:36.930> do<00:07:37.110> if<00:07:37.410> if<00:07:38.220> I

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:38.340 
lucky but that's what I would do if if I

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.700 
lucky but that's what I would do if if I
was<00:07:38.550> like<00:07:38.970> really<00:07:39.360> serious<00:07:39.840> about<00:07:40.080> making<00:07:40.260> a

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:40.710 
was like really serious about making a

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:41.610 
was like really serious about making a
lot<00:07:40.800> more<00:07:40.890> power

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:41.620 
lot more power

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.060 
lot more power
I<00:07:41.680> would<00:07:42.520> just<00:07:42.699> cut<00:07:42.970> this<00:07:43.150> thing<00:07:43.210> off<00:07:43.770> put<00:07:44.770> a<00:07:44.800> V

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:45.070 
I would just cut this thing off put a V

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.520 
I would just cut this thing off put a V
bandit<00:07:45.669> sauce<00:07:45.880> housing<00:07:46.479> on<00:07:46.630> there<00:07:46.870> and<00:07:47.139> then

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:47.530 
bandit sauce housing on there and then

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.490 
bandit sauce housing on there and then
make<00:07:48.160> a<00:07:48.190> 30<00:07:48.550> R<00:07:48.820> we<00:07:49.540> have<00:07:49.690> all<00:07:49.870> the<00:07:50.020> parts<00:07:50.320> to

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:50.500 
make a 30 R we have all the parts to

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.530 
make a 30 R we have all the parts to
make<00:07:50.550> ball-bearing<00:07:51.550> turbos<00:07:51.580> and<00:07:51.970> stuff<00:07:52.330> like

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:52.540 
make ball-bearing turbos and stuff like

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.320 
make ball-bearing turbos and stuff like
that<00:07:52.919> but<00:07:53.919> we've<00:07:54.220> never<00:07:54.400> actually<00:07:54.850> done<00:07:55.270> it

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:55.330 
that but we've never actually done it

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:56.070 
that but we've never actually done it
for<00:07:55.630> this

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080 
for this

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.750 
for this
however<00:07:56.590> hopefully<00:07:57.130> maybe<00:07:57.340> in<00:07:57.520> the<00:07:57.610> future

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:57.760 
however hopefully maybe in the future

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.080 
however hopefully maybe in the future
sometime<00:07:58.180> we'll<00:07:58.510> do<00:07:58.630> something<00:07:58.930> like<00:07:59.020> that
