00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:07.160
 Hi, I'm jared and today I'm going to 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.929
 show the best fighting game good to 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.919
 my personal taste of course so 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.919
 let's go with the video 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.570
 well let's start this 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:35.150
 the game is called faith bar which is this 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.190
 what we have here 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.830
 we will be able to play this game in 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.220
 story mode as well as in mode 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.800
 challenge 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.440
 the truth is that the controls are very 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.620
 simple and the purpose of this is 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.300
 supposes that the bad guys kidnapped a 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.550
 familiar to us and we have 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.200
 to go and rescue him in this area here 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.990
 we are going to be able to improve our 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.480
 character for example where the power 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:05.250
 of penta also here we have the area 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.250
 for example from salt lake uds 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.510
 and among many other things too 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.320
 we can vote it for some weapons to 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:17.400
 that fight the game weighs around 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.950
 222 megs already with data 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.110
 and they will be able to download it for free 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.110
 from play store 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.970
 we are going to be able to bend down 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.010
 deactivate the blows of opponents 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.720
 and by pressing the screen several times 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.720
 it's how we're going to hit 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.310
 we can also kick up 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.310
 or for the lake 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.840
 also in the top part we have 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.070
 time that is the time in which 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.070
 we have to kill the enemies 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.340
 if we do it at the right time 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.930
 we are also earning points and so we 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.350
 can give money to buy 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.350
 improvements 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.930
 avn there they already killed me we can give 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.349
 continue giving three gold ingots 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.720
 as I say this game has therefore if 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.030
 the controls pretty simple if not 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.190
 it's going to be difficult to play obviously 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.260
 they will go practicing and they will leave 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.260
 doing much better in this game 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.500
