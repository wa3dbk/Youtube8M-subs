send up a Geo so I'm gonna switch out to
come<00:02:06.600> ball<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:07.970> mean<00:02:08.970> cotton<00:02:09.270> ball<00:02:09.390> sole

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
come ball I mean cotton ball sole

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.920 
come ball I mean cotton ball sole
purpose<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.319> first<00:02:10.979> get<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.459> poison<00:02:11.640> on<00:02:12.000> it

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
purpose is to first get the poison on it

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.259 
purpose is to first get the poison on it
because<00:02:13.790> continuous<00:02:14.790> sandwich<00:02:15.060> would<00:02:15.239> be

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
because continuous sandwich would be

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.289 
because continuous sandwich would be
most<00:02:15.659> helpful<00:02:16.159> and<00:02:17.159> maybe<00:02:17.549> get<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.790> tail<00:02:18.000> up<00:02:18.150> in

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
most helpful and maybe get a tail up in

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.539 
most helpful and maybe get a tail up in
but<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.540> doesn't<00:02:19.439> happen<00:02:19.560> because<00:02:19.890> he<00:02:20.310> just

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
but that doesn't happen because he just

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.490 
but that doesn't happen because he just
gusts<00:02:21.269> it<00:02:22.099> so<00:02:23.099> I<00:02:23.459> switch<00:02:24.000> out<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.209> Steve<00:02:24.500> any

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
gusts it so I switch out to Steve any

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.720 
gusts it so I switch out to Steve any

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
much flow as a possible but it's not

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.119 
much flow as a possible but it's not
helping<00:02:41.939> mm-hmm<00:02:45.019> so<00:02:46.019> finally<00:02:46.200> hit<00:02:46.500> me<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.859> I

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
helping mm-hmm so finally hit me and I

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.740 
helping mm-hmm so finally hit me and I
go<00:02:47.280> rage<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.730> rage<00:02:47.760> is<00:02:48.090> building<00:02:48.419> so<00:02:48.540> it<00:02:48.629> does

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
go rage the rage is building so it does

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.710 
go rage the rage is building so it does
a<00:02:48.780> little<00:02:48.989> bit<00:02:49.169> more<00:02:49.790> any<00:02:50.790> roosts<00:02:51.269> I'm<00:02:51.540> just

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
a little bit more any roosts I'm just

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.280 
a little bit more any roosts I'm just
like<00:02:51.840> aah<00:02:53.419> but<00:02:54.419> rach<00:02:54.569> is<00:02:54.599> still<00:02:54.930> doing<00:02:55.169> I<00:02:55.230> think

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
like aah but rach is still doing I think

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.069 
like aah but rach is still doing I think
it's<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.799> think<00:02:55.859> it's<00:02:56.129> still<00:02:56.730> doubled<00:02:57.120> so<00:02:58.049> I

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
it's I think it's still doubled so I

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.020 
it's I think it's still doubled so I
hits<00:02:58.409> me<00:02:58.590> that<00:02:58.769> enrages<00:02:59.189> building<00:02:59.669> even<00:02:59.849> more

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
hits me that enrages building even more

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.909 
hits me that enrages building even more
so<00:03:00.209> now<00:03:00.239> it's<00:03:00.510> doing<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.840> little<00:03:01.109> bit<00:03:01.560> more<00:03:01.709> so

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
so now it's doing a little bit more so

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:03.170 
so now it's doing a little bit more so
it<00:03:02.010> keeps<00:03:02.159> doing<00:03:02.400> that<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:02.669> now<00:03:02.760> he's<00:03:02.909> at<00:03:03.030> half

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
it keeps doing that and now he's at half

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.080 
it keeps doing that and now he's at half
and<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.139> gusts<00:03:04.500> again<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:05.010> rage<00:03:05.579> is<00:03:05.609> really

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
and the gusts again and rage is really

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.270 
and the gusts again and rage is really
been<00:03:06.599> pretty<00:03:06.870> strong<00:03:07.169> but<00:03:07.439> I<00:03:07.620> get<00:03:07.799> some<00:03:08.069> min

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
been pretty strong but I get some min

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.119 
been pretty strong but I get some min
damage<00:03:08.669> right<00:03:08.819> there<00:03:08.849> and<00:03:09.650> I'm<00:03:10.650> thinking

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
damage right there and I'm thinking

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.740 
damage right there and I'm thinking
roost<00:03:11.489> but<00:03:11.760> just<00:03:11.969> to<00:03:12.060> be<00:03:12.150> safe<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.540> whinnies

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
roost but just to be safe and whinnies

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.110 
roost but just to be safe and whinnies
potion<00:03:13.260> actually<00:03:14.159> doesn't<00:03:14.519> go<00:03:14.609> roost<00:03:14.819> he<00:03:15.000> goes

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
potion actually doesn't go roost he goes

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.099 
potion actually doesn't go roost he goes
gust<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:17.269> yeah<00:03:18.269> I'm<00:03:18.449> thinking<00:03:18.840> he's<00:03:18.900> probably

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
gust and yeah I'm thinking he's probably

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.259 
gust and yeah I'm thinking he's probably
nervous<00:03:19.349> but<00:03:19.620> he<00:03:19.680> doesn't<00:03:20.040> so<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.430> just<00:03:20.819> go<00:03:21.030> rage

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
nervous but he doesn't so I just go rage

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.140 
nervous but he doesn't so I just go rage
and<00:03:21.709> I<00:03:22.709> beat<00:03:22.979> Faulkner<00:03:23.549> which<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:23.940> pretty

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
and I beat Faulkner which is pretty

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.649 
and I beat Faulkner which is pretty
sweet<00:03:24.799> and<00:03:26.870> Steve<00:03:27.870> wants<00:03:28.319> to<00:03:28.439> learn<00:03:28.590> bite<00:03:29.659> so

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
sweet and Steve wants to learn bite so

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.149 
sweet and Steve wants to learn bite so
I'd<00:03:30.810> get<00:03:31.109> rid<00:03:31.199> of<00:03:31.319> leader<00:03:31.650> because<00:03:31.979> that's

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
I'd get rid of leader because that's

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.530 
I'd get rid of leader because that's
pretty<00:03:32.340> pointless<00:03:32.669> and<00:03:32.879> I<00:03:32.970> almost<00:03:33.090> level<00:03:33.479> up

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
pretty pointless and I almost level up

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.110 
pretty pointless and I almost level up
again<00:03:33.689> myth<00:03:33.900> from<00:03:34.229> that<00:03:34.530> Peduto<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:35.849> now<00:03:35.970> he's
