 has not been applied before 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.620
 besides the device itself 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.540
 that is, the person buying the device is not 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.540
 will think that the system is recorded there 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.100
 intuitively 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.360
 what does this or that item mean 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.800
 and learn with ease 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.660
 to use 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.880
 interface started 3d let's say it is 03 min 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.150
 device design that is what allows 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.440
 communicate with the device 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.640
 but the external parameters of the device are also very 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.400
 important 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.480
 this is subtlety 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.310

 on the same 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.440
 convenient to use as a normal mobile 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.830
 phone 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.680
 it just has much more 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.880
 Sayanogorsk

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.010
 try that 90-2 megabytes 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.020
 RAM 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.300
 this is an answer for friday

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.910
 availability of gps module 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.170
 now meeting 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.970
 i.e. this device possesses 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.409
 all the technologies that exist on 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:43.520
 this moment 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.090
 the main question is how much are we 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.070
 asked arkady bakhina 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.770

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.510
 from which it is composed and will 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.410
 whether to change 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.510
 this device will appear 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.830

 I think sales will be 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.679

 device you have to be for this 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.069
 modern technology design 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.069
 in price change and the coming months 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.969

 all journalists 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.969
 what is this device 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:46.389
 in lineup 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:48.369
 That is, the tach is manifested by the brother 

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:49.829
 this device 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.239
 people need to understand pieces when leaving this 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:52.929

 cisco company 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:58.329
 this design 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:02:59.919
 this stuffing 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:03.139
 that is, a device from the family 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:04.929
 I will continue to appear 

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:07.269
 By the way, it will appear probably in the autumn 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:08.809
 we are now 

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:10.469
 are developing 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.689
 some subtleties that 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.689
 needed for the Russian market 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:18.669
