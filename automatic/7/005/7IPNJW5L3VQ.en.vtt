00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.160 
green I'm not going to add too much that
maybe<00:03:03.379> another<00:03:03.739> one<00:03:04.040> okay<00:03:06.370> then<00:03:07.989> we're<00:03:08.989> going

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
maybe another one okay then we're going

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.699 
maybe another one okay then we're going
to<00:03:09.290> add<00:03:09.379> some<00:03:10.569> walnuts<00:03:11.569> now<00:03:12.440> you'll<00:03:12.620> notice

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
to add some walnuts now you'll notice

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.780 
to add some walnuts now you'll notice
the<00:03:13.129> walnuts<00:03:13.670> look<00:03:14.030> like<00:03:14.239> little<00:03:14.659> brains<00:03:15.139> I

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
the walnuts look like little brains I

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.030 
the walnuts look like little brains I
would<00:03:16.790> assume<00:03:16.909> that<00:03:17.319> creation<00:03:18.319> made<00:03:18.680> them

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
would assume that creation made them

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.180 
would assume that creation made them
especially<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:20.000> look<00:03:20.209> like<00:03:20.480> brains<00:03:20.889> so<00:03:21.889> that

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
especially to look like brains so that

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.490 
especially to look like brains so that
they<00:03:22.400> kind<00:03:23.150> of<00:03:23.269> give<00:03:23.540> us<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.930> hint<00:03:24.260> that

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
they kind of give us the hint that

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.069 
they kind of give us the hint that
they're<00:03:24.709> good<00:03:24.980> for<00:03:25.220> our<00:03:25.430> brains<00:03:25.909> they<00:03:26.690> do<00:03:26.750> have

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
they're good for our brains they do have

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.690 
they're good for our brains they do have
omega-3<00:03:28.060> fatty<00:03:29.060> oils<00:03:29.450> in<00:03:29.930> there<00:03:30.139> so<00:03:30.470> that<00:03:30.700> it

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
omega-3 fatty oils in there so that it

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.399 
omega-3 fatty oils in there so that it
is<00:03:31.940> probably<00:03:32.569> good<00:03:32.840> for<00:03:32.870> your<00:03:33.260> body<00:03:33.409> and<00:03:35.409> now
