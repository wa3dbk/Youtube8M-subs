my<00:00:00.420> calculator<00:00:01.020> is<00:00:01.230> working<00:00:01.620> and<00:00:01.800> is<00:00:01.890> free

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
my calculator is working and is free

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.610 
my calculator is working and is free
from<00:00:02.280> our<00:00:02.460> arses<00:00:02.879> I'll<00:00:03.780> also<00:00:04.049> be<00:00:04.290> doing<00:00:04.319> a

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
from our arses I'll also be doing a

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.410 
from our arses I'll also be doing a
library<00:00:05.100> scan<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.549> prove<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:05.879> you<00:00:05.970> that<00:00:06.000> it<00:00:06.299> is

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
library scan to prove to you that it is

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.419 
library scan to prove to you that it is
real<00:00:06.600> but<00:00:07.290> before<00:00:07.649> we<00:00:07.770> get<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.130> it<00:00:08.250> though<00:00:08.400> I

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
real but before we get to it though I

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:09.770 
real but before we get to it though I
just<00:00:08.550> want<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.940> explain<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.450> you<00:00:09.480> how<00:00:09.750> a

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
just want to explain to you how a

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.440 
just want to explain to you how a
generator<00:00:10.380> works<00:00:10.670> since<00:00:11.670> we<00:00:11.820> are<00:00:11.940> trusted<00:00:12.330> in

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
generator works since we are trusted in

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.209 
generator works since we are trusted in
secure<00:00:12.780> website<00:00:13.170> if<00:00:13.290> we<00:00:13.440> have<00:00:13.590> sponsors<00:00:14.070> who

we<00:00:16.650> then<00:00:16.890> are<00:00:17.130> these<00:00:17.340> accounts<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.210> our

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
we then are these accounts to our

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.910 
we then are these accounts to our
generator<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:18.960> which<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.289> can<00:00:19.439> receive<00:00:19.590> them

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
generator in which you can receive them

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.010 
generator in which you can receive them
each<00:00:20.640> generator<00:00:21.029> produces<00:00:21.270> one<00:00:21.750> unique

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
each generator produces one unique

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.200 
each generator produces one unique
account<00:00:22.439> once<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.310> account<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.730> generated

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
account once this account is generated

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.750 
account once this account is generated
it<00:00:24.359> cannot<00:00:24.570> be<00:00:24.750> used<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.170> by<00:00:25.410> anyone<00:00:25.800> else<00:00:25.980> in

it cannot be used it by anyone else in
another<00:00:26.880> car<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.449> must<00:00:27.689> download<00:00:27.840> the

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
another car you must download the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.929 
another car you must download the
generator<00:00:28.470> again<00:00:28.650> now<00:00:29.519> we're<00:00:29.670> not<00:00:29.760> talking

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
generator again now we're not talking

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.609 
generator again now we're not talking
let's<00:00:30.449> get<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.869> actual<00:00:31.140> proof<00:00:31.410> and

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
let's get to the actual proof and

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.680 
let's get to the actual proof and
demonstration<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:32.219> our<00:00:32.340> generator<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:33.059> have

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
demonstration of our generator I have

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.270 
demonstration of our generator I have
downloaded<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.200> generator<00:00:34.590> from<00:00:34.800> mediafire

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
downloaded the generator from mediafire

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.690 
downloaded the generator from mediafire
I<00:00:35.579> will<00:00:36.510> download<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.050> once<00:00:37.320> again<00:00:37.640> show<00:00:38.640> to

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
I will download it once again show to

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.580 
I will download it once again show to
you<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.270> generates<00:00:39.660> random<00:00:39.809> accounts<00:00:40.379> I

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
you that it generates random accounts I

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.770 
you that it generates random accounts I
will<00:00:41.250> not<00:00:41.399> down<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.760> again<00:00:42.030> after<00:00:42.270> because<00:00:42.719> I

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
will not down it again after because I

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.770 
will not down it again after because I
want<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:42.960> leave<00:00:43.170> some<00:00:43.440> accounts<00:00:44.129> for<00:00:44.309> friends

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
want to leave some accounts for friends

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.029 
want to leave some accounts for friends
so<00:00:45.780> now<00:00:45.930> let<00:00:46.140> me<00:00:46.170> scan<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.590> generator<00:00:46.920> for

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
so now let me scan the generator for

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:55.230 
so now let me scan the generator for
iris<00:00:47.280> scans<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:48.059> my<00:00:48.239> scanner<00:00:48.600> Tito

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.240 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:07.350 

all<00:00:55.810> right<00:00:56.020> I've<00:00:56.200> added<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:56.590> file

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.300 

all<00:01:07.900> right<00:01:08.080> now<00:01:08.230> let<00:01:08.410> us<00:01:08.440> wait<00:01:08.740> for<00:01:08.770> it<00:01:09.100> to<00:01:09.190> get

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
all right now let us wait for it to get

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.010 
all right now let us wait for it to get
scanned

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.859 

I<00:01:12.140> previously<00:01:12.859> scan<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:13.729> generator<00:01:14.390> so<00:01:14.719> now

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
I previously scan the generator so now

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.080 
I previously scan the generator so now
as<00:01:15.320> you<00:01:15.500> can<00:01:15.649> see

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
as you can see

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.390 
as you can see
they<00:01:17.479> found<00:01:17.780> that<00:01:17.960> thing

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
they found that thing

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.390 
they found that thing
it<00:01:19.880> is<00:01:20.030> clean<00:01:20.270> from<00:01:20.450> irises<00:01:20.920> it<00:01:21.920> doesn't<00:01:22.250> pose

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
it is clean from irises it doesn't pose

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.600 
it is clean from irises it doesn't pose
a<00:01:22.430> threat<00:01:22.610> to<00:01:23.150> your<00:01:23.270> computer

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
a threat to your computer

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.090 
a threat to your computer
I<00:01:25.640> will<00:01:26.450> try<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.690> account<00:01:27.050> I<00:01:27.320> would<00:01:27.830> try<00:01:28.040> the

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
I will try the account I would try the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.070 
I will try the account I would try the
generator<00:01:28.550> and<00:01:28.790> see<00:01:29.000> if<00:01:29.150> it<00:01:29.360> I<00:01:29.810> feel

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
generator and see if it I feel

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.660 
generator and see if it I feel
concentrated<00:01:30.950> works

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.610 

this<00:01:35.150> is<00:01:35.330> the<00:01:35.450> generator<00:01:35.780> you<00:01:36.200> could<00:01:36.350> find

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.050 

and<00:01:39.620> now<00:01:39.740> well<00:01:39.950> they<00:01:40.100> generate<00:01:40.490> account<00:01:40.820> and

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
and now well they generate account and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.010 
and now well they generate account and
see<00:01:41.330> which<00:01:41.540> I<00:01:41.630> come<00:01:41.780> again<00:01:42.610> as<00:01:43.750> you<00:01:44.750> can<00:01:44.900> see

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
see which I come again as you can see

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
again but it's not generate another

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.590 
again but it's not generate another
account<00:01:48.950> this<00:01:49.220> is<00:01:49.369> to<00:01:49.460> prevent<00:01:49.790> users<00:01:50.450> from
