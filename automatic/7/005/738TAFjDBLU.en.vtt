00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.010
 hi to all in this video you go 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:21.970
 discover how to learn recoil and 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:23.949
 and theirs comes to your horse let's start 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.900
 to exert pressure on the chest 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.599
 to explain what is expected of 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.820
 pressure is released at each step 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:36.300
 back at the beginning this progressive rent 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.300
 asked one step then two and then three 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.120
 then remove the physical pressure and 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.430
 talking about your body and your 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.880
 determination by giving him an order 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.290
 vocalcom recoil if it resists exercising 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.660
 again a pressure on the trail wood 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.160
 in order to trigger the movement you 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.230
 can also associate an order 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.390
 visual clear using your stick 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:00.460
 your finger or whatever as you can 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:04.380
 see him here to roll them back to 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.380
 distance use the same codes 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.110
 always very gradually at the beginning 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.290
 acted with your loin to do it 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.290
 retreat 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.680
 start by waving the loin 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.689
 with your finger and then if they do not respond 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.490
 not increase the ripple with your 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.409
 hand and if there is still no 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.740
 recoil motion and waved the 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.200
 tether 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.710
 with a gesture of all your arm and done 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.710
 the big voice 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.110
 freedom then comes naturally 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.180
 when the exercise will be perfectly 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.360
 acquired remember do not forget the 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.360
 congratulate 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.600
 for their return the horse must 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.859
 respond to the pressures of the halter one of 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.469
 my videos explain you besides 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.929
 that we process to bring back 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.030
 our horse lower you can three 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.569
 imposing and exerting pressure with 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.670
 the loin 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:12.900
 as soon as the forward movement is engaged 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:15.299
 cc the action could compensate if the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.650
 horse stops again but if 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:21.080
 still advance towards you with your 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.080
 invitation congratulated the warmly 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.000
 lange pressure should be more 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.769
 in lighter until reaching 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.730
 more use it 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.440
 little by little you will be able to 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.060
 straighten until you only need 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.480
 to tilt the shoulders to invite 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.830
 your horse coming to join you 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.810
 once with you he must be in the 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.459
 calm and find a lot of comfort and 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.890
 reg 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.989
 especially do not ask him anything you can 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.150
 even the allowed through pressure to 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:53.090
 graze and found great pleasure in 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:55.010
 have come to the end to ask for a 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.870
 back to trot it's the same thing with 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.060
 the same codes exert pressure 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.459
 discontinuous and released there as soon as the 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.900
 pass speeds up to start over and 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.900
 get to get one too 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.860
 for freedom act as if you 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.320
 had still the long exercise was 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.480
 acquired the horse will answer it otherwise you 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.100
 went too fast 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.840
 it is important to know that the horse 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.480
 do not ever have to push yourself 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.220
 we come back too close to you it's you 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.530
 who came to him in a last gesture 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.980
 to come and caress him and bring him 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.980
 comfort 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.230
 this exercise we find it is who 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.150
 file here you can see a contract at 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.070
 20 points where the horse must step back on 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.070
 7 meters crossing a ground bar 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.720
 finally you can ask for stillness 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.610
 of your horse add difficulty 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.930
 by placing obstacles across 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.270
 his way as a ground bar 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.280
 a tarpaulin or an obstacle for the jump 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.760
 an explanatory video will be realized 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.070
 shortly 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.070
 thank you for your viewing and see you soon 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.210
