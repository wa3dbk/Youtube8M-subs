00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
actually our new ITV testbed I have

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.310 
actually our new ITV testbed I have
brought<00:00:59.790> it<00:00:59.880> home<00:00:59.970> for<00:01:00.150> the<00:01:00.239> weekend<00:01:00.540> to<00:01:00.750> catch

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
brought it home for the weekend to catch

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.020 
brought it home for the weekend to catch
up<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.620> little<00:01:01.800> bit<00:01:01.950> of<00:01:02.010> benchmarking<00:01:02.550> because

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
up a little bit of benchmarking because

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.180 
up a little bit of benchmarking because
well<00:01:03.750> there's<00:01:04.140> lots<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.440> benchmarks<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.040> run

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
well there's lots of benchmarks to run

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.430 
well there's lots of benchmarks to run
through<00:01:05.550> also<00:01:06.390> when<00:01:06.690> we<00:01:06.810> benchmark<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.410> the

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
through also when we benchmark in the

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.350 
through also when we benchmark in the
video<00:01:07.710> room<00:01:07.890> there<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.250> gets<00:01:08.430> really<00:01:08.790> really

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
video room there it gets really really

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.270 
video room there it gets really really
warm<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:09.840> I'm<00:01:09.960> kind<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.229> removing<00:01:10.979> some<00:01:11.190> of

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
warm so I'm kind of removing some of

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.490 
warm so I'm kind of removing some of
that<00:01:11.370> heat<00:01:11.640> transferring<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.750> home<00:01:12.930> but<00:01:13.320> while

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
that heat transferring it home but while

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.140 
that heat transferring it home but while
I<00:01:13.530> have<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.770> here<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.009> figured<00:01:14.340> well<00:01:14.490> why<00:01:14.520> not<00:01:14.850> do

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
I have it here I figured well why not do

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.760 
I have it here I figured well why not do
something<00:01:15.420> from<00:01:15.750> my<00:01:15.869> channel<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.320> mean<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.590> got

what kind of performance what kind of

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.639 
what kind of performance what kind of
scaling<00:02:02.520> we<00:02:02.759> get<00:02:02.970> what<00:02:03.539> current<00:02:04.080> benchmarks

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
scaling we get what current benchmarks

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.529 
scaling we get what current benchmarks
and<00:02:04.800> programs<00:02:05.190> are<00:02:05.399> actually<00:02:05.670> able<00:02:05.970> to<00:02:06.209> even

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
and programs are actually able to even

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.350 
and programs are actually able to even
take<00:02:06.660> advantage<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.350> extra<00:02:07.679> video<00:02:07.890> cards

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
take advantage of the extra video cards

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.530 
take advantage of the extra video cards
but<00:02:09.360> what<00:02:10.430> besides<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.700> might<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:11.970> do<00:02:12.120> for<00:02:12.420> my

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
but what besides that might I do for my

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.600 
but what besides that might I do for my
own<00:02:12.660> channel<00:02:12.990> because<00:02:13.440> all<00:02:13.740> those<00:02:14.010> benchmarks

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
own channel because all those benchmarks

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.740 
own channel because all those benchmarks
are<00:02:14.700> gonna<00:02:14.790> be<00:02:14.910> able<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.120> find<00:02:15.300> over<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.630> new

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750
