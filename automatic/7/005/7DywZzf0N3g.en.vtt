00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
build in the enraged koala whatever

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.870 
build in the enraged koala whatever
there<00:01:57.380> were<00:01:57.439> just<00:01:57.590> another<00:01:57.890> just<00:01:58.579> a<00:01:58.640> slightly

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
there were just another just a slightly

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.599 
there were just another just a slightly
different<00:01:58.999> form<00:01:59.479> of<00:01:59.859> planet<00:02:00.859> to<00:02:00.950> beam<00:02:01.100> down<00:02:01.310> so

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:01.609 
different form of planet to beam down so

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:03.940 
different form of planet to beam down so
but<00:02:02.320> not<00:02:03.320> anymore

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
but not anymore

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.120 
but not anymore

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
now they're boring and weird but a good

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.370 
now they're boring and weird but a good
way<00:02:07.340> because<00:02:08.090> there's<00:02:08.360> no<00:02:08.450> actual<00:02:08.840> enemies

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
way because there's no actual enemies

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.170 
way because there's no actual enemies
don't<00:02:09.860> things<00:02:10.069> any<00:02:10.220> chests<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:10.849> things<00:02:11.060> I

don't things any chests and things I
haven't<00:02:11.330> come<00:02:11.480> across<00:02:11.510> any<00:02:11.930> but<00:02:12.680> what<00:02:12.800> it<00:02:12.920> does

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
haven't come across any but what it does

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.790 
haven't come across any but what it does
have<00:02:13.129> is<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.459> fuel<00:02:13.909> and<00:02:14.239> you'll<00:02:14.659> need<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:15.019> go

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
have is the fuel and you'll need to go

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.920 
have is the fuel and you'll need to go
quite<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:15.920> bit<00:02:16.070> further<00:02:16.220> down<00:02:16.400> you<00:02:17.240> will<00:02:17.450> make

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
quite a bit further down you will make

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.900 
quite a bit further down you will make
sure<00:02:18.110> that<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:18.290> tried<00:02:18.470> upgrade<00:02:18.830> your<00:02:19.100> what

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
sure that you tried upgrade your what

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.070 
sure that you tried upgrade your what
you<00:02:20.000> would<00:02:20.120> call<00:02:20.240> it<00:02:20.420> your<00:02:20.540> your<00:02:20.870> funny<00:02:21.020> little

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
you would call it your your funny little

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.290 
you would call it your your funny little
tall<00:02:21.500> thing<00:02:21.770> yeah<00:02:22.220> matter<00:02:22.760> manipulator

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
tall thing yeah matter manipulator

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.920 
tall thing yeah matter manipulator
because<00:02:23.600> that<00:02:23.840> makes<00:02:24.020> mining<00:02:24.560> a<00:02:24.680> breeze

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
because that makes mining a breeze

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.010 
because that makes mining a breeze
already<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:27.110> can<00:02:27.260> see<00:02:27.290> absolutely<00:02:27.860> loads<00:02:29.020> like

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
already I can see absolutely loads like

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.170 
already I can see absolutely loads like
lots<00:02:30.800> of<00:02:30.920> loads<00:02:31.160> of<00:02:31.490> them<00:02:31.640> caves<00:02:31.880> and<00:02:32.120> things

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
lots of loads of them caves and things

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.790 
lots of loads of them caves and things
there's<00:02:32.480> plenty<00:02:32.750> of<00:02:32.780> caves<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:33.380> we<00:02:33.650> can

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
there's plenty of caves and we can

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.020 
there's plenty of caves and we can
really<00:02:33.950> just<00:02:34.010> get<00:02:34.250> away<00:02:34.340> with<00:02:34.520> just<00:02:34.670> mining

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
really just get away with just mining

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.820 
really just get away with just mining
down<00:02:35.210> until<00:02:35.480> you<00:02:35.570> find<00:02:35.780> some<00:02:36.020> oh<00:02:36.200> god<00:02:36.620> here<00:02:36.800> we

okay so back to the ship go over to our
little<00:03:09.850> FTL<00:03:10.850> drive<00:03:11.410> I've<00:03:12.410> already<00:03:12.680> filled<00:03:13.070> it

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
little FTL drive I've already filled it

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.800 
little FTL drive I've already filled it
with<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.370> thousand<00:03:13.970> fuel<00:03:14.240> already<00:03:14.630> because

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
with a thousand fuel already because

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.630 
with a thousand fuel already because
I've<00:03:14.900> been<00:03:14.990> mining<00:03:15.380> before<00:03:15.680> but<00:03:16.250> look<00:03:16.400> I've

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
I've been mining before but look I've

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.740 
I've been mining before but look I've
already<00:03:16.760> got<00:03:16.880> two<00:03:17.180> hundred<00:03:17.360> that<00:03:17.660> will

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
already got two hundred that will

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.800 
already got two hundred that will
convert<00:03:18.280> fuel<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.400> filter<00:03:19.730> another<00:03:20.090> 200<00:03:20.570> fuel

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
convert fuel to filter another 200 fuel

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.110 
convert fuel to filter another 200 fuel
and<00:03:21.050> with<00:03:21.560> two<00:03:21.770> hundred<00:03:22.070> fuel<00:03:22.370> you<00:03:22.760> can<00:03:22.910> get<00:03:23.090> a

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
and with two hundred fuel you can get a

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.199 
and with two hundred fuel you can get a
long<00:03:23.480> distance<00:03:24.790> fairly<00:03:25.790> long<00:03:25.910> distance

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
long distance fairly long distance

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.150 
long distance fairly long distance
that's<00:03:26.450> my<00:03:26.660> current<00:03:26.959> system<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:27.500> this<00:03:27.860> is<00:03:28.040> the

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
that's my current system and this is the

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.410 
that's my current system and this is the
immediate<00:03:28.489> area<00:03:28.820> I<00:03:28.880> mean<00:03:29.060> around<00:03:29.239> an

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
immediate area I mean around an

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.060 
immediate area I mean around an
eccentric<00:03:29.780> stow<00:03:30.020> in<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.200> moment<00:03:30.560> and<00:03:30.950> if<00:03:31.040> I

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
eccentric stow in the moment and if I

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.010 
eccentric stow in the moment and if I
was<00:03:31.160> going<00:03:31.310> to<00:03:31.430> say<00:03:31.580> like<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.060> I'm<00:03:32.720> sure<00:03:32.900> not

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
was going to say like and I'm sure not

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.340 
was going to say like and I'm sure not
gonna<00:03:33.110> go<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.350> that<00:03:33.560> but<00:03:33.890> kick<00:03:34.220> on<00:03:34.340> that<00:03:35.350> even

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
gonna go to that but kick on that even

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.370 
gonna go to that but kick on that even
that<00:03:36.910> that's<00:03:37.910> going<00:03:38.390> to<00:03:38.540> cost<00:03:38.720> just<00:03:39.050> slightly

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
that that's going to cost just slightly

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.440 
that that's going to cost just slightly
over<00:03:39.860> 200<00:03:40.400> so<00:03:40.670> an<00:03:40.790> actual<00:03:40.910> fight<00:03:41.180> you<00:03:41.270> can't

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
over 200 so an actual fight you can't

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.449 
over 200 so an actual fight you can't
get<00:03:41.600> very<00:03:41.690> far<00:03:41.780> at<00:03:42.020> all<00:03:42.140> actually<00:03:43.040> this<00:03:43.280> field

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
get very far at all actually this field

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.870 
get very far at all actually this field
is<00:03:43.550> bollocks<00:03:43.820> though<00:03:45.489> anyway<00:03:46.489> that's<00:03:46.700> how<00:03:46.760> we

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
is bollocks though anyway that's how we

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.160 
is bollocks though anyway that's how we
