00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.920
 [Music] 

00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:09.000
 so my kids started walking 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.219
 the games were much more active and 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 I spent a lot of time chasing after 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.179
 their 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.750
 sometimes it seemed that we played 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.570
 same thing all the time but it does not have 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.880
 problem because children like and 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.670
 need the repetition to develop 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.099
 your physical and mental abilities 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.420
 so they start to walk and run 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.980
 everything changes its ability to 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.770
 interact with people 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.530
 invent things makes the jokes 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.969
 more fun for everyone 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.579
 these are some of my 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.770
 favorite games to keep the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.770
 children who are active on a daily basis 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.629
 as children develop 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.300
 Your Mental Puzzle Puzzles 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.340
 excellent toy was one of the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.170
 favorite toys at home and are a 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.180
 excellent way to help in the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.400
 brain development 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.400
 they teach shapes and colors are 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.250
 fun and helps in motor coordination 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.080
 in the beginning we used simple jigsaw 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.500
 with large parts that could not 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.869
 Swallowing did not want this to happen. 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.530
 four-piece puzzle is good for 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.330
 begin 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.630
 then you can bring one of the most 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.630
 complicated 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.509
 [Applause] 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.729
 at this age 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.649
 My kids loved running from me and 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.229
 They wanted me to run after him. 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.240
 They loved the movement. That's good. 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.210
 for them to use various skills that 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.399
 They learned to play with you. I 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.439
 I would party when I could get the 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.049
 let them run after me 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.630
 the handle is an excellent joke 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:53.070
 to spend energy mainly for 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.070
 more electric kids 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.340
 in this period the motor skills 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.920
 begin to improve 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.700
 paint and draw with your fingers help 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.920
 very 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.440
 they love the feel of the 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.450
 fingers and make marks on paper 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.790
 believe it or not but a painting 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.069
 messy stimulates the senses and allows 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.860
 that they five various textures 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.500
 I know it sounds like a mess but it's a 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.780
 learning for him we spread 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.660
 brown paper on the floor and we created one 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:33.920
 baby's art studio but do it at 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:36.050
 floor you can clean up after the 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.850
 important landmark in the city ​​is the 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.400
 ability to invent 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.230
 we see him talking to our children 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.630
 with toys in the room or 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.850
 imagining adventures in the room 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.820
 the sofa cushions turned a cave 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.790
 a strong one dared to make sheets 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.860
 a cabin there are cabins to arm in the 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.980
 shops but I always found the ones made 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.870
 at home stimulated more imagination and 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.870
 they can build the ones we already have 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.380
 [Applause] 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.930
 playing ball seems easy but there is 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.150
 several important skills 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.250
 involved in this play the child 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.100
 is learning to coordinate several 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.580
 different movements and it's amazing if 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.550
 You stop to think about playing 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.190
 Ball was an endless fun 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.830
 besides having the little face of them trying 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.490
 kicking a ball around the room was very 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.490
 funny 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.750
 when my children became more active 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.540
 I searched for a lack capable of keeping the 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.100
 without disturbing his movements and I 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.650
 I found a soft and comfortable diaper 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.340
 that Sergio was well on his legs and 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.190
 belly 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.750
 had elastic sides and was 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.730
 superabsorbent so the baby had 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.440
 total freedom 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.210
 the games during this phase are 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.550
 My favorite memories of mine 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.950
 children no matter what games they play 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.290
 What are you doing? I'm sure you 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.360
 they took a lot of time together 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.740
