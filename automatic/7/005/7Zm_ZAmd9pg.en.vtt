00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.170
 and then channel people do it yourself 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.560
 here is a car speaker 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.720
 [Music] 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.220
 facebook also calling it here is 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.460
 a car speaker 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.739
 if sometimes you have a problem with this 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.000
 You do not have to buy a speaker. 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:34.890
 new were to make a maintenance in the car 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.300
 and broke the wire connector here 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.800
 what is here 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.070
 this wire here it is connected in that 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.190
 twitter 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.879
 and in this medium that has up here you 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.949
 call the car here he even comes out here 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.320
 but the big speaker does not work 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.970
 because it broke 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.510
 So what are we going to do to each other? 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:01.260
 will simply fit this piece here 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:07.220
 What does it have a groove people are going 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.220
 stay there yes 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:20.100
 You see here the piece is docked here. 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.100
 She does not have the 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.540
 and now we'll get the iron 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:32.670
 welding will lean 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:36.570
 this thread here will give a drop of 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.110
 sol from here a drop of solder in this movie 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.900
 on here 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.080
 on the other side here and I heard 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.860
 back working 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.210
 Let's loose here today is the iron 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.980
 soldering welding 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:59.190
 we already lean here all together 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:01.970
 tightening the wire and placing the solder in 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.970
 top of the 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:10.259
 the wire has solder in the terminal 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.120
 we will melt everything together and go 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.120
 fasten the wire 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.860
 [Music] 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.220
 you put the soldering iron on top 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.220
 his 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:36.480
 I will do the other side now been 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:39.050
 ill wires in a position and I will do sun 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.050
 from here too 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:59.180
 So, folks, you see a video crash. 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.030
 that's because the camera battery ran out 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.380
 just when I was going to finish here 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.280
 explanation 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.920
 then O's here to do is stuck here 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.670
 There's a drop of solder here so well. 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.090
 on here 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.370
 the other welding time right here you 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.900

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.880
 stuck on both sides 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.730
 Now we're going to put the speaker on. 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.640
 in the car again place the connector 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.920
 it is that it will work and you will not 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.040
 will need to buy another because the 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.020
 speaker is practically new 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.510
