 hello friends today I will introduce you as 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.730
 it sounds a kot rs7 r especially 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.320
 designed for the honda 250 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.230
 remember that the sound is taken with 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.860
 this digital camera that is from a cell phone 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.150
 but the sound is much better 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.570
 personally that I have taken with the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.570
 camera 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:33.120
 this one exhaust totally 14 the size 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.840
 and not heat which by any 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.600
 utilization 1 the power of the hand just 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.290
 used and does not burn unlike 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.290
 original 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.699
 let's turn on the motorcycle 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.090

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.590

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.860
 how we are generating is totally 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.100

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.360
 It has a fit like the original so 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.690
 that he will not have problems in his 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.000
 placement this is well carbureted 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.280
 way that greatly enhances the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.450
 ride the motorbike 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.310

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.440
 escape for this motorcycle be in doubt no 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.290
 you know what they placed a listened to a what 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.310

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.750
