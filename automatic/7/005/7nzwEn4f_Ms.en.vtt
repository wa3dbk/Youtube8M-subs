00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
you can see I keep it constant with the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.010 
you can see I keep it constant with the
USP<00:01:25.890> 45<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.790> do<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.180> until<00:01:27.570> i<00:01:27.630> unlock<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
USP 45 and I do that until i unlock the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.950 
USP 45 and I do that until i unlock the
mp9<00:01:28.700> because<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:30.060> really<00:01:30.540> don't<00:01:30.689> think<00:01:30.750> that

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
mp9 because I really don't think that

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.260 
mp9 because I really don't think that
the<00:01:31.020> fmg<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.799> really<00:01:32.159> good<00:01:32.310> secondary

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
the fmg is a really good secondary

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.789 
the fmg is a really good secondary
weapon<00:01:33.900> when<00:01:34.049> there's<00:01:34.200> only<00:01:34.350> one<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.680> them

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
weapon when there's only one of them

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.590 
weapon when there's only one of them
when<00:01:35.310> there's<00:01:35.490> two<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.640> them<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.939> overpowered

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.819 
when there's two of them is overpowered
and<00:01:36.689> I'd<00:01:36.780> never<00:01:37.110> use<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.350> either<00:01:37.710> just

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
and I'd never use that either just

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.380 
and I'd never use that either just
because<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.250> don't<00:01:38.640> think<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:38.970> fair<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.360> I

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
one I already unlock the mp7 a mp5 would

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.090 
one I already unlock the mp7 a mp5 would
do<00:01:59.490> fine<00:01:59.790> as<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.689> replacement<00:02:01.049> for<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.469> mp7<00:02:01.770> if

personally think this is the best
assault<00:03:46.280> rifle<00:03:46.639> just<00:03:46.819> because<00:03:47.030> it<00:03:47.150> doesn't

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
assault rifle just because it doesn't

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.240 
assault rifle just because it doesn't
really<00:03:47.449> have<00:03:47.629> the<00:03:47.659> fastest<00:03:48.079> rate<00:03:48.260> of<00:03:48.349> fire<00:03:48.530> but

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
really have the fastest rate of fire but

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.219 
really have the fastest rate of fire but
it<00:03:49.370> has<00:03:49.519> the<00:03:49.729> best<00:03:49.940> accuracy<00:03:50.540> I'd<00:03:50.810> have<00:03:50.959> to<00:03:51.079> say

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:51.229 
it has the best accuracy I'd have to say

range and if you have a fast trigger
finger<00:04:17.000> it<00:04:17.180> is<00:04:17.229> highly<00:04:18.229> worth<00:04:18.380> using<00:04:18.709> and<00:04:19.130> you

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
finger it is highly worth using and you

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.039 
finger it is highly worth using and you
could<00:04:20.209> usually<00:04:20.359> kill<00:04:20.719> them<00:04:20.810> before<00:04:20.870> they

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
could usually kill them before they

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.570 
could usually kill them before they
could<00:04:21.169> even<00:04:21.260> get<00:04:21.500> a<00:04:21.560> shot<00:04:21.769> on<00:04:21.829> you<00:04:22.099> which<00:04:22.219> is<00:04:22.250> a

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
could even get a shot on you which is a

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.170 
could even get a shot on you which is a
pretty<00:04:23.300> good<00:04:23.599> it's<00:04:23.810> a

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
pretty good it's a

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.810 
pretty good it's a
good<00:04:24.360> benefit<00:04:24.690> so<00:04:25.289> after<00:04:26.070> that<00:04:26.190> I<00:04:26.250> like<00:04:26.610> to<00:04:26.729> use

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
good benefit so after that I like to use

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.760 
good benefit so after that I like to use
the<00:04:26.940> Barrett<00:04:27.270> 50<00:04:27.389> Cal<00:04:27.750> and<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.080> MSR<00:04:28.560> my

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
Barrett 50 Cal is kind of more of like a

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.290 
Barrett 50 Cal is kind of more of like a
hardscoping<00:04:31.620> /<00:04:32.009> like<00:04:32.310> holding<00:04:33.120> down<00:04:33.240> a

really run around with it and I like it

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.650 
really run around with it and I like it
a<00:04:38.520> lot<00:04:38.550> because<00:04:38.789> it<00:04:39.000> doesn't<00:04:39.240> seem<00:04:39.360> to<00:04:39.479> miss<00:04:39.630> a

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
a lot because it doesn't seem to miss a

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.550 
a lot because it doesn't seem to miss a
lot<00:04:39.780> of<00:04:39.930> shots<00:04:40.110> when<00:04:40.320> you<00:04:40.410> put<00:04:40.530> your
