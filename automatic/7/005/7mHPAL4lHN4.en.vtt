grams why a cultural bias see because

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.140 
grams why a cultural bias see because
protein<00:01:21.440> was<00:01:21.620> believed<00:01:22.070> at<00:01:22.370> the<00:01:22.430> time<00:01:22.550> to<00:01:23.000> only

protein was believed at the time to only

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.600 
protein was believed at the time to only
come<00:01:23.570> from<00:01:23.840> meet<00:01:24.200> this<00:01:24.710> cultural<00:01:25.280> bias

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
come from meet this cultural bias

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.210 
come from meet this cultural bias
developed<00:01:26.420> that<00:01:26.780> is<00:01:26.990> if<00:01:27.200> you<00:01:27.470> are<00:01:27.500> civilized

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
developed that is if you are civilized

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.850 
developed that is if you are civilized
in<00:01:28.490> higher<00:01:28.790> class<00:01:29.240> than<00:01:29.659> you<00:01:29.840> eat<00:01:30.260> meat<00:01:30.620> and

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
in higher class than you eat meat and

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.670 
in higher class than you eat meat and
lots<00:01:31.370> of<00:01:31.580> it<00:01:31.700> at<00:01:31.820> that<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:32.330> so<00:01:32.900> this<00:01:33.080> cultural

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
lots of it at that and so this cultural

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.430 
lots of it at that and so this cultural
bias<00:01:33.980> has<00:01:34.520> put<00:01:34.820> us<00:01:34.940> on<00:01:35.120> a<00:01:35.150> very<00:01:35.480> misleading<00:01:35.870> and

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
bias has put us on a very misleading and

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.640 
bias has put us on a very misleading and
unhealthy<00:01:37.340> path<00:01:37.850> that<00:01:38.450> meat<00:01:38.810> is<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.290> only<00:01:39.409> way

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
unhealthy path that meat is the only way

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.070 
unhealthy path that meat is the only way
to<00:01:39.710> get<00:01:40.010> protein<00:01:40.490> that<00:01:41.060> meat<00:01:41.360> is<00:01:41.390> good<00:01:41.720> for<00:01:42.050> us

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
to get protein that meat is good for us

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.680 
to get protein that meat is good for us
and<00:01:42.470> therefore<00:01:43.159> more<00:01:43.820> of<00:01:43.940> it<00:01:44.090> must<00:01:44.360> be<00:01:44.510> even

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
and therefore more of it must be even

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.899 
and therefore more of it must be even
better<00:01:45.020> not<00:01:45.710> only<00:01:45.920> that<00:01:46.040> but<00:01:46.280> we<00:01:46.670> have<00:01:46.790> been

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
better not only that but we have been

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.880 
better not only that but we have been
led<00:01:47.210> to<00:01:47.240> believe<00:01:47.450> that<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.260> best<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:48.770> only

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
led to believe that the best and only

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.640 
led to believe that the best and only
way<00:01:49.280> to<00:01:49.340> get<00:01:49.700> protein<00:01:50.150> is<00:01:50.390> from<00:01:50.990> animal<00:01:51.380> foods

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
way to get protein is from animal foods

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.770 
way to get protein is from animal foods
truly<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.580> most<00:01:52.700> common<00:01:53.150> reason<00:01:53.510> that<00:01:53.659> most

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
truly the most common reason that most

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.719 
truly the most common reason that most
people<00:01:54.170> don't<00:01:54.200> even<00:01:54.590> consider<00:01:54.890> being<00:01:55.190> a

people don't even consider being a
vegetarian<00:01:55.909> but<00:01:56.690> this<00:01:57.380> is<00:01:57.590> where<00:01:57.830> you<00:01:58.190> will<00:01:58.310> be
