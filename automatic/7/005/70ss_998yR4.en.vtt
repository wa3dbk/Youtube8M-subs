cook time if the item that you're
cooking<00:00:50.280> has<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> very<00:00:50.850> short<00:00:51.120> cook<00:00:51.329> time<00:00:51.539> you

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
cooking has a very short cook time you

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.439 
cooking has a very short cook time you
should<00:00:52.199> toast<00:00:52.440> them<00:00:52.620> first<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.670> here<00:00:54.180> we<00:00:54.300> have

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
should toast them first so here we have

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.630 
should toast them first so here we have
toasted<00:00:54.899> breadcrumbs<00:00:55.260> raw<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.250> then<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.489> also

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
toasted breadcrumbs raw and then we also

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.910 
toasted breadcrumbs raw and then we also
have<00:00:56.969> some<00:00:57.510> panko<00:00:57.750> breadcrumbs<00:00:58.379> these<00:00:58.739> are

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
have some panko breadcrumbs these are

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.830 
have some panko breadcrumbs these are
Japanese<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.730> they're<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> little<00:01:00.239> bit<00:01:00.449> larger

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
Japanese and they're a little bit larger

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.479 
Japanese and they're a little bit larger
and<00:01:00.870> offer<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.350> slightly<00:01:01.680> different<00:01:01.949> texture

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
and offer a slightly different texture

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.420 
and offer a slightly different texture
as<00:01:03.420> far<00:01:03.750> as<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> oil<00:01:04.170> goes<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.159> use<00:01:05.280> an

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
as far as the oil goes you can use an

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.030 
as far as the oil goes you can use an
extra<00:01:05.760> virgin<00:01:05.970> or<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.360> pure<00:01:06.960> olive<00:01:07.140> oil<00:01:07.530> as<00:01:07.770> well

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
extra virgin or a pure olive oil as well

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.940 
extra virgin or a pure olive oil as well
so<00:01:08.790> oreganata<00:01:09.600> can<00:01:09.930> be<00:01:10.049> used<00:01:10.290> as<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> topping
