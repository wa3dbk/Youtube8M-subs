00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 Today jo people I want you my 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.570
 tell story and this story 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:13.460
 is about an elite unit with us 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.460
 knows the code name 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.340
 It all started on 31 october 2013 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.640
 It was the day we were soldiers 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.030
 we were fighting for simple soldiers 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.620
 our country had victories and defeats 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.930
 and in principle we were just one 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.690
 pretty uncoordinated bunch 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:48.519
 but that changed when we first 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:51.519
 machine we entered found jadestadt 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.600
 watch city tours with a code 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.940
 were provided 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.610
 We quickly realized that we were this 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.620
 So we had to crack code 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.989
 Experts who code the Morse code 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.280
 could decrypt and it surrendered 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.479
 a sentence bump in senate 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.820
 At that time we did not know what was happening to us 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.920
 before we got this password 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.560
 the battlelog page had entered 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:19.590
 the only thing we got wine 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.590
 Order found in the prospectus 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.120
 Three months later our mission went 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.130
 we arrived in the south chinese sea 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.980
 the first time in contact with one 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:37.090
 soldiers of the fendt in the unit his name 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:39.160
 was kevin simpson he communicated 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.940
 Of course not directly with us but 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:45.730
 via a website kevin simpson 1942 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.370
 point is hidden on this website 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.720
 He points us to another 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.730
 password should lead 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.800
 the decoding here was unfortunately 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.450
 not just the search for 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.520
 point this out of ours 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.290
 Uncoordinated pile of soldiers 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.380
 become one entity 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.290
 a very effective unit and such 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.930
 we also found the second epic password 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.970
 dreamworks after we pass this password 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.020
 had entered again in the battlelog 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.209
 we got our second order 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.340
 Trainee at this time we knew 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.050
 even in these orders was not 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.900
 just any puzzles 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:28.360
 It was our record for the 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:31.150
 Fans return to the Chinese 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.640
 mainland arrived against ours 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.209
 Mission continued it was the hardest 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.610
 what we ever faced we found 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.550
 symbols which point us to the fibonacci 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.430
 we did not come after that 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.290
 after weeks of searching we were 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.450
 really close to the task 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.640
 but then we got one 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.130
 decisive note from one of the 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.709
 window soldiers which us on one 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.350
 mathematical function led and with 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.970
 We were able to help with this function as well 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:09.880
 crack the third password 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:12.070
 it was 24 34 42 4 18 93 in the battlelog 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.670
 entered we got the third 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:19.140
 apply 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.590
 Fantasy Aid stood by our last exam 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.049
 before 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.840
 we found a secret elevator in 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:27.329
 a russian titan factory this one 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.049
 Elevator should take us to our final destination 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.900
 to lead 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.090
 but first we had to find out how 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.700
 we could activate this elevator 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.799
 It quickly became clear to us that we should 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.409
 needed different dog tags 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.370
 which in small boxes on the net 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.069
 were distributed 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.530
 when we are four with different 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.690
 dog tags in the elevator could climb 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.230
 we activate it for the first time 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.519
 But the ride was not completely atypical 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.889
 soldiers who fendt the previous ones 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.209
 orders were not fulfilled 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.940
 just killed 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.970
 without fenton weapons camouflage and soldiers 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.349
 camouflage and fenton there one became 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.989
 simply slaughtered 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.109
 it was not a nice sight yet 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.489
 Only the best should survive 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:14.579
 Arriving at the bottom hinders us 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.530
 force field in the move into the fanbase 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.180
 but we were through the last 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.760
 challenges were trained 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.330
 and quickly found out a pin code 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:27.960
 who opened the forcefield and was there 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:33.199
 we now the once simple soldiers in 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:36.199
 our new home snaps operational 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.199
