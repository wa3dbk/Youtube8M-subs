sponsorship<00:02:46.610> is<00:02:46.819> not<00:02:47.120> possible<00:02:47.540> after<00:02:47.989> all

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.760 

so<00:02:53.120> after<00:02:53.510> an<00:02:53.630> age<00:02:53.780> climbing<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.410> lift<00:02:54.590> Hill

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
so after an age climbing the lift Hill

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.560 
so after an age climbing the lift Hill
were<00:02:54.980> finally<00:02:55.400> ready<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:55.760> take<00:02:56.030> on<00:02:56.210> the<00:02:56.390> big

were finally ready to take on the big
one<00:02:56.890> first<00:02:57.890> up<00:02:58.160> is<00:02:58.580> that<00:02:58.820> huge<00:02:59.270> drop

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
one first up is that huge drop

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.680 
one first up is that huge drop
overlooking<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.380> Irish<00:03:00.710> Sea<00:03:01.450> as<00:03:02.450> you'd

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
overlooking the Irish Sea as you'd

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
overlooking the Irish Sea as you'd
expect<00:03:03.110> this<00:03:03.530> drop<00:03:03.830> is<00:03:04.070> absolutely<00:03:04.700> fantastic

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
expect this drop is absolutely fantastic

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.990

this<00:03:06.710> is<00:03:06.860> followed<00:03:07.190> by<00:03:07.220> Hill<00:03:07.610> well

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
this is followed by Hill well

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.820 
this is followed by Hill well
technically<00:03:08.510> it<00:03:08.690> is<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:08.900> hill<00:03:09.140> it<00:03:09.320> goes<00:03:09.500> up<00:03:09.710> and

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
technically it is a hill it goes up and

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.770 
technically it is a hill it goes up and
down<00:03:09.920> but<00:03:10.480> rollercoaster<00:03:11.480> hills<00:03:11.630> are

down but rollercoaster hills are

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.450 
down but rollercoaster hills are
supposed<00:03:12.020> to<00:03:12.080> be<00:03:12.200> curvy<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:12.680> parabolic<00:03:13.070> like

you<00:03:36.470> won't<00:03:36.620> really<00:03:36.860> get<00:03:37.070> any<00:03:37.400> there<00:03:38.210> is<00:03:38.330> one

is a narrow rollercoaster so expect
roughness<00:03:47.380> luckily<00:03:48.380> you're<00:03:48.560> only<00:03:48.680> held<00:03:48.950> in<00:03:49.070> by

what I hate the most about EPS about

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.820 
what I hate the most about EPS about
it<00:03:57.240> has<00:03:57.420> the<00:03:57.600> potential<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:58.230> be<00:03:58.320> an<00:03:58.410> absolutely

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
it has the potential to be an absolutely

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.000 
it has the potential to be an absolutely
fantastic<00:03:59.130> ride<00:04:00.000> with<00:04:00.780> 74<00:04:01.380> miles<00:04:01.590> per<00:04:01.740> hour

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.470 
and over 200 foot height to play with
you<00:04:04.830> could<00:04:05.010> pack<00:04:05.220> in<00:04:05.370> some<00:04:05.580> intense<00:04:06.000> forces

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
you could pack in some intense forces

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.660 
you could pack in some intense forces
and<00:04:06.630> lots<00:04:06.780> of<00:04:06.930> airtime<00:04:07.110> to<00:04:07.770> its<00:04:08.220> credit<00:04:08.640> the

first<00:04:09.030> drop<00:04:09.300> is<00:04:09.330> fantastic<00:04:10.110> and<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.320> length

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
first drop is fantastic and the length

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.470 
first drop is fantastic and the length
makes<00:04:10.860> up<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.130> little<00:04:11.310> for<00:04:11.550> the<00:04:11.640> lack<00:04:11.790> of<00:04:11.820> forces

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
park of this size I think the design is

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.590 
park of this size I think the design is
fantastic<00:04:52.050> and<00:04:52.830> also<00:04:53.640> diving<00:04:54.450> through

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
fantastic and also diving through

fantastic and also diving through
different<00:04:54.930> ride<00:04:55.110> structures<00:04:55.620> adds<00:04:55.800> a<00:04:55.950> little

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
different ride structures adds a little

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.560 
something to the ride the operation side
however<00:04:58.950> leaves<00:04:59.310> a<00:04:59.430> lot<00:04:59.580> to<00:04:59.610> be<00:04:59.730> desired<00:05:00.030> if
