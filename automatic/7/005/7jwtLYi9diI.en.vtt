00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
right there and I made that using the

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.950 
right there and I made that using the
Toro<00:00:10.590> lawn<00:00:11.130> striping<00:00:11.790> system<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:12.450> bought<00:00:12.840> this

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
Toro lawn striping system I bought this

Toro lawn striping system I bought this
on<00:00:13.080> Amazon<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.799> figured<00:00:14.099> I'd<00:00:14.219> hook<00:00:14.759> it<00:00:14.910> up<00:00:15.030> to

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
on Amazon and figured I'd hook it up to

make<00:00:22.289> your<00:00:22.470> own<00:00:22.650> lawn<00:00:22.949> striper<00:00:23.340> but<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.000> figured

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
make your own lawn striper but I figured

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.650 
make your own lawn striper but I figured
I'd<00:00:24.359> compare<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.109> what<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.500> can<00:00:25.740> do<00:00:25.859> here

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
I'd compare that to what I can do here

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.210 
I'd compare that to what I can do here
so<00:00:27.660> assembly<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.170> pretty<00:00:28.410> easy<00:00:28.650> it's<00:00:28.980> real

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
so assembly is pretty easy it's real

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.980 
so assembly is pretty easy it's real
simple<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:30.150> biggest<00:00:30.480> thing<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.810> remember

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
simple the biggest thing is remember

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.200 
simple the biggest thing is remember
that<00:00:31.289> this<00:00:31.679> arm<00:00:31.949> here<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.430> controls<00:00:32.850> or

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
that this arm here that controls or

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.569 
that this arm here that controls or
holds<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.960> roller<00:00:34.230> itself<00:00:34.649> needs<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.460> be

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
holds the roller itself needs to be

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.000 
holds the roller itself needs to be
pointed<00:00:35.910> back<00:00:36.180> towards<00:00:36.690> your<00:00:36.840> mower<00:00:37.079> if<00:00:37.739> it's

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
pointed back towards your mower if it's

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.220 
pointed back towards your mower if it's
pointed<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.610> other<00:00:38.850> way<00:00:39.090> you're<00:00:39.629> not<00:00:39.989> going

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
pointed the other way you're not going

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.020 
pointed the other way you're not going
to<00:00:40.290> have<00:00:40.410> as<00:00:40.559> good<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.829> control<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.820> course

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
to have as good of control of course

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.729 
to have as good of control of course
then<00:00:42.270> fill<00:00:42.540> up<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.690> roller<00:00:42.989> with<00:00:43.200> some<00:00:43.410> sand

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
then fill up the roller with some sand

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.220 
then fill up the roller with some sand
should<00:00:44.309> probably<00:00:44.520> use<00:00:44.940> should<00:00:45.870> probably<00:00:46.020> use

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
should probably use should probably use

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.720 
should probably use should probably use
some<00:00:46.410> sort<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.770> funnel<00:00:47.039> make<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.640> lot

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
some sort of a funnel make it a lot

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.970 
some sort of a funnel make it a lot
easier<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.629> there<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.260> go<00:00:49.440> just<00:00:49.469> get<00:00:49.890> out

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
easier and there you go just get out

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.380 
easier and there you go just get out
there<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.190> start<00:00:50.489> mowing<00:00:52.760> now<00:00:53.760> you'll<00:00:54.030> notice

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
there and start mowing now you'll notice

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.090 
there and start mowing now you'll notice
that<00:00:54.539> i<00:00:54.750> make<00:00:54.780> my<00:00:55.140> stripes<00:00:55.530> what<00:00:55.770> i<00:00:55.800> call

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
that i make my stripes what i call

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.220 
that i make my stripes what i call
double<00:00:56.579> fat<00:00:56.820> means<00:00:57.180> i<00:00:57.329> go<00:00:57.539> each<00:00:57.870> direction

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
double fat means i go each direction

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.160 
double fat means i go each direction
twice<00:00:58.920> i<00:00:59.250> do<00:00:59.760> that<00:01:00.149> because<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.719> gives<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.109> a

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
twice i do that because it gives you a

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.689 
twice i do that because it gives you a
little<00:01:01.350> bit<00:01:01.530> more<00:01:01.710> stunning<00:01:02.129> look<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.640> it

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
little bit more stunning look and it

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.070 
little bit more stunning look and it
also<00:01:02.850> gives<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.480> look<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.019> a

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
also gives you that look of a

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.500 
also gives you that look of a
professional<00:01:04.650> mower<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.519> much<00:01:05.820> wider<00:01:06.210> than

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
professional mower it's much wider than

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.899 
professional mower it's much wider than
your<00:01:06.630> 21<00:01:07.140> inch<00:01:07.290> home<00:01:07.500> mower<00:01:07.740> deck<00:01:08.010> when<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.790> do

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
your 21 inch home mower deck when you do

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.340 
your 21 inch home mower deck when you do
these<00:01:09.030> double<00:01:09.420> wide<00:01:09.540> stripes<00:01:09.900> though<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.140> do

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
these double wide stripes though you do

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.620 
these double wide stripes though you do
have<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.619> go<00:01:10.770> back<00:01:11.100> over<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.790> previous<00:01:12.270> areas

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
have to go back over the previous areas

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.600 
have to go back over the previous areas
that<00:01:13.260> way<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.439> don't<00:01:13.650> mess<00:01:13.830> anything<00:01:14.100> up<00:01:14.369> but

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
that way you don't mess anything up but

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.550 
that way you don't mess anything up but
what<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.850> does<00:01:15.060> do<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.540> redefines<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
what it does do is it redefines the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.320 
what it does do is it redefines the
stripe<00:01:16.979> for<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.340> if<00:01:17.520> you're<00:01:17.700> off<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> little

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
stripe for you if you're off a little

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.140 
stripe for you if you're off a little
bit<00:01:18.540> or<00:01:19.020> if<00:01:19.320> maybe<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:20.040> line<00:01:20.369> isn't<00:01:20.580> perfectly

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
bit or if maybe the line isn't perfectly

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.220 
bit or if maybe the line isn't perfectly
straight

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.780 

so<00:01:27.230> comparing<00:01:27.680> this<00:01:27.800> to<00:01:27.860> my<00:01:28.040> DIY<00:01:28.520> launch

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
so comparing this to my DIY launch

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.550 
so comparing this to my DIY launch
striper<00:01:29.090> I<00:01:29.360> think<00:01:29.630> it<00:01:29.720> does<00:01:29.900> just<00:01:30.200> as<00:01:30.320> good<00:01:30.500> a

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
striper I think it does just as good a

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.150 
striper I think it does just as good a
job<00:01:30.650> of<00:01:31.340> course<00:01:31.580> $76<00:01:32.570> versus<00:01:33.050> $10<00:01:33.740> is<00:01:33.890> quite<00:01:34.130> a

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
job of course $76 versus $10 is quite a

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.460 
job of course $76 versus $10 is quite a
big<00:01:34.340> difference<00:01:34.730> and<00:01:35.060> I'll<00:01:35.270> link<00:01:35.480> below<00:01:35.540> to
