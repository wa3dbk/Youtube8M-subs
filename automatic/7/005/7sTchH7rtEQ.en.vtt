00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.589
 hello everyone bought 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.589
 power supply for the second computer 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:19.789
 logics of power that's it's a miracle views 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:23.880
 whale fish what is most interesting on 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:27.330
 photos that someone new to come in 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.230
 box but it comes in such 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.230
 tea bags 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:43.320
 here is Sofia 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:50.219
 issue price of 245 hryvnia is 500 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:01:00.210
 watt than we see here we see here 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:01:01.829
 as always horror for the price of course 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.969
 don't praise yourself nobody praises 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.549
 logic power 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:10.229
 everything seems to be on Houri com 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:17.970
 engrave as extruded 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:29.180
 it's called issued this thing I 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:29.180
 look jumped out of the grooves in general do 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:42.299
 as we are seeing the power button no 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:49.619
 what a sadness cam for me here without a button 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:54.360
 the inclusion of although the husband she does not need here 500 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:02:01.950
 watt but I think there is no 500 at least 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:07.200
 400 was each level that is how 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:12.450
 see data if someone needs someone else 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:15.840
 need rings see damage robs 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:23.959
 Arante 2013, as it should be 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:32.180
 the tenth month you serve within us 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:32.180
 by the way the power supply itself is very light 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:42.650
 inside inside there's nothing really in 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:45.650
 I see two healthy capacitors 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.650
 large 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:03:09.470
 Now we need to go tomorrow 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.470
 bundled and wires for this very 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:18.900
 of himself 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:23.070
 there is no network wire 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.080
 no wires well I think those who will 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:31.160
 change if will change the same in 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:54.000
 bundled not so what we see here 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:59.720
 sata molex water terrible care screed is 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.720
 that is, here 's not all the bitch bothers 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.130
 something good 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.040
 the game we have about the lead 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.389
 that's actually why I took the block 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.330
 power it to be able to 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:25.169
 connect wi spirit 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.169
 on 2 computers 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:35.740
 typesetting power or rather output 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:40.500
 here is this one set that is possible 4 you can 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:53.410
 8 well, you can rather 6 and you can fall 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:58.380
 I get confused by the standard Finn and 24 by 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:05:07.770
 my back again collapsible mind 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:11.680
 so it can be so 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:16.479
 powerful enough though the sheath is not this 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:23.460
 In general, the issue price of food for 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:23.460
 processor and own speak 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:32.729
 snails 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.729
 1 cupcake here and 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:52.690
 11 separate wires for grade 2 and more 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:55.479
 one is the same double ie 20 x esata 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.669
 Well , I already have extra food 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:03.440
 I do not know what it is used and wild 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:05.900
 let's say so for the flop drives 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:11.410
 but if someone they have throw them away 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.410
 see you 0 advice extra waste of energy 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:24.710
 principle m of said three plus i would 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:36.440
 I would give 4 well, I do not mind that there is no 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:40.970
 buttons are very sorry that there are no buttons yet 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:47.090
 that such a tell and of course not 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:52.100
 braids on wires well, although the price would be the price 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:57.050
 would have greatly increased from arc 200 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:07:01.820
 45 hryvnia inside cost me to enter 15 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:13.240
 hryvnia that's what 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:19.270
 and it will work, I hope the wires and 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:19.270
 strong long so principle ok 

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:31.330
 cooler I guess the cheapest but 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:35.240
 if all goes well I run replaced 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:42.790
 normal something like home or 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:42.790
 castle here thank you for your attention bye
