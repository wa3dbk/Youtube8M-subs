stuff that's exclusive record box so the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.759 
stuff that's exclusive record box so the
first<00:00:22.680> thing<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.189> needle<00:00:23.580> search<00:00:23.820> function

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
first thing is a needle search function

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.980 
first thing is a needle search function
when<00:00:25.769> your<00:00:25.949> song<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.460> paused<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:27.630> can<00:00:27.750> move

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
anywhere along here soundwave we just

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.750 
anywhere along here soundwave we just
touch<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.960> string<00:00:34.380> I'll<00:00:35.130> skip<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.610> part

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
touch the string I'll skip to that part

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.160 
touch the string I'll skip to that part
in<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.120> song<00:00:36.329> because<00:00:36.570> it's<00:00:36.690> really<00:00:36.840> useful

for setting cue points further down in

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.639 
for setting cue points further down in
the<00:00:40.140> song<00:00:41.780> well<00:00:42.780> next<00:00:43.050> thing<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.290> loops

below them which will start a four

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.960 
below them which will start a four
people<00:00:57.780> loop<00:00:57.930> as<00:00:58.110> well<00:01:01.520> now<00:01:02.520> if<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.760> press

people loop as well now if you press
that<00:01:03.000> button<00:01:03.360> again<00:01:03.630> it<00:01:03.810> will<00:01:03.870> cut<00:01:04.050> the<00:01:04.170> loop

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
that button again it will cut the loop

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.690 
that button again it will cut the loop
nap

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.370

know about is when you're in the loop in

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.010 
know about is when you're in the loop in
if<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:24.049> press<00:01:24.530> out<00:01:24.740> again<00:01:25.540> it<00:01:26.540> gives<00:01:26.810> you<00:01:26.930> this

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
loop menu and you can choose the timing

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.359 
loop menu and you can choose the timing
on<00:01:29.930> how<00:01:30.080> fast<00:01:30.290> you<00:01:30.500> want<00:01:30.619> it<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:30.890> loop<00:01:31.100> so<00:01:31.310> you

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
on how fast you want it to loop so you

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:41.969 
on how fast you want it to loop so you
can<00:01:31.490> jump<00:01:31.759> between<00:01:31.880> different<00:01:32.420> timings

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.760 

another<00:01:42.979> cool<00:01:43.250> features<00:01:43.759> the<00:01:44.090> hotkeys<00:01:45.020> now

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
another cool features the hotkeys now

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.200 
another cool features the hotkeys now
this<00:01:45.890> works<00:01:46.220> best<00:01:46.460> when<00:01:46.640> it's<00:01:46.820> set<00:01:47.030> up<00:01:47.060> a

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
this works best when it's set up a

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.520 
this works best when it's set up a
record<00:01:47.600> box<00:01:47.840> but<00:01:48.110> it<00:01:48.200> doesn't<00:01:48.470> necessarily

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
record box but it doesn't necessarily

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.460 
record box but it doesn't necessarily
have<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.369> be<00:01:49.580> set<00:01:49.880> up<00:01:50.000> so<00:01:50.660> if<00:01:50.750> you<00:01:50.869> press<00:01:51.140> the

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
have to be set up so if you press the

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.359 
have to be set up so if you press the
record<00:01:52.340> button<00:01:53.259> they'll<00:01:54.259> turn<00:01:54.619> red<00:01:55.009> which

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
record button they'll turn red which

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.760 
record button they'll turn red which
means<00:01:55.580> you<00:01:55.729> can<00:01:55.880> set<00:01:56.179> the<00:01:56.330> queue<00:01:56.600> you<00:01:57.320> can<00:01:57.500> set

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
means you can set the queue you can set

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.190 
means you can set the queue you can set
that<00:01:57.920> to<00:01:58.070> any<00:01:58.190> point<00:01:58.490> in<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:58.670> song

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.260 

so<00:02:04.829> once<00:02:05.039> you<00:02:05.189> set<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.880> will<00:02:06.000> show<00:02:06.149> up

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
point and jump back to that part of the

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:19.270 
point and jump back to that part of the
song

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.760 

a<00:02:19.540> cool<00:02:20.540> feature<00:02:20.780> about<00:02:20.959> this<00:02:21.319> is<00:02:21.590> you<00:02:21.740> can

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
actually use it to jump between song so

q you want to load there it will jump to
that<00:04:55.530> part<00:04:55.800> and<00:04:55.949> now<00:04:56.130> it<00:04:56.280> will<00:04:56.370> be<00:04:56.750> automatic

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.939 

now<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:03.060> reason<00:05:03.360> that<00:05:03.720> this<00:05:04.020> one<00:05:04.320> is<00:05:04.350> orange

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
now the reason that this one is orange

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.520 
now the reason that this one is orange
is<00:05:05.130> because<00:05:05.460> it's<00:05:06.240> a<00:05:06.419> loop<00:05:06.720> so<00:05:07.050> you<00:05:07.139> can<00:05:07.290> set

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
is because it's a loop so you can set

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:13.580 
is because it's a loop so you can set
those<00:05:07.680> up<00:05:07.740> as<00:05:08.070> hockey's<00:05:08.790> as<00:05:08.970> well<00:05:12.380> you<00:05:13.380> just

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
hit this twice more to it down with

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.850 
hit this twice more to it down with
flashing<00:05:18.240> there

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.490 

you

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500
