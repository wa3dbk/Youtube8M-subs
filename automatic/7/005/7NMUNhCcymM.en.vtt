00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
views on this map well actually you know

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.230 
views on this map well actually you know
this<00:02:43.320> move<00:02:43.590> of<00:02:43.770> just<00:02:44.130> hitting<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.940> making

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
this move of just hitting and making

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.550 
this move of just hitting and making
this<00:02:45.330> point<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:46.020> pretty<00:02:46.710> clear<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.250> mean<00:02:48.560> the

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
this point is pretty clear I mean the

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.730 
this point is pretty clear I mean the
other<00:02:49.680> players<00:02:50.100> actually<00:02:50.310> pretty<00:02:50.730> horrible

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
other players actually pretty horrible

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.520 
other players actually pretty horrible
um<00:02:52.790> yeah<00:02:53.790> I<00:02:53.820> think<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.510> what's<00:02:54.840> gonna<00:02:55.020> happen

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
um yeah I think so what's gonna happen

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.010 
um yeah I think so what's gonna happen
when<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.280> do<00:02:56.460> this<00:02:56.670> usually<00:02:57.570> you<00:02:57.720> want<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:58.050> hit

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
when you do this usually you want to hit

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.260 
when you do this usually you want to hit
the<00:03:01.020> frontmost<00:03:01.800> guy<00:03:02.100> because<00:03:02.820> it<00:03:02.940> takes<00:03:03.120> away

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
the frontmost guy because it takes away

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.310 
the frontmost guy because it takes away
the<00:03:03.540> most<00:03:03.750> in<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.020> race<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:06.140> sends<00:03:07.140> another

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
the most in the race and sends another

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.650 
the most in the race and sends another
guy<00:03:07.650> back<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:09.000> it<00:03:09.150> prevents<00:03:09.510> them<00:03:09.630> from

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
guy back and it prevents them from

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.190 
guy back and it prevents them from
making<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:10.170> four-point<00:03:10.620> board<00:03:11.390> um<00:03:12.390> that's<00:03:13.020> what

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
making a four-point board um that's what

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.590 
making a four-point board um that's what
they<00:03:13.290> must<00:03:13.410> have<00:03:13.590> been<00:03:13.680> thinking<00:03:13.860> right<00:03:14.600> the

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
they must have been thinking right the

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.440 
they must have been thinking right the
problem<00:03:15.990> with<00:03:16.140> this<00:03:16.380> is<00:03:16.650> that<00:03:17.340> now<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:18.120> give

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
problem with this is that now you give

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.110 
problem with this is that now you give
them<00:03:18.570> an<00:03:18.690> ace<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:19.140> just<00:03:19.380> equalize<00:03:19.860> a<00:03:20.190> deuce<00:03:20.940> is

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120

there<00:04:14.660> the<00:04:15.660> prime<00:04:15.989> is<00:04:16.230> not<00:04:16.380> really<00:04:16.980> a<00:04:17.010> threat

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
there the prime is not really a threat

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.330 
there the prime is not really a threat
because<00:04:17.609> you've<00:04:17.940> got<00:04:18.090> this<00:04:18.330> point<00:04:18.690> and<00:04:19.340> you

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
because you've got this point and you

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.310 
because you've got this point and you
know<00:04:20.370> if<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:20.940> can<00:04:21.120> just<00:04:21.150> pick<00:04:21.900> up<00:04:22.020> three

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
know if you can just pick up three

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.420 
know if you can just pick up three
checkers<00:04:22.680> it's<00:04:22.860> going<00:04:23.010> to<00:04:23.070> be<00:04:23.190> really

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
checkers it's going to be really

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.590 
checkers it's going to be really
powerful<00:04:23.700> yeah<00:04:24.600> I<00:04:24.900> think<00:04:25.800> so<00:04:26.130> pretty<00:04:26.640> much<00:04:26.880> all

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
powerful yeah I think so pretty much all

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.150 
powerful yeah I think so pretty much all
the<00:04:27.720> points<00:04:28.110> are<00:04:28.290> pretty<00:04:28.500> much<00:04:28.650> equal<00:04:28.860> in

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
the points are pretty much equal in

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.580 
the points are pretty much equal in
value<00:04:29.190> you<00:04:29.760> know<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.030> race<00:04:30.210> is<00:04:30.450> not<00:04:30.630> really<00:04:31.560> a

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
value you know the race is not really a

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.640 
value you know the race is not really a
concern<00:04:32.660> what<00:04:33.660> did<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:33.870> ACE<00:04:33.960> point<00:04:34.290> is<00:04:34.410> pretty

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
concern what did the ACE point is pretty

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.650 
concern what did the ACE point is pretty
valuable<00:04:35.040> yeah<00:04:35.580> and<00:04:35.820> taking<00:04:36.270> away<00:04:36.510> his

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
valuable yeah and taking away his

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.620 
valuable yeah and taking away his
potential<00:04:37.080> anchor<00:04:37.440> is<00:04:37.560> also<00:04:37.860> very<00:04:37.980> valuable

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
potential anchor is also very valuable

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.120 
potential anchor is also very valuable
when<00:04:39.630> things<00:04:39.870> are<00:04:40.020> very<00:04:40.110> sometimes<00:04:40.830> things

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
when things are very sometimes things

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.530 
when things are very sometimes things
are<00:04:41.280> very<00:04:41.490> clear<00:04:41.850> straight<00:04:42.060> away<00:04:42.210> like<00:04:42.360> this

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
are very clear straight away like this

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.030 
are very clear straight away like this
when<00:04:42.810> I<00:04:42.840> was<00:04:43.050> playing<00:04:43.170> it<00:04:43.470> when<00:04:43.560> I<00:04:43.620> watched<00:04:43.860> it

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
when I was playing it when I watched it

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.970 
when I was playing it when I watched it
happen<00:04:44.270> it<00:04:45.270> was<00:04:45.450> very<00:04:45.690> clear<00:04:46.050> that<00:04:46.080> this<00:04:46.380> was<00:04:46.800> a

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
happen it was very clear that this was a

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.160 
happen it was very clear that this was a
wrong<00:04:47.160> play<00:04:47.460> and<00:04:47.790> you<00:04:48.480> know<00:04:48.570> this<00:04:48.690> was<00:04:48.840> clearly

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
wrong play and you know this was clearly

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.770 
wrong play and you know this was clearly
the<00:04:49.320> right<00:04:49.530> play<00:04:49.770> doing<00:04:50.070> this<00:04:50.390> but<00:04:51.390> sometimes

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
the right play doing this but sometimes

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.860 
the right play doing this but sometimes
also<00:04:51.960> in<00:04:52.350> a<00:04:52.760> few<00:04:53.760> other<00:04:53.940> good<00:04:54.150> players<00:04:54.420> say<00:04:54.840> oh

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
also in a few other good players say oh

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.420 
also in a few other good players say oh
hang<00:04:55.230> on<00:04:55.350> though<00:04:55.500> they<00:04:55.650> disagree<00:04:56.100> with<00:04:56.250> you
