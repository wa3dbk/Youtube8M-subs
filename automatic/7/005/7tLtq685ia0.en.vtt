00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello welcome to the second 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.490
 part of special screws today I 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.500
 will show you how to adjust your 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.880
 bike to perfection and enjoy at 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.650
 maximum of all elements 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.360
 depreciation when we realize 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.250
 the adjustment of the deflection it is 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.289
 important to adjust the level first 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.150
 of hardness of the suspension thanks to the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.400
 air pressure at the fork 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.289
 finally we will adjust the damper for 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.869
 that the transmission works it takes 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.910
 adjust the suspension elements this is 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.699
 to say the fork and the damper to 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.430
 our weight start with the fork 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.280
 if the fork as is the case here is 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.230
 too low she must first relax 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.989
 completely something else very important 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.090
 before adjusting the sensitivity of the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.640
 suspension and uninstallation of 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.860
 the compression damper so that the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.780
 fork and compress without limit 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.700
 normally the compression of 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.129
 depreciation is here but this 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.110
 fork is a bit special because here down 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.969
 there is another platform that will need 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.350
 unscrewed ie in the sense 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.660
 counterclockwise 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.940
 to adjust the suspension too 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.379
 commonly called is wise and he is 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.820
 important to have a ring in 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.890
 rubber on the fork 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.990
 it is possible that he comes already included 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.049
 or we can also fix it using 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.420
 of a ring the area where the 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.030
 relaxation of the suspension is here 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.299
 down she adjusts when we 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.040
 sit down completely on the bike 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.990
 does he presume when for instance we pass 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.670
 by crevasses the bike is not going 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.310
 lose contact with the ground 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.060
 as a rule this area relaxes 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.560
 between 20 and 30% to adjust it 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.810
 can ask someone from us 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.030
 hold the bike or simply search for a 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.369
 wall or table to support the bike 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.250
 in order to be able to put ourselves with the 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.320
 two legs standing on the bike he put 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.700
 all our weight 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.070
 previously with a backpack is 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.530
 completely equipped as we are 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.210
 would be the day of our bike ride 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.229
 we position ourselves in posture 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.360
 normal riding centered on the bike 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.479
 and press the suspensions elements 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.600
 twice we draw on the ring in 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.649
 rubber down and we go down 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.560
 gently ride the bike without the ring 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.680
 do not move at the end we can measure the 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.860
 deflection of the suspension if it is 6 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.579
 cm the fork is too relaxed saw itself 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:26.239
 than 20% on 250 mm forks 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:29.659
 should be three centimeters the la 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.890
 fork is too relaxed to inflate the 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.500
 fork and fender 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.980
 we will need a special pump 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.379
 a suspension pump let's start 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.620
 first by the fork and I will you 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:44.870
 show a secret to gather the 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.950
 fork fox with this life its pressure 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.470
 hidden here 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.190
 we only need to put it in 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:56.060
 minus position in descent position 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.010
 life is easier to unscrew then 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.269
 we are getting back into position 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.470
 driving before starting inflation 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.720
 it is not indicated a pressure 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.000
 adequate in the manual or directly 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.250
 on the same fork you will then need 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.069
 sought by yourself that is in 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.440
 snoring a little more and repeated the same 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:19.549
 process to reach the correct level 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:24.680
 20 or 25% of is wise and is 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:26.569
 now let's start the process again 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.019
 pulls on the rubber ring towards the 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:37.459
 down and we get off the bike 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:40.159
 carefully now she measures 35 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.169
 perfect mm once we have 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:43.819
 the print is adjusted at the fork 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.739
 we can move to depreciation 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.959
 in depreciation there are two 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.699
 adjustment possibilities on one side we 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.229
 have the level of other actions more 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.579
 known as robots and 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.349
 the other the pressure level or 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.629
 compression 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:00.079
 firstly let's adjust the 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:03.590
 pull level for this we need 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:06.530
 completely unscrew the level screw 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.019
 normally red 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.510
 in the opposite direction of the needles 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.819
 of a watch all the forks not 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.590
 the compression setting normally 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.579
 only models expensive or with 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.289
 beats have 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.329
 it is important that depreciation by 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:22.610
 compression is completely unscrewed 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.740
 before adjusting the traction level 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.689
 exactly the same way as we 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.750
 have seen it before before adjusting 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:31.580
 the sensitivity of the damper for 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.500
 adjust the trigger ie the 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.090
 rebound speed we have to shoot 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.560
 the front wheel brake compress the 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.960
 wheel with all the weight of our body 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:44.330
 thanks to a dry and dynamic movement and 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:46.340
 then dropped the handlebars like that you 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.500
 can see how fast the fork 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.509
 bounced before adjusting the level of 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.669
 pull on the damper one has to 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:54.919
 completely unscrew the level screw 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.879
 traction in the opposite direction of the 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.379
 Clockwise 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:59.629
 like that you can see how 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:01.430
 speed the fork rebounded before 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:03.319
 to adjust the level of traction on 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.000
 the shock must be unscrewed 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:06.949
 completely screw the level of 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.770
 traction in the opposite direction of 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:14.870
 clockwise to check to 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.210
 how fast the back part of the bike 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.849
 rebounded the simplest would be to go 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.889
 outside and that you try to look for a 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:24.080
 bordeaux sidewalk sit on the 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.270
 saddle is mounted then go down on the 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.039
 sidewalk several times to check to 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.360
 how often does the back part of the 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:31.819
 bounced bike 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.889
 the ideal would be that the back part of the 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:35.990
 bike gets compressed once and then 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:38.479
 bounce and then to the wheel 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.599
 stabilize once or twice we're going 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:43.490
 do it now 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:45.680
 another way of checking would be in 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.080
 rescuing those down to see 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:52.039
 how often the rebound damper 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.690
 when he is compressed the level of 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:55.879
 traction in the direction of the needles 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.190
 of a watch should rise until 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:06:00.979
 train driving this tablet and 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.050
 to rise again to finally paralyze 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:04.580
 as we did for the fork 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.620
 we will now adjust 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.719
 the damper for that we have to 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.270
 return to our initial position 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:13.159
 sit on the road and move three 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.080
 times the damping elements finally 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:17.240
 we draw the wedding pull towards the 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.849
 up and we measure the is wise and a 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.949
 once got off the bike the negative path 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:24.080
 of the shock absorber must be 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:25.819
 somewhere between 25 and 30% 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.190
 now the train of conduct and 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:30.590
 adjusted have fun with your bike 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.480
 in the next videos I'll go 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.600
 show the necessary adjustments of 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.600
 wheels
