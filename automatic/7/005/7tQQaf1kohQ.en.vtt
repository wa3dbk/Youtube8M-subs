00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
bees have the flyer mutation which means

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.200 
bees have the flyer mutation which means
as<00:00:22.439> soon<00:00:22.590> as<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.830> stops<00:00:23.070> raining<00:00:23.310> they<00:00:23.939> all<00:00:24.090> go

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
as soon as it stops raining they all go

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.179 
as soon as it stops raining they all go
into<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.539> apiary<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.140> hide<00:00:25.590> until<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.039> rain

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
into the apiary and hide until the rain

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.279 
into the apiary and hide until the rain
goes<00:00:26.400> away<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:27.330> we're<00:00:27.720> going<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.960> be<00:00:28.050> looking

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
goes away so we're going to be looking

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.209 
goes away so we're going to be looking
at<00:00:28.410> another<00:00:28.710> machine<00:00:28.949> from<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.609> forestry<00:00:30.090> mod

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
at another machine from the forestry mod

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:33.290 
at another machine from the forestry mod
well<00:00:32.219> if<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.640> haven't<00:00:32.880> guessed<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.180> already

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
well if you haven't guessed it already

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.270 
well if you haven't guessed it already
from<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.870> description<00:00:34.230> or<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.860> title<00:00:35.219> of

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
from that description or the title of

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.549 
from that description or the title of
the<00:00:35.370> video<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.510> it's<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.110> Rainmaker

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
the video this is it it's the Rainmaker

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.670 
the video this is it it's the Rainmaker
now<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.430> Rainmaker<00:00:38.879> itself<00:00:39.420> does<00:00:40.079> two<00:00:40.290> simple

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
now the Rainmaker itself does two simple

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.650 
now the Rainmaker itself does two simple
tasks<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.340> can<00:00:41.550> make<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.850> rain<00:00:42.030> or<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.510> can

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
tasks you can make it rain or you can

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.779 
tasks you can make it rain or you can
stop<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:42.989> raining<00:00:43.350> it's<00:00:43.980> very<00:00:44.219> easy<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.550> build

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
stop it raining it's very easy to build

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.250 
stop it raining it's very easy to build
although<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.300> does<00:00:45.420> require<00:00:45.570> four<00:00:46.020> diamonds

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
although it does require four diamonds

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.799 
although it does require four diamonds
the<00:00:47.160> difficult<00:00:47.700> part<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:48.180> actually<00:00:48.420> getting

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
the difficult part is actually getting

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.139 
the difficult part is actually getting
the<00:00:49.020> fuels<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.649> needs<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.070> run<00:00:50.280> on<00:00:50.399> so

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
the fuels that it needs to run on so

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.979 
the fuels that it needs to run on so
let's<00:00:51.600> go<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.020> workshop<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> look

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
let's go to the workshop and have a look

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.689 
let's go to the workshop and have a look
so<00:00:54.989> first<00:00:55.020> things<00:00:55.649> first<00:00:55.739> let's<00:00:56.309> put<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
so first things first let's put the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.670 
so first things first let's put the
Rainmaker<00:00:57.120> itself<00:00:57.809> together<00:00:57.989> we're<00:00:58.379> going<00:00:58.410> to

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
Rainmaker itself together we're going to

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.200 
Rainmaker itself together we're going to
need<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.920> power<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.399> here<00:00:59.579> because<00:00:59.940> we

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
need the power on in here because we

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.049 
need the power on in here because we
need<00:01:00.420> our<00:01:00.840> carpenter<00:01:01.440> now<00:01:01.980> we've<00:01:02.489> made<00:01:02.820> a

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
need a sturdy casing and four diamonds

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.260 
need a sturdy casing and four diamonds
in<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:09.150> four<00:01:09.780> corners<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:11.580> carpenter<00:01:12.090> and

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
in the four corners in the carpenter and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.420 
in the four corners in the carpenter and
that<00:01:12.420> will<00:01:12.570> give<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:13.110> hardened<00:01:13.650> casing<00:01:14.130> so

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
that will give you a hardened casing so

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.570 
that will give you a hardened casing so
let's<00:01:14.760> wait<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.240> make<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:16.430> there<00:01:17.430> we

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
let's wait for that to make and there we

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.210 
let's wait for that to make and there we
go<00:01:17.610> we<00:01:18.060> have<00:01:18.330> our<00:01:18.720> hardened<00:01:19.470> casing<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.040> let's

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
go we have our hardened casing so let's

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.370 
go we have our hardened casing so let's
take<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.880> clear<00:01:21.330> my<00:01:21.360> recipe<00:01:21.869> as<00:01:21.960> usual

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
take that and clear my recipe as usual

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.130 
take that and clear my recipe as usual
and<00:01:22.560> then<00:01:23.310> it's<00:01:23.610> simply<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.119> case<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.390> going<00:01:24.810> to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
and then it's simply a case of going to

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.830 
and then it's simply a case of going to
the<00:01:25.229> crafting<00:01:25.590> table<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:27.000> hardened<00:01:27.420> casing

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
the crafting table the hardened casing

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.940 
the crafting table the hardened casing
goes<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.350> middle<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.909> glass<00:01:29.909> block<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
goes in the middle a glass block to the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.980 
goes in the middle a glass block to the
north<00:01:31.950> south<00:01:32.189> east<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.549> west<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.090> then<00:01:33.540> tin

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
north south east and west and then tin

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.350 
north south east and west and then tin
gears<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.740> four<00:01:34.950> corners<00:01:35.369> will<00:01:35.549> give<00:01:36.210> us

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
gears in the four corners will give us

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.649 
gears in the four corners will give us
our<00:01:36.600> Rainmaker<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> Rainmaker<00:01:39.000> itself<00:01:39.450> is

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
our Rainmaker so the Rainmaker itself is

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.830 
our Rainmaker so the Rainmaker itself is
really<00:01:40.020> easy<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.950> make<00:01:41.130> but<00:01:41.400> then<00:01:42.210> we<00:01:42.570> need<00:01:42.689> to

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
really easy to make but then we need to

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.080 
really easy to make but then we need to
make<00:01:43.020> two<00:01:43.320> different<00:01:43.680> types<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.369> capsules<00:01:44.880> we

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
make two different types of capsules we

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.060 
make two different types of capsules we
need<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.329> make<00:01:45.450> an<00:01:45.600> iodine<00:01:45.840> capsule<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.590> a

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
need to make an iodine capsule and a

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.510 
need to make an iodine capsule and a
dissipation<00:01:47.759> capsule<00:01:49.189> now<00:01:50.189> I've<00:01:50.340> already

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
dissipation capsule now I've already

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.850 
dissipation capsule now I've already
showed<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:50.939> how<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.479> get<00:01:51.750> honey<00:01:52.049> drops<00:01:52.380> from

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
showed you how to get honey drops from

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.520 
showed you how to get honey drops from
the<00:01:53.610> honeycombs<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.689> bees<00:01:54.869> produced<00:01:55.350> by

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
the honeycombs that bees produced by

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.560 
the honeycombs that bees produced by
putting<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.159> centrifuge<00:01:56.570> however

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
putting it in the centrifuge however

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.999 
putting it in the centrifuge however
there<00:01:57.780> are<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> couple<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.380> other<00:01:58.590> things<00:01:58.680> that

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
there are a couple of other things that

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.840 
there are a couple of other things that
bees<00:01:59.340> do<00:01:59.610> produce<00:02:00.030> such<00:02:00.990> as<00:02:01.140> pollen<00:02:01.560> honey<00:02:02.549> Jew

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
bees do produce such as pollen honey Jew

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.230

you're going to need industrious bees

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.660 
you're going to need industrious bees
you<00:02:24.960> can<00:02:25.170> also<00:02:25.320> get<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.680> randomly<00:02:26.190> from<00:02:26.430> time

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
you can also get it randomly from time

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.550 
you can also get it randomly from time
to<00:02:26.850> time<00:02:26.910> when<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.450> break<00:02:27.690> down<00:02:27.900> hives<00:02:28.230> with<00:02:28.530> a

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
to time when you break down hives with a

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.800 
to time when you break down hives with a
scoop<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.100> very<00:02:29.910> rarely<00:02:30.270> you<00:02:30.540> will<00:02:30.690> actually

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
scoop and very rarely you will actually

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.410 
scoop and very rarely you will actually
find<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.650> can<00:02:31.800> get<00:02:31.950> some<00:02:32.190> from<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.730> village<00:02:33.030> if

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
find you can get some from a village if

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.110 
find you can get some from a village if
it<00:02:33.540> has<00:02:33.690> beekeeper<00:02:34.550> you're<00:02:35.550> also<00:02:35.670> going<00:02:36.000> to

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
it has beekeeper you're also going to

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.000 
it has beekeeper you're also going to
need<00:02:36.210> some<00:02:36.600> tin<00:02:36.930> cans<00:02:37.200> which<00:02:37.500> are<00:02:37.620> very<00:02:37.710> easy

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
need some tin cans which are very easy

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.270 
need some tin cans which are very easy
and<00:02:38.220> cheap<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.610> make<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.260> some<00:02:40.260> gunpowder<00:02:40.680> so

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
and cheap to make and some gunpowder so

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.800 
and cheap to make and some gunpowder so
think<00:02:41.730> about<00:02:41.850> killing<00:02:42.360> some<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.720> those

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
think about killing some of those

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.830 
think about killing some of those
creepers<00:02:43.320> so<00:02:44.040> let's<00:02:44.550> head<00:02:44.790> back<00:02:44.850> to<00:02:45.570> the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
creepers so let's head back to the

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.830 
creepers so let's head back to the
carpenter<00:02:46.410> so<00:02:47.340> we'll<00:02:47.580> make<00:02:47.730> our<00:02:48.000> iodine

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
carpenter so we'll make our iodine

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.670 
carpenter so we'll make our iodine
capsule<00:02:49.290> first<00:02:49.500> with<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.610> can<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.360> middle

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
capsule first with the can in the middle

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.920 
capsule first with the can in the middle
we<00:02:52.680> will<00:02:52.710> have<00:02:53.040> our<00:02:53.070> pollen<00:02:53.640> north<00:02:54.270> east<00:02:54.450> south

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
we will have our pollen north east south

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.550 
we will have our pollen north east south
and<00:02:54.990> west<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:56.610> honey<00:02:56.880> drop<00:02:57.180> will<00:02:57.570> go<00:02:57.810> in<00:02:58.140> the

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
and west the honey drop will go in the

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.240 
and west the honey drop will go in the
top<00:02:59.010> two<00:02:59.310> corners<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.320> gunpowder<00:03:01.320> in<00:03:01.740> the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
top two corners and gunpowder in the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.550 
top two corners and gunpowder in the
bottom<00:03:02.910> two<00:03:02.940> corners<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.690> that<00:03:04.230> will<00:03:04.410> produce

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
bottom two corners and that will produce

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.210 
bottom two corners and that will produce
for<00:03:04.950> us<00:03:04.980> an<00:03:05.730> iodine<00:03:06.270> capsule<00:03:06.930> so<00:03:07.830> let's<00:03:08.010> pop

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
for us an iodine capsule so let's pop

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.180 
for us an iodine capsule so let's pop
that<00:03:08.430> down<00:03:08.460> and<00:03:09.470> we'll<00:03:10.470> leave<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:10.980> same

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
that down and we'll leave the same

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.010 
that down and we'll leave the same
recipe<00:03:11.580> there<00:03:11.730> because<00:03:12.060> it's<00:03:12.300> almost<00:03:12.750> the

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
recipe there because it's almost the

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.200 
recipe there because it's almost the
same<00:03:13.230> except<00:03:14.130> what<00:03:14.310> we<00:03:14.430> want<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:14.760> do<00:03:14.910> here<00:03:14.940> is

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
same except what we want to do here is

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.460 
same except what we want to do here is
replace<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.960> honey<00:03:16.140> drops<00:03:16.350> for<00:03:17.070> honeydew<00:03:18.060> and

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
replace the honey drops for honeydew and

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.120 
replace the honey drops for honeydew and
replace<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.800> pollen<00:03:20.190> for<00:03:20.640> royal<00:03:21.150> jelly<00:03:21.750> and

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
replace the pollen for royal jelly and

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.500 
replace the pollen for royal jelly and
that<00:03:23.130> gives<00:03:23.310> us<00:03:23.490> the<00:03:23.640> recipe<00:03:23.820> it's<00:03:24.300> not<00:03:24.420> going

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
that gives us the recipe it's not going

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.090 
that gives us the recipe it's not going
to<00:03:24.660> shows<00:03:24.840> what<00:03:25.020> it<00:03:25.110> is<00:03:25.230> so<00:03:25.380> let's<00:03:25.410> put<00:03:25.770> in<00:03:25.920> the

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
to shows what it is so let's put in the

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.199 
to shows what it is so let's put in the
gunpowder<00:03:26.580> and<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:27.209> empty<00:03:27.570> can<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:29.209> that

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
gunpowder and the empty can and that

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.350 
gunpowder and the empty can and that
will<00:03:30.330> give<00:03:30.540> us<00:03:30.570> our<00:03:30.900> dissipation<00:03:31.860> charge<00:03:32.360> so

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
will give us our dissipation charge so

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.630 
will give us our dissipation charge so
there<00:03:33.810> we<00:03:34.020> go<00:03:34.050> we<00:03:34.500> have<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.800> two<00:03:34.980> things<00:03:35.310> that

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
there we go we have the two things that

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.970 
there we go we have the two things that
we<00:03:36.030> need<00:03:36.240> to<00:03:36.510> power<00:03:36.959> this<00:03:37.170> so<00:03:37.440> let's<00:03:37.740> head<00:03:37.920> on

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
we need to power this so let's head on

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.830 
we need to power this so let's head on
the<00:03:38.100> outside<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:38.700> see<00:03:39.209> what<00:03:39.390> we<00:03:39.510> can<00:03:39.630> do<00:03:39.750> with

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
the outside and see what we can do with

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.280 
the outside and see what we can do with
it<00:03:40.760> so<00:03:41.760> I<00:03:41.790> want<00:03:42.180> to<00:03:42.300> place<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.660> down<00:03:42.780> over<00:03:43.140> here

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
it so I want to place it down over here

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.530 
it so I want to place it down over here
near<00:03:43.650> my<00:03:43.800> bees<00:03:44.040> but<00:03:44.520> not<00:03:44.730> too<00:03:44.940> close<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.390> them

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
near my bees but not too close to them

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.199 
near my bees but not too close to them
so<00:03:45.720> i<00:03:45.750> think<00:03:45.840> i<00:03:46.140> will<00:03:46.200> pop<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:46.800> up<00:03:46.920> here<00:03:47.400> on<00:03:47.640> this

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
so i think i will pop it up here on this

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.640 
so i think i will pop it up here on this
little<00:03:48.450> Ridge<00:03:48.750> that<00:03:49.050> doesn't<00:03:49.320> seem<00:03:49.470> too<00:03:49.620> bad

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
little Ridge that doesn't seem too bad

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.100 
little Ridge that doesn't seem too bad
so<00:03:50.459> just<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.790> right<00:03:51.000> click<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.300> pop<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.690> down<00:03:51.870> now

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
so just a right click to pop it down now

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.810 
so just a right click to pop it down now
if<00:03:52.320> I<00:03:52.709> right<00:03:52.920> click<00:03:52.950> on<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.489> you'll<00:03:53.610> see

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
if I right click on it you'll see

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.270 
if I right click on it you'll see
nothing<00:03:54.180> happens<00:03:54.600> and<00:03:54.870> that's<00:03:54.959> because<00:03:55.280> it

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
nothing happens and that's because it

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.040 
nothing happens and that's because it
doesn't<00:03:56.610> have<00:03:56.730> an<00:03:56.820> interface<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.810> can't

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
doesn't have an interface you can't

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.990 
doesn't have an interface you can't
interact<00:03:58.410> with<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:58.770> in<00:03:58.890> any<00:03:58.980> way<00:03:59.100> you<00:03:59.760> can't

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
interact with it in any way you can't

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.699 
interact with it in any way you can't
pipe<00:04:00.239> anything<00:04:00.720> in<00:04:00.930> and<00:04:01.050> out<00:04:01.140> of<00:04:01.320> it<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:01.590> it

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
pipe anything in and out of it and it

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.680 
pipe anything in and out of it and it
doesn't<00:04:01.980> require<00:04:02.130> power<00:04:02.580> it<00:04:02.910> just<00:04:03.390> sits<00:04:03.600> there

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
doesn't require power it just sits there

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.510 
doesn't require power it just sits there
on<00:04:03.959> its<00:04:04.110> own<00:04:04.290> what<00:04:05.070> you<00:04:05.160> need<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.340> do<00:04:05.489> to

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
on its own what you need to do to

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.180 
on its own what you need to do to
activate<00:04:05.880> it<00:04:06.209> is<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:06.750> take<00:04:06.930> either<00:04:07.709> your

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
activate it is to take either your

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.540 
activate it is to take either your
iodine<00:04:09.180> or<00:04:09.510> your<00:04:10.170> dissipation<00:04:10.770> charge<00:04:11.040> so

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
iodine or your dissipation charge so

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.240 
iodine or your dissipation charge so
take<00:04:12.239> the<00:04:12.360> iodine<00:04:12.690> capsule<00:04:13.110> and<00:04:13.230> right<00:04:14.070> click

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
take the iodine capsule and right click

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.979 
take the iodine capsule and right click
on<00:04:14.430> it<00:04:14.489> now<00:04:15.180> you'll<00:04:15.330> see<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:15.630> capsules

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
on it now you'll see the capsules

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.840 
on it now you'll see the capsules
disappeared<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:16.709> the<00:04:17.310> Rainmaker<00:04:17.700> is

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
disappeared and the Rainmaker is

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.180 
disappeared and the Rainmaker is
starting<00:04:18.239> to<00:04:18.330> do<00:04:18.480> something<00:04:18.930> it's<00:04:19.739> pumping

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
starting to do something it's pumping

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.010 
starting to do something it's pumping
out<00:04:20.340> on<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:21.150> sides<00:04:21.390> you<00:04:21.570> can<00:04:21.720> see<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:21.900> little

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
out on the sides you can see the little

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.770 
out on the sides you can see the little
animation<00:04:22.590> and<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:23.460> bar<00:04:23.669> is<00:04:23.700> going<00:04:24.150> up<00:04:24.300> it

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
animation and the bar is going up it

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.510 
animation and the bar is going up it
does<00:04:24.990> take<00:04:25.169> about<00:04:25.260> 30<00:04:25.650> seconds<00:04:26.130> so

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
does take about 30 seconds so

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:35.029 
does take about 30 seconds so
I'll<00:04:27.030> cut<00:04:27.330> to<00:04:27.360> where<00:04:27.599> it<00:04:27.720> needs<00:04:27.750> to<00:04:27.990> go<00:04:33.740> and<00:04:34.740> as

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
I'll cut to where it needs to go and as

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:37.010 
I'll cut to where it needs to go and as
you<00:04:35.159> can<00:04:35.310> see<00:04:35.340> when<00:04:35.729> it<00:04:35.849> gets<00:04:36.060> to<00:04:36.419> the<00:04:36.599> full

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
you can see when it gets to the full

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.520 
you can see when it gets to the full
charge<00:04:37.379> and<00:04:37.740> turns<00:04:38.039> green<00:04:38.370> it<00:04:39.270> disappears<00:04:39.870> the

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
charge and turns green it disappears the

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.300 
charge and turns green it disappears the
animation<00:04:41.069> stops<00:04:41.479> and<00:04:42.479> we<00:04:42.659> have<00:04:42.870> rain<00:04:43.190> as<00:04:44.190> you

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
animation stops and we have rain as you

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.240 
animation stops and we have rain as you
can<00:04:44.430> see<00:04:44.840> all<00:04:45.840> of<00:04:45.900> my<00:04:46.169> bees<00:04:46.470> that<00:04:46.770> were<00:04:47.069> busily

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
can see all of my bees that were busily

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.330 
can see all of my bees that were busily
working<00:04:47.520> away<00:04:48.319> have<00:04:49.319> stopped<00:04:49.650> they've<00:04:50.190> all

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
working away have stopped they've all

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.050 
working away have stopped they've all
gone<00:04:50.460> in<00:04:51.020> so<00:04:52.020> I<00:04:52.259> actually<00:04:53.099> see<00:04:53.490> there<00:04:53.729> in<00:04:53.940> the

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
gone in so I actually see there in the

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.230 
gone in so I actually see there in the
top<00:04:54.210> corner<00:04:54.419> rain<00:04:56.000> operation<00:04:57.000> is<00:04:57.090> only

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
top corner rain operation is only

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.420 
top corner rain operation is only
possible<00:04:57.479> when<00:04:57.990> it<00:04:58.139> is<00:04:58.229> not<00:04:58.470> raining<00:04:58.710> because

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
possible when it is not raining because

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.180 
possible when it is not raining because
my<00:04:59.669> bees<00:04:59.819> don't<00:05:00.060> have<00:05:00.180> flyer<00:05:00.650> so<00:05:01.650> in<00:05:01.949> order<00:05:02.039> to

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
my bees don't have flyer so in order to

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.920 
my bees don't have flyer so in order to
reverse<00:05:02.490> the<00:05:02.669> process<00:05:02.819> we<00:05:03.479> take<00:05:03.750> our

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
reverse the process we take our

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.890 
reverse the process we take our
dissipation<00:05:04.710> charge<00:05:04.949> and<00:05:05.220> I<00:05:05.940> click<00:05:06.690> again

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
dissipation charge and I click again

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.140 
dissipation charge and I click again
same<00:05:07.710> process<00:05:08.069> as<00:05:08.099> before<00:05:08.220> the<00:05:08.789> sides<00:05:09.030> are

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
same process as before the sides are

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.180 
same process as before the sides are
pumping<00:05:09.539> lot<00:05:10.139> quicker<00:05:10.380> this<00:05:10.560> time<00:05:10.770> didn't

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
pumping lot quicker this time didn't

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.890 
pumping lot quicker this time didn't
even<00:05:11.400> need<00:05:11.490> to<00:05:11.639> edit<00:05:11.759> that<00:05:11.940> just<00:05:12.599> takes<00:05:12.750> a<00:05:12.870> few

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
even need to edit that just takes a few

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.290 
even need to edit that just takes a few
seconds<00:05:13.470> for<00:05:13.650> that<00:05:14.099> to<00:05:14.250> work<00:05:14.280> and<00:05:14.759> then

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
seconds for that to work and then

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.249 
seconds for that to work and then
hopefully<00:05:15.780> the<00:05:16.620> rain<00:05:16.800> will<00:05:16.860> stop<00:05:18.050> and<00:05:19.050> there

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 
hopefully the rain will stop and there

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.010 
hopefully the rain will stop and there
we<00:05:19.380> go<00:05:19.409> it<00:05:19.830> is<00:05:19.979> now<00:05:20.130> stopped<00:05:20.430> raining<00:05:20.900> and<00:05:21.900> the

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
we go it is now stopped raining and the

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.499 
we go it is now stopped raining and the
bees<00:05:22.199> are<00:05:22.229> returning<00:05:22.740> to<00:05:22.860> work<00:05:23.030> so<00:05:24.030> we<00:05:24.360> now

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
bees are returning to work so we now

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:27.499 
bees are returning to work so we now
have<00:05:24.539> a<00:05:24.750> way<00:05:24.840> of<00:05:25.259> making<00:05:25.860> it<00:05:25.979> rain<00:05:26.159> and<00:05:26.509> making

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:27.509 
have a way of making it rain and making

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:29.839 
have a way of making it rain and making
it<00:05:27.569> stop<00:05:27.840> rain<00:05:28.080> and<00:05:28.349> you<00:05:29.069> can<00:05:29.219> even<00:05:29.340> stop<00:05:29.699> the

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:29.849 
it stop rain and you can even stop the

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:31.969 
it stop rain and you can even stop the
rain<00:05:30.000> if<00:05:30.270> it's<00:05:30.449> natural<00:05:30.870> rain<00:05:31.080> so<00:05:31.380> you<00:05:31.800> don't

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
rain if it's natural rain so you don't

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.040 
rain if it's natural rain so you don't
have<00:05:32.130> to<00:05:32.310> worry<00:05:32.490> about<00:05:32.669> rain<00:05:33.180> that<00:05:33.509> you've

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
have to worry about rain that you've

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.809 
have to worry about rain that you've
created<00:05:34.289> yourself<00:05:34.590> if<00:05:35.069> it<00:05:35.430> starts<00:05:35.639> raining

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:35.819 
created yourself if it starts raining
