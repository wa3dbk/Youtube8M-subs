testing<00:00:15.629> is<00:00:16.049> an<00:00:16.200> absolutely<00:00:16.830> key<00:00:17.610> part<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.180> the

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
testing is an absolutely key part of the

testing is an absolutely key part of the
whole<00:00:18.480> process<00:00:18.780> in<00:00:19.530> our<00:00:19.740> process<00:00:20.280> there's

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
whole process in our process there's

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.690 
whole process in our process there's
really<00:00:20.930> continuous<00:00:21.930> cycles<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:23.010> testing<00:00:23.490> and

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 
really continuous cycles of testing and

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.910 
really continuous cycles of testing and
testing<00:00:24.600> at<00:00:24.690> different<00:00:25.050> levels<00:00:25.410> in<00:00:25.860> the

testing at different levels in the
product<00:00:26.460> process<00:00:26.970> testing<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.570> very

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
product process testing is very

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.250 
product process testing is very
important<00:00:28.620> for<00:00:28.800> Bower<00:00:29.040> as<00:00:30.030> we<00:00:30.450> go<00:00:30.660> on<00:00:30.870> year

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
important for Bower as we go on year

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.470 
important for Bower as we go on year
after<00:00:31.500> year<00:00:31.680> we're<00:00:32.099> putting<00:00:32.489> more<00:00:32.700> product<00:00:33.360> on

after year we're putting more product on
the<00:00:33.570> market<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:34.380> don't<00:00:34.620> go<00:00:34.890> with<00:00:35.490> a<00:00:35.550> product<00:00:35.940> on

the products once we get into the actual
development<00:00:42.120> process<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.530> testing<00:00:43.980> becomes

development process the testing becomes

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.360 
development process the testing becomes
the<00:00:44.820> really<00:00:45.540> the<00:00:46.170> driving<00:00:46.470> force<00:00:46.620> behind

iteration and develop some samples we
get<00:00:54.720> them<00:00:54.900> out<00:00:55.020> there<00:00:55.260> we'll<00:00:55.530> test<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.280> lab

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
get them out there we'll test in the lab

and<00:00:56.820> we'll<00:00:57.540> also<00:00:57.720> test<00:00:58.310> very<00:00:59.310> importantly<00:00:59.760> on

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
and we'll also test very importantly on

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.120 
and we'll also test very importantly on
