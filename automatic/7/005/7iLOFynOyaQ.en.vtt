00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.470
 yes 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.290
 all right 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.150
 greetings and welcome my name is 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:23.310
 Rachel this is the nail art in which 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.529
 we're going to be working now let's start 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.330
 for the first design I started by applying 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.699
 well back in blue now I'm 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.949
 using a beige color and nothing else 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.140
 I'm painting a thick line in the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.960
 center of my nail and it's not a line 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.579
 not clear once you dry everything down 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.140
 full I'm coming in with a glaze 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.809
 in purple and nothing else doing 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.660
 spots in the corners of the lines 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.400
 white on the sides and I'm also going to 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.570
 enter with a blue color in a tone 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.420
 medium and nothing more 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.739
 highlighting the areas outside the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.720
 beige line 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.690
 now with a blue glaze on a 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.510
 low tone I'm also nothing more 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.729
 filling in certain areas I will enter 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.860
 with a turquoise enamel and nothing 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.860
 more I am applying it on the enamel 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.710
 in darker blue and now between 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.890
 means of design I will be applying 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.479
 some glitter in copper color 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.000
 once everything has dried by 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.760
 full I'm entering the part of the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.610
 center where he had originally painted 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.760
 with the beige color and I'm doing 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.159
 brown spots that are going to be my 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.950
 leopard spots and they're pretty 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.110
 big now I will enter with a color 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.000
 black along with my brush to detail 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.729
 and nothing else I will be delineating the 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.340
 surroundings of my brown spots but not 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.909
 an outlined all around nothing else 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.830
 certain areas and I want each one to be 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.020
 different in between my employer 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.899
 Leopard I'll be painting spots 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.660
 in black now not many more 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.180
 a little bit this step that follows is 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.580
 optional I'm using glitters in 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.500
 blue color and nothing else I am 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.220
 Applying also between the pattern 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.470
 random leopard 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.229
 to finish with this first design of 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.670
 nothing else apply your gloss coat this 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.820
 it will also help to make them look good 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.620
 little glitter and that's it 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.200
 Now let's move to the design that 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.910
 follow this design I also started it by 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.680
 apply the enamel in blue and 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.170
 I'm just running a glaze 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.540
 clear in the center of the nail so that it 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.090
 make for tastes to the surface and so 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.880
 I can apply three crystals and the 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.160
 I'm vertically applying one below 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.280
 from the other now I 'm going to be applying 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.430
 balines in silver color and nothing more 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.220
 I'm applying me four in each of 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.740
 the crystallites one in each corner and I'll 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.840
 to do exactly the same thing with 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.380
 my three crystals to make it look 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.180
 uniform the design to finish with 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.730
 this second design I am applying 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.010
 a clear top layer so they remain 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.410
 well attached the pebbles I like 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.420
 use a top layer with a 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.940
 thick consistency so that of this 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.670
 way I will not fall easily 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.530
 the decorations and that's all this is it 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.340
 how are you going to achieve this art design of 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.019
 nail 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.360
 I hope you enjoyed this 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.060
 video and you like this design 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.220

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.060
 we see for the next goodbye 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.060
