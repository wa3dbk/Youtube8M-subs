00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.150
 hi everyone knows they're 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.040
 back I hope you are well 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.210
 because me it's not cool so 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.640
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.029
 new video of big theft auto on 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.510
 how to pierce the chest in the first 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.369
 robbery 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.990
 so I still suspect that there is 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.210
 many people who have already done this 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.800
 mission and already run people safe 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.460
 when we succeed like that without worry 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.860
 but I also know a lot of people 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.870
 comfort here even a lot actually that 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.210
 failed to break through the trunk they did not 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.820
 have not even done so today we 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.920
 will succeed in piercing it we will give the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.190
 tips for doing it the technique is 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.190
 left 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.300
 we 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.300
 I 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.700
 I 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.670
 g 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.189
 m 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.390
 so what you're going to do is do 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.210
 turn the wick before they touch 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.090
 the lock and then you bring it back just one 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.250
 little bit on the lock so 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.260
 that it touches the lord but without much 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.190
 the strength is actually you're going to do 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.020
 turn the meije gently not too much 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.030
 strong not too fast for not that the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.540
 overheating and you're going the advanced 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.960
 gently not too strong otherwise it's okay 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.130
 also overheated and it looks like it 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.020
 is actually nothing that's something 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.960
 it breaks anyway and that's the 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.420
 technique after you found yourself 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.820
 with my sister is open and it's going to be 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.410
 very cool 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.820
 she has as you can see that 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.880
 advance little by little and as soon as that 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.040
 starts to overheat stopped turning 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.860
 a little break and then walk away 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.670
 quickly and not paying attention at all to this 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.750
 that the stars tell you it's you 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.580
 take too much time finally this is 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.110
 anything do you have almost 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.650
 as much time as you finally want 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.930
 almost 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.459
 in fact you have pretty much i would say 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:51.180

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:54.230
 until there is with the bank 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.230
