00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.100 
that very simple you can keep the lips
nude<00:01:26.710> or<00:01:27.010> have<00:01:27.610> a<00:01:27.640> have<00:01:28.299> a<00:01:28.330> red<00:01:28.600> which<00:01:28.810> is<00:01:28.990> what

I'm<00:01:29.229> going<00:01:29.440> to<00:01:29.470> do<00:01:29.650> I<00:01:29.920> think<00:01:30.460> to<00:01:30.670> some<00:01:30.909> people

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
I'm going to do I think to some people

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.300 
I'm going to do I think to some people
think<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.570> smoky<00:01:32.020> eye<00:01:32.049> has<00:01:32.320> to<00:01:32.470> be<00:01:32.620> black<00:01:32.860> but

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
think the smoky eye has to be black but

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.250 
think the smoky eye has to be black but
Brown<00:01:33.549> really<00:01:33.820> is<00:01:34.030> great<00:01:34.480> for<00:01:34.720> smoke<00:01:34.930> it's

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
Brown really is great for smoke it's

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.980 
Brown really is great for smoke it's
much<00:01:35.530> softer<00:01:35.800> yeah

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
much softer yeah

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.680 
much softer yeah
I'm<00:01:38.470> going<00:01:38.680> to<00:01:38.740> use<00:01:38.920> a<00:01:38.950> graphic<00:01:39.400> liner<00:01:39.640> pen<00:01:40.000> I'm

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
I'm going to use a graphic liner pen I'm

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.359 
I'm going to use a graphic liner pen I'm
just<00:01:41.110> going<00:01:41.260> to<00:01:41.320> keep<00:01:41.500> it<00:01:41.770> on<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.220> outer

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
just going to keep it on the outer

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.850 
just going to keep it on the outer
corners<00:01:42.940> of<00:01:42.970> the<00:01:43.210> lid<00:01:43.420> so<00:01:43.930> it's<00:01:44.049> really<00:01:44.350> just<00:01:44.560> a

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
corners of the lid so it's really just a

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.340 
corners of the lid so it's really just a
micro<00:01:45.340> line<00:01:45.580> can<00:01:46.180> you<00:01:46.300> do<00:01:46.450> eyeliner<00:01:46.810> yourself

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
micro line can you do eyeliner yourself

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.460 
micro line can you do eyeliner yourself
Lily<00:01:47.650> it's<00:01:48.520> kind<00:01:48.940> of<00:01:49.000> tricky<00:01:49.270> but<00:01:49.960> I<00:01:50.020> think<00:01:50.320> you

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
Lily it's kind of tricky but I think you

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.680 
Lily it's kind of tricky but I think you
could<00:01:50.740> practice<00:01:51.190> a<00:01:51.220> little<00:01:51.400> bit<00:01:51.640> yeah<00:01:52.000> so<00:01:52.600> I'm

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
could practice a little bit yeah so I'm

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.090 
could practice a little bit yeah so I'm
going<00:01:52.869> to<00:01:52.960> finish<00:01:53.140> off<00:01:53.440> the<00:01:53.590> eye<00:01:53.619> with<00:01:53.950> the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
going to finish off the eye with the

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.420 
going to finish off the eye with the
volume<00:01:54.550> plump<00:01:54.900> mascara<00:01:56.070> it's<00:01:57.070> definitely

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
volume plump mascara it's definitely

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.830 
volume plump mascara it's definitely
something<00:01:57.640> I<00:01:57.790> look<00:01:57.970> for<00:01:58.149> in<00:01:58.210> a<00:01:58.240> mascara<00:01:58.630> is

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
something I look for in a mascara is

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.230 
something I look for in a mascara is
volumizing<00:01:59.619> I'm<00:02:00.220> not<00:02:00.460> going<00:02:00.610> to<00:02:00.670> go<00:02:00.759> too<00:02:00.820> much

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
volumizing I'm not going to go too much

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.719 
volumizing I'm not going to go too much
on<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.680> lashes<00:02:02.680> just<00:02:02.950> because<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.369> eyes<00:02:03.490> are

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
on the lashes just because the eyes are

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.990 
on the lashes just because the eyes are
quite<00:02:03.850> dramatic

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.910
