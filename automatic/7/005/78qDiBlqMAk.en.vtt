00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.349
 I already open my eyes they gave me the truck 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:10.549
 We know you love driving 

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:12.559
 incredible for me life was like a 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.389
 machine the university in autumn children to 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.889
 the 30 all figured I know it sounds 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.889
 boring but I like it that way 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:25.210
 I would do it with her all day long hear that 's 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.739
 it 's normal that we pass the 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.609
 adolescence without having gone to a 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.949
 true party 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:32.810
 we have gone to many parties not if someone 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.580
 touches the tuba is not a party 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.430
 from the moment I saw bitter rock 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.350
 spiegelman I fell in love like a long blog 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.340
 and we cried almost unknown until 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.010
 one night 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.020
 bruque then you have to lend me your 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.790
 self that I have nine things to do 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.840
 tonight and more than half require 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.840
 a driver's life 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.310
 my boyfriend has been cheating on me 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.620
 the revenge plan 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.620
 it's not as strange as you think if it is 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.390
 I will come out that's what you should feel 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.939
 your whole life is beautiful is a city of 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.619
 paper paper houses and paper people 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:21.600
 Margo loved the mysteries maybe he 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:25.570
 they liked it so much that it became one 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.979
 He left when he saw him last 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.030
 and where was Junichi because not with me 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.950
 You were with her on her last night 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.079
 that must have relevance 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.939
 they were the best 30 seconds of me 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:42.920
 life I found something a direction some 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.159
 he told you something about a building 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.860
 abandoned yet guys I looked towards the 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.780
 paper cities and you'll never come back with 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.610
 the last time I got scared so sleep 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.200
 in my mom's bed in your place 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.969
 I would scare every night 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.070
 we had never tried the school 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:03.530
 I feel bad I also feel bad but 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.110
 at the same time I feel good 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.970
 take risks, stop playing it safe 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.800

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.800

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.569
