example and heat transfer to radiation
now<00:00:05.100> we're<00:00:05.279> going<00:00:05.430> to<00:00:05.520> talk<00:00:05.790> about<00:00:05.819> the

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
now we're going to talk about the

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.930 
now we're going to talk about the
Earth's<00:00:07.080> equilibrium<00:00:07.950> temperature<00:00:08.189> now<00:00:08.820> of

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
Earth's equilibrium temperature now of

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.180 
Earth's equilibrium temperature now of
course<00:00:09.090> we<00:00:09.330> have<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.599> oversimplify<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.740> model

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
course we have to oversimplify the model

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.530 
course we have to oversimplify the model
because<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.820> earth<00:00:11.940> does<00:00:12.240> have<00:00:12.420> an

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
because the earth does have an

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.720 
because the earth does have an
atmosphere<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.650> atmosphere<00:00:14.040> does<00:00:14.340> tend

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
atmosphere and the atmosphere does tend

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.609 
atmosphere and the atmosphere does tend
to<00:00:14.880> retain<00:00:15.059> heat<00:00:15.570> but<00:00:16.080> if<00:00:16.170> we<00:00:16.289> ignore<00:00:16.410> that

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
to retain heat but if we ignore that

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.010 
to retain heat but if we ignore that
aspect<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:17.609> what<00:00:18.090> would<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.449> temperature

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
aspect of it what would the temperature

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.650 
aspect of it what would the temperature
of<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.199> world<00:00:19.380> be<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.070> earth<00:00:20.189> be<00:00:20.430> if<00:00:20.880> we

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
of the world be of the earth be if we

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.870 
of the world be of the earth be if we
simply<00:00:22.109> look<00:00:22.320> at<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.680> from<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:23.010> simple

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
simply look at it from a simple

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.660 
simply look at it from a simple
perspective<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.630> radiation<00:00:25.230> yurts<00:00:26.010> shining

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
energy from the Sun and then the energy

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.650 
energy from the Sun and then the energy
being<00:00:31.470> radiated<00:00:31.740> out<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.610> all<00:00:32.759> directions<00:00:32.969> at

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
being radiated out in all directions at

being radiated out in all directions at
all<00:00:33.809> times<00:00:34.200> into<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.100> universe<00:00:36.290> what<00:00:37.290> would

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
all times into the universe what would

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.959 
all times into the universe what would
temporary<00:00:37.950> or<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.129> be<00:00:38.250> if<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.520> was<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.790> case

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
temporary or it be if that was the case

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:39.560 
temporary or it be if that was the case
again

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
again

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.650 
again
we<00:00:39.899> can<00:00:40.079> say<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> DQ<00:00:40.950> DT<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:42.239> equal<00:00:42.629> to

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
we can say that the DQ DT is equal to

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.990 
we can say that the DQ DT is equal to
the<00:00:43.079> emissivity<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.100> for<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> earth<00:00:44.789> that's

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
the emissivity and for the earth that's

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.350 
the emissivity and for the earth that's
probably<00:00:45.329> about<00:00:45.539> 0.9<00:00:46.550> Sigma<00:00:47.550> times<00:00:48.180> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
probably about 0.9 Sigma times the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.389 
probably about 0.9 Sigma times the
surface<00:00:48.570> area<00:00:48.870> times<00:00:49.500> temperature<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
surface area times temperature to the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.540 
surface area times temperature to the
fourth<00:00:50.670> power<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.329> now<00:00:52.079> let's<00:00:52.350> see<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:53.340> can

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
fourth power and now let's see we can

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.760 
fourth power and now let's see we can
then<00:00:53.760> go<00:00:54.059> ahead<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.570> calculate<00:00:55.230> how<00:00:55.469> much

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
then go ahead and calculate how much

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.590 
then go ahead and calculate how much
energy<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.430> earth<00:00:56.610> receives<00:00:57.090> from<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.449> Sun

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
energy the earth receives from the Sun

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.340 
energy the earth receives from the Sun
now<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.680> course<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.160> can<00:00:59.309> see<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.760> the

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
now of course you can see that the

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.450 
now of course you can see that the
portions<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.649> earth<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.250> they're

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
portions of the earth that they're

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.740 
portions of the earth that they're
pointing<00:01:02.879> directly<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.449> Sun<00:01:03.600> they

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
pointing directly to the Sun they

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.329 
pointing directly to the Sun they
receive<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.110> whole<00:01:04.379> lot<00:01:04.559> more<00:01:04.710> energy<00:01:05.159> than

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
receive a whole lot more energy than

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.340 
receive a whole lot more energy than
portions<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.270> are<00:01:06.330> here<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.720> side<00:01:07.049> where

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
portions that are here on the side where

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.050 
portions that are here on the side where
they<00:01:07.470> just<00:01:07.680> come<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.340> get<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.520> little<00:01:08.820> bit<00:01:08.939> of

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
they just come and get a little bit of

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.789 
they just come and get a little bit of
the<00:01:09.150> energy<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> Sun<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.200> we<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.470> kind<00:01:10.710> of

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
the energy of the Sun but we can kind of

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.070 
the energy of the Sun but we can kind of
average<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.280> out<00:01:11.400> we<00:01:11.820> can<00:01:11.970> assume<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.810> if<00:01:12.930> we

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
average it out we can assume that if we

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.590 
average it out we can assume that if we
were<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.619> cut<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.010> earth<00:01:14.220> open<00:01:14.880> like<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.270> and

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
were to cut the earth open like this and

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.140 
were to cut the earth open like this and
we<00:01:16.229> had<00:01:16.380> all<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> energy<00:01:17.009> received<00:01:17.189> on<00:01:17.700> that

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
we had all the energy received on that

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.969 
we had all the energy received on that
flat<00:01:18.540> surface<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.290> cross<00:01:19.470> section<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
flat surface of the cross section of the

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.440 
flat surface of the cross section of the
earth<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.280> would<00:01:20.400> be<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.700> same<00:01:20.970> amount<00:01:21.150> as

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
earth that would be the same amount as

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.960 
earth that would be the same amount as
would<00:01:21.930> be<00:01:21.960> distributed<00:01:22.740> over<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.130> semi<00:01:23.549> sphere

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
would be distributed over a semi sphere

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.030 
would be distributed over a semi sphere
so<00:01:24.540> what<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:24.810> can<00:01:24.990> say<00:01:25.229> then<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
so what we can say then is that the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.910 
so what we can say then is that the
total<00:01:26.670> energy<00:01:26.909> energy<00:01:27.840> received<00:01:28.560> from<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
total energy energy received from the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.819 
total energy energy received from the
Sun<00:01:29.689> is<00:01:30.689> equal<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.829> energy<00:01:32.450> per<00:01:33.450> unit<00:01:34.140> area

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
Sun is equal to the energy per unit area

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.499 
Sun is equal to the energy per unit area
times<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:37.140> area<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.220> Sun<00:01:38.460> all<00:01:39.030> right<00:01:39.240> so

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
times the area of the Sun all right so

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.450 
times the area of the Sun all right so
maybe<00:01:39.869> we'll<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.470> write<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.250> like<00:01:41.400> this

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
maybe we'll just write it like this

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.660 
maybe we'll just write it like this
energy<00:01:42.180> per<00:01:42.450> unit<00:01:42.509> area<00:01:42.960> times<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:44.159> total

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
energy per unit area times the total

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.389 
energy per unit area times the total
area<00:01:45.020> where<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.229> light<00:01:46.439> shines<00:01:46.470> if<00:01:47.159> we<00:01:47.310> were

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
area where the light shines if we were

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.830 
area where the light shines if we were
to<00:01:47.579> cut<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.909> earth<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.299> half<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.750> we<00:01:48.810> have

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
to cut the earth in half and we have

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.950 
to cut the earth in half and we have
this<00:01:49.110> flat<00:01:49.380> surface<00:01:49.850> all<00:01:50.850> right<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.509> energy

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
this flat surface all right the energy

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.690 
this flat surface all right the energy
that<00:01:52.079> we<00:01:52.259> receive<00:01:52.530> per<00:01:52.799> unit<00:01:53.070> area<00:01:53.220> that's

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
that we receive per unit area that's

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.120 
that we receive per unit area that's
about<00:01:54.149> thirteen<00:01:54.840> hundred<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.259> sixty-one

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
about thirteen hundred and sixty-one

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.139 
about thirteen hundred and sixty-one
watts<00:01:56.820> per<00:01:57.270> square<00:01:57.810> meter<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.680> know<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.060> a

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
watts per square meter I know that in a

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.700 
watts per square meter I know that in a
previous<00:02:00.509> example<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.990> number<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.469> we<00:02:01.560> got

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
previous example the number that we got

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.200 
previous example the number that we got
was<00:02:01.920> slightly<00:02:02.159> different<00:02:02.670> from<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:02.969> but

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
was slightly different from that but

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.190 
was slightly different from that but
that's<00:02:03.420> because<00:02:03.659> there's<00:02:03.990> some<00:02:04.110> other

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
that's because there's some other

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.350 
that's because there's some other
factors<00:02:04.710> we<00:02:04.829> have<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.979> consider<00:02:05.100> at<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.119> rate

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
factors we have to consider at this rate

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.119 
factors we have to consider at this rate
this<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.630> about<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.200> energy<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.680> we<00:02:07.860> measure

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
this is about the energy that we measure

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.249 
this is about the energy that we measure
out<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:08.700> space<00:02:09.000> just<00:02:09.629> above<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.080> Earth's

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
out in space just above the Earth's

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.600 
out in space just above the Earth's
atmosphere<00:02:10.410> that's<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.220> amount<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.489> energy

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
atmosphere that's the amount of energy

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.949 
atmosphere that's the amount of energy
that<00:02:12.270> we<00:02:12.450> receive<00:02:12.840> from<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.050> Sun

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
that we receive from the Sun

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.140 
that we receive from the Sun
meter<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.680> if<00:02:14.920> we<00:02:15.040> then<00:02:15.159> multiply<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:15.790> times

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
meter and if we then multiply that times

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.360 
meter and if we then multiply that times
the<00:02:16.390> cross-section<00:02:17.260> of<00:02:17.349> the<00:02:17.469> earth<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:18.189> would

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
the cross-section of the earth the would

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.880 
the cross-section of the earth the would
be<00:02:18.519> PI<00:02:18.790> R<00:02:19.180> squared<00:02:19.780> then<00:02:20.379> we<00:02:20.409> can<00:02:20.620> get<00:02:20.739> the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
be PI R squared then we can get the

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.899 
be PI R squared then we can get the
total<00:02:21.189> energy<00:02:21.340> received<00:02:21.969> on<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.689> earth<00:02:22.840> and

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
total energy received on the earth and

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:28.500 
total energy received on the earth and
so<00:02:24.909> this<00:02:25.090> is<00:02:25.239> equal<00:02:25.269> to<00:02:26.250> let's<00:02:27.250> see<00:02:27.340> here

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
so this is equal to let's see here

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.080 
so this is equal to let's see here
thirteen<00:02:29.200> hundred<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.680> sixty-one<00:02:30.159> watts<00:02:30.700> per

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
thirteen hundred and sixty-one watts per

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.069 
thirteen hundred and sixty-one watts per
square<00:02:31.299> meter<00:02:32.069> times<00:02:33.069> pi<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:33.879> times<00:02:34.870> the

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
square meter times pi and times the

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.300 
square meter times pi and times the
radius<00:02:35.379> of<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.590> earth<00:02:35.650> which<00:02:35.920> is<00:02:35.950> six

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
radius of the earth which is six

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.619 
radius of the earth which is six
thousand<00:02:36.760> three<00:02:36.879> hundred<00:02:36.969> and<00:02:37.209> seventy<00:02:37.599> eight

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
thousand three hundred and seventy eight

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.740 
thousand three hundred and seventy eight
kilometers<00:02:38.409> or<00:02:38.620> six<00:02:39.129> million<00:02:39.489> seven<00:02:40.389> three

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
kilometers or six million seven three

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.170 
kilometers or six million seven three
hundred<00:02:41.019> and<00:02:41.109> seventy<00:02:41.409> eight<00:02:41.439> million<00:02:42.280> meters

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
hundred and seventy eight million meters

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.319 
hundred and seventy eight million meters
so<00:02:43.540> don't<00:02:44.049> forget<00:02:44.139> the<00:02:44.379> meters<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:45.180> would<00:02:46.180> be

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
so don't forget the meters that would be

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.390 
so don't forget the meters that would be
down<00:02:46.480> meters<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.319> we<00:02:47.709> have<00:02:47.829> to<00:02:47.980> square<00:02:48.220> that

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
down meters and we have to square that

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.429 
down meters and we have to square that
so<00:02:48.579> that's<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.970> radius<00:02:49.540> of<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.019> earth<00:02:50.049> in

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:50.439 
so that's the radius of the earth in

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.520 
so that's the radius of the earth in
meters<00:02:51.569> so<00:02:52.569> let's<00:02:52.780> see<00:02:52.930> what<00:02:53.049> we<00:02:53.139> get

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
meters so let's see what we get

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.140 
meters so let's see what we get
that<00:02:54.069> would<00:02:54.189> be<00:02:54.359> 1361<00:02:55.359> times<00:02:56.290> pi<00:02:56.769> times<00:02:57.150> six

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
that would be 1361 times pi times six

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.959 
that would be 1361 times pi times six
three<00:02:58.689> seven<00:02:59.019> eight<00:02:59.290> zero<00:02:59.829> zero<00:03:00.069> zero<00:03:00.129> squared

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:00.969 
three seven eight zero zero zero squared

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:03.929 
three seven eight zero zero zero squared
equals<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:02.109> so<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.889> total<00:03:03.250> amount<00:03:03.459> of<00:03:03.549> energy

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:03.939 
equals and so the total amount of energy

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:06.270 
equals and so the total amount of energy
received<00:03:04.090> in<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.540> Sun<00:03:04.780> per<00:03:05.109> second<00:03:05.560> is<00:03:05.650> one

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
received in the Sun per second is one

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.979 
received in the Sun per second is one
point<00:03:06.760> seven<00:03:07.450> four<00:03:07.840> times<00:03:08.590> ten<00:03:09.099> to<00:03:09.819> the

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
point seven four times ten to the

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.039 
point seven four times ten to the
seventeenth<00:03:10.989> watts

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
seventeenth watts

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.050 
seventeenth watts
that's<00:03:14.049> joules<00:03:14.439> per<00:03:14.560> second<00:03:15.040> all<00:03:15.639> right

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
that's joules per second all right

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.580 
that's joules per second all right
now<00:03:16.540> we've<00:03:16.780> want<00:03:17.019> to<00:03:17.139> find<00:03:17.319> the<00:03:17.409> equilibrium

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
now we've want to find the equilibrium

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.229 
now we've want to find the equilibrium
temperature<00:03:18.069> we<00:03:18.489> can<00:03:18.669> go<00:03:18.790> ahead<00:03:18.849> and<00:03:19.060> take

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
temperature we can go ahead and take

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.809 
temperature we can go ahead and take
that<00:03:19.269> number<00:03:20.079> and<00:03:20.409> plug<00:03:20.739> it<00:03:20.919> back<00:03:20.949> into<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.459> DQ

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
that number and plug it back into the DQ

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.569 
that number and plug it back into the DQ
DT<00:03:22.120> so<00:03:22.720> this<00:03:22.900> goes<00:03:23.139> back<00:03:23.169> in<00:03:23.620> here<00:03:23.949> that's<00:03:24.459> the

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
DT so this goes back in here that's the

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.369 
DT so this goes back in here that's the
acuity<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:25.209> then<00:03:25.569> we<00:03:25.659> could<00:03:25.810> solve<00:03:26.019> for<00:03:26.139> the

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
acuity and then we could solve for the

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.469 
acuity and then we could solve for the
temperature<00:03:26.680> of<00:03:26.979> the<00:03:27.069> earth<00:03:27.190> would<00:03:27.430> be<00:03:27.489> all

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:28.479 
temperature of the earth would be all

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:30.479 
temperature of the earth would be all
right<00:03:28.690> but<00:03:29.109> now<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.349> area<00:03:29.859> of<00:03:29.949> course<00:03:30.189> is<00:03:30.370> no

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
right but now the area of course is no

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.520 
right but now the area of course is no
longer<00:03:30.790> going<00:03:30.970> to<00:03:31.060> be<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.540> cross-sectional

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
longer going to be the cross-sectional

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.839 
longer going to be the cross-sectional
area<00:03:32.590> of<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:32.829> earth<00:03:32.979> it's<00:03:33.220> not<00:03:33.370> going<00:03:33.669> to<00:03:33.760> be

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
area of the earth it's not going to be

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:35.250 
area of the earth it's not going to be
the<00:03:34.000> total<00:03:34.180> serves<00:03:34.689> they're<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.139> earth

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
the total serves they're the earth

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.379 
the total serves they're the earth
because<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.769> earth<00:03:35.889> re<00:03:36.189> radiates<00:03:36.639> in<00:03:36.879> all

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
because the earth re radiates in all

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.780 
because the earth re radiates in all

right<00:03:42.250> so<00:03:42.549> we<00:03:43.060> write<00:03:43.269> in<00:03:43.389> this<00:03:43.479> equation<00:03:43.959> we

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
right so we write in this equation we

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.869 
right so we write in this equation we

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
could say that temperature is equal to

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
to do is we have to divide that by nine

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.879 
to do is we have to divide that by nine
no<00:05:41.800> divided<00:05:42.219> by<00:05:42.430> five<00:05:42.729> times<00:05:43.539> nine<00:05:43.870> and<00:05:44.259> then

no divided by five times nine and then
add<00:05:45.099> 32<00:05:45.430> to<00:05:45.729> that<00:05:45.879> plus<00:05:46.120> 32<00:05:46.659> and<00:05:46.930> that<00:05:47.409> gives<00:05:47.620> us

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
add 32 to that plus 32 and that gives us

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
is the average temperature of the world

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:57.510 
is the average temperature of the world
but<00:05:54.789> again<00:05:55.690> there's<00:05:56.469> all<00:05:56.680> kinds<00:05:57.039> of<00:05:57.129> factors

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
but again there's all kinds of factors

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.119 
but again there's all kinds of factors
we<00:05:57.669> have<00:05:57.699> to<00:05:57.969> take<00:05:58.150> into<00:05:58.330> play<00:05:58.599> turns<00:05:59.469> out<00:05:59.710> that

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:00.129 
we have to take into play turns out that

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:02.100 
we have to take into play turns out that
we<00:06:00.430> don't<00:06:00.639> receive<00:06:01.120> this<00:06:01.389> kind<00:06:01.690> of<00:06:01.810> energy

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
we don't receive this kind of energy

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.649 
we don't receive this kind of energy
from<00:06:02.500> the<00:06:02.560> earth<00:06:02.830> actually<00:06:03.190> we<00:06:03.969> receive<00:06:04.360> about

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:04.659 
from the earth actually we receive about

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:07.379 
from the earth actually we receive about
half<00:06:05.349> of<00:06:05.379> that<00:06:05.560> so<00:06:06.039> where<00:06:06.219> was<00:06:06.370> I<00:06:06.580> so<00:06:06.940> this<00:06:07.210> is

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
half of that so where was I so this is

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:09.420 
half of that so where was I so this is
the<00:06:07.479> energy<00:06:07.629> that<00:06:07.839> was<00:06:08.199> that<00:06:08.560> is<00:06:08.800> received<00:06:09.250> by

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
the energy that was that is received by

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.059 
the energy that was that is received by
the<00:06:09.460> cloud<00:06:10.000> tops<00:06:10.330> and<00:06:10.629> by<00:06:11.080> the<00:06:11.139> upper<00:06:11.560> portion

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:12.069 
the cloud tops and by the upper portion

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:13.619 
the cloud tops and by the upper portion
of<00:06:12.159> the<00:06:12.250> atmosphere<00:06:12.729> much<00:06:13.300> of<00:06:13.449> it<00:06:13.539> is

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:13.629 
of the atmosphere much of it is

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:15.719 
of the atmosphere much of it is
reflected<00:06:13.839> in<00:06:14.620> back<00:06:15.009> into<00:06:15.219> space<00:06:15.490> without

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729 
reflected in back into space without

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:18.269 
reflected in back into space without
being<00:06:16.120> absorbed<00:06:16.449> by<00:06:16.719> the<00:06:17.440> top<00:06:17.770> of<00:06:17.949> the<00:06:18.039> clouds

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:18.279 
being absorbed by the top of the clouds

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:20.100 
being absorbed by the top of the clouds
by<00:06:18.520> the<00:06:18.580> eyes<00:06:18.849> by<00:06:19.089> the<00:06:19.150> oceans<00:06:19.509> and<00:06:19.659> so<00:06:19.810> forth

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
by the eyes by the oceans and so forth

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.790 
by the eyes by the oceans and so forth
somebody's<00:06:20.949> being<00:06:22.440> reflected<00:06:23.440> or<00:06:23.589> not

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
somebody's being reflected or not

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.379 
somebody's being reflected or not
allowed<00:06:24.219> through<00:06:24.669> because<00:06:25.180> of<00:06:25.300> the

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:25.389 
allowed through because of the

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:27.570 
allowed through because of the
atmosphere<00:06:25.870> and<00:06:26.139> only<00:06:26.620> a<00:06:26.650> portion<00:06:26.710> that<00:06:27.310> gets

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
atmosphere and only a portion that gets

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.879 
atmosphere and only a portion that gets
through<00:06:27.940> so<00:06:28.539> the<00:06:28.900> real<00:06:29.110> numbers<00:06:29.529> would<00:06:29.740> be

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:29.889 
through so the real numbers would be

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.740 
through so the real numbers would be
very<00:06:30.400> different<00:06:30.669> but<00:06:31.089> this<00:06:31.240> is<00:06:31.300> kind<00:06:31.629> of

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
very different but this is kind of

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.390 
very different but this is kind of
interesting<00:06:32.169> when<00:06:32.229> you<00:06:32.349> think<00:06:32.560> about<00:06:32.650> it<00:06:32.949> if

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400 
interesting when you think about it if

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.490 
interesting when you think about it if
we<00:06:33.879> take<00:06:34.240> all<00:06:34.419> the<00:06:34.569> energy<00:06:34.900> received<00:06:35.050> from<00:06:35.349> the

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.500 
we take all the energy received from the

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.040 
we take all the energy received from the
Sun<00:06:35.740> to<00:06:35.860> be<00:06:35.949> 1361<00:06:36.940> watts<00:06:37.149> per<00:06:37.360> square<00:06:37.479> meter<00:06:37.659> we

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
Sun to be 1361 watts per square meter we

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.659 
Sun to be 1361 watts per square meter we
spread<00:06:38.319> that<00:06:38.349> over<00:06:38.500> the<00:06:38.770> earth<00:06:38.919> and<00:06:39.250> then<00:06:39.580> we

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:39.669 
spread that over the earth and then we

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:40.800 
spread that over the earth and then we
understand<00:06:40.209> how<00:06:40.389> much

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810 
understand how much

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.690 
understand how much
the<00:06:41.050> temperature<00:06:41.650> the<00:06:41.770> world<00:06:41.980> how<00:06:42.370> much<00:06:42.520> the

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:42.700 
the temperature the world how much the

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.670 
the temperature the world how much the
earth<00:06:43.000> with<00:06:43.300> them<00:06:43.420> radiates<00:06:43.990> back<00:06:44.020> into<00:06:44.440> space

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
earth with them radiates back into space

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.220 
earth with them radiates back into space
it<00:06:45.160> turns<00:06:45.460> out<00:06:45.700> the<00:06:46.270> approximate<00:06:46.870> number<00:06:46.900> we

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.230 
it turns out the approximate number we

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.260 
it turns out the approximate number we
get<00:06:47.380> is<00:06:47.710> very<00:06:47.980> very<00:06:48.400> close<00:06:48.670> to<00:06:48.730> the<00:06:49.000> average

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
get is very very close to the average

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.880 
get is very very close to the average
temperature<00:06:49.660> of<00:06:49.690> the<00:06:49.870> world<00:06:50.020> so<00:06:50.500> you<00:06:50.590> can<00:06:50.740> see

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:50.890 
temperature of the world so you can see

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.020 
temperature of the world so you can see
that<00:06:51.070> there's<00:06:51.370> kind<00:06:51.550> of<00:06:51.700> eight<00:06:51.850> and

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.030 
that there's kind of eight and

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.210 
that there's kind of eight and
equilibrium<00:06:52.990> status<00:06:53.440> that<00:06:53.590> they<00:06:53.740> will<00:06:54.040> take

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.220 
equilibrium status that they will take

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.490 
equilibrium status that they will take
on<00:06:54.430> based<00:06:55.180> upon<00:06:55.480> how<00:06:55.630> much<00:06:55.750> energy<00:06:55.930> receives

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.500 
on based upon how much energy receives

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.050 
on based upon how much energy receives
and<00:06:56.710> I'm<00:06:56.890> at<00:06:57.010> energy<00:06:57.370> that<00:06:57.490> radiates<00:06:57.880> back

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.060 
and I'm at energy that radiates back

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.480 
and I'm at energy that radiates back
into<00:06:58.300> space
