00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 what is going on from girlfriend stefanie of much 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.109
 from gaming tv and welcome 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.790
 to the 52 episode of our pack go to glory 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.769
 how are you on the exchange pile have 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.450
 sell a lot and of course give 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.030
 now directly in the shop and be 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.900
 now draw a 7500 goldbeck 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.460
 and this time we have inside them is 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.170
 i think saeco kids when i am 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.550
 not know nature so exactly 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.619
 I appeal in the turks nor from 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.240
 we still bonera and has internal 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.789
 actually good passwords good shot 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.109
 we resisted otherwise we have to look 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.550
 eventually we could eventually 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.290
 I do not know how to install it yet 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.730
 that's exactly what we have here 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.160
 otherwise it's just mistaken 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.360
 we can also take off directly and 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.460
 Now we go directly to the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.290
 because it's the spring 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.090
 Classic at the start and there are too 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.309
 Win 5000 coins and a premium 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.469
 gold and that's why I thought we would 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.239
 do that and so there are good ones 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.680
 chances that we win something nice 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.820
 as we have to see now 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.620
 whole contracts of ours 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.760
 Italian series a team fill up 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.500
 but that works pretty well 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.969
 fast and that's how I would say 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.170
 then we start directly that 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.879
 tournament and hope that we do not now 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.580
 so get the best opponent in the world 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.280
 and then we found him too 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.229
 with sven the jerseys change shortly 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.119
 on yellow and we with the black 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.659
 jerseys and then we'll have a look 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.520
 his team at he has a 4 1 212 team and 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.890
 What kind of a very, very 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.540
 strong team with thiago silva david luiz 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.220
 in shape front in there neymar there is yes 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.420
 really expensive in form wall is so very 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.130
 many five stars scale 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.829
 We start then directly into the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.540
 play over motto line and that leads the 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.400
 Ball continues with Jankovic and takes 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.020
 short the ball back and then there 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.159
 top lottery no again now that works 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.780
 game was fast then you can see 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.369
 how such a game to start all over 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.930
 Charity and then comes the direct acceptance 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.850
 by pallas for button was a bit 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.500
 too weak but that's what I'm feeling 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.000
 first in the game and then come 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.710
 We also went directly to the ball and was a guest 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.830
 then uses the error from the opponent like that 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.780
 make that 1 0 in the 3 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.310
 So we can go so fast 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.590
 so in spring classic cards 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.220
 with 1 0 and that was of course clarified 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.320
 made 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.850
 from our plans we then jump in 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.200
 the ninth minute is also right 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.310
 continue via roger dean or it very much 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.470
 active in this game 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.300
 nice combination with daum on simone 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.160
 pepe digitally over now with the 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.540
 Reversal US jersey for the four stars 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.340
 skinner brings the flank and there it stands 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.840
 was guest of the goalkeeper parried but there 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.940
 we finally come to the ball and was 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.220
 Gast then uses the renewed error of 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.210
 goalkeeper off and that is ringing for 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.310
 20 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.750
 much made of the fact he joined then 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.400
 two out in the ball three times but fishes out 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.630
 Thus, the ball is then in the net as well 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.610
 the 22nd swing 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.140
 Everything works out the ball as the saw 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.090
 Defense is not good from the field 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.000
 he brings the thing to his left hammer 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.410
 then into the net as the 26 minute jump 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.030
 is it now I think jankovic on the ball 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.770
 brings the flank and there is palacio 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.300
 against the post against the latte and 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.610
 in the end it is natural again 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.280
 Passenger who dusted and then he does 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.290
 So the 3 to 1 we still look at it 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.580
 The choice went to almost one of them 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.350
 header and the stock again 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.820
 unfortunately we go to works 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.470
 but ultimately the ball is in 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.209
 Doors lead three to one and should 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.500
 it 'll be right jiechi on the ball and that 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.720
 go back here zigzagging 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.820
 outstanding combination with simone pepe 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.380
 kappel terrain with a job and then 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.120
 it is charity but it spoils once 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.830
 otherwise we would be super chic 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.200
 combination then we jump too 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.640
 directly in the second half 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.590
 sent her palacio then takes the 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.150
 ball beautiful with almost easy times 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.810
 the idea and then the shot comes against 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.980
 the post 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.480
 otherwise rather that again 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.610
 we have been a nice goal then we jump 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.870
 also directly in the 75 minute palacio 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.239
 lets the ball through brings the flank 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.459
 on vargas and the skin on it but the 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.080
 goalkeeper parried that to the corner and 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.550
 then you can do it with the opponent 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.959
 further on trying to play here but 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.700
 after all, he does not have much there 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.190
 Taken 90 minutes the game is over 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.140
 we win 3 2 1 the 8th in 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.620
 spring classics and goods and thus 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.840
 to bring all chances and the cup 504 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.580
 There are coins and now I would say 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.980
 continue with our league a team 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.440
 front in course with our 93er 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:50.450
 pace striker adam young is the opponent 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:54.170
 found fc malaga has and his team is 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.940
 a 5 2 1 2 and more city just goes 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.130
 do not you look at the front please 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.900
 all German in the really over 90 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.069
 tempo have the inside defense with 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.450
 the full-backs 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.730
 so i do not know average price 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.079
 is somewhere at 85 or so then 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.700
 Let's jump dirt in the fifteen 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.499
 Team ute k brings the flank on 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.420
 everyone brings the ball and the rhine 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:13.069
 slammed against the post and suddenly 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.499
 the goalkeeper then looks out the ball 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.209
 and the situation is defused and 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:19.250
 then it goes straight on in the 26th 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.870
 minute kba again on the ball and today 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.910
 Let's see right football art here 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.380
 that's what our team palais does 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.910
 outstanding waits until from 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.280
 because someone is running free because it was like that 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.840
 close in the defense of the opponent 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.949
 ultimately come with his five-chain 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.720
 but then again to graduation 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.580
 still reshaped and the situation 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.560
 then we were also nullified 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.360
 but then jump in the 38 minute 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.039
 work is hereby comes then 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.440
 bit happy by the ball to kb 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.000
 the tangelan is characterized by and 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.889
 Finally, there is a little bit more 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.520
 Good luck with Obama brings in 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:51.289
 pure skin to the 1 0 in the 38 minute faith 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.220
 I look at that again on data 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.130
 we really are a bit lucky though 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.710
 made strong by kwh and zero problems 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.479
 for our striker then it goes on 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.190
 in the 40 minute now the opponent is on 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:04.070
 ball he brings the direct counterattack 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.370
 Then it comes with who is the skin 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.650
 the thing on it and ultimately it is 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.539
 white marco reus with the connection 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.130
 so that one to one with the 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.990
 equalizer but we leave that 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.820
 Do not wait long for us is obama 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.860
 at the power then again there 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.389
 lead hit in the 44 minute 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.300
 Let's have a nice look 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.949
 an explains power in the lower long 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.050
 corner we jump then also directly into 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:29.570
 the second half I think the rest 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.310
 we can play in the minicar 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.110
 bit to keep perish in mimik 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.580
 we do not attack well enough then 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.889
 comes the flank and there is ultimately 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.320
 the head of lukas podolski der 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.550
 Go to the gate and so it is 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.310
 balanced again then we jump 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.409
 but in the 55 shown here his pace 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.570
 goes there in the 16er one is rebuilt 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:49.610
 or is separated from the ball 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.960
 and so you see when the opponent so much 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.070
 Pace has to the mini squad only been 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.840
 can not get through anymore what should you 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.699
 make countries and now again the 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.289
 riots is now time to be fast 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:58.639
 pulls over to company and that's what it stands for 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:00.249
 at a free brings the flank 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:02.769
 and there is also but yes 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:04.659
 the header and there is the 3 2 in the 

00:06:02.769 --> 00:06:06.189
 85 minute now we have the result 

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:07.539
 save only over time 

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:09.579
 Thus, then put in the 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:11.889
 semi-final well done good timing 

00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:13.539
 made perfect by our striker and 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:15.759
 then the game is over we win 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:17.319
 So 32 were hard- fought players 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:19.239
 opponent was really only in the back 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:20.799
 We already had a player 

00:06:19.239 --> 00:06:23.259
 with three goals and now on a long the 

00:06:20.799 --> 00:06:24.759
 there is also the hat trick it is 515 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:25.509
 coins and ultimately we are in 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.069
 semifinal 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:28.659
 and I think if we continue like this 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:30.849
 as in these two games we have 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:32.589
 really good chances and there the cup victory 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:34.479
 to pick that up it was from me i had 

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:37.649
 fun skin will last until next time 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:37.649
 and yahoo
