00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.570
 liked the screen did not think it would be bad and 

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:21.220
 some kind of resolution for such a screen 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.550
 no, everything is clearly visible 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:28.980
 pixels are visible even as if saying that not 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.980
 visible speaker volume is excellent 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:50.419
 and room for stairs nitrogen cheap price 

00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:53.419
 normal crane average 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:57.679
 good battery performance is 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.639
 plus now to the minuses immediately say about 

00:04:57.679 --> 00:05:02.029
 here are these buttons 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:05.229
 they are tired of cracking they are shot together 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:08.299
 turns out with a lid and not so here 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:11.329
 hang out is a bit unpleasant like 

00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:13.579

00:05:11.329 --> 00:05:18.009
 Soon we can stand without problems 

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:22.369
 very fun now to the minuses 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:24.499
 This speaker is very quiet to 

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:27.019
 to hear the interlocutor should be applied 

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:29.809
 very close to the ear in a certain place 

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:33.169
 to hear also 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:33.769
 Immediately from the phone box there is no play 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.509
 market 

00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:38.659
 but this is not a problem I have already found 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:41.479
 instructions on the Internet where clear and 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:45.409
 understandable how to install here 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:49.369

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:52.279
 nobody cares now the main thing 

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:55.759
 chief say the main disadvantage of this 

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:59.089
 phone sometimes when I tested it 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:06:01.519
 I was told that we do not hear you when 

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:04.209
 someone say someone called someone say 

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:08.029
 what we hear noise we don't hear you 

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:11.629
 feeling like you bring 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:13.999
 Specially the phone is such a dynamic and well 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:16.489
 you understand what kind of interference when the speakers 

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:18.709
 I read the phone tray too 

00:06:16.489 --> 00:06:19.370
 on the internet some say it 

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:22.030
 problem 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.590
 dynamics nobody say u less from this 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.630
 background volume of the phone is obtained 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.090
 burning cute maximum put on minimum 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:34.910
 sometimes it is normal to talk on the phone and 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:37.070
 on the data is very much such things are worth 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:41.630
 some nice little white launcher 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:47.360
 it all works quickly show 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:51.949
 The phone is not loaded now about the camera 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:53.690
 cameras are average and even for bad nothing 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:57.800
 should not be expected of them a little 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:07:01.160

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:04.190
