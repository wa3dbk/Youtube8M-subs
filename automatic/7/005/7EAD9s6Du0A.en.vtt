00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 or the girls and guys how are you 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.460
 Welcome to the new day and cool we are going to 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.200
 make a little easier than what 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.179
 we have been doing so that we are well 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.830
 really cool guys lately but that 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.240
 they had some degree of complication and 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.460
 good you have to keep the spirit of 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.109
 just like the one that was born this blog that 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.940
 it was always relatively easy things 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.010
 and simple well let's recover that 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.359
 spirit but that you know that I have ten 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.550
 cool earrings to do they're going to 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.490
 to be very cool to do is with machine 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.840
 costs and you can also and today we are going to 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.840
 be only these materials 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.420
 some pants that you want to wear a 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.920
 strip of strass a needle and a thread what 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.840
 What we are going to do is customize a 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.730
 very simply the pockets of the 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.260
 pants and also us cool 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.300
 here where we have customized 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.800
 pockets of pants in concrete by 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.660
 the back truly get one 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.160
 we put some pins I'll leave the link 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.930
 around here and another one that we changed 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.000
 let's replace this fabric with another one 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.770
 I'll also leave the link around here then 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.020
 today we will do one thing very 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.780
 simple how to add an extra pin 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.920
 something relatively easy to find is 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.199
 a strip that has a series of 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.700
 little plants or stones that serve to 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.290
 decorate to make necklaces for a 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.880
 lots of things we're going to take advantage of 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.770
 curve that has not here any 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.840
 pocket of any pants is something 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.360
 pretty simple and we will add 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.890
 this little detail of brightness 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.869
 that you can see so you see what 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.430
 simple then the idea is to add 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.590
 this little detail in both 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.600
 front pockets you see how I've 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.759
 taught one and so I teach you to see if I 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.340
 is little better sample the other 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.050
 pocket how would it be around here then in 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.700
 the back of the pants that is 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.420
 where brands usually tend 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.330
 furnish 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.280
 and a little more with drawings with embroidery 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.659
 etc. I think you can use it too 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.729
 in their back pockets for 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.380
 decorate them with this extras in the case of 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.090
 the pockets that I have that are from 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.770
 l'esprit and specifically those pants 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.000
 I'm going to take advantage of these hairlines you see that 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.369
 has here in the back two 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.259
 pockets to add a very detail 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.659
 subtle extras for example in one of 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.130
 those strips do not do not want to recharge 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.140
 pants because the intention is not 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.149
 recharge it but add a small 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.439
 detail that will lie more than six 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.000
 feet and make them a little bit more 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.649
 personal then the first thing we go 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.330
 to do is start sewing nineties like 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.250
 You see these extras strips as you can 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.899
 observe more closely they have small 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.060
 each other, which is where we are going to 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.470
 go knowing it practically although it is 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.840
 the true plastic with pebbles is 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.250
 relatively easy to basic things of 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.350
 without end I have continued sewing 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.880
 truth and that is very simple because 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.440
 now I am going to teach you closely 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.440
 back does not teach again just in case 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.090
 You see how it has some small streaks 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.830
 that's where I'm going to take and what's coarse 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.780
 but the trousers 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.730
 it could not be easier to program 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.860
 I never would have imagined that it would be 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.750
 we in a hundred sacyr and how is it 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.520
 this first detail true and here a 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.100
 second pocket detail then 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.750
 now I'm just going to cut it out and 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.760
 so you can see how the two are 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.200
 I threw them monkeys pockets will be 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.640
 these two front pockets that 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.380
 they could be nation I always make you so 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.400
 simple how this ends up that 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.690
 any when you take some 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.760
 pants for example you are the hands 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.680
 or always to chuli not in the pocket and 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.240
 look what it is that gives the effect now 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.010
 I will continue this has been 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.450
 single little detail on the back 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.920
 and we have already reached the end of the day 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.360
 He has taught us a lot because he is 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.130
 that really did not have anything to say 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.510
 Knowing him and I will not take away 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.310
 more time but I did want stevie 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.780
 as the final result 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.550
 new if I taught you and the 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.080
 small detail true us pockets of 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.180
 back this is back you have to see the 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.530
 posts and it 's the ones I prefer to teach in 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.510
 some what is to those who do it 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.280
 He taught how we have seen posts 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.010
 that is very simple is needed 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.050
 exactly half a meter of extras and I 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.600
 this has left over half a meter not 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.250
 you buy more you can find it in 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.360
 haberdashery and in stores as well 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.070
 Beads I imagine will come 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.660
 We made guys can do wonders 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.940
 you can right in the middle of the pile of 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.520
 things imagine for example a stripe 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.460
 behind the infinities all over the side 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.230
 of the lateral zinc blog inside in the 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.230
 side of the pants imagine what 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.060
 nice could be a fine line like this 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.620
 on one side I think it could be 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.480
 I suck a little more patience 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.640
 to go putting it little by little but you 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.100
 I assure you this fast as I tell you 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.260
 always when something takes a lot this 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.020
 is pulled salts that stretches or is it 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.030
 yes while you offense not a canon 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.530
 academic erre for six the same 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.240
 I need several holes, although you can 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.230
 also strengthen it a couple three times 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.580
 example every three or four stones 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.440
 reinforce is a little three or four 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.570
 strengthen and really that would be 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.579
 superchule of these that are encouraged and what 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.780
 please do not show it to me anymore 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.090
 I want to say nothing more simply 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.230
 thank you for not seeing us to happen to see 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.190
 an equal day see you in the next 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.190
 until next time
