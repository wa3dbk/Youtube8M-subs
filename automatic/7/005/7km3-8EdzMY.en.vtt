00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:07.479 
using all capital letters I'm gonna

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:10.350 
using all capital letters I'm gonna
write<00:00:07.720> out<00:00:07.870> the<00:00:08.049> word<00:00:08.230> happy<00:00:08.969> and<00:00:09.969> leaving

plenty<00:00:10.539> of<00:00:10.690> space<00:00:11.139> between<00:00:11.500> each<00:00:12.099> of<00:00:12.309> the

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:12.429 
plenty of space between each of the

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.279 
plenty of space between each of the
letters<00:00:12.760> so<00:00:12.969> that<00:00:13.000> I<00:00:13.180> can<00:00:13.359> trace<00:00:13.660> around<00:00:13.869> them

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:14.289 
letters so that I can trace around them

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:17.840 
letters so that I can trace around them
afterward<00:00:14.949> making<00:00:15.789> them<00:00:15.939> into<00:00:16.150> block<00:00:16.449> letters

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
afterward making them into block letters

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.240 
afterward making them into block letters
you<00:00:18.850> can<00:00:18.939> see<00:00:19.210> that<00:00:19.359> I'm<00:00:19.480> not<00:00:19.830> tried<00:00:20.830> to<00:00:20.860> line

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
you can see that I'm not tried to line

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.080 
you can see that I'm not tried to line
them<00:00:21.490> all<00:00:21.610> up<00:00:21.670> to<00:00:22.330> be<00:00:22.420> exactly<00:00:22.930> the<00:00:23.110> same<00:00:23.140> size

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.560 
and I'm also not trying to make them all
land<00:00:28.150> on<00:00:28.900> the<00:00:29.890> same<00:00:30.160> base<00:00:30.550> line<00:00:30.910> this<00:00:31.210> is<00:00:31.359> going

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
land on the same base line this is going

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.490 
land on the same base line this is going
to<00:00:31.630> give<00:00:31.750> them<00:00:31.900> a<00:00:31.960> little<00:00:32.169> bit<00:00:32.289> of<00:00:32.320> interest

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500
