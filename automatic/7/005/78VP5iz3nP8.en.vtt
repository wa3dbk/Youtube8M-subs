00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
you know usually that means that

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.479 
you know usually that means that
something<00:00:39.719> else<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.079> wrong<00:00:40.140> with<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.100> battery

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
something else is wrong with the battery

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.430 
something else is wrong with the battery
typically<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.239> might<00:00:42.450> hear<00:00:42.660> clicking<00:00:43.020> or<00:00:43.320> you

typically you might hear clicking or you
might<00:00:43.590> not<00:00:43.800> get<00:00:44.040> anything<00:00:44.309> at<00:00:44.579> all<00:00:44.700> one<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
might not get anything at all one of the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.880 
might not get anything at all one of the
giveaways<00:00:45.629> with<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.110> battery<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.590> when<00:00:46.800> you

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
giveaways with the battery is when you

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.200 
giveaways with the battery is when you
get<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.190> car<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.640> open<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:47.969> door<00:00:48.000> and

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
get in the car and you open the door and

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.880 
get in the car and you open the door and
the<00:00:48.480> lights<00:00:48.660> don't<00:00:48.930> come<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.379> or<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.710> don't

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
the lights don't come on or you don't

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.470 
the lights don't come on or you don't
hear<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.160> normal<00:00:50.489> buzzing<00:00:50.850> sounds<00:00:51.270> or<00:00:51.390> it

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
hear the normal buzzing sounds or it

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.750 
hear the normal buzzing sounds or it
seems<00:00:51.719> really<00:00:51.840> weak<00:00:52.320> that's<00:00:53.160> typically<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
seems really weak that's typically a

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.580 
seems really weak that's typically a
battery<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.270> battery<00:00:54.360> can<00:00:54.899> cause<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
battery and the battery can cause the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.849 
battery and the battery can cause the
make<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.219> sound<00:00:56.430> again<00:00:56.520> Chris<00:00:57.530> jejeje<00:00:58.530> that

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
make that sound again Chris jejeje that

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.340 
make that sound again Chris jejeje that
what<00:00:59.070> if<00:00:59.640> maybe<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.390> battery's<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> little<00:01:01.199> low

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
what if maybe the battery's a little low

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.510 
what if maybe the battery's a little low
I'm<00:01:01.530> sorry<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.890> just<00:01:02.070> couldn't<00:01:02.190> bring<00:01:02.399> myself

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
little bit about all the components that

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.990 
little bit about all the components that
could<00:01:07.380> cause<00:01:07.680> those<00:01:08.010> sounds<00:01:08.460> Chris<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.880> those

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
could cause those sounds Chris and those

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.240 
could cause those sounds Chris and those
problems<00:01:09.390> or<00:01:09.630> at<00:01:09.869> least<00:01:10.049> most<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.560> them<00:01:10.740> here

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
problems or at least most of them here

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.910 
problems or at least most of them here
we<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.520> an<00:01:11.640> alternator<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.510> starter<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.619> this

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
we have an alternator a starter and this

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.550 
we have an alternator a starter and this
is<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> battery<00:01:14.640> okay<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.659> idea<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
is a battery okay and the idea is the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.920 
is a battery okay and the idea is the
battery<00:01:16.979> supposed<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.549> supply<00:01:17.850> power<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
battery supposed to supply power to the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.899 
battery supposed to supply power to the
starter<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.130> it'll<00:01:20.280> turn<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.729> motor

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
starter so that it'll turn the motor

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.539 
starter so that it'll turn the motor
over<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.869> alternator<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.860> supposed<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.430> help

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
over the alternator is supposed to help

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.670 
over the alternator is supposed to help
manage<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.119> power<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.570> belt<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.439> RET

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
manage that power of the belt the RET

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.499 
manage that power of the belt the RET
travels<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.580> big<00:01:26.759> long<00:01:26.939> serpentine

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
travels on this that big long serpentine

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.620 
travels on this that big long serpentine
belt<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.380> helps<00:01:28.680> manage<00:01:29.400> power<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
belt and it helps manage power for the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.270 
belt and it helps manage power for the
battery<00:01:31.020> now<00:01:31.439> if<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.619> have<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.770> problem<00:01:32.040> with

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
battery now if you have a problem with

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.950 
battery now if you have a problem with
the<00:01:32.400> alternator<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.060> can<00:01:33.270> actually<00:01:33.630> destroy

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
the alternator it can actually destroy

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.719 
the alternator it can actually destroy
the<00:01:34.229> battery<00:01:34.590> if<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.280> problem<00:01:35.520> with

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
the battery if you have a problem with

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.370 
the battery if you have a problem with
the<00:01:35.850> starter<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:36.600> destroy<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.049> battery

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
the starter it can destroy the battery

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.520 
the starter it can destroy the battery
too<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.280> really<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.509> smart<00:01:39.840> thing<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.259> not<00:01:40.500> to

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
too so really the smart thing is not to

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.289 
too so really the smart thing is not to
go<00:01:40.890> by<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> part<00:01:41.520> when<00:01:41.759> your<00:01:41.880> car<00:01:42.060> won't<00:01:42.210> start

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
go by a part when your car won't start

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.670 
go by a part when your car won't start
and<00:01:42.600> put<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:42.990> like<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.229> battery<00:01:43.530> or

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
and put it in like a battery or

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.800 
and put it in like a battery or
alternator<00:01:43.920> or<00:01:44.130> starter<00:01:44.450> chances<00:01:45.450> are<00:01:45.600> it's

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
alternator or starter chances are it's

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.389 
alternator or starter chances are it's
not<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.259> be<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.500> part<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.130> can't

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
not going to be the part and it can't

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.460 
not going to be the part and it can't
always<00:01:47.610> be<00:01:47.759> diagnosed<00:01:48.360> from<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.750> sound<00:01:49.079> like<00:01:49.350> we

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
always be diagnosed from a sound like we

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.530 
always be diagnosed from a sound like we
used<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.829> be<00:01:49.950> able<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.340> 15<00:01:50.850> 20<00:01:51.210> years<00:01:51.329> ago

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
used to be able to 15 20 years ago

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.870 
used to be able to 15 20 years ago

thanks to all the electronics let me
show<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.149> how<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.630> can<00:01:54.780> take<00:01:55.290> care<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.619> a

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
show you how you can take care of a

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.170 
show you how you can take care of a
battery<00:01:55.860> as<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.189> see<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.610> one<00:01:56.790> here<00:01:56.820> and

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
battery as you see this one here and

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.850 
battery as you see this one here and
look<00:01:57.299> at<00:01:57.390> all<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.600> nasty<00:01:58.140> corrosion<00:01:58.710> right

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
look at all this nasty corrosion right

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.830 
look at all this nasty corrosion right
here<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.729> can<00:01:59.850> see<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.210> corrosion<00:02:00.630> here

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
here and you can see this corrosion here

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.350 
here and you can see this corrosion here
on<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.259> one<00:02:01.439> as<00:02:01.590> well<00:02:01.790> you<00:02:02.790> can<00:02:02.909> also<00:02:03.090> see

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
on this one as well you can also see

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.969 
on this one as well you can also see
acid<00:02:03.840> building<00:02:04.140> up<00:02:04.320> at<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.530> bottom<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.920> this

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
acid building up at the bottom of this

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.100 
acid building up at the bottom of this
battery<00:02:05.340> what<00:02:06.090> happens<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.630> your<00:02:06.780> battery

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
battery what happens is your battery

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.710 
battery what happens is your battery
cable<00:02:07.560> basically<00:02:08.039> has<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.340> come

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
cable basically has to come

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.540 
cable basically has to come
to<00:02:08.930> that<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:09.560> all<00:02:09.800> that's<00:02:09.979> going<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.310> get<00:02:10.430> in

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
to that and all that's going to get in

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.670 
to that and all that's going to get in
between<00:02:10.700> it<00:02:11.090> and<00:02:11.150> prevent<00:02:11.570> that<00:02:11.780> charge<00:02:12.230> for

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
between it and prevent that charge for

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.620 
between it and prevent that charge for
making<00:02:13.100> it<00:02:13.220> from<00:02:13.340> this<00:02:13.520> battery<00:02:13.940> to<00:02:14.480> that

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
making it from this battery to that

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.940 
making it from this battery to that
starter<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.290> that's<00:02:15.440> where<00:02:15.650> you're<00:02:15.770> going<00:02:15.890> to

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
starter and that's where you're going to

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.380 
starter and that's where you're going to
end<00:02:16.100> up<00:02:16.160> with<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.430> majority<00:02:17.000> of<00:02:17.030> battery

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
end up with the majority of battery

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.970 
end up with the majority of battery
problems<00:02:17.780> so<00:02:17.870> what<00:02:18.020> I've<00:02:18.110> got<00:02:18.350> here<00:02:18.380> some<00:02:18.590> very

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
problems so what I've got here some very

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.510 
problems so what I've got here some very

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
hot water I'm microwave that without the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.260 
hot water I'm microwave that without the
metal<00:02:22.790> cap<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.300> course<00:02:24.940> what<00:02:25.940> you're<00:02:26.090> going<00:02:26.210> to

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
metal cap of course what you're going to

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.150 
metal cap of course what you're going to
do<00:02:26.390> next<00:02:26.570> with<00:02:26.990> your<00:02:27.020> hot<00:02:27.470> water<00:02:27.680> is<00:02:27.980> you're

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
do next with your hot water is you're

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.700 
do next with your hot water is you're
going<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.340> mix<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:28.790> couple<00:02:29.390> of<00:02:29.600> tablespoons<00:02:29.960> of

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
going to mix a couple of tablespoons of

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.130 
going to mix a couple of tablespoons of
baking<00:02:31.130> soda<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.970> it's<00:02:32.480> okay<00:02:32.780> if<00:02:32.810> you<00:02:32.960> make<00:02:33.110> a

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
baking soda and it's okay if you make a

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.230 
baking soda and it's okay if you make a
mess<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:33.590> do<00:02:33.650> that<00:02:33.920> in<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.100> kitchen<00:02:34.430> too<00:02:34.640> it's

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
mess I do that in the kitchen too it's

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.880 
mess I do that in the kitchen too it's
pretty<00:02:35.540> hot<00:02:35.780> then<00:02:36.500> you're<00:02:36.530> going<00:02:36.770> to<00:02:36.830> take

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
pretty hot then you're going to take

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.310 
pretty hot then you're going to take
like<00:02:37.220> a<00:02:37.250> household<00:02:37.790> cleanser<00:02:38.330> okay<00:02:39.230> and

like a household cleanser okay and
you're<00:02:39.410> going<00:02:39.500> to<00:02:39.560> put<00:02:39.740> just<00:02:39.770> a<00:02:39.980> little<00:02:40.010> bit<00:02:40.400> of

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
you're going to put just a little bit of

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.310 
you're going to put just a little bit of
that<00:02:40.640> in<00:02:40.700> there<00:02:41.090> because<00:02:41.750> that's<00:02:41.990> going<00:02:42.230> to

going to take that and stir it up a

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.050 
going to take that and stir it up a
little<00:02:47.320> and<00:02:48.320> then<00:02:48.380> once<00:02:48.709> it's<00:02:48.920> stirred<00:02:49.250> you

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
little and then once it's stirred you

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.670 
little and then once it's stirred you
can<00:02:50.240> either<00:02:50.390> take<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.110> you<00:02:51.230> can<00:02:51.380> literally

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
can either take it and you can literally

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.530 
can either take it and you can literally
just<00:02:51.830> pour<00:02:52.370> it<00:02:52.490> on<00:02:52.640> or<00:02:52.790> what<00:02:52.910> I've<00:02:53.030> got<00:02:53.240> here<00:02:53.270> is

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
just pour it on or what I've got here is

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.510 
just pour it on or what I've got here is
a<00:02:53.630> battery<00:02:53.900> cable<00:02:54.530> in<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:55.220> we're<00:02:55.340> going<00:02:55.459> to

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
a battery cable in and we're going to

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.120 
a battery cable in and we're going to
take<00:02:55.760> that<00:02:56.030> and<00:02:56.600> put<00:02:56.750> it<00:02:57.080> inside<00:02:57.230> here<00:02:57.770> and<00:02:57.920> see

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
take that and put it inside here and see

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.040 
take that and put it inside here and see
what<00:02:58.280> happens<00:02:58.730> you<00:02:59.240> see<00:02:59.480> how<00:02:59.630> it's<00:02:59.780> turning

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
what happens you see how it's turning

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.699 
what happens you see how it's turning
colors<00:03:00.560> can<00:03:01.459> you<00:03:01.580> see<00:03:01.820> that<00:03:02.000> fun<00:03:02.600> it's<00:03:03.320> really

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
colors can you see that fun it's really

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.770 
colors can you see that fun it's really
cleaning<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.610> stuff<00:03:05.000> right<00:03:05.300> off<00:03:05.330> there

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
cleaning that stuff right off there

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.750 
cleaning that stuff right off there
it'll<00:03:06.290> do<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.560> same<00:03:06.830> thing<00:03:07.130> if<00:03:07.250> we<00:03:07.370> pour<00:03:07.700> a

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
it'll do the same thing if we pour a

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.150 
it'll do the same thing if we pour a
little<00:03:08.000> of<00:03:08.120> this<00:03:08.270> on<00:03:08.570> here<00:03:08.950> it'll<00:03:09.950> actually

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
little of this on here it'll actually
