00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.250
 how about friends how are they up to sensual 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.740
 in another video for you and this time 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.710
 I bring you a tutorial tutorial 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.560
 about the automatic collection of 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.470
 wheat and wheat seeds this time 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.500
 I'm going to try to hurry measure 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.360
 I always get dark and more than 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.090
 nothing this tutorial is only for the 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.250
 collection is not for planting and that 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.340
 grow back automatically no no no 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.940
 not only for automatic collection 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.850
 wheat and wheat seeds here here 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.310
 I have what is the button for the system 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.649
 Once you pressed I recommend 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.989
 to press it twice as a 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.000
 sometimes the wheat gets stuck and not 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.489
 goes down well to what are being the 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.270
 water channels as you can see there are good 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.579
 Wheat very happily towards us 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.670
 here comes my point of 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.380
 wheat harvest and how are we going to see 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.280
 how many do I have right now of wheat I do not have 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.860
 Many 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.120
 let's see how many grabs seeds 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.890
 same I do not have let's see how many 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.030
 We took the ratito 38 seeds and 32 of 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.619
 wheat 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.869
 these systems you can do them 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.880
 of the size they want depends on their 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.189
 imagination and creativity 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.350
 well let's start with what's coming 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:23.360
 being how can we make this mechanism 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:28.850
 can break what they are being 8 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:34.220
 blocks to the right 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.270
 we leave it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 bits 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.820
 today I'm going to put what they are being 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.800
 the water channels 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.200
 and then we will put here again 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.360
 water and dancing will flow to the right 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.810
 then I'm going to break this block 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.070
 here I will break one I will break the same 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:02:00.020
 8 but I'm going to break two blocks of 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:02:02.090
 of thickness 12 do not go more 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.400
 until here and after the water I'm going to 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.510
 I put here just below this is still the 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.640
 what is my channel 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.170
 not from youtube but my water channel 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.910
 then let's put what they come 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.520
 being the good ones I did not even say the material 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.520
 what are you that I'm occupying right now is 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.630
 the crystal water cube in this case what 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.360
 I'm looking forward to glass 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.490
 appreciate a little better roasted seed 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.970
 of wheat here bone license for 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.690
 accelerate the stone button piston process 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.620
 reddish and reddish stone repeater 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.930
 after having what they are being 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.470
 the channels we are going to put what is the 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.920
 piston all this piston line do not 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.920
 I put 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.660
 I do not put it here then later because there 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.660
 it's being what the harvest is 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.090
 after this we are going to put what 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.920
 they are being repeaters remember that 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.920
 the little arrow should be facing up 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.920
 towards the piston equal in this case 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.790
 Well, I'm going to put what is being 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:07.530
 reddish stone 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.530
 same here back too 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.500
 this is the back of the mechanism 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.050
 the front is this because they 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.960
 I'm going to explain something 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.970
 this mechanism I'm going to do good this 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.070
 I'm going to connect with this the connection 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.740
 I'm going to do it directly from here 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.690
 I'm going to make a straight line 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.740
 just like this we are going to put it 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.040
 here 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.290
 now I was going what I tell them to be the 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.660
 repeater should go up to 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:42.520
 connect this with this and let's put 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.010
 a repeater here in the middle where the 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.640
 water we leave this and then again 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.430
 we put other 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.140
 equal or a being on this side put a 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.360
 repeater in the middle so that they are not 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.680
 go the signal leave a reddish stone 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.230
 and put a repeater 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.189
 now let's put good egg for what 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.189
 what is the earth 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.060
 we go to land here here too 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.880
 as well 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:15.290
 and then I'm going to put what is the 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:18.769
 reddish stone here a block and here my 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.120
 vote is to corrupt I am to jazz and 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.150
 it depends on you as who your 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:27.210
 decoration at the collection point of 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.449
 wheat I do not leave it to your imagination 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.330
 let's do it here simple 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.310
 let's break is also 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.400
 let's press the button to see 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.530
 that works 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.310
 I tell you that the pressure is twice 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:45.490
 because then the wheat stays here and if 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.169
 they press it on the second time the wheat 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.229
 you will see what the channels are 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.320
 of water and so they can collect all the 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.390
 harvesting wheat 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.190
 after this comes what comes 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.500
 being the structure again hollow for 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.370
 what has been good glass 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.240
 crystal 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:07.020
 let's put here a good ladder 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.870
 we climb a little path 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.360
 here too 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:16.140
 and the decoration I leave to your 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.120
 criterion but remember to put the only 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:22.420
 advice that I give you is here one of 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:25.090
 glass or any other material 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.860
 so they can be here walking 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:32.080
 about what has been the 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.080
 harvest and re-grow it 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:38.530
 let's do it here here and here 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.730
 in the same way let's put here 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:45.900
 our barrier and you define it 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.900
 how will it be finished 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:56.340
 let's put it here and fast fast 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:59.039
 fast fast fast because it always 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:02.630
 makes me let's break this always be 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:02.630
 it makes me night without stopping 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.070
 as you see here here is our button 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.909
 and I left these blocks here in between 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.330
 to use what has been the 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:15.330
 room 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.430
 then we will cultivate what is the 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.800
 wheat seed and then must 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.270
 wait like 10 minutes for 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.280
 grow back but in this case I'm going to 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:31.520
 use bone meat to accelerate 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:34.090
 the process like this side we use 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.090
 grilled 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:41.249
 and also afterwards we use what 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.590
 the wheat seed is coming 

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:47.390
 here too 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.390
 and then the bone meat 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:53.129
 once we have our wheat and 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.779
 we see that it is already at the maximum point 

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:56.600
 we press what is being 

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:58.760
 our button 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.820
 we press it again in case it got stuck 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.730
 any 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:06.790
 and as you see our wheat follows these 

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:08.620
 ducts or water channels for what 

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:11.040
 it's been our point of 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.040
 harvest 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:15.680
 there's like why 

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:23.170
 like everything was sinking we're going 

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.170
 to break it and collect again 

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:29.280
 unintentionally I broke two blocks down 

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.920
 but I hope you liked it 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.950
 this tutorial remember your depends 

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.900
 creativity and your imagination you 

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:40.530
 they can make very very large mechanisms 

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:42.510
 where with a simple button and when 

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.260
 activen can collect hundreds 

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:47.440
 hundreds of 

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.990
 raw material how about friends this 

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.700
 It has been the tutorial on collection 

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:53.680
 automatic wheat and wheat seeds 

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.510
