00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.680
Hello, guys! It's Sherry

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.700
I'm in Matsuyama city area

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.820
Because I need to get some gifts for my friend

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.420
So I'm gonna show you around the city area of Ehime

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.660
Here we go!

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.260
So I'm walking down a shopping street right now

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.310
It's called "Ropeway gai" shopping street

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.060
I want to introduce you one sweet

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.402
that I really like and haven't had that for a long time

00:00:30.402 --> 00:00:34.560
Because you have to come to the shop early enough to get one

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.160
Because it's gonna get easily sold out in, I don't know, maybe an hour or two

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.620
Here we are at the shop that I was looking for

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.160
And look at that!

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.560
It's already a long line

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.720
So, inside of the shop, still in line

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.900
Look at the long line

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.820
The shop isn't that big so it looks like so crowded

00:01:05.827 --> 00:01:08.387
but we only have like 20 people, I guess

00:01:08.387 --> 00:01:10.360
So I think I can get it! Yaaay!

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.960
So yay! I got this little guy

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.994
I need to open this one

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.240
And I need to find a place that I can open it up

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.220
and I can try it

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.040
And ya that was a little trip to Kiri no mori

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.100
I'm gonna try this out!

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.420
I am sitting at Starbucks

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.055
I'm going to open this one

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.360
It comes in a little nice green paper bag

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.100
And it was....

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.780
I just bought one

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.720
And then, it was like 150 yen plus tax

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.640
So it's about like 1 dollar and 50 cents

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.860
And it's pretty small

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.680
Like this size

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.400
It's really cold:D

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.060
I'm gonna show you guys

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.940
Just like that!

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.960
Just a small green tea ball

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.840
"Itadakimasu" (A greeting before you eat)

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.420
So that's like "mochi," rice cake

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.780
Inside, there is(are) red bean paste and whip cream

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.400
It's not too sweet

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.720
Really nice cold snack for summer:)

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.640
Alright, I'm gonna finish this up

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.440
And I'm gonna head back to souvenir shopping

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.020
Alright~

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.880
So I got a Starbucks

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.120
Chai tea latteâ™ª

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.340
I'm at Dogo Onsen shoping street

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.351
if you can read these little Kanji(Japanese letters) here

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.920
I'm heading down to the souvenir shop

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.960
And it's my mom

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.280
She is jumping

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.920
This is also kind of a big souvenir shop

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.698
But I'm going to a different one

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.780
I'm going to the one that I used to work at when I was in college

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.420
I came back for 3 week.. no 3 months

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.340
during the summer vacation

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.056
Because I didn't know I could work in the States

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.320
So I was like well I need to work

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.145
and I'm gonna go back to Japan

00:03:17.145 --> 00:03:18.881
and I'm gonna work and make some money, right?

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.440
So I ended up working

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.760
at this souvenir shop

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.540
here, Jugo mangoku

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.380
This is the section I'm going to dig around

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.400
I'm gonna find some cool stuff here

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.122
And then, I'm gonna show you the rest of the shop later

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.780
Look at this!

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.020
They are aaaaaaaaall orange juices

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:57.979
Alright, so this is the end of the shopping street

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.480
And I'm gonna close this up

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.784
Dogo Onsen (hot spring) in the back

00:05:02.784 --> 00:05:04.368
And then, this is what I got!

00:05:04.368 --> 00:05:07.256
I'm not gonna show you what's inside because this is gonna be a suprise

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.310
That's all for today

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.390
Thank you for watching, I will see you gain soon

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.880
Bye!
