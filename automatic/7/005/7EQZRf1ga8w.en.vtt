00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
once when they do that they actually

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.590 
once when they do that they actually
pour<00:00:31.890> those<00:00:32.070> impressions<00:00:32.430> up<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.239> stone

plaster<00:00:34.050> base<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.950> actually<00:00:35.550> creates<00:00:36.120> a

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
plaster base and actually creates a

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.780 
plaster base and actually creates a
model<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.899> your<00:00:37.290> teeth<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:37.980> therefore<00:00:38.430> she<00:00:38.640> can

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
kind of see on the different angulations

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.090 
kind of see on the different angulations
or<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.640> crowdedness<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.600> your<00:00:45.750> teeth<00:00:46.100> also

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
jaw alignment how far your overbite is

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.450 
jaw alignment how far your overbite is
so<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.240> means<00:01:06.390> whenever<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.780> bite<00:01:07.020> down<00:01:07.460> how

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
you have a panorex x-ray which is a long

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.840 
you have a panorex x-ray which is a long
x-ray<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.509> normally<00:01:30.990> done<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.950> cases<00:01:32.220> for

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
x-ray this is normally done in cases for

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.420 
x-ray this is normally done in cases for
orthodontic<00:01:33.450> records<00:01:33.960> or<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.740> determine<00:01:35.070> on

it's the machine that you go in and the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.510 
it's the machine that you go in and the
Machine<00:01:40.590> goes<00:01:40.799> all<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:40.979> way<00:01:41.130> around<00:01:41.400> your

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
Machine goes all the way around your

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
head and then it produces an x-ray that

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.819 
head and then it produces an x-ray that
looks<00:01:44.009> like<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:45.149> will<00:01:45.420> show<00:01:45.659> your<00:01:46.500> bone
