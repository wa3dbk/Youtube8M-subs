00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.230
 very good everyone again welcome 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.390
 to the channel, I am my, how are you doing? 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.040
 this time it was our turn to do 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.810
 something other than bringing one of those 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.759
 games that you already know that I like 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.380
 that are not the usual ones that are not 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.860
 commercial games are not shooters 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.230
 they are games 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.900
 very watched and very played in the channels 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.630
 of youtube and well I decided that this 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.280
 once they were snapshot snapshot you will say 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.410
 host that was past key that minecraft 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.820
 minecraft snapshot minecraft does not have 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.890
 nothing to do with minecraft for nothing 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.360
 as you can see is this little 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.700
 milestone robot although it has to escape from 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.650
 a world in which he is alone and 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.420
 will only be accompanied from your 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.510
 photo camera a very photo camera 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.850
 very special which you will see in the 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.739
 next phase how to use 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.000
 tell you that games are platforms 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.879
 of all the life that you will find it in 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.469
 steam will make about ten euros and here you have 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.839
 the first use of the camera is the click 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.339
 apart to set aside an object to do 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.580
 disappear and do it reappears in 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.200
 our area to help us from him and he will do 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.180
 higher heights and thus complete 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.120
 phases 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.790
 the game as it said by districts in 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.070
 this month is a platform which is 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.130
 composed of puzzles consists of 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.580
 time trial in which he owns we will play 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.090
 levels against a specific time not 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.759
 we can take more than that time 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.950
 and it will have to be done at that minimum, not if 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.289
 We test and we will have failed 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.000
 come back to do it again as you can 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:38.859
 check the objects are in many 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.600
 areas of the map we take them 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:42.510
 we capture the removed from the map the 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.640
 we place center side 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.870
 we go up to him we can even 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.640
 push as you see check in this 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.070
 moment 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.810
 Y 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.120
 so take them to areas where 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.550
 we were initially and needed 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.380
 to get up there the game has a 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.060
 very simple mechanics very simple ones 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.830
 very curious graphics the soundtrack is 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.940
 very pretty I like quite the 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.620
 true 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.240
 like other team lessons you have a 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.190
 option that is to buy the normal option 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.590
 a snapshot plan or then you have also 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.810
 the option of snapshot soundtrack edition 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.790
 or what has been with the band 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.920
 sound not a difference of about three 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.990
 euros the truth and the good soundtrack 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.810
 it's very good it's very relaxing very cool 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.840
 and such that I can tell you more from this 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.340
 passion forgiveness snapshot was launched on 30 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.000
 August is a fairly recent game 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.000
 recent the truth 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.910
 for a single player on the platform 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.770
 steam I do not know if it has left for some 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.800
 another that knows only why 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.170
 the developer are retro effect is 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.120
 an independent developer that there 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.410
 that make games simpler 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.930
 independent 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.000
 and this is one of the last games that 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.150
 they have released and it has taken the awards 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.440
 and a prize of packs of packs 10 that has 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.840
 been 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.330
 and the three awards and one in the 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.710
 independent games festival is one of the 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.620
 finalists has brought us prize but 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:08.350
 it's still been has been the two 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.910
 finalists your computer your 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.580
 computer for this game to walk 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.070
 also something as simple as an intel 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.030
 dual core of 2 gigs of ram a nvidia 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:21.010
 8,800 gts or equivalent 7 x 9 500 megs 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.409
 hard disk 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.090
 and a normal sound card and 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:27.950
 current 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.940
 recommended that they say that 4 gb of 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.580
 ram 18 1,800 gts or better 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.120
 I do not think I need many many 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.670
 graphics 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.930
 a hard drive gb I do not know why the 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.060
 true if you needed a moment ago 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.319
 500 that a gig of disk 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.599
 It does not have logic, but it does not matter 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.890
 sound card and the truth is that 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.540
 is a game that does not ask for much is very 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.249
 similar to the requirements of a 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.989
 mechanical that you saw it the week 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:56.439
 last and it's the week bets of 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:58.420
 traitors nap shot that I can tell you no 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.859
 there are no more weapons so to speak 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.019
 weapons in quotes I mean the 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:04.359
 bed we will only use the camera 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.859
 you do not need anything else there are about 100 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:08.769
 different levels that is to say they are quite 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:11.280
 levels four four or four environments 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:15.129
 worlds by itself there are secrets there 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.299
 challenges websites too and good and the 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:17.829
 theme of the graphics that look like 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.560
 pretty curious pretty pretty 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.660
 very simple very clean very little 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.450
 more than saying no to 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.950
 about this game is one of those 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.200
 games that I already tell you , a little bit of the 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.420
 no tonic than normal 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.410
 before the massive pull comes 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.950
 in which we will find them 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.080
 collapsed by reuters as always 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.590
 I always say a little rest to the 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.600
 coconut I can say the coconut I mean 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.740
 so many shots and that collapse there is no 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.630
 to take care of what the 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.150
 online games and the fruits and the rock 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.890
 hitting shots and nothing guys with this 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.110

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.770
 independent game of something different 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.060
 only one player remembering the games 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.490
