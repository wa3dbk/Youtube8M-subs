00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:09.360
 hello girls have some silver hair 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.620
 but I'm here with the hair well 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.710
 Wet, I'm trying to show you. 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:26.910
 that nothing is strange 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:29.530
 It's okay, it's the only hair I have in the kitchen. 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:35.360
 black male 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:36.980
 there is nothing weird in the barrel that the 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:43.790
 normal hair 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:47.210
 Yes, I 'm going to take a picture of her hair. 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:51.559
 my sister-in-law who also uses the straightener 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:56.660
 black a good one for you see I'll take it 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:58.670
 a photo of her now in the morning because she 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.239
 not're using more quiet 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:23.210
 she is not wearing one more 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:27.049
 not rolling and you're going to get pissed 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:34.880
 jesus are going to stay totally crosshairs, okay? 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:36.440
 because there are also some girls who 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.660
 They say they can not perform 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:44.210
 designed to prove more disconcerting 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.240
 so I'll talk now and do it 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:51.700
 business sure says not arraes 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:55.340
 matter neither the breed nor the hair type is 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:59.920
 I am not sponsored the accident 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:04.430
 I'm saying this because it really is 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:07.400
 It was super easy to drag the 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.700
 product was beginning to want in the 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:16.330
 It's true, it's true, getting out is super. 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.330
 easy to remove the product of the fight is like this 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.280
 I think the bisnaga enem understands this 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.490
 harder to take off the face causes 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.870
 this piece already that name by bit 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.640
 I do not need to get my hair done. 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.110
 mainly because it is fresh or 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.720
 either it is very malleable 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:41.100
 It's good, I washed the line. It's super good. 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.490
 accustomed to a swamp 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:48.540
 but I do not use more expensive protein 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:51.600
 only when I spend an emmy and it's out 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.690
 I thought it an anti-waste shampoo 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.860
 is that it is surrounded a little because the 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:01.170
 pam time cause of hair break either 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.890
 say hair loss is in some 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.870
 lines have spoken causing fall 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.670
 I do not know what they put a product 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.420
 it really looks like the hair is 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:16.680
 more times but still a lot of 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:21.330
 my hair okay so I do not use is 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:25.260
 in use more zealot used more 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:27.840
 after that new sandy line I do not use 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.890
 no way but the button 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.989
 ok this is the cream and anti Fall 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.959
 also it is not necessary that this site 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:40.650
 there's no one I'm going to do with these 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:43.680
 products that are here because they do not 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.060
 It's more necessary, today 's team has some 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.080
 which are full 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.080
 in another parliamentary session 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.280
 but I'm going to leave it here suddenly 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.140

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.630
 products that work with the same 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.300
 quality but it was only 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.640
 he was released're going to talk more because 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:08.310

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:08.860
