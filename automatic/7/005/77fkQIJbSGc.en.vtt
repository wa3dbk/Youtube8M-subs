screen<00:00:19.830> little<00:00:20.550> sugar<00:00:20.730> water<00:00:20.820> gives<00:00:21.689> them

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
screen little sugar water gives them

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.269 
screen little sugar water gives them
something<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.170> think<00:00:22.289> about<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.160> also

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
something to think about and it also

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.779 
something to think about and it also
calms<00:00:23.730> them<00:00:23.850> down<00:00:24.289> so<00:00:25.289> we've<00:00:25.470> been<00:00:25.560> told<00:00:25.789> and

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.550 
calms them down so we've been told and
it<00:00:26.910> seems<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.660> can't<00:00:27.840> really<00:00:27.990> over<00:00:28.289> spray

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.100 
sunny and it's warm so that's that so
the<00:00:35.880> next<00:00:36.000> thing<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.210> we're<00:00:36.420> gonna<00:00:36.510> most

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
the next thing is we're gonna most

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.380 
the next thing is we're gonna most
packages<00:00:37.500> have<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.730> cannon<00:00:38.730> here<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.120> sugar

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
packages have a cannon here of sugar

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.880 
packages have a cannon here of sugar
water<00:00:39.540> but<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:39.960> one<00:00:40.110> doesn't<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.530> just

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
water but this one doesn't this just

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.459 
water but this one doesn't this just
came<00:00:41.040> from<00:00:41.160> Georgia<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:41.730> they<00:00:41.969> didn't<00:00:42.210> have<00:00:42.329> a

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
came from Georgia so they didn't have a

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.680 
came from Georgia so they didn't have a
can<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.680> them<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.610> you'd<00:00:45.030> usually<00:00:45.390> pull<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
can in them so you'd usually pull the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.080 
can in them so you'd usually pull the
can<00:00:45.930> out<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.379> after<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:47.460> pull<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> Queen<00:00:47.969> out

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
can out and after you pull the Queen out

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.400 
can out and after you pull the Queen out
and<00:00:48.210> that's<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.450> Queen<00:00:48.660> tab<00:00:48.899> right<00:00:49.079> there<00:00:49.110> so

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
and that's the Queen tab right there so

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.170 
and that's the Queen tab right there so
we're<00:00:49.530> gonna<00:00:49.620> pull<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:49.980> out<00:00:52.969> it's<00:00:53.969> good<00:00:54.090> to

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
we're gonna pull that out it's good to

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.229 
we're gonna pull that out it's good to
work<00:00:54.300> with<00:00:54.329> no<00:00:54.600> hands<00:00:54.870> if<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.140> can<00:00:55.940> no<00:00:56.940> gloves

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
work with no hands if you can no gloves

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.910 
work with no hands if you can no gloves
no<00:00:57.510> hands<00:00:57.719> would<00:00:57.870> be<00:00:57.899> harder<00:00:58.440> because<00:00:58.649> you

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
no hands would be harder because you

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.790 
no hands would be harder because you
would<00:00:59.039> have<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.940> use<00:01:00.090> hooks<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:01.230> that's<00:01:01.620> a

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
would have to use hooks but that's a

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.579 
would have to use hooks but that's a
different<00:01:02.160> problem<00:01:02.309> okay<00:01:03.379> so<00:01:04.379> we're<00:01:04.470> gonna

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
different problem okay so we're gonna

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.990 
different problem okay so we're gonna
