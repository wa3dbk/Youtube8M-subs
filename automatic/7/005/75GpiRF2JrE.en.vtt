00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
the capabilities to do that but frap

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.120 
the capabilities to do that but frap
certainly<00:02:12.220> does<00:02:12.400> or<00:02:12.670> did<00:02:12.880> with<00:02:13.600> windows<00:02:13.930> 7<00:02:14.260> it

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
certainly does or did with windows 7 it

certainly does or did with windows 7 it
was<00:02:15.340> very<00:02:15.370> simple<00:02:15.850> thing<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:16.150> was<00:02:16.239> just<00:02:16.390> a

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
was very simple thing it was just a

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.120 
was very simple thing it was just a
little<00:02:16.630> check<00:02:16.840> box<00:02:16.870> you<00:02:17.320> checked<00:02:17.560> on<00:02:17.709> but

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
little check box you checked on but

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.350 
little check box you checked on but

unfortunately we've windows out and look

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.479 
unfortunately we've windows out and look

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
windows 8 when you check that on it

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
won't record so I couldn't record me

won't record so I couldn't record me
changing<00:02:28.660> it<00:02:28.750> but<00:02:29.110> what<00:02:29.260> it<00:02:29.380> is<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:30.310> do<00:02:30.430> with<00:02:30.670> is

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
changing it but what it is to do with is

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.449 
changing it but what it is to do with is
your<00:02:31.390> mouse<00:02:31.570> and<00:02:31.900> it<00:02:32.560> will<00:02:32.709> actually<00:02:32.950> help

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
your mouse and it will actually help

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.390 
your mouse and it will actually help
increase<00:02:34.060> your<00:02:34.500> accuracy<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:35.799> improve<00:02:36.220> your

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
increase your accuracy and improve your

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.789 
increase your accuracy and improve your
own<00:02:36.549> okay<00:02:37.239> so<00:02:37.299> what<00:02:37.510> it<00:02:37.600> is<00:02:37.690> is<00:02:38.079> a<00:02:38.110> little<00:02:38.530> check

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799

when you first put your computer up and

it's called enhance point of precision

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.199 
it's called enhance point of precision
now<00:02:45.310> i'm<00:02:45.400> not<00:02:45.519> going<00:02:45.639> to<00:02:45.669> get<00:02:45.790> into<00:02:45.970> the

now i'm not going to get into the

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.150 
now i'm not going to get into the
nitty-gritty<00:02:46.840> details<00:02:47.139> but<00:02:47.650> essentially

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
nitty-gritty details but essentially

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.360 
nitty-gritty details but essentially
it's

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
it's

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.820 
it's
to<00:02:48.430> do<00:02:48.549> with<00:02:48.730> mouse<00:02:48.940> acceleration<00:02:49.840> so<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.620> guess

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
to do with mouse acceleration so I guess

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.250 
to do with mouse acceleration so I guess
the<00:02:51.010> best<00:02:51.159> way<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.400> explain<00:02:51.849> it<00:02:51.970> is<00:02:52.269> that<00:02:52.330> if

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
the best way to explain it is that if

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.160 
the best way to explain it is that if
you<00:02:53.440> move<00:02:53.920> your<00:02:54.159> mouse<00:02:54.390> exactly<00:02:55.390> one<00:02:55.599> inch<00:02:55.840> on

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
you move your mouse exactly one inch on

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.780 
you move your mouse exactly one inch on
your<00:02:56.379> mouse<00:02:56.530> pad<00:02:56.769> to<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.099> right<00:02:57.280> and<00:02:57.519> you<00:02:57.640> do

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
your mouse pad to the right and you do

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.539 
your mouse pad to the right and you do
it<00:02:57.909> very<00:02:57.940> slowly<00:02:58.330> you<00:02:59.110> might<00:02:59.319> turn<00:02:59.560> around<00:02:59.860> for

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
it very slowly you might turn around for

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:01.949 
it very slowly you might turn around for
argument's<00:03:00.700> sake<00:03:01.120> to<00:03:01.269> keep<00:03:01.420> it<00:03:01.540> easy<00:03:01.659> let's

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
argument's sake to keep it easy let's

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.259 
argument's sake to keep it easy let's
say<00:03:02.080> a<00:03:02.110> hundred<00:03:02.319> to<00:03:02.560> 80<00:03:02.739> degrees<00:03:03.030> but<00:03:04.030> if<00:03:04.180> you

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
say a hundred to 80 degrees but if you

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.819 
say a hundred to 80 degrees but if you
then<00:03:04.480> reset<00:03:04.959> your<00:03:05.049> mouse<00:03:05.230> back<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:05.590> where<00:03:05.739> you

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
then reset your mouse back to where you

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.069 
then reset your mouse back to where you
started<00:03:05.860> and<00:03:06.489> very<00:03:07.030> quickly<00:03:07.090> move<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.900> mouse

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
started and very quickly move the mouse

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.339 
started and very quickly move the mouse
one<00:03:08.349> inch<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.010> right<00:03:09.989> because<00:03:10.989> of<00:03:11.170> this

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
one inch to the right because of this

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.740 
one inch to the right because of this
added<00:03:11.860> Mouse<00:03:12.340> acceleration<00:03:13.180> you<00:03:13.569> might

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
added Mouse acceleration you might

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.089 
added Mouse acceleration you might
actually<00:03:13.900> spin<00:03:14.260> around<00:03:14.409> a<00:03:14.620> lot<00:03:14.739> further<00:03:14.950> you

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
actually spin around a lot further you

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.360 
actually spin around a lot further you
must<00:03:15.280> be<00:03:15.400> around<00:03:15.549> 270<00:03:16.480> degrees<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:17.370> and

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
must be around 270 degrees and and

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.979 
must be around 270 degrees and and
obviously<00:03:18.760> that<00:03:18.849> means<00:03:19.120> that<00:03:19.599> it's<00:03:19.810> going<00:03:19.930> to

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
obviously that means that it's going to

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.360 
obviously that means that it's going to
make<00:03:20.140> getting<00:03:20.500> used<00:03:20.680> to<00:03:20.859> any<00:03:21.099> mouse

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
make getting used to any mouse

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.819 
make getting used to any mouse
sensitivity<00:03:21.609> a<00:03:22.030> little<00:03:22.299> bit<00:03:22.420> hard<00:03:22.629> and<00:03:23.109> yeah

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
sensitivity a little bit hard and yeah

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.140 
sensitivity a little bit hard and yeah
now<00:03:24.280> that<00:03:24.430> I've<00:03:24.519> said<00:03:24.700> that<00:03:24.849> you<00:03:24.940> may<00:03:25.120> have

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
now that I've said that you may have

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.910 
now that I've said that you may have
noticed<00:03:25.599> if<00:03:25.780> you<00:03:26.019> turn<00:03:26.470> around<00:03:26.620> too<00:03:26.890> quickly

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
noticed if you turn around too quickly

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.819 
noticed if you turn around too quickly
snap<00:03:27.579> on<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:27.879> someone<00:03:28.530> you<00:03:29.530> might<00:03:29.680> have

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
snap on to someone you might have

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.000 
snap on to someone you might have
overshot<00:03:30.250> it<00:03:30.310> or<00:03:30.670> you<00:03:30.849> know<00:03:31.000> gone<00:03:31.329> past<00:03:31.569> him<00:03:32.010> so

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
overshot it or you know gone past him so

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.780 
overshot it or you know gone past him so
if<00:03:33.069> you<00:03:33.310> disable<00:03:34.269> that<00:03:34.510> or<00:03:34.780> uncheck<00:03:35.379> the<00:03:35.560> box

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
if you disable that or uncheck the box

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.979 
if you disable that or uncheck the box
it<00:03:36.790> means<00:03:37.030> your<00:03:37.239> mass<00:03:37.390> is<00:03:37.569> always<00:03:37.750> going<00:03:37.870> to<00:03:37.959> be

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
it means your mass is always going to be

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.720 
it means your mass is always going to be
consistent<00:03:38.590> no<00:03:38.650> matter<00:03:38.680> if<00:03:38.950> you<00:03:39.069> quickly<00:03:39.370> move

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
consistent no matter if you quickly move

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.569 
consistent no matter if you quickly move
your<00:03:40.090> mouse<00:03:40.269> to<00:03:40.450> an<00:03:41.290> inch<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.739> right<00:03:41.799> or<00:03:42.250> if

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
your mouse to an inch to the right or if

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.099 
your mouse to an inch to the right or if
you<00:03:42.670> very<00:03:42.849> slowly<00:03:43.030> move<00:03:43.420> it<00:03:43.599> you<00:03:43.690> know<00:03:43.900> you're

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
you very slowly move it you know you're

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:45.660 
you very slowly move it you know you're
going<00:03:44.230> to<00:03:44.319> be<00:03:44.379> turning<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.769> same<00:03:45.040> distance

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
going to be turning the same distance

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.860 
going to be turning the same distance
and<00:03:45.819> it<00:03:46.090> does<00:03:46.209> actually<00:03:46.329> make<00:03:46.540> a<00:03:46.629> big

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
and it does actually make a big

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.380 
and it does actually make a big
difference<00:03:47.049> in<00:03:47.349> help<00:03:47.530> with<00:03:47.680> accuracy<00:03:48.359> so<00:03:49.359> I

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
difference in help with accuracy so I

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.599 
difference in help with accuracy so I
guess<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.870> next<00:03:49.989> step<00:03:50.170> is<00:03:50.530> how<00:03:50.799> to<00:03:50.859> disable<00:03:51.340> it

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
guess the next step is how to disable it

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.670 
guess the next step is how to disable it
so<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.269> first<00:03:52.389> thing<00:03:52.540> you<00:03:52.780> need<00:03:52.930> to<00:03:52.989> do<00:03:53.349> in

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
so the first thing you need to do in

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.190 
so the first thing you need to do in
Windows<00:03:54.190> is<00:03:54.609> go<00:03:54.790> to<00:03:54.849> control<00:03:55.450> panel<00:03:55.569> now

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
Windows is go to control panel now

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.020 
Windows is go to control panel now
hopefully<00:03:56.560> most<00:03:57.160> of<00:03:57.340> you<00:03:57.400> can<00:03:57.579> navigate<00:03:57.700> your

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
hopefully most of you can navigate your

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.210 
hopefully most of you can navigate your
way<00:03:58.090> to<00:03:58.299> control<00:03:58.989> panel<00:03:59.260> once<00:03:59.950> you're<00:04:00.130> in

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
way to control panel once you're in

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.520 
way to control panel once you're in
control<00:04:00.519> panel<00:04:00.639> you<00:04:01.060> need<00:04:01.239> to<00:04:01.359> go<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.569> hardware

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
control panel you need to go to hardware

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.740 
control panel you need to go to hardware
and<00:04:02.829> sound<00:04:03.190> or<00:04:03.549> at<00:04:03.639> least<00:04:03.790> view<00:04:04.030> your<00:04:04.239> hardware

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
and sound or at least view your hardware

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.690 
and sound or at least view your hardware
devices<00:04:05.109> or<00:04:05.500> depending<00:04:06.129> on<00:04:06.220> which<00:04:06.370> version<00:04:06.400> of

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
on that a small box will appear on the

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.830 
on that a small box will appear on the
screen<00:04:17.440> and<00:04:18.150> along<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.299> top<00:04:19.479> you've<00:04:19.660> got<00:04:19.690> a

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
screen and along the top you've got a

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.680 
screen and along the top you've got a
whole<00:04:20.079> bunch<00:04:20.229> of<00:04:20.560> tabs<00:04:20.949> well<00:04:21.699> the<00:04:21.910> third<00:04:22.270> tab

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
whole bunch of tabs well the third tab

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.040 
whole bunch of tabs well the third tab
along<00:04:22.990> is<00:04:23.260> called<00:04:23.530> pointer<00:04:24.130> options<00:04:24.310> and<00:04:25.060> the

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
along is called pointer options and the

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.540 
along is called pointer options and the
very<00:04:26.199> top<00:04:26.380> one<00:04:26.560> you'll<00:04:26.800> see<00:04:27.039> there's<00:04:27.280> some

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
very top one you'll see there's some

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.370 
very top one you'll see there's some
selected<00:04:28.000> pointer<00:04:28.330> speed<00:04:28.660> which<00:04:28.990> is<00:04:29.020> fairly

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
selected pointer speed which is fairly

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.469 
selected pointer speed which is fairly
obviously<00:04:29.770> that's<00:04:30.070> what<00:04:30.280> it<00:04:30.370> is<00:04:30.400> and<00:04:31.330> then

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
obviously that's what it is and then

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.150 
obviously that's what it is and then
underneath<00:04:31.660> that<00:04:32.080> is<00:04:32.260> a<00:04:32.289> check<00:04:32.560> box<00:04:32.590> that<00:04:33.039> will

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
underneath that is a check box that will

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.159 
underneath that is a check box that will
be<00:04:33.310> ticked<00:04:33.580> called<00:04:34.150> enhance<00:04:34.630> pointer

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
be ticked called enhance pointer

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.189 
be ticked called enhance pointer
precision<00:04:35.710> so<00:04:36.220> if<00:04:36.280> you<00:04:36.340> uncheck<00:04:36.520> that<00:04:36.789> box

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
precision so if you uncheck that box

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.300 
precision so if you uncheck that box
you'll<00:04:38.199> notice<00:04:38.530> straightaway<00:04:38.770> that<00:04:39.099> the

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
you'll notice straightaway that the

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.370 
you'll notice straightaway that the
mouse<00:04:39.490> feels<00:04:39.820> a<00:04:39.880> lot<00:04:40.030> slower<00:04:40.539> and<00:04:40.870> if<00:04:41.260> you've

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
mouse feels a lot slower and if you've

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.129 
mouse feels a lot slower and if you've
got<00:04:41.560> an<00:04:41.650> adjustable<00:04:41.919> DPI<00:04:42.610> mouse<00:04:42.970> you<00:04:43.840> may<00:04:43.990> need

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
got an adjustable DPI mouse you may need

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:45.750 
got an adjustable DPI mouse you may need
to<00:04:44.320> increase<00:04:44.650> it<00:04:44.860> or<00:04:44.949> just<00:04:45.160> increase<00:04:45.520> your

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
to increase it or just increase your

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.089 
to increase it or just increase your
pointer<00:04:46.599> speed<00:04:46.810> because<00:04:47.260> it<00:04:47.380> will<00:04:47.530> feel<00:04:47.830> a<00:04:47.860> bit

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
pointer speed because it will feel a bit

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:49.379 
pointer speed because it will feel a bit
dull<00:04:48.310> we<00:04:48.490> because<00:04:48.789> you<00:04:48.880> don't<00:04:49.090> have<00:04:49.270> that

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
dull we because you don't have that

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.180 
dull we because you don't have that
Mouse<00:04:49.570> acceleration<00:04:50.349> that<00:04:50.440> you<00:04:50.560> had<00:04:50.770> prior

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
Mouse acceleration that you had prior

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.760 
Mouse acceleration that you had prior
but<00:04:51.729> anyway<00:04:52.030> uncheck<00:04:52.479> that<00:04:52.590> it'll<00:04:53.590> take<00:04:53.740> a

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
but anyway uncheck that it'll take a

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.710 
but anyway uncheck that it'll take a
little<00:04:53.949> bit<00:04:54.099> of<00:04:54.160> getting<00:04:54.310> used<00:04:54.460> to<00:04:54.760> in<00:04:55.180> Windows

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
little bit of getting used to in Windows

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.060 
little bit of getting used to in Windows
but<00:04:55.930> as<00:04:56.020> soon<00:04:56.139> as<00:04:56.260> you<00:04:56.349> get<00:04:56.469> into<00:04:56.650> battlefield

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
but as soon as you get into battlefield

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.980 
but as soon as you get into battlefield
3<00:04:57.250> it<00:04:57.400> will<00:04:57.520> all<00:04:57.729> make<00:04:57.760> sense<00:04:57.969> and<00:04:58.570> you<00:04:58.870> may

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
3 it will all make sense and you may

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.900 
3 it will all make sense and you may
we'll<00:04:59.169> find<00:04:59.380> you<00:04:59.469> a<00:04:59.530> curious
