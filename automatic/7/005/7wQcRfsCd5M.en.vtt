take these out put them inside of a bin
put<00:02:09.550> them<00:02:09.640> underneath<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.000> heat<00:02:10.270> bring<00:02:10.720> the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
put them underneath the heat bring the

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.120 
put them underneath the heat bring the
bins<00:02:10.990> in<00:02:11.170> there<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.410> clean<00:02:11.560> their<00:02:11.740> toys<00:02:11.920> at

bins in there and clean their toys at
the<00:02:12.160> same<00:02:12.370> time<00:02:12.610> so<00:02:13.210> it<00:02:13.270> really<00:02:13.450> doesn't<00:02:13.630> take

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
the same time so it really doesn't take

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.990 
the same time so it really doesn't take
that<00:02:14.110> long<00:02:14.310> but<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:15.460> does<00:02:15.580> take<00:02:15.790> at<00:02:15.910> least
