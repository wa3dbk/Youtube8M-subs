00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.590
 just over a month ago 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:15.849
 What do you usually use when you talk about the mayor? 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:17.880
 it's much bigger 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.810
 and wears a black helmet 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.810
 The goal is okay. 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.579
 archeologists hour plus taste of what we want 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.369
 and so it goes 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.369
 I know we have 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.820
 but if you want 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.710
 I'm so brave martins 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.020
 the first thing I'm going to do 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.020
 it's us 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.130
 and we stayed 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.130
 so you have to go 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.180
 these white ducks 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.180
 ls 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.960
 will be placed in searches 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.840
 others are entitled 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.820
 we play forward 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.990
 do not just turn 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.750
 serpa is part of 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.570
 if you make them 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.770
 and places in their places 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.300
 I'm looking for another step. 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.590
 of security 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.590
 until on one side 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.060
 because there is no certainty will bring non-technical losses 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.310
 to 15 months to turn 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.650
 in my home 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.650
 they have physical problems 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.660
 last year 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.370
 to the 10 douglas occurred year 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.370
 james woolsey jewish people 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.520
 only in august 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.520
 only with the majority 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.530
 only these two areas 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.530
 customers too 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.740
 try to put it on top of what we do 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.679
 if need be 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.849
 ten people who bundle works 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.959
 even though you already did 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.599
 You'll pass something so early. 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.139
 If you 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:22.139
 will lose position 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.229
 it's me sasha 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:27.499
 São Paulo 6 0% 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:30.499
 You wind up out of the air. 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:34.299
 You do two others. 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.659
 monthly work here 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.719
 the networks but what you think when you go down do not get caught in this tide of 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:42.289
 defeats 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:45.289
 when you leave seven kids if you do not like 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.629
 clear at home 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.980
 now you got injured due to injury coming in the month in May 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:57.759
 three companies 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:00.489
 parpública specialists 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.489
 here you will see what is best you are doing well 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:09.559
 what is the taste percent from here because if you put a rugby team 

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:12.959
 The mota-engil will not work there 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.089
 I put a party at the bar and pool. 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:19.759
 the ball box passes near the beam without a prescription is a toy 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.509
 this gives 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:26.509
 already in vila nova-mg 

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:31.559
 I intend that next year 

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:34.559
 from pmdb 

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:39.589
 hold in the right position 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.409
 without money 

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:48.009
 without the stress of work 

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:51.529
 so let it 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:54.529
 towards the end of the piece 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:59.499
 Miguel Pupo 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:03.669
 the local government of voting 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.239
 which is a red carpet that will carry dock at the pier 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.199
 then the tricolor 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:13.199
 carry home to where you lived 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:20.609
 josé lapa coffee put from here score 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.609
 you think twice 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.580
 the first place 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.580
 now with this part of the public river green 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.509
 Yesterday 2 to 0 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.990
 he who is also so perfect for you 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.990
 I bet celso roth 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.210
 is an advantage because if he happens to be 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:00.210
 the end of the year 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.839
 also the pcp 

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:03.999
 What are you going to put the ps 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:04.949
 do you want 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:06.860
 ahead 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.699
 guttenberg 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.580
 You'll share yourself with that, too. 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.529
 ball forward a left to right 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:17.529
 wrong 

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:24.859
 the position when they were only four exchanged 

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:31.089
 the palace is going to get the grandson 1st battalion 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.419
 but the ps3 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.089
 Can anyone be on a bicycle? 

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:39.089
 in my head, behind 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:43.789
 edward j 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:46.789
 There you go and get another one. 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:01.499
 or private 

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:03.069
 in the second step 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:03.759
