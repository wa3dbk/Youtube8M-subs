00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.050 
seems the running away they're gonna fly
away<00:01:57.259> these<00:01:57.560> slugs<00:01:57.920> have<00:01:58.159> very<00:01:58.759> good

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
away these slugs have very good

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.139 
away these slugs have very good
aerodynamics<00:02:00.020> it's<00:02:00.259> very<00:02:00.530> unfortunate<00:02:00.979> oh<00:02:01.460> I

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
aerodynamics it's very unfortunate oh I

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:03.609 
aerodynamics it's very unfortunate oh I
don't<00:02:02.299> think<00:02:02.509> I'll<00:02:02.750> be<00:02:02.869> able<00:02:02.899> to<00:02:03.079> catch<00:02:03.259> up<00:02:03.469> to

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
don't think I'll be able to catch up to

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.980 
don't think I'll be able to catch up to
them<00:02:03.740> oh<00:02:03.950> no<00:02:04.520> there<00:02:05.030> goes<00:02:05.299> one<00:02:05.539> off<00:02:05.719> to<00:02:05.899> the

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
them oh no there goes one off to the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.929 
them oh no there goes one off to the
right<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.469> there<00:02:06.920> goes<00:02:07.070> one<00:02:07.250> off<00:02:07.399> to<00:02:07.579> the<00:02:07.609> left

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
right and there goes one off to the left

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.120 
right and there goes one off to the left
that's<00:02:08.660> very<00:02:09.020> unfortunate<00:02:09.350> that<00:02:09.800> they<00:02:09.950> ran

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
that's very unfortunate that they ran

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.000 
that's very unfortunate that they ran
away<00:02:10.250> so<00:02:11.150> here<00:02:11.420> I<00:02:11.450> am<00:02:11.570> in<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.900> wild<00:02:12.260> once<00:02:12.590> again

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
away so here I am in the wild once again

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.530 
away so here I am in the wild once again
and<00:02:13.250> I've<00:02:13.700> actually<00:02:13.880> stumbled<00:02:14.330> across

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
and I've actually stumbled across

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.510 
and I've actually stumbled across
through<00:02:15.020> while<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.470> animals<00:02:15.830> here<00:02:16.070> one<00:02:16.430> on

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
through while the animals here one on

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.460 
through while the animals here one on
the<00:02:16.610> left<00:02:16.940> there<00:02:17.150> looks<00:02:17.360> like<00:02:17.450> it's<00:02:17.810> a<00:02:17.960> zebra

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
the left there looks like it's a zebra

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.090 
the left there looks like it's a zebra
one

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
one

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.730 
one
the<00:02:19.160> right<00:02:19.430> is<00:02:19.670> most<00:02:20.180> likely<00:02:20.450> an<00:02:20.840> Impala<00:02:21.350> so

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
the right is most likely an Impala so

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.440 
the right is most likely an Impala so
these<00:02:22.100> two<00:02:22.280> animals<00:02:22.460> are<00:02:22.790> obviously<00:02:23.150> going

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
these two animals are obviously going

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.630 
these two animals are obviously going
for<00:02:23.690> a<00:02:23.720> drink<00:02:24.140> due<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.800> hot<00:02:25.040> summer<00:02:25.370> day

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
has taken it and run off that leaves the

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.640 
has taken it and run off that leaves the
Impala<00:02:40.370> all<00:02:40.700> alone<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.780> look<00:02:42.080> up<00:02:42.260> there<00:02:42.470> in

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
Impala all alone and look up there in

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.500 
Impala all alone and look up there in
the<00:02:42.740> sky<00:02:42.860> it<00:02:43.310> looks<00:02:43.700> like<00:02:43.910> those<00:02:44.120> are<00:02:44.330> two

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510

the sky it looks like those are two
vultures<00:02:44.900> I<00:02:45.380> wonder<00:02:46.010> what<00:02:46.160> they're<00:02:46.310> trying<00:02:46.640> to

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
vultures I wonder what they're trying to

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.270 
vultures I wonder what they're trying to
actually<00:02:47.000> Oh<00:02:47.360> probably<00:02:48.140> right<00:02:48.560> there<00:02:48.830> that

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
dead rabbit carcass and that's probably

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.650 
dead rabbit carcass and that's probably
what<00:02:52.130> they're<00:02:52.310> trying<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:52.700> get<00:02:53.000> I'm<00:02:53.210> wondering

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
what they're trying to get I'm wondering

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.570 
what they're trying to get I'm wondering
why<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:54.230> woolly<00:02:54.620> mammoth<00:02:54.710> hasn't<00:02:55.310> actually

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
why a woolly mammoth hasn't actually

once again I've managed to find four

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.750 
once again I've managed to find four
species<00:03:27.110> of<00:03:27.590> different<00:03:28.040> types<00:03:28.250> of<00:03:28.400> animals

from<00:03:33.770> left<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.130> right<00:03:34.220> we<00:03:34.580> have<00:03:34.760> a<00:03:34.910> cantaloupe

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
from left to right we have a cantaloupe

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.020 
from left to right we have a cantaloupe
another<00:03:36.050> cantaloupe<00:03:36.620> a<00:03:36.800> slot<00:03:37.220> and<00:03:37.490> another

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
another cantaloupe a slot and another

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.330 
another cantaloupe a slot and another
cantaloupe<00:03:38.600> so<00:03:38.900> let<00:03:39.620> me<00:03:39.650> see<00:03:39.920> if<00:03:39.950> I<00:03:40.070> can<00:03:40.220> get<00:03:40.280> a

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
cantaloupe so let me see if I can get a

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.730 
cantaloupe so let me see if I can get a
little<00:03:40.730> bit<00:03:41.090> closer<00:03:41.420> to<00:03:41.660> them<00:03:41.960> without<00:03:42.350> them

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
little bit closer to them without them
