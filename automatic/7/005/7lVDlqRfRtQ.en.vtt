down<00:02:51.200> with<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.010> big<00:02:52.340> seller<00:02:52.700> of<00:02:52.850> this<00:02:53.090> pack<00:02:53.359> and

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
down with a big seller of this pack and

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.539 
down with a big seller of this pack and
the<00:02:53.720> best<00:02:53.900> thing<00:02:54.109> about<00:02:54.230> this<00:02:54.350> pack<00:02:54.769> is<00:02:55.010> the

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
the best thing about this pack is the

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.819 
the best thing about this pack is the
hip<00:02:55.730> belt<00:02:55.970> you<00:02:56.450> can<00:02:56.570> see<00:02:56.810> that<00:02:56.840> it's<00:02:57.200> mesh<00:02:57.560> so

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
hip belt you can see that it's mesh so

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.920 
hip belt you can see that it's mesh so
it's<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.130> lightweight<00:02:58.549> hip<00:02:59.090> belt<00:02:59.299> but<00:02:59.810> yet

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
it's a lightweight hip belt but yet

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.479 
it's a lightweight hip belt but yet
there's<00:03:00.109> also<00:03:00.350> a<00:03:00.500> nice<00:03:00.680> good<00:03:00.920> padding<00:03:01.310> here

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
there's also a nice good padding here

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.210 
there's also a nice good padding here
the<00:03:02.030> best<00:03:02.239> thing<00:03:02.480> is<00:03:02.630> this<00:03:02.780> mobility<00:03:03.199> on<00:03:03.709> back

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
the best thing is this mobility on back

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.280 
the best thing is this mobility on back
system<00:03:04.639> as<00:03:04.820> you<00:03:05.239> can<00:03:05.359> see<00:03:05.570> the<00:03:05.720> entire<00:03:05.810> hip

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
system as you can see the entire hip

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.490 
system as you can see the entire hip
belt<00:03:06.500> swings

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
belt swings

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.830 
belt swings
and<00:03:07.640> kind<00:03:08.640> of<00:03:08.730> works<00:03:08.940> so<00:03:09.210> that<00:03:09.240> when<00:03:09.690> you're

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
and kind of works so that when you're

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.020 
and kind of works so that when you're
hiking<00:03:10.200> it'll<00:03:10.950> actually<00:03:11.130> go<00:03:11.490> along<00:03:11.730> with<00:03:11.910> your

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
hiking it'll actually go along with your

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.870 
hiking it'll actually go along with your
hip<00:03:12.210> flexors<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:12.630> with<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:13.520> with<00:03:14.520> your<00:03:14.670> legs

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
hip flexors and with and with your legs

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.460 
hip flexors and with and with your legs
when<00:03:15.120> you're<00:03:15.240> stepping<00:03:15.450> scrambling<00:03:16.320> up

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
when you're stepping scrambling up

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.980 
when you're stepping scrambling up
things<00:03:16.710> there's<00:03:17.700> other<00:03:18.210> backpacks<00:03:18.720> out<00:03:18.900> on

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
things there's other backpacks out on

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.600 
things there's other backpacks out on
the<00:03:19.080> market<00:03:19.380> that<00:03:19.500> have<00:03:19.710> similar<00:03:20.010> type<00:03:20.400> of

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
the market that have similar type of

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.540 
the market that have similar type of
systems<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.900> difference<00:03:22.290> between<00:03:22.380> this<00:03:23.280> pack

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
systems the difference between this pack

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.460 
systems the difference between this pack
and<00:03:23.790> those<00:03:23.910> packs<00:03:24.240> is<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:24.959> this<00:03:25.080> is<00:03:25.290> much

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
and those packs is that this is much

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.430 
and those packs is that this is much
higher<00:03:25.770> usually<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:27.450> pivoting<00:03:27.870> point<00:03:28.200> is

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
higher usually the pivoting point is

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.660 
higher usually the pivoting point is
down<00:03:28.650> here<00:03:28.890> low<00:03:29.130> so<00:03:29.700> it's<00:03:29.880> like<00:03:29.940> on<00:03:30.590> the

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
down here low so it's like on the

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.090 
down here low so it's like on the
basically<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.850> back<00:03:33.690> of<00:03:33.930> your<00:03:34.050> tailbone<00:03:34.860> and

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
basically the back of your tailbone and

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.130 
basically the back of your tailbone and
this<00:03:35.490> one<00:03:35.670> is<00:03:35.790> actually<00:03:35.940> up<00:03:36.270> higher<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:36.570> its<00:03:37.020> up

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
this one is actually up higher so its up

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.020 
this one is actually up higher so its up
more<00:03:37.320> like<00:03:37.470> your<00:03:37.650> lumbar<00:03:38.100> and<00:03:38.280> actually<00:03:38.970> I

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
more like your lumbar and actually I

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.729 
more like your lumbar and actually I
think<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.330> get<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.510> lot<00:03:39.690> more<00:03:39.720> mobility<00:03:40.230> out<00:03:40.590> of

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
think you get a lot more mobility out of

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.130 
think you get a lot more mobility out of
this<00:03:40.860> because<00:03:41.070> of<00:03:41.489> that<00:03:41.640> so<00:03:42.330> of<00:03:42.570> all<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.750> packs

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
this because of that so of all the packs

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.199 
this because of that so of all the packs
I've<00:03:43.350> tested<00:03:43.800> through<00:03:44.280> four<00:03:44.520> different<00:03:45.000> packs

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
I've tested through four different packs

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.630 
I've tested through four different packs
with<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.630> hip<00:03:45.959> belt<00:03:46.140> system<00:03:46.380> that<00:03:46.950> swivels<00:03:47.430> or

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
with the hip belt system that swivels or

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.880 
with the hip belt system that swivels or
moves<00:03:47.940> around<00:03:48.180> this<00:03:48.720> is<00:03:48.959> um<00:03:49.200> probably<00:03:49.680> the

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
moves around this is um probably the

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.590 
moves around this is um probably the
most<00:03:50.070> mobile<00:03:50.370> of<00:03:50.640> any<00:03:50.820> of<00:03:50.970> those<00:03:51.090> packs<00:03:51.420> that

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
most mobile of any of those packs that

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.510 
most mobile of any of those packs that
I've<00:03:51.810> tested<00:03:52.260> so<00:03:53.070> even<00:03:53.280> though<00:03:53.310> it's

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
I've tested so even though it's

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.760 
I've tested so even though it's
lightweight<00:03:53.730> is<00:03:54.090> still<00:03:54.300> tough<00:03:54.540> we<00:03:55.320> tested<00:03:55.709> it

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
lightweight is still tough we tested it

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.860 
lightweight is still tough we tested it
in<00:03:55.890> Peru<00:03:56.070> on<00:03:56.400> a<00:03:56.430> couple<00:03:56.790> of<00:03:56.940> nineteen<00:03:57.840> and

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
in Peru on a couple of nineteen and

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.510 
in Peru on a couple of nineteen and
twenty<00:03:58.050> thousand<00:03:58.590> foot<00:03:58.739> Peaks<00:03:58.980> impacted

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
twenty thousand foot Peaks impacted

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.760 
twenty thousand foot Peaks impacted
really<00:03:59.730> well<00:03:59.910> as<00:04:00.150> durable<00:04:00.570> as<00:04:00.630> tough<00:04:01.020> so<00:04:01.680> if

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
really well as durable as tough so if

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.260 
really well as durable as tough so if
you're<00:04:01.890> looking<00:04:02.010> definitely<00:04:02.820> for<00:04:02.970> a<00:04:03.000> light

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270
