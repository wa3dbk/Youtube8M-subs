that's<00:04:48.780> time<00:04:49.020> for<00:04:49.169> example<00:04:49.580> your<00:04:50.580> skinny

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
that's time for example your skinny

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.360 
that's time for example your skinny
little<00:04:51.300> twig<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:52.139> you<00:04:52.410> do<00:04:52.560> eating<00:04:52.919> contests

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
little twig and you do eating contests

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.999 
little twig and you do eating contests
right<00:04:53.610> so<00:04:53.960> I<00:04:54.960> guess<00:04:55.380> you're<00:04:55.560> not<00:04:55.680> a<00:04:55.740> prime

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:56.009

I'm putting 110% effort into creating

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:58.249 
I'm putting 110% effort into creating
something<00:05:56.400> that<00:05:57.030> you<00:05:57.630> know<00:05:57.750> organize

00:05:58.249 --> 00:05:58.259 
something that you know organize

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:00.140 
something that you know organize
information<00:05:58.500> basically<00:05:59.430> this<00:05:59.669> is<00:05:59.820> the<00:05:59.909> way<00:06:00.030> it

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
information basically this is the way it

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.770 
information basically this is the way it
is<00:06:00.300> online<00:06:01.550> information<00:06:02.550> is<00:06:02.940> free<00:06:03.210> organized

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
is online information is free organized

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.930 
is online information is free organized
information<00:06:04.409> isn't<00:06:04.919> necessarily<00:06:05.550> free

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
information isn't necessarily free

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.600 
information isn't necessarily free
because<00:06:06.270> it<00:06:06.690> takes<00:06:06.960> a<00:06:07.169> lot<00:06:07.590> of<00:06:07.620> energy<00:06:08.280> and<00:06:08.490> a

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
because it takes a lot of energy and a

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.719 
because it takes a lot of energy and a
lot<00:06:08.639> of<00:06:08.909> effort<00:06:09.330> to<00:06:10.139> put<00:06:10.770> something<00:06:10.949> together

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:11.729 
lot of effort to put something together

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.769 
lot of effort to put something together
like<00:06:11.970> that<00:06:12.300> it<00:06:12.539> takes<00:06:12.690> a<00:06:12.870> lot<00:06:13.139> of<00:06:13.169> time<00:06:13.520> and<00:06:14.520> so

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:14.779 
like that it takes a lot of time and so

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:16.969 
like that it takes a lot of time and so
I'm<00:06:15.779> gonna<00:06:15.900> put<00:06:16.139> together<00:06:16.229> something<00:06:16.620> really

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
I'm gonna put together something really

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:18.950 
I'm gonna put together something really
really<00:06:17.099> cool<00:06:17.340> it<00:06:18.120> should<00:06:18.330> be<00:06:18.450> available<00:06:18.630> but
