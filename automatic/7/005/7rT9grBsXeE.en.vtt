00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
players and your team's and matter of

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.059 
players and your team's and matter of
fact<00:00:39.929> here's<00:00:40.229> what<00:00:40.379> I'm<00:00:40.440> talking<00:00:40.800> about<00:00:40.859> it

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:41.069 
fact here's what I'm talking about it

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:43.369 
fact here's what I'm talking about it
right<00:00:41.190> here

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
right here

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.509 
right here
so<00:00:44.379> we<00:00:44.440> think<00:00:44.559> all<00:00:44.739> the<00:00:44.829> factors<00:00:45.160> are<00:00:45.250> going<00:00:45.430> to

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
so we think all the factors are going to

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.100 
so we think all the factors are going to
make<00:00:45.640> it<00:00:45.760> a<00:00:45.820> shot<00:00:46.000> your<00:00:46.359> openness<00:00:46.780> your

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
make it a shot your openness your

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.319 
make it a shot your openness your
attributes<00:00:47.590> the<00:00:47.860> defensive<00:00:48.219> impact<00:00:48.550> and<00:00:48.879> we

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
attributes the defensive impact and we

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:50.970 
attributes the defensive impact and we
put<00:00:49.510> that<00:00:49.600> into<00:00:49.750> a<00:00:49.839> shot<00:00:50.110> meter<00:00:50.320> that<00:00:50.649> grows

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
put that into a shot meter that grows

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.380 
put that into a shot meter that grows
and<00:00:51.160> shrinks<00:00:51.280> most<00:00:51.969> people<00:00:52.180> are<00:00:52.239> at<00:00:52.329> the

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
and shrinks most people are at the

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.399 
and shrinks most people are at the
center<00:00:52.600> of<00:00:52.629> that<00:00:52.719> meter<00:00:52.989> the<00:00:53.260> higher

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
center of that meter the higher

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:55.049 
center of that meter the higher
percentage<00:00:53.620> would<00:00:53.949> be<00:00:54.010> on<00:00:54.159> the<00:00:54.219> shop<00:00:54.430> and<00:00:54.909> so

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
percentage would be on the shop and so

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:56.369 
percentage would be on the shop and so

Curry<00:02:35.830> I'm<00:02:36.129> coming<00:02:36.430> out<00:02:36.550> to<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.790> three-point

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
Curry I'm coming out to the three-point

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.759 
Curry I'm coming out to the three-point
line<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:38.019> know<00:02:38.110> he's<00:02:38.290> still<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.680> best

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
line and you know he's still the best

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.140 
line and you know he's still the best
shooter<00:02:39.069> in<00:02:39.099> the<00:02:39.250> game<00:02:39.430> so<00:02:39.760> it's<00:02:39.790> still<00:02:40.060> gonna

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
shooter in the game so it's still gonna

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.540 
shooter in the game so it's still gonna
be<00:02:40.269> a<00:02:40.390> big<00:02:40.629> spot<00:02:40.930> but<00:02:41.650> it's<00:02:41.800> not<00:02:41.980> as<00:02:42.129> big<00:02:42.310> as<00:02:42.430> if

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
be a big spot but it's not as big as if

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.460 
be a big spot but it's not as big as if
I<00:02:42.640> take<00:02:42.819> a<00:02:42.849> couple<00:02:43.030> steps<00:02:43.269> in<00:02:43.629> like<00:02:43.840> right<00:02:44.080> here

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
I take a couple steps in like right here

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.339 
I take a couple steps in like right here
you<00:02:45.099> see<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.310> blue<00:02:45.819> area<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:46.720> expands<00:02:47.290> a

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
you see that blue area it expands a

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:48.750 
you see that blue area it expands a
little<00:02:47.560> bit<00:02:47.680> more<00:02:47.890> and<00:02:47.980> then<00:02:48.099> even<00:02:48.370> as<00:02:48.459> I<00:02:48.580> go

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
little bit more and then even as I go

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.949 
little bit more and then even as I go
closer<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.420> basket

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
closer to the basket

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.650 
closer to the basket
it<00:02:50.709> pretty<00:02:50.920> much<00:02:51.180> expands<00:02:52.180> all<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.540> way

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
it pretty much expands all the way

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.990 
it pretty much expands all the way
through<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.410> meter<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:54.040> basically<00:02:54.819> what

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
through the meter and basically what

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.120 
through the meter and basically what
that<00:02:55.030> affects<00:02:55.569> is

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
that affects is

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.290 
that affects is
your<00:02:56.280> margin<00:02:56.820> of<00:02:56.910> error<00:02:57.210> so<00:02:58.160> as<00:02:59.160> I'm<00:02:59.580> farther

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
your margin of error so as I'm farther

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.780 
your margin of error so as I'm farther
out<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:01.320> know<00:03:01.740> I<00:03:01.770> have<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.190> be<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.340> little<00:03:02.610> bit

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
out you know I have to be a little bit

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.140 
out you know I have to be a little bit
more<00:03:02.970> precise<00:03:03.420> with<00:03:04.170> my<00:03:04.350> shot<00:03:04.620> timing<00:03:05.160> and

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
more precise with my shot timing and

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.100 
more precise with my shot timing and
then<00:03:06.330> you<00:03:06.750> know<00:03:06.870> as<00:03:07.020> I<00:03:07.050> as<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.830> go<00:03:08.070> in<00:03:08.340> though<00:03:09.110> you

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
then you know as I as I go in though you

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.520 
then you know as I as I go in though you
know<00:03:10.260> much<00:03:10.710> my<00:03:11.160> margin<00:03:11.550> for<00:03:11.700> error<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:13.500> know

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
know much my margin for error you know

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.550 
know much my margin for error you know
it<00:03:13.740> actually<00:03:14.270> increases<00:03:15.270> you<00:03:15.990> know<00:03:16.020> like<00:03:16.320> so

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
it actually increases you know like so

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.200 
it actually increases you know like so
like<00:03:16.770> it<00:03:16.890> like<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.130> said<00:03:17.310> if<00:03:17.430> I'm<00:03:17.550> closer<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:18.120> the

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
like it like I said if I'm closer to the

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.900 
like it like I said if I'm closer to the
basket<00:03:18.630> so<00:03:18.660> you<00:03:19.200> know<00:03:19.590> I<00:03:19.620> can<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.610> know<00:03:20.730> not

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
basket so you know I can you know not

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.500 
basket so you know I can you know not
have<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.270> best<00:03:21.510> shot<00:03:22.380> time<00:03:22.710> or<00:03:23.670> timing<00:03:24.270> on<00:03:24.390> my

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
have the best shot time or timing on my

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.500 
have the best shot time or timing on my
shot<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:24.960> still<00:03:25.290> have<00:03:25.800> a<00:03:25.830> make<00:03:26.100> but<00:03:26.880> when

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
shot and still have a make but when

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.060 
shot and still have a make but when
coming<00:03:27.840> out<00:03:27.990> especially<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.560> three-point

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
coming out especially the three-point

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.980 
coming out especially the three-point
line<00:03:29.250> I'm<00:03:29.760> gonna<00:03:29.940> have<00:03:30.210> to<00:03:30.360> really<00:03:30.660> practice
