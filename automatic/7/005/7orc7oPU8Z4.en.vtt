 [musics] 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.100
 [musics] 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.100
 [applause] 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:27.300
 This will be released next time 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.450
 Sepia ss c 3000 this is a reel 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.500
 It is light what with than anything 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.450
 If the weight is only 120g single handle 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.930
 210g 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.710
 Especially the Egging Akoho amount continues 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.690
 Because there are many motions, there is little fatigue 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.950
 2 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.010
 Brown was human it came I came 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.800
 It's been over here 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.640
 number 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.070
 Smooth sky 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:03.450
 It smoothness of the drag is insanely good 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:09.479
 This Sepia ss c 3000 sdh 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:15.150
 It is in the Egingu to repeat here in the surging I frequently I steel gear Is 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:19.770
 The smoothness is long lasting, so it's tough I'm very happy with the bell 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:23.670
 After that, the Magnum light rotor is installed. 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.130
 Is it just us to pick up the I to slip line incense 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.520
 I have no stress 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.179
 This way 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:37.320
 Digits support drag is also equipped 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:43.800
 Rattling of the reel spool None We have made very little 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:50.280
 And it's smooth and it's smooth out of the drag, but even if it says so , it's a large sound Aoriika 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:53.270
 Peace of mind and we become a specification that can interact It is moreover this design 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.270
 It's really cool 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.270
 Because it is rigid support 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.590
 Smooth out 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:13.640
 It is an image that I will leave a little when I get too scolded 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.640
 You can swim the station with moderate power 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.540
 A resignation can be inserted 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.410
 After do this have very now I'd line Tteyuu this ne new g 5 line 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.500
 Gane 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:30.430
 Specifically to is a little fast rate at which the sinking and know Parare come sutsu 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:35.140
 When the sound buoyancy of the p line is too strong 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:37.720
 E of sinking in the slowed down enough to throw Throw a considerable I subsidence speed distance 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.120
 It is also good to return the line 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.540
 [musics] 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.540
 A large 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.750
 The 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.490
 Drag from this pot etc 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.100
 I also have 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.800
 In steel gear 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.230
 Even things 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.090
 Good bend

 What matter Rappu 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:19.709
 Steel gear mounted ss 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.709
 I can take it before
