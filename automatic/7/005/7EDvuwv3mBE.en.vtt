underrated<00:04:03.780> player<00:04:03.959> and<00:04:04.799> coca<00:04:05.609> actually<00:04:06.000> did

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
underrated player and coca actually did

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.179 
underrated player and coca actually did
very<00:04:06.389> well<00:04:06.449> in<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:07.290> center<00:04:07.620> mid<00:04:07.769> role<00:04:07.979> I

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:08.189 
very well in the center mid role I

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:10.069 
very well in the center mid role I
thought<00:04:08.579> he<00:04:08.729> might<00:04:09.060> you<00:04:09.329> know<00:04:09.479> sort<00:04:09.810> of<00:04:09.840> get<00:04:10.049> a

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
thought he might you know sort of get a

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:11.569 
thought he might you know sort of get a
bit<00:04:10.290> lost<00:04:10.470> because<00:04:10.769> he's<00:04:10.949> more<00:04:11.400> of<00:04:11.489> an

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
bit lost because he's more of an

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.699 
bit lost because he's more of an
attacking<00:04:11.849> player<00:04:12.030> because<00:04:12.930> he's<00:04:13.229> normally<00:04:13.650> a

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
attacking player because he's normally a

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.189 
attacking player because he's normally a
cam<00:04:13.949> as<00:04:14.189> a<00:04:14.250> default<00:04:14.579> position<00:04:15.180> but<00:04:15.419> on<00:04:15.930> the

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
cam as a default position but on the

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:17.509 
cam as a default position but on the
most<00:04:16.380> part<00:04:16.650> described<00:04:17.009> it<00:04:17.099> very<00:04:17.130> well

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
most part described it very well

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.310 
most part described it very well
defensively<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:18.419> it<00:04:18.659> was<00:04:18.750> very<00:04:18.930> surprising

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
defensively and it was very surprising

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.649 
defensively and it was very surprising
actually<00:04:19.650> he's<00:04:20.400> not<00:04:20.579> too<00:04:20.729> short<00:04:20.970> also<00:04:21.359> at<00:04:21.449> five

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
actually he's not too short also at five

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:23.959 
actually he's not too short also at five
or<00:04:21.870> ten<00:04:22.079> and<00:04:22.289> I<00:04:22.919> gotta<00:04:23.159> pull<00:04:23.370> point2<00:04:23.789> gay

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:23.969 
or ten and I gotta pull point2 gay

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:25.730 
or ten and I gotta pull point2 gay
because<00:04:24.180> he<00:04:24.419> had<00:04:24.659> to<00:04:24.750> be<00:04:24.840> converted<00:04:25.289> from<00:04:25.529> a

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
team is going to be David B also from a

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.550 
team is going to be David B also from a
flat<00:04:34.610> ago<00:04:34.820> Madrid<00:04:35.180> and<00:04:35.330> I<00:04:35.870> really<00:04:36.199> enjoyed

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
flat ago Madrid and I really enjoyed

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.230 
flat ago Madrid and I really enjoyed
this<00:04:36.710> guy<00:04:36.919> just<00:04:36.979> a<00:04:37.340> simple<00:04:37.669> fact<00:04:37.910> that<00:04:38.120> he's

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
this guy just a simple fact that he's

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.620 
this guy just a simple fact that he's
very<00:04:38.300> good<00:04:39.310> sort<00:04:40.310> of<00:04:40.400> shooting-wise<00:04:41.060> I<00:04:41.479> think

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
very good sort of shooting-wise I think

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.610 
very good sort of shooting-wise I think
he<00:04:41.690> has<00:04:41.780> like<00:04:41.900> the<00:04:41.990> finesse<00:04:42.259> trade<00:04:42.530> or

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
he has like the finesse trade or

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.740 
he has like the finesse trade or
something<00:04:42.889> like<00:04:43.039> that<00:04:43.150> and<00:04:44.150> he's<00:04:44.360> pace<00:04:44.600> is

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
something like that and he's pace is

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.719 
something like that and he's pace is
very<00:04:44.990> underrated<00:04:45.500> actually<00:04:45.770> i'm<00:04:45.860> not<00:04:45.889> sure<00:04:46.250> if

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
very underrated actually i'm not sure if

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:48.580 
very underrated actually i'm not sure if
it<00:04:46.880> is<00:04:46.970> sprint<00:04:47.300> speed<00:04:47.479> which<00:04:47.690> is<00:04:47.720> very<00:04:48.020> bad<00:04:48.259> but

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
it is sprint speed which is very bad but

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.270 
it is sprint speed which is very bad but

off the Marquis you know very good sort

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.370 
off the Marquis you know very good sort
of<00:04:52.370> acceleration<00:04:53.180> you<00:04:53.360> could<00:04:53.509> say<00:04:53.720> and<00:04:53.930> the

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
of acceleration you could say and the

long<00:05:30.349> shots<00:05:30.650> and<00:05:30.860> that<00:05:31.099> pretty<00:05:31.190> much<00:05:31.310> wraps<00:05:31.490> up

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
long shots and that pretty much wraps up
