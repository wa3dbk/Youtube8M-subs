00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.940
 I have to live 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:38.980
 where I am because I am here I cannot 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:40.960
 to remember nothing I feel tired 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.730
 very tired 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.720
 my soul is as if it had been 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.720
 torn away by the wind 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.350
 I don't even want to think in 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.989
 right now I have to first rest for 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:02.469
 understanding is better to look for shelter and 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:04.570
 food for now i have to understand i have to understand 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.759
 where all this has been dormant 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.770
 time what happened to me in these three 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:17.200
 years and in what situation I am at 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:19.030
 moment I can barely walk e 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.649
 of course in case he wanted me 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.740
 I found just a half shelter 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:26.950
 destroyed curious I have to admit I see 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.720
 new things strange things 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.700
 I swear I never felt this way 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.580
 lacking in strength like today 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.700
 yet once I was not so one already 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.700
 time 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.750
 how many things have changed in all 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.640
 this years 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.490
 how many worlds have changed theirs 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.590
 I wait how many dreams and hopes 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.950
 how many heroes have disappeared during the 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.950
 my absence 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.210
 but above all because I was absent 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.800
 what happened I don't remember anything 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.800
 I only remember an interference between 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:07.200
 real world and virtual world 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:09.300
 anything forbidden interference 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:15.570
 both happened it destabilized me and 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:18.180
 destroyed for all this time at least 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.940
 here it seems welcoming in short, so 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.959
 to say it is curious that there are three 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.459
 identical paintings 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.459
 who knows what this place was 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.760
 now I have to look for food let's see what's there 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.340
 here too easy of the dubious food 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:41.340
 quality an empty bottle and a cd 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:43.140
 what a strange thing just as strange as the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.010
 fact that here is a reproducer of 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.480
 disks what the coincidence room is 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.480
 enlightened I don't think so 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:57.150
 the most obvious thing is to listen 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.740
 let's see what happens 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:04.980
 and what the hell does it do 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.980
 just injured but damned ears 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.370
 cisco 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.010
 some in my place would do as harry 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.120
 potter or let's put it in water for 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.500
 see what it says 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.770
 pity he has not the slightest 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:22.770
 intention so you do this thing 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.770
 bruciamolo 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:41.810
 what the hell was calm now 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.420
 calm because if I start to have the 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:50.540
 hallucinations is not good for nothing 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:53.030
 I want to know what that thing nor 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.769
 much less these rumors rumors that 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.560
 they come from that trunk 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.519
 how is it possible the disc is back here 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.930
 inside 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:05.389
 very strange I must admit it is obvious 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.060
 that the disc cannot be destroyed but 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:09.799
 it must be heard only for now 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.720
 it is not clear 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.419
 no matter for now I'll try to 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.070
 find out when I hope for something 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:18.259
 says that if I could understand the 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.459
 content of the CD I would have the answer to 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:21.079
 my questions 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.130
 but what better way to make up your mind 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.130
 local if not writing 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.930
 and not writing so by chance but by 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.550
 memories memories of my mind that 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.919
 could help me but let's start 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.509
 from the dawn of time from how it all began 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.509
 so it began
