00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.389
 Hello everyone, extreme explorer 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.420
 Today I am reviewing fashion number 4 and 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.580
 A review of the mod will be special earlier 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.849
 the name is already understood what will be now 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.060
 review this review will be on a new look 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.970
 creeper elements 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.460
 give that they appear you need 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:35.030
 spawn night by the way spoilers and not 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:39.680
 found up the creeper it's very strange no 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:42.710
 here they are just not so difficult harder so 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.970
 I hope we will see everything guys if 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:50.150
 what's in diamond for lina we have nothing here 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:53.510
 I, in principle, but here is the first look 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:57.380
 the creeper is our kind of fiery 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:00.020
 create item check and see all 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.900
 on fire moms burn me too 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:07.220
 is applied to the nose damage you spider 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.109
 fired up oh everybody dies or burned 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.039
 got burned 

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:13.490
 so very dangerous be careful 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:16.460
 So 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.830
 and the next creeper is we have some 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:24.250
 yellow let's check what he do a 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.220
 This, too, approach is set on fire some 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.930
 less damage less so here it was 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:34.450
 banned my favorite failures to him 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:37.060
 liked and it's not him this is obsidian this 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.120
 orange clit which it explodes 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.870
 differently but this is possible 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.310
 tame but we fail a second 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.160
 i'm sorry i needed 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.710
 urgent find well i'm here is our principle 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.050
 beloved and why is it here immediately perry 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.340
 see this creeper as with such 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.210
 inverted heads 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:03.870
 Now you will notice everything that he does 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:12.400
 plop and he flip the earth look 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:14.170
 now see he took and face up 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.870
 so how do we play with parking 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.450
 he is 4 blocks office or even 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.720
 maybe a big flip well in 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:26.290
 In general, everything turned upside down so 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:30.100
 could him and this is kind of like ricar magma 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.140
 if I'm not mistaken, they kind of cookies 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:37.450
 most gentle drank run 2 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:40.090
 Cookies are not interesting because it's clear 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.430
 snow creeper see all covered 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.360
 snow is very attractive to 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.290
 cover books collect this is an illusion 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.900
 Critter look you have to push see 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.430
 how would one of them work five times and 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.250
 torn and every kind 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.980
 1 shadow door as you can see did not explode 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.350
 Tuffy is also in 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.600
 real quality cents he's like 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.330
 would have moved away from the squad yes I was right and 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:12.130
 the others why did they die 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.850
 remain yes yes they are figures like they will 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.070
 these creeper 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.670
 they sort of make any land around 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:22.709
 us about how you see we are under 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.180
 earth as a succession is not easy to flourish 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.989
 so I dug up 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:34.299
 now you can not shave like this 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:39.269
 similar all showed it like well too 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:45.810
 no creeper just nothing special 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:48.969
 Changeling had such a creeper so 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:53.139
 somewhere there was one more if it does not change me 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:53.859
 memory is yes cookies are terrible 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.069
 earthy 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.720
 so i have to find the last last 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.579
 should be so pink in theory you can 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.159
 to tame 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:07.659
 I just walked away honestly do not remember 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:09.579
 here he is not there, the campaign explodes 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:11.859
 world developers have not added yet 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.719
 Well, it's probably time for the guys to finish
