there<00:02:45.690> but<00:02:46.560> instead<00:02:46.830> there's<00:02:47.640> going<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.850> be

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
there but instead there's going to be

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.820 
there but instead there's going to be
one<00:02:48.030> ramp<00:02:48.270> off<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.720> side<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.080> very<00:02:49.410> simple
