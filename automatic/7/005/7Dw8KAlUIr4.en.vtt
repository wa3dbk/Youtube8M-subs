00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello youtube friends this time 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.120
 I bring you another video to improve 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.490
 our gta san andreas very well 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.170
 let's start the first thing we will do is go 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.309
 to the link as it will always be in the 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.309
 video description 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.530
 ah 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.010
 ah 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.840
 the link will take us to mediafire where 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.700
 download the winrar file does not weigh 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.329
 I do not download it because I already 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.940
 I have 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.320
 well once downloaded we go to where 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.320
 we keep and decompress it 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.990
 we will get these two folders and a 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.970
 text file which has 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.020
 installation instructions if not 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.020
 they understand the video 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.830
 well but what matters most now is 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.950
 the folders as they can see a folder 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.080
 says config and the other sf x what 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.800
 we will do will go to where is our gta 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.800
 San Andreas 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.090
 and we will enter the folder that says 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.950
 audio as you will see there are two folders with the 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.200
 same name to which we download what 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.300
 what we will do is pass the folder with 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.300
 phil just as we are dragged 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.420
 we give it to everything and replace 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.280
 and ready now we will pass the folder s fx 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.900
 but this will not happen full just 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.900
 the file that you have inside 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.970
 we just drag it 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.599
 we give it to replace and ready you will be 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.159
 installed our new sounds for 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.140
 our gta san andreas 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:48.040
 now I will leave you a sample of how 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.040
 the weapons sound 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.010
 good friends now I'll show you just a few 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.660
 few weapons that I have but I assure you 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.660
 that changes the sound to all 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.959
 to 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.730
 finish 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.819
 well friends I only had these weapons in my 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.220
 power but it changes them all not only to 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.989

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.400
