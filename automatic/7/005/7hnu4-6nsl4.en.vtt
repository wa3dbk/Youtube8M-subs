00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
they were pretending that that I think

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.000

is my favorite part of just to see them

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.070 
is my favorite part of just to see them
go<00:02:16.010> right<00:02:16.040> into<00:02:16.450> pretending<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:17.600> that's<00:02:17.780> it's

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080
