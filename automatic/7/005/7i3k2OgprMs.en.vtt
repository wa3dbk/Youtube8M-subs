need<00:04:44.139> on<00:04:44.380> Saturday<00:04:44.860> and<00:04:45.040> this<00:04:45.550> believe<00:04:45.880> we

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
need on Saturday and this believe we

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.120 
need on Saturday and this believe we
need<00:04:46.150> also<00:04:46.389> next<00:04:46.780> Monday<00:04:47.110> this<00:04:47.620> matter<00:04:47.919> what

need also next Monday this matter what
happened<00:04:48.490> I<00:04:48.639> think<00:04:48.970> this<00:04:49.300> squad<00:04:49.570> of<00:04:49.720> players

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840

has<00:04:50.199> finished<00:04:50.500> third<00:04:50.860> place<00:04:51.220> after<00:04:51.940> 46<00:04:52.419> games

and I think they need the hundred and

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.950 
and I think they need the hundred and
ten<00:04:56.889> percent<00:04:57.250> support<00:04:57.790> from<00:04:58.270> our<00:04:58.389> fantastic

ten percent support from our fantastic
supporters<00:04:59.550> especially<00:05:00.550> I<00:05:00.580> think<00:05:00.760> we<00:05:01.479> would

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
supporters especially I think we would

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.909 
supporters especially I think we would
have<00:05:01.660> not<00:05:01.930> finished<00:05:02.110> further<00:05:02.470> when<00:05:02.800> we

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
have not finished further when we

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:04.680 
have not finished further when we
wouldn't<00:05:03.220> have<00:05:03.310> that<00:05:03.370> support<00:05:03.639> home<00:05:04.180> away

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
wouldn't have that support home away

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.900 
wouldn't have that support home away
from<00:05:05.020> our<00:05:05.560> fantastic<00:05:06.190> supporters<00:05:06.639> and<00:05:06.790> I

television you wanted to get down to the

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:17.760 
television you wanted to get down to the
stadium<00:05:16.630> and<00:05:16.930> actually<00:05:17.200> support<00:05:17.500> the<00:05:17.560> team

stadium and actually support the team
definitely<00:05:18.639> I<00:05:18.760> think<00:05:18.850> when<00:05:19.180> you<00:05:19.270> have<00:05:19.389> a

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
definitely I think when you have a

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.409 
definitely I think when you have a
chance<00:05:19.600> to<00:05:19.780> get<00:05:19.900> a<00:05:19.960> ticket<00:05:20.910> I'm<00:05:21.910> sure<00:05:22.210> you

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
chance to get a ticket I'm sure you

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.990 
chance to get a ticket I'm sure you
should<00:05:22.600> go<00:05:22.720> because<00:05:23.200> I<00:05:23.470> think<00:05:23.789> this<00:05:24.789> team

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
should go because I think this team

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.930 
should go because I think this team
needs<00:05:25.930> to<00:05:26.199> support<00:05:26.380> they<00:05:26.860> need<00:05:27.070> the<00:05:27.370> voice<00:05:27.550> and

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
think make sure that you're not going

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.350 
think make sure that you're not going
into<00:06:07.700> a<00:06:07.820> trap<00:06:08.090> and<00:06:09.020> that<00:06:09.140> the<00:06:09.740> things<00:06:10.430> things

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
into a trap and that the things things

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.030 
into a trap and that the things things
in<00:06:11.510> life<00:06:11.690> always<00:06:11.990> repeat<00:06:12.410> himself<00:06:12.530> there<00:06:12.950> will

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.040 
in life always repeat himself there will

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.360 
in life always repeat himself there will
always<00:06:13.220> be<00:06:13.960> at<00:06:14.960> the<00:06:15.080> end<00:06:15.230> of<00:06:15.380> a<00:06:15.500> road<00:06:15.680> and<00:06:15.950> that

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
always be at the end of a road and that

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.100 
always be at the end of a road and that
means<00:06:16.610> a<00:06:16.760> beginning<00:06:17.120> of<00:06:17.270> a<00:06:17.360> new<00:06:17.390> one<00:06:17.660> and<00:06:17.990> I

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
means a beginning of a new one and I

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.600 
means a beginning of a new one and I
think<00:06:18.350> we<00:06:18.440> have<00:06:18.470> to<00:06:18.710> make<00:06:18.860> sure<00:06:18.890> we<00:06:19.460> will

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
think we have to make sure we will

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.010 
think we have to make sure we will
achieve<00:06:19.700> that<00:06:20.000> together<00:06:20.180> and<00:06:20.450> I<00:06:20.630> think<00:06:20.660> this

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
achieve that together and I think this

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.810 
achieve that together and I think this
