expectations i thought you know get into

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:15.590 
expectations i thought you know get into
the<00:00:12.389> competition<00:00:13.369> you<00:00:14.369> know<00:00:14.490> teams<00:00:14.789> you<00:00:15.570> know

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:15.600 
the competition you know teams you know

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.420 
the competition you know teams you know
it's<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.289> bit<00:00:16.440> frantic<00:00:16.710> at<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.100> start<00:00:17.340> and

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
it's a bit frantic at the start and

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.070 
it's a bit frantic at the start and
getting<00:00:17.580> teams<00:00:17.850> organized<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.720> getting<00:00:19.020> the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
getting teams organized and getting the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.470 
getting teams organized and getting the
national<00:00:19.470> team<00:00:19.619> players<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:21.060> kind<00:00:21.390> of

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
national team players in so it kind of

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.239 
national team players in so it kind of
it<00:00:21.839> would<00:00:22.019> to<00:00:22.109> be<00:00:22.230> expected<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:22.919> the<00:00:23.039> games

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:23.249 
it would to be expected that the games

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:24.859 
it would to be expected that the games
particularly<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.029> start<00:00:24.300> may<00:00:24.509> have<00:00:24.630> been<00:00:24.749> a

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
particularly the start may have been a

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.140 
particularly the start may have been a
little<00:00:25.019> bit<00:00:25.320> disjointed<00:00:25.949> but<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.730> be<00:00:26.849> honest

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
little bit disjointed but to be honest

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.999 
little bit disjointed but to be honest
