I should have really been using the
assault<00:01:21.080> kit<00:01:21.229> in<00:01:21.380> this<00:01:21.530> video<00:01:22.130> because<00:01:22.580> we

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
assault kit in this video because we

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.999 
assault kit in this video because we
were<00:01:23.119> getting<00:01:23.240> spawn<00:01:23.659> trap<00:01:23.930> so<00:01:24.170> if<00:01:24.470> I<00:01:24.649> was<00:01:24.770> able

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009

were getting spawn trap so if I was able
to<00:01:25.040> revive<00:01:25.399> a<00:01:25.430> few<00:01:25.700> people<00:01:26.030> we<00:01:26.149> would<00:01:26.299> have

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
to revive a few people we would have

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.719

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
been able to push back and get C again

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.219 
been able to push back and get C again
but<00:01:29.000> I<00:01:29.119> guess<00:01:29.299> I<00:01:29.479> didn't<00:01:29.750> I<00:01:29.930> was<00:01:30.079> already

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
because you can get right closer and I'm

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.859 
because you can get right closer and I'm
really<00:01:46.430> like<00:01:46.790> in<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.149> or<00:01:47.270> combat<00:01:47.570> area

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
because it with a shotgun you're really

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.510 
because it with a shotgun you're really
good<00:01:49.850> at<00:01:49.939> close-range<00:01:50.329> combat<00:01:51.159> now<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.219> next

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
shotgun now there's loads of shotguns to

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.420 
shotgun now there's loads of shotguns to
pick<00:01:56.479> from<00:01:56.659> in<00:01:56.869> battlefield<00:01:57.680> 4<00:01:57.770> there's<00:01:58.130> a<00:01:58.219> few

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
pick from in battlefield 4 there's a few

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.279 
pick from in battlefield 4 there's a few
pump-action<00:01:58.880> ones<00:01:59.210> a<00:01:59.360> few<00:01:59.509> semi-automatic

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
pump-action ones a few semi-automatic

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.349 
pump-action ones a few semi-automatic
ones<00:02:00.469> and<00:02:00.710> I<00:02:01.039> think<00:02:01.070> again<00:02:01.609> just<00:02:01.969> assess<00:02:02.240> the

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 
ones and I think again just assess the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:05.349 
ones and I think again just assess the
situation<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:03.020> pick<00:02:03.500> accordingly<00:02:04.009> now<00:02:04.759> on<00:02:05.030> ho

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:05.359 
situation and pick accordingly now on ho

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:07.120 
situation and pick accordingly now on ho
I<00:02:05.539> do<00:02:05.600> believe<00:02:06.020> that<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:06.409> pump-action<00:02:06.770> ones

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
I do believe that the pump-action ones

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.349 
I do believe that the pump-action ones
do<00:02:07.340> perform<00:02:07.759> better<00:02:07.939> than<00:02:08.209> the

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:08.359 
do perform better than the

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:10.539 
do perform better than the
semi-automatic<00:02:08.780> ones<00:02:09.350> but<00:02:09.859> depending<00:02:10.429> on

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
semi-automatic ones but depending on

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.099 
semi-automatic ones but depending on
your<00:02:10.670> situation<00:02:10.880> sometimes<00:02:11.510> the

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:12.109 
your situation sometimes the

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:13.750 
your situation sometimes the
semi-automatic<00:02:12.590> ones<00:02:13.010> will<00:02:13.250> be<00:02:13.280> better

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
semi-automatic ones will be better

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.910 
semi-automatic ones will be better
semi-automatic<00:02:14.720> ones<00:02:15.140> are<00:02:15.290> pretty<00:02:15.500> good<00:02:15.739> if

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
semi-automatic ones are pretty good if

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.410 
semi-automatic ones are pretty good if
there's<00:02:16.160> loads<00:02:16.519> of<00:02:16.700> enemies<00:02:17.030> that's<00:02:17.239> in<00:02:17.390> a

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
there's loads of enemies that's in a

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.300 
there's loads of enemies that's in a
line<00:02:17.750> which<00:02:17.989> you<00:02:18.170> can<00:02:18.320> take<00:02:18.470> out<00:02:18.680> as<00:02:18.859> rapid

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
line which you can take out as rapid

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.430 
line which you can take out as rapid
fire<00:02:19.519> but<00:02:20.000> then<00:02:20.150> again<00:02:20.269> like<00:02:20.420> I<00:02:20.750> did<00:02:20.780> like<00:02:21.260> I'm

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
fire but then again like I did like I'm

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.770 
fire but then again like I did like I'm
in<00:02:21.650> that<00:02:21.680> first<00:02:22.070> clip<00:02:22.280> in<00:02:22.489> this<00:02:22.790> video<00:02:23.150> I<00:02:23.359> was

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.750 
in that first clip in this video I was
using<00:02:24.079> a<00:02:24.290> pump-action<00:02:24.799> shotgun<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.549> because

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
using a pump-action shotgun and because

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.580

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
the pump they pump it really fast it

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.439 
the pump they pump it really fast it
does<00:02:27.889> feel<00:02:28.070> like<00:02:28.130> a<00:02:28.280> semi-automatic<00:02:28.910> one<00:02:29.239> so

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:29.449 
does feel like a semi-automatic one so

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:31.350 
does feel like a semi-automatic one so

ones which offer semi-automatic ones you
can<00:02:34.240> get<00:02:34.420> in<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.600> pump-action<00:02:34.960> one<00:02:35.290> so<00:02:35.500> on<00:02:35.650> it<00:02:36.010> go

with a pump-action one the one I'm using

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.600 
with a pump-action one the one I'm using
here<00:02:38.140> is<00:02:38.440> pretty<00:02:38.680> good<00:02:38.920> but<00:02:39.100> also<00:02:39.250> there's<00:02:39.550> a

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
them a long range but they really felt

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.770 
them a long range but they really felt
badly<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.250> takes<00:03:15.430> like<00:03:15.610> five<00:03:15.910> or<00:03:16.150> six<00:03:16.180> hits<00:03:16.570> to

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
badly it takes like five or six hits to

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:17.940 
badly it takes like five or six hits to
take<00:03:16.930> something<00:03:17.140> down<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:17.620> by<00:03:17.739> that<00:03:17.920> time

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
take something down and by that time

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.320 
take something down and by that time
they're<00:03:18.280> probably<00:03:18.459> going<00:03:18.730> to<00:03:18.790> take<00:03:18.970> you<00:03:19.150> down

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
they're probably going to take you down

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.150 
they're probably going to take you down
the<00:03:19.570> dart<00:03:20.230> rounds<00:03:20.530> over<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.770> little<00:03:21.040> bit

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
the dart rounds over a little bit

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.949 
the dart rounds over a little bit
greater<00:03:21.400> at<00:03:21.700> long<00:03:21.940> range<00:03:22.209> and<00:03:22.420> they<00:03:22.540> also<00:03:22.690> do

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
greater at long range and they also do

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.780 
greater at long range and they also do
like<00:03:23.140> quite<00:03:23.410> a<00:03:23.440> lot<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.680> damage<00:03:23.890> if<00:03:24.190> you<00:03:24.610> want

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
like quite a lot of damage if you want

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.760 
like quite a lot of damage if you want
to<00:03:24.880> shoot<00:03:25.330> someone<00:03:25.600> through<00:03:25.840> like<00:03:26.050> a<00:03:26.080> wall<00:03:26.440> or

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
to shoot someone through like a wall or

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.350 
to shoot someone through like a wall or
wood<00:03:27.070> or<00:03:27.100> something<00:03:27.550> so<00:03:27.850> they're<00:03:28.000> pretty<00:03:28.150> good

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
wood or something so they're pretty good

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.640 
wood or something so they're pretty good
but<00:03:28.420> they're<00:03:28.750> not<00:03:28.780> that<00:03:29.020> great<00:03:29.200> at<00:03:29.410> close

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
but they're not that great at close

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.040 
but they're not that great at close
range<00:03:29.950> so<00:03:30.190> if<00:03:30.489> you<00:03:30.850> want<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.180> be<00:03:31.239> using<00:03:31.660> it<00:03:31.930> I

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
range so if you want to be using it I

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.540 
range so if you want to be using it I
would<00:03:32.290> say<00:03:32.410> use<00:03:32.620> it<00:03:32.650> on<00:03:32.860> a<00:03:32.890> conquest<00:03:33.280> match

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
would say use it on a conquest match

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.160 
would say use it on a conquest match
where<00:03:33.850> there's<00:03:34.090> lots<00:03:34.330> of<00:03:34.480> enemies<00:03:34.660> but

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
where there's lots of enemies but

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.140 
where there's lots of enemies but
they're<00:03:35.320> quite<00:03:35.500> far<00:03:35.709> away<00:03:35.799> the<00:03:36.580> third<00:03:36.790> rounds

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
they're quite far away the third rounds

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.910 
they're quite far away the third rounds
the<00:03:37.269> frag<00:03:37.600> rounds<00:03:37.630> are<00:03:38.170> pretty<00:03:38.560> good<00:03:38.739> they're

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
the frag rounds are pretty good they're

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.350 
the frag rounds are pretty good they're
really<00:03:39.190> good<00:03:39.310> for<00:03:39.430> suppressing<00:03:39.730> enemies<00:03:40.180> but

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
really good for suppressing enemies but

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.660 
really good for suppressing enemies but
getting<00:03:40.630> kills<00:03:40.989> and<00:03:41.320> not<00:03:41.470> so<00:03:41.620> great<00:03:41.830> I<00:03:42.130> would

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
getting kills and not so great I would

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.840 
getting kills and not so great I would
say<00:03:42.850> use<00:03:43.330> this<00:03:43.570> if<00:03:43.810> you're<00:03:44.260> dumb<00:03:44.620> you're<00:03:45.610> being

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
say use this if you're dumb you're being

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.699 
say use this if you're dumb you're being
like<00:03:46.060> a<00:03:46.209> tag<00:03:46.450> you're<00:03:46.630> like<00:03:46.810> spawn<00:03:47.140> crap<00:03:47.350> like<00:03:47.530> I

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
like a tag you're like spawn crap like I

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.500 
like a tag you're like spawn crap like I
was<00:03:47.920> and<00:03:48.100> just<00:03:48.519> use<00:03:48.700> it<00:03:48.910> to<00:03:49.030> suppress<00:03:49.360> the

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
was and just use it to suppress the

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.970 
was and just use it to suppress the
enemies<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:49.989> then<00:03:50.080> allow<00:03:50.350> your<00:03:50.500> teammates<00:03:50.890> to

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
enemies and then allow your teammates to

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:51.660 
enemies and then allow your teammates to
take<00:03:51.160> them<00:03:51.310> out

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
take them out

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.759 
take them out
finally<00:03:52.269> the<00:03:52.450> slugs<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:53.410> slug<00:03:53.650> is

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
finally the slugs the the slug is

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.289 
finally the slugs the the slug is
basically<00:03:54.100> just<00:03:54.220> a<00:03:54.489> one-round<00:03:54.730> which<00:03:55.180> you

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
basically just a one-round which you

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.390 
basically just a one-round which you
fire<00:03:55.540> it<00:03:55.780> goes<00:03:55.930> really<00:03:56.230> far<00:03:56.500> really<00:03:56.890> deadly<00:03:57.100> is

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
fire it goes really far really deadly is

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.160 
fire it goes really far really deadly is
normally<00:03:57.880> a<00:03:57.940> one-shot<00:03:58.330> kill<00:03:58.360> to<00:03:58.720> the<00:03:58.810> head<00:03:59.019> in

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
normally a one-shot kill to the head in

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.020 
normally a one-shot kill to the head in
the<00:03:59.290> chest<00:03:59.590> anywhere<00:04:00.160> from<00:04:00.280> like<00:04:00.459> any<00:04:00.760> range

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
the chest anywhere from like any range

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.030 
the chest anywhere from like any range
but<00:04:01.570> if<00:04:01.780> they<00:04:01.959> are<00:04:02.110> hard<00:04:02.380> if<00:04:02.500> they<00:04:02.560> do<00:04:02.739> have<00:04:02.920> the

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
but if they are hard if they do have the

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.890 
but if they are hard if they do have the
field<00:04:03.280> upgrade<00:04:03.670> which<00:04:03.850> gives<00:04:04.090> them<00:04:04.269> armor<00:04:04.690> it

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
field upgrade which gives them armor it

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.350 
field upgrade which gives them armor it
will<00:04:05.230> make<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.920> slug<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.459> two-shot<00:04:06.880> kill<00:04:06.910> so

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
will make the slug a two-shot kill so

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.150 
will make the slug a two-shot kill so
I'm<00:04:07.510> just<00:04:07.750> bear<00:04:07.900> that<00:04:07.930> in<00:04:08.110> mind<00:04:08.170> I<00:04:08.530> personally

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
I'm just bear that in mind I personally

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.500 
I'm just bear that in mind I personally
preferred<00:04:09.519> using<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:10.000> buckshot<00:04:10.390> on

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
preferred using the buckshot on

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.460 
preferred using the buckshot on
operation<00:04:11.140> Locker

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
operation Locker

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.979 
operation Locker
basically<00:04:11.920> because<00:04:12.130> loads<00:04:12.850> of<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.420> UM<00:04:13.600> combat

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
basically because loads of the UM combat

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.930 
basically because loads of the UM combat
was<00:04:14.140> post<00:04:14.410> quarters<00:04:14.739> so<00:04:14.860> I<00:04:14.890> felt<00:04:15.190> it<00:04:15.400> performed

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
was post quarters so I felt it performed

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:16.800 
was post quarters so I felt it performed
the<00:04:16.090> UM<00:04:16.269> best

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
the UM best

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.930 
the UM best
the<00:04:17.410> fourth<00:04:17.650> tip<00:04:17.830> for<00:04:18.010> you<00:04:18.070> guys<00:04:18.100> is<00:04:18.459> knowing

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
the fourth tip for you guys is knowing

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.449 
the fourth tip for you guys is knowing
your<00:04:19.090> limits<00:04:19.390> now<00:04:20.290> like<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:20.590> said<00:04:20.650> shotguns

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
your limits now like I said shotguns

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.830 
your limits now like I said shotguns
aren't<00:04:21.790> that<00:04:21.880> great<00:04:22.060> at<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.419> long<00:04:22.570> range

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
aren't that great at the long range

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.300 
aren't that great at the long range
unless<00:04:23.200> you<00:04:23.320> are<00:04:23.410> using<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.860> slugs<00:04:24.130> or

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
unless you are using the slugs or

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.710 
unless you are using the slugs or
something<00:04:24.640> but<00:04:24.970> most<00:04:25.180> of<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.390> time<00:04:25.570> you're

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
something but most of the time you're

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.060 
something but most of the time you're
not<00:04:25.750> going<00:04:26.050> to<00:04:26.110> be<00:04:26.200> hitting<00:04:26.500> those<00:04:26.590> long<00:04:26.860> range

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
not going to be hitting those long range

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.100 
not going to be hitting those long range
kills<00:04:27.370> so<00:04:27.580> always<00:04:28.000> switch<00:04:28.210> to<00:04:28.360> your<00:04:28.419> pistol<00:04:28.840> if

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
kills so always switch to your pistol if

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.480 
kills so always switch to your pistol if
you<00:04:29.260> do<00:04:29.410> see<00:04:29.590> someone<00:04:29.830> at<00:04:30.010> a<00:04:30.040> longer<00:04:30.250> range

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
you do see someone at a longer range

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.640 
you do see someone at a longer range
definitely<00:04:31.479> be<00:04:31.630> using<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.020> Magnum<00:04:32.410> or<00:04:32.560> the

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
definitely be using the Magnum or the

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.110 
definitely be using the Magnum or the
Rex<00:04:32.860> when<00:04:33.040> you<00:04:33.130> are<00:04:33.280> using<00:04:33.520> a<00:04:33.729> shotgun<00:04:33.940> just

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
Rex when you are using a shotgun just

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.730 
Rex when you are using a shotgun just
because<00:04:34.600> those<00:04:34.840> are<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.020> most<00:04:35.200> powerful

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740

Anna most of the time it's really easy
to<00:05:38.740> assess<00:05:39.069> but<00:05:39.310> just<00:05:39.789> keep<00:05:40.180> that<00:05:40.449> like<00:05:40.749> one<00:05:41.050> or

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:44.469 
because without the assessment you're

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:46.200 
because without the assessment you're
always<00:05:44.740> gonna<00:05:45.009> die<00:05:45.250> and<00:05:45.520> it's<00:05:45.669> not<00:05:45.849> gonna<00:05:46.029> be
