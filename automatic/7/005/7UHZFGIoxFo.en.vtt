this map is not the number one and I

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.910 
this map is not the number one and I
personally<00:02:53.720> believe<00:02:53.870> it's<00:02:54.230> just<00:02:54.530> because<00:02:54.890> of

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
personally believe it's just because of

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.250 
personally believe it's just because of
the<00:02:55.130> way<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.580> map<00:02:55.790> is<00:02:56.000> designed<00:02:56.510> personally<00:02:57.110> I

the way the map is designed personally I

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.470 
the way the map is designed personally I
just<00:02:57.710> don't<00:02:57.980> really<00:02:58.160> like<00:02:58.430> how<00:02:58.670> easy<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.360> is

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
just don't really like how easy it is

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.420 
just don't really like how easy it is
there's<00:02:59.810> not<00:02:59.960> much<00:03:00.230> of<00:03:00.260> a<00:03:00.560> challenge<00:03:00.860> with<00:03:01.250> it

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
there's not much of a challenge with it

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
you do get the Thunder gun which is

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.810 
you do get the Thunder gun which is
amazing<00:03:03.470> wonder<00:03:03.710> weapon<00:03:04.040> like<00:03:04.190> I<00:03:04.340> just<00:03:04.400> said

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
amazing wonder weapon like I just said

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.360 
amazing wonder weapon like I just said
but<00:03:05.390> also<00:03:05.600> it<00:03:05.840> can<00:03:05.990> sometimes<00:03:06.200> glitch<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.100> fly

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
but also it can sometimes glitch and fly

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.460 
but also it can sometimes glitch and fly
out<00:03:07.610> and<00:03:07.880> not<00:03:08.030> have<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.390> consistency<00:03:09.140> of

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
out and not have the consistency of

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.830 
out and not have the consistency of
killing<00:03:09.890> zombies<00:03:10.490> which<00:03:10.760> does<00:03:11.000> makes<00:03:11.240> it<00:03:11.390> make

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
killing zombies which does makes it make

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.900 
killing zombies which does makes it make
it<00:03:11.960> a<00:03:12.050> little<00:03:12.200> tiny<00:03:12.440> bit<00:03:12.650> harder<00:03:13.010> but<00:03:13.430> I<00:03:13.490> think

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
it a little tiny bit harder but I think

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.210 
it a little tiny bit harder but I think
really<00:03:14.180> bumps<00:03:14.720> up<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.050> difficulty<00:03:15.710> in<00:03:16.100> a

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
really bumps up the difficulty in a

really bumps up the difficulty in a

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
funny about it is that the main

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.189 
funny about it is that the main
characters<00:06:35.699> for<00:06:35.940> the<00:06:36.030> zombie<00:06:36.389> saga<00:06:36.720> aren't

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 
characters for the zombie saga aren't

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:38.870 
characters for the zombie saga aren't
really<00:06:37.560> in<00:06:37.770> it<00:06:37.949> you're<00:06:38.220> not<00:06:38.370> really<00:06:38.550> playing

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 
really in it you're not really playing

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.210 
really in it you're not really playing
as<00:06:39.240> them<00:06:39.540> you<00:06:39.930> do<00:06:40.110> help<00:06:40.380> them<00:06:40.620> get<00:06:40.860> teleported

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 
as them you do help them get teleported

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.060 
as them you do help them get teleported
to<00:06:41.520> shangri-la<00:06:42.270> but<00:06:42.900> other<00:06:43.199> than<00:06:43.470> that<00:06:43.530> this

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070 
to shangri-la but other than that this

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.010 
to shangri-la but other than that this
is<00:06:44.280> one<00:06:44.460> of<00:06:44.490> the<00:06:44.669> best<00:06:45.060> Maps<00:06:45.419> I<00:06:45.660> think

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 
is one of the best Maps I think

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.170 
is one of the best Maps I think
personally<00:06:46.530> I<00:06:46.650> was<00:06:46.919> ever<00:06:47.130> made<00:06:47.520> nothing

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.180 
personally I was ever made nothing

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.940 
personally I was ever made nothing
really<00:06:48.389> compares<00:06:48.660> to<00:06:49.200> this<00:06:49.350> because<00:06:49.770> it's

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:49.950 
really compares to this because it's

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.850 
really compares to this because it's
very<00:06:50.280> unique<00:06:50.970> in<00:06:51.360> its<00:06:51.510> own<00:06:51.690> way<00:06:51.750> the<00:06:52.470> only<00:06:52.680> map

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
very unique in its own way the only map

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.350 
very unique in its own way the only map
that<00:06:53.040> would<00:06:53.130> kind<00:06:53.490> of<00:06:53.639> compare<00:06:53.940> to<00:06:54.060> this<00:06:54.150> would

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 
that would kind of compare to this would

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.840 
that would kind of compare to this would
be<00:06:54.389> mob<00:06:54.780> the<00:06:54.990> dead<00:06:55.229> but<00:06:55.740> I<00:06:55.770> do<00:06:55.919> think<00:06:56.550> called

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:56.850 
be mob the dead but I do think called

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.670 
be mob the dead but I do think called
the<00:06:57.000> Dead<00:06:57.180> deserves<00:06:57.540> its<00:06:57.750> own<00:06:57.990> name<00:06:58.290> and<00:06:58.530> I

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 
the Dead deserves its own name and I

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.440 
the Dead deserves its own name and I
think<00:06:58.919> it's<00:06:59.040> the<00:06:59.190> number<00:06:59.430> one<00:06:59.700> spot<00:07:00.000> on<00:07:00.210> my

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:00.450 
think it's the number one spot on my

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.240 
think it's the number one spot on my
