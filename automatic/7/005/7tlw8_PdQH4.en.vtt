the left hand side and one on the right
hand<00:02:03.780> side<00:02:03.869> now<00:02:04.409> they<00:02:04.530> do<00:02:04.590> have<00:02:04.860> like<00:02:05.009> a

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
hand side now they do have like a

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
front so you do have to go out of the

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.960 
front so you do have to go out of the
wall<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.679> light<00:02:10.890> which<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.520> main<00:02:11.700> thing

to notice and go behind them so you can
start<00:02:15.070> attacking<00:02:15.520> them<00:02:15.880> now<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.390> only<00:02:16.660> thing

nevertheless you shouldn't have seized
you<00:04:01.780> should<00:04:01.990> be<00:04:02.110> really<00:04:02.350> trying<00:04:02.620> to<00:04:02.740> get<00:04:02.920> as

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
you should be really trying to get as

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.100 
you should be really trying to get as
much<00:04:03.310> dps<00:04:03.670> out<00:04:03.970> on<00:04:04.090> these<00:04:04.240> pandas<00:04:04.450> as<00:04:04.690> you<00:04:04.870> can

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
much dps out on these pandas as you can

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.660 
much dps out on these pandas as you can
because<00:04:05.320> you<00:04:05.590> need<00:04:05.710> to<00:04:05.800> get<00:04:05.950> back<00:04:06.190> before<00:04:06.520> the

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
because you need to get back before the

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.280 
because you need to get back before the
other<00:04:06.880> proof<00:04:07.150> is<00:04:07.270> teleported<00:04:07.810> then<00:04:08.020> the<00:04:08.110> boss

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
other proof is teleported then the boss

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.150 
other proof is teleported then the boss
just<00:04:08.560> goes<00:04:08.709> apeshit

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
just goes apeshit

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.910 
just goes apeshit
so<00:04:09.520> what<00:04:10.240> you<00:04:10.330> need<00:04:10.480> to<00:04:10.570> do<00:04:10.720> is<00:04:10.990> try<00:04:11.530> not<00:04:11.590> to<00:04:11.830> get

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
so what you need to do is try not to get

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.470 
so what you need to do is try not to get
hit<00:04:12.100> by<00:04:12.160> as<00:04:12.370> many<00:04:12.640> of<00:04:12.730> these<00:04:12.820> as<00:04:12.880> you<00:04:13.060> possibly

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
hit by as many of these as you possibly

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.540 
hit by as many of these as you possibly
can<00:04:13.720> and<00:04:13.780> if<00:04:14.020> you<00:04:14.140> are<00:04:14.350> just<00:04:14.620> dispel<00:04:15.070> it<00:04:15.220> now

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
can and if you are just dispel it now

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.130 
can and if you are just dispel it now
every<00:04:15.820> time<00:04:15.970> you<00:04:16.090> do<00:04:16.209> damage<00:04:16.450> to<00:04:16.600> these<00:04:16.840> pandas

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
every time you do damage to these pandas

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.320 
every time you do damage to these pandas
Globes<00:04:17.830> will<00:04:18.100> spawn<00:04:18.400> and<00:04:18.640> they're<00:04:19.209> like

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
Globes will spawn and they're like

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.840 
Globes will spawn and they're like
little<00:04:19.570> almost<00:04:20.320> like<00:04:20.440> monk<00:04:20.890> passive<00:04:21.520> Globes

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
little almost like monk passive Globes

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.350 
little almost like monk passive Globes
but<00:04:22.180> the<00:04:22.870> monk<00:04:23.790> they're<00:04:24.790> just<00:04:24.940> healing<00:04:25.120> globes

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
but the monk they're just healing globes

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.480 
but the monk they're just healing globes
now<00:04:25.750> how<00:04:25.900> these<00:04:26.080> globes<00:04:26.410> work<00:04:26.680> is<00:04:26.979> that<00:04:27.220> if<00:04:27.400> you

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
now how these globes work is that if you

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.670 
now how these globes work is that if you
do<00:04:27.640> not<00:04:27.760> pick<00:04:27.970> them<00:04:28.180> up<00:04:28.330> within<00:04:28.960> eight<00:04:29.229> seconds

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
do not pick them up within eight seconds

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.380 
do not pick them up within eight seconds
of<00:04:29.800> them<00:04:29.950> spawning<00:04:30.340> they'll<00:04:30.640> heal<00:04:30.880> the<00:04:31.060> Panda

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
of them spawning they'll heal the Panda

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.420 
of them spawning they'll heal the Panda
for<00:04:31.570> 5%<00:04:31.870> of<00:04:32.140> its<00:04:32.290> max<00:04:32.500> health<00:04:32.800> so<00:04:33.280> it's

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
for 5% of its max health so it's

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.680 
for 5% of its max health so it's
important<00:04:33.850> that<00:04:33.880> you<00:04:34.060> do<00:04:34.210> pick<00:04:34.450> them<00:04:34.600> up

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
important that you do pick them up

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.030 
important that you do pick them up
however<00:04:34.930> when<00:04:35.200> you<00:04:35.290> do<00:04:35.410> pick<00:04:35.590> them<00:04:35.740> up<00:04:35.830> they<00:04:35.979> do

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
however when you do pick them up they do

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.950 
however when you do pick them up they do
a<00:04:36.130> small<00:04:36.550> amount<00:04:36.790> of<00:04:36.940> damage<00:04:37.210> to<00:04:37.390> you<00:04:37.479> however

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
a small amount of damage to you however

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.270 
a small amount of damage to you however
they<00:04:38.229> will<00:04:38.380> give<00:04:38.530> your<00:04:38.650> primary<00:04:39.070> resource

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
they will give your primary resource

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.250 
they will give your primary resource
back<00:04:39.729> so<00:04:39.970> if<00:04:40.180> your<00:04:40.330> mana<00:04:40.570> user<00:04:40.780> it<00:04:40.990> will<00:04:41.050> give

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
back so if your mana user it will give

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.320 
back so if your mana user it will give
you<00:04:41.350> manner<00:04:41.590> if<00:04:42.160> your<00:04:42.340> rogue<00:04:42.550> of<00:04:42.700> your<00:04:43.000> energy

see<00:04:46.030> you<00:04:46.270> just<00:04:46.419> need<00:04:46.540> to<00:04:46.600> make<00:04:46.750> sure<00:04:46.870> that<00:04:46.990> you

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
see you just need to make sure that you

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.690 
see you just need to make sure that you
pick<00:04:47.229> them<00:04:47.440> up<00:04:47.470> it's<00:04:48.040> not<00:04:48.220> a<00:04:48.250> good<00:04:48.400> idea<00:04:48.580> to

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
pick them up it's not a good idea to

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:49.920 
pick them up it's not a good idea to
pick<00:04:48.820> them<00:04:48.970> up<00:04:49.060> if<00:04:49.300> you're<00:04:49.450> on<00:04:49.540> low<00:04:49.720> health

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
pick them up if you're on low health

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.350 
pick them up if you're on low health
because<00:04:50.830> you<00:04:51.070> know<00:04:51.160> it's<00:04:51.820> just<00:04:52.030> not<00:04:52.210> a<00:04:52.270> good

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
because you know it's just not a good

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.710 
because you know it's just not a good
idea

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
idea

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.450 
idea
ideally<00:04:53.440> you<00:04:53.530> just<00:04:53.710> want<00:04:53.860> its<00:04:54.010> hang<00:04:54.130> picking

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
ideally you just want its hang picking

ideally you just want its hang picking
them<00:04:54.580> all<00:04:54.669> up<00:04:54.820> now<00:04:55.060> the<00:04:55.120> pandas<00:04:55.450> also<00:04:55.690> do

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
them all up now the pandas also do

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.570 
them all up now the pandas also do
another<00:04:55.900> ability<00:04:56.530> called<00:04:56.650> death<00:04:56.979> blossom<00:04:57.250> and

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
another ability called death blossom and

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.070 
another ability called death blossom and
it's<00:04:57.669> when<00:04:57.820> they're<00:04:57.970> on<00:04:58.060> fairly<00:04:58.300> low<00:04:58.510> HP<00:04:58.720> and

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
it's when they're on fairly low HP and

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.960 
it's when they're on fairly low HP and
this<00:04:59.380> is<00:04:59.500> just<00:04:59.680> a<00:04:59.770> massive<00:05:00.010> hard-hitting<00:05:00.610> AoE

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970
