continuity when i first got into comics
all<00:02:01.680> i<00:02:01.710> did<00:02:01.890> was<00:02:02.040> just<00:02:02.250> going<00:02:02.460> by<00:02:02.610> back<00:02:03.149> issues

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
all i did was just going by back issues

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.330 
all i did was just going by back issues
and<00:02:03.780> i<00:02:04.200> would<00:02:04.380> just<00:02:04.409> jump<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.979> middle<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.280> a

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340

story<00:02:05.640> arc<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.119> would<00:02:06.210> make<00:02:06.360> no<00:02:06.390> sense<00:02:06.570> to

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
story arc and it would make no sense to
