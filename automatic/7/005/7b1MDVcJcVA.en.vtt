00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.000
 we're going to obviously need cauliflower myself 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.699
 I use purple onion if you like 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.519

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.039
 call also let's use parsley the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.510
 sprig of parsley to taste in parsley 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.260
 flavor is a bit strong then at 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.750
 taste we are going to need oil salt 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.550

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.129
 preparation the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.399

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.590
