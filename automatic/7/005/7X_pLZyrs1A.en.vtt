00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.330
 look good at this moment because it was 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.599
 one of the most tender we could see 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.300
 in e3 the developer of a small 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.099
 Swedish company consisting of only 14 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.130
 people talking between the presentation 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.380
 of the new need for speed or the gigantic 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.420
 water with the truth is that it is appreciated 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.820
 that things happen so studies 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.070
 small but with great ideas can 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.079
 go out to stardom and say there that here 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.180
 we are and we have a lot to show 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.550
 although our hands tremble because they do not 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.739
 we are used to this in this 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.230
 case was on the occasion of Aragon a 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:55.030
 video game with platforms and puzzles that 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.030
 literally got us fall in love 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.090
 the title starts from a very premise 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.970
 easy to handle find even this little 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.190
 wool creature that moves under some 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.680
 dynamics that combine platforms and 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.600
 puzzles in a very ingenious way what 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.790
 we have tried and we can tell you that there 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.130
 a strong design of levels with moments 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.650
 that force us to stop and think the 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.540
 main reason is almost always because 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.400
 our character is destined to 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.380
 As it progresses and we must find 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.170
 always the way to get new 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.420
 balls to keep going as you see 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.700
 There will be variety of situations quantity 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.860
 of environments and the best thing is that wool does not 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.600
 is a mere aesthetic element but the 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.560
 we will use for a pierre between us 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.560
 many other options 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.940
 said this is important and supposes 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.680
 one of the best-treated aspects of 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.210
 title must also be said that good 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.760
 part of the appeal of the video game 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.650
 is that you want to contribute more than 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.810
 Entertainment wants to become 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.420
 a unique experience as his 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.610
 own creator something very personal and with 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.290
 heart this we find it easily 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.450
 his visual section which has been 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.640
 inspired by the northern landscapes of 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.310
 sweden hitting the arctic a place without 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.230
 many people but plenty of nature 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.720
 I tried to share these magnificent 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.330
 places with the rest of the world and do it 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.280
 inside a videogame the idea we 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.160
 it seems to fit perfectly and 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.750
 also creates a set really 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.840
 satisfactory we played it during just 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.300
 10 minutes but it left us with many 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.580
 You want to wait until a date that 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.620
 is still to be announced raised as 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.280
 a multi-platform launch for 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.320
 playstation 4 xbox one ipc for us 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.200
 in 3d games was one of the small 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.290
 surprises of the e3 one of those that achieve 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.390
 encourage a fair and why not say it 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.860
 give it meaning not everything will be 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.310
 super productions 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.310
 truly
