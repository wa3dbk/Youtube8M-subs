for<00:00:25.590> plankton<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:26.130> believe<00:00:26.700> that's<00:00:26.880> what<00:00:27.030> the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
for plankton I believe that's what the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.180 
for plankton I believe that's what the
plot<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:28.170> you'll<00:00:28.350> be<00:00:28.470> playing<00:00:28.710> several

I kind of like this one an invasion of
the<00:01:21.960> patty<00:01:22.230> statures<00:01:22.860> you'll<00:01:23.040> be<00:01:23.190> running

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
characters appear in the levels but it's

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.920

too<00:02:37.360> bad<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.900> crazy<00:02:38.380> story<00:02:38.950> was<00:02:39.190> probably<00:02:39.520> the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
too bad the crazy story was probably the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.340 
too bad the crazy story was probably the
biggest<00:02:39.850> draw<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.690> games<00:02:40.870> are<00:02:40.990> okay

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
biggest draw and the games are okay

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.199 
biggest draw and the games are okay
despite<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.010> games<00:02:42.190> being<00:02:42.459> quite<00:02:42.760> similar

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
they they felt different enough not to

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.320 
they they felt different enough not to
feel<00:02:45.010> like<00:02:45.160> copies<00:02:45.640> of<00:02:45.730> each<00:02:45.820> other<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:46.270> they

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
feel like copies of each other and they

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.970 
feel like copies of each other and they
kept<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:46.660> length<00:02:46.900> of<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.170> levels<00:02:47.650> not<00:02:47.770> too

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
kept the length of the levels not too

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.830 
kept the length of the levels not too
long<00:02:48.220> so<00:02:48.520> you<00:02:48.850> wouldn't<00:02:49.090> get<00:02:49.180> bored<00:02:49.360> too<00:02:49.570> fast

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
long so you wouldn't get bored too fast

my biggest complaint was the recycling
of<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.120> levels<00:02:52.420> in<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.660> two<00:02:52.810> stories<00:02:53.290> playing

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
of the levels in the two stories playing

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.800 
of the levels in the two stories playing
all<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.370> games<00:02:54.610> in<00:02:54.790> one<00:02:55.000> story<00:02:55.330> than<00:02:55.570> seeing

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
all the games in one story than seeing

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.000 
all the games in one story than seeing
them<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.140> next<00:02:56.410> was<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:56.650> bit<00:02:56.860> of<00:02:56.950> a

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
them the next was a bit of a

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.070 
them the next was a bit of a
disappointment<00:02:57.730> but<00:02:58.000> still<00:02:58.360> III<00:02:58.540> thought<00:02:58.900> the

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
disappointment but still III thought the
