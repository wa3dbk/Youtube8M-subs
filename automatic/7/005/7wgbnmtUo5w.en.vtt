a sprite sizes a lot of them seem to be

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.899 
a sprite sizes a lot of them seem to be
bigger<00:03:17.290> or<00:03:17.620> smaller<00:03:18.099> of<00:03:18.579> what<00:03:18.730> they<00:03:18.849> were

really supposed to be which kind of felt

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:26.369 
really supposed to be which kind of felt
out<00:03:20.980> of<00:03:21.010> place<00:03:21.099> when<00:03:21.640> I<00:03:21.670> was<00:03:21.790> playing<00:03:25.379> overall

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
out of place when I was playing overall

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.170 
out of place when I was playing overall
I<00:03:26.650> really<00:03:26.980> liked<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.340> concept<00:03:27.730> of<00:03:27.849> the<00:03:28.000> game

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180

giving the user freedom and full control
of<00:03:30.430> your<00:03:30.670> roster<00:03:30.819> is<00:03:31.120> a<00:03:31.150> really<00:03:31.510> neat<00:03:31.659> idea

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
of your roster is a really neat idea
