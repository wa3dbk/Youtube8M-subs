00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
sponge so I can easily flip it around

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.830

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
and blend the colors together next it's

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.560 
and blend the colors together next it's
time<00:01:35.960> to<00:01:36.140> start<00:01:36.530> on<00:01:36.650> the<00:01:36.770> fairies<00:01:37.100> body<00:01:37.370> and<00:01:37.700> if

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
time to start on the fairies body and if

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.570 
time to start on the fairies body and if
you<00:01:38.600> break<00:01:38.930> this<00:01:39.140> in<00:01:39.350> two<00:01:39.500> steps<00:01:39.740> it's<00:01:40.100> not<00:01:40.370> as

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
you break this in two steps it's not as

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.150 
you break this in two steps it's not as
difficult<00:01:40.880> as<00:01:41.330> you<00:01:41.450> would<00:01:41.720> think<00:01:41.750> just<00:01:42.410> think

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
difficult as you would think just think

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.160 
difficult as you would think just think
of<00:01:43.280> it<00:01:43.340> as<00:01:43.460> a<00:01:43.490> series<00:01:43.940> of<00:01:43.970> teardrops<00:01:44.690> so<00:01:44.960> for

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
of it as a series of teardrops so for

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.790 
of it as a series of teardrops so for
the<00:01:45.290> legs<00:01:45.530> you're<00:01:46.370> going<00:01:46.730> to<00:01:46.940> start<00:01:47.410> thick<00:01:48.410> and

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
the legs you're going to start thick and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.410 
the legs you're going to start thick and
then<00:01:49.550> pull<00:01:50.120> it<00:01:50.570> out<00:01:51.050> so<00:01:51.500> thick<00:01:51.980> pull<00:01:52.760> out<00:01:53.000> to<00:01:53.390> a

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
then pull it out so thick pull out to a

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.350 
then pull it out so thick pull out to a
point<00:01:53.870> and<00:01:54.340> then<00:01:55.340> for<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:55.700> knee<00:01:55.910> make<00:01:56.240> it

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
point and then for the knee make it

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.570 
point and then for the knee make it
thick<00:01:56.660> again<00:01:56.810> or<00:01:57.290> the<00:01:57.440> cap<00:01:57.680> is<00:01:57.920> and<00:01:58.220> pull<00:01:58.460> it

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
thick again or the cap is and pull it

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.150 
thick again or the cap is and pull it
out<00:01:58.730> to<00:01:59.270> a<00:01:59.720> point<00:02:00.080> where<00:02:00.230> the<00:02:00.320> ankle<00:02:00.680> is<00:02:00.860> and

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
out to a point where the ankle is and

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.280 
out to a point where the ankle is and
then<00:02:01.940> a<00:02:01.970> really<00:02:02.660> quick

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
then a really quick

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.169 
then a really quick
C<00:02:03.980> motion<00:02:04.520> finishes<00:02:05.300> it<00:02:05.480> off<00:02:05.690> for<00:02:06.230> the<00:02:06.320> foot

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
C motion finishes it off for the foot

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.809 
C motion finishes it off for the foot
and<00:02:08.560> remember<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.739> ferry<00:02:10.009> is<00:02:10.129> small<00:02:10.459> so<00:02:10.729> it

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
and remember the ferry is small so it

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
start small mine was a bit too big so I

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.500 
start small mine was a bit too big so I
just<00:02:59.670> quickly<00:02:59.970> erased<00:03:00.630> it<00:03:00.930> with<00:03:01.049> a<00:03:01.080> wet<00:03:01.349> wipe

with<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.489> sponge<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.739> I<00:03:10.739> started<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.310> head

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
with the sponge and I started the head

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.449

again<00:03:11.549> but<00:03:12.000> this<00:03:12.780> time<00:03:13.110> I<00:03:13.380> started<00:03:14.099> small<00:03:14.400> just

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
again but this time I started small just

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.580 
again but this time I started small just
always<00:03:15.000> start<00:03:15.239> small<00:03:15.299> because<00:03:15.930> he<00:03:16.049> can<00:03:16.200> add<00:03:16.410> on

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
always start small because he can add on

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.130 
always start small because he can add on
to<00:03:16.859> it<00:03:16.890> but<00:03:17.280> it's<00:03:17.549> harder<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.299> erase<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:19.109> and

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
to it but it's harder to erase it and

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.400 
to it but it's harder to erase it and
start<00:03:19.440> over<00:03:20.420> make<00:03:21.420> sure<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.810> add<00:03:21.959> just<00:03:22.200> a

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
start over make sure to add just a

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.900 
start over make sure to add just a
little<00:03:22.440> bit<00:03:22.829> of<00:03:23.100> a<00:03:23.190> point<00:03:23.579> for<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.030> chin

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:00.350 
I'm very frustrated so to fix it I just

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.310 
I'm very frustrated so to fix it I just
took<00:07:00.590> a<00:07:00.650> damp<00:07:01.040> brush<00:07:01.280> and<00:07:01.930> the<00:07:02.930> damp<00:07:03.170> brush

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:03.320 
took a damp brush and the damp brush

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.350 
took a damp brush and the damp brush
just<00:07:03.530> wiped<00:07:03.980> that<00:07:04.160> black<00:07:04.490> right<00:07:04.850> off<00:07:05.030> from<00:07:05.240> the

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 
just wiped that black right off from the

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.320 
just wiped that black right off from the
blue<00:07:05.540> very<00:07:05.840> easily<00:07:06.110> and<00:07:06.530> then<00:07:07.100> I<00:07:07.430> also<00:07:07.670> used<00:07:08.120> it

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.330 
blue very easily and then I also used it

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.270 
blue very easily and then I also used it
to<00:07:08.390> clean<00:07:08.720> up<00:07:08.900> and<00:07:09.140> smooth<00:07:09.590> out<00:07:09.800> any<00:07:10.010> of<00:07:10.190> the

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280 
to clean up and smooth out any of the

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.070 
to clean up and smooth out any of the
paint<00:07:10.580> where<00:07:10.790> the<00:07:10.880> stencil<00:07:11.360> had<00:07:11.540> lifted<00:07:11.840> the

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 
paint where the stencil had lifted the

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.010 
paint where the stencil had lifted the
paint<00:07:12.980> up<00:07:13.220> so<00:07:13.670> it's<00:07:13.790> a<00:07:13.880> good<00:07:14.180> trick<00:07:14.360> to<00:07:14.540> use<00:07:14.720> for

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:15.020 
paint up so it's a good trick to use for

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.900
