more and more obvious to people that

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.920 
more and more obvious to people that
there's<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.890> shift<00:00:17.160> going<00:00:17.400> on<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.930> planetary

itself<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.729> all<00:01:05.850> starts<00:01:06.360> with<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.689> heart<00:01:10.400> when

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
itself it all starts with the heart when

itself it all starts with the heart when
the<00:01:11.520> heart's<00:01:12.140> rhythmic<00:01:13.140> beating<00:01:13.439> pattern<00:01:14.040> is

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
the heart's rhythmic beating pattern is

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.490 
the heart's rhythmic beating pattern is
smooth<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.479> ordered<00:01:15.840> it's<00:01:16.049> called<00:01:16.350> a

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
smooth and ordered it's called a

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.370 
smooth and ordered it's called a
coherent<00:01:16.890> rhythm<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:18.080> coherent<00:01:19.080> rhythm

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
coherent rhythm and that coherent rhythm

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.090 
coherent rhythm and that coherent rhythm
in<00:01:19.560> trains<00:01:20.310> or<00:01:21.320> synchronizes<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.799> brain

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
in trains or synchronizes the brain

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.100 
in trains or synchronizes the brain
rhythm<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> nervous<00:01:23.939> system<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.570> body's

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
rhythm the nervous system the body's

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.800 
rhythm the nervous system the body's
organs<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.710> glands<00:01:25.979> all<00:01:26.280> dance<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.390> harmony

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
organs and glands all dance and harmony

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.429 
organs and glands all dance and harmony
to<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.170> heart<00:01:28.650> coherent<00:01:29.400> rhythm<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.689> people

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
to that heart coherent rhythm so people

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.810 
to that heart coherent rhythm so people
kind<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.740> know<00:01:31.920> inside<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.490> them<00:01:32.640> when<00:01:32.729> they

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
kind of know inside of them when they

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.569 
kind of know inside of them when they
feel<00:01:33.030> connected<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.750> heart<00:01:34.280> things<00:01:35.280> line

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
feel connected in the heart things line

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.030 
feel connected in the heart things line
up<00:01:35.610> they're<00:01:36.180> more<00:01:36.509> at<00:01:36.840> ease<00:01:37.079> more<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.740> flow

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
up they're more at ease more in the flow

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.950 
up they're more at ease more in the flow
and<00:01:38.250> there<00:01:38.400> really<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> scientific<00:01:39.540> basis

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
and there really is a scientific basis

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.649 
and there really is a scientific basis
for<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.430> so<00:01:41.430> heart<00:01:41.670> coherence<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:42.329> when<00:01:42.509> we

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
for that so heart coherence is when we

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.319 
for that so heart coherence is when we
have<00:01:43.009> groups<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.220> people<00:01:44.369> intentionally

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
have groups of people intentionally

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.999 
have groups of people intentionally
becoming<00:01:45.659> heart<00:01:45.990> coherent<00:01:46.560> with<00:01:46.979> a

there's<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.580> lot<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.730> power<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.300> that<00:01:52.280> on<00:01:53.280> the

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
ionosphere of the earth now what's

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.860 
ionosphere of the earth now what's
really<00:02:11.250> interesting<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.030> resonances<00:02:12.750> are

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
really interesting is the resonances are

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.900 
really interesting is the resonances are
these<00:02:13.020> waves<00:02:13.350> that<00:02:14.340> are<00:02:14.460> occurring<00:02:14.760> the

these waves that are occurring the

these waves that are occurring the

the<00:02:16.530> first<00:02:16.770> one<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:17.160> seven<00:02:17.580> point<00:02:17.820> eight<00:02:17.970> Hertz

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
the first one is seven point eight Hertz

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.199 
the first one is seven point eight Hertz
that<00:02:19.110> that's<00:02:19.350> that<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.770> very<00:02:20.340> same<00:02:20.580> frequency

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
that that's that the very same frequency

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.030 
that that's that the very same frequency
is<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.600> human<00:02:21.959> brain<00:02:22.080> wave<00:02:22.380> of<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.740> Alpha

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
is the human brain wave of the Alpha

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.890 
is the human brain wave of the Alpha
rhythm<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.090> could<00:02:24.209> think<00:02:24.360> of<00:02:24.570> this<00:02:24.690> kind

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
rhythm and you could think of this kind

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.690 
rhythm and you could think of this kind
of<00:02:24.990> like<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.170> brain<00:02:25.620> wave<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.130> planet<00:02:26.550> can

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
of like a brain wave of the planet can

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.090 
of like a brain wave of the planet can
heart<00:02:26.910> rhythms<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.330> planet<00:02:27.810> but<00:02:28.800> it's

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
heart rhythms of the planet but it's

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.220 
heart rhythms of the planet but it's
indeed<00:02:29.489> our<00:02:29.640> hypothesis<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.660> there<00:02:30.959> actually

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
indeed our hypothesis and there actually

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.199 
indeed our hypothesis and there actually
is<00:02:31.320> data<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.650> support<00:02:31.830> this<00:02:32.130> as<00:02:32.310> well<00:02:32.550> that

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
is data to support this as well that

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.160 
is data to support this as well that
it's<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.420> two-way<00:02:33.630> street

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
it's a two-way street

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.320 
it's a two-way street
that<00:02:34.650> what<00:02:34.800> we<00:02:35.010> do<00:02:35.220> as<00:02:35.370> individual<00:02:35.940> humans

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
that what we do as individual humans

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.530 
that what we do as individual humans
especially<00:02:36.959> when<00:02:37.530> we<00:02:37.739> have<00:02:38.580> cooperative<00:02:39.209> or
