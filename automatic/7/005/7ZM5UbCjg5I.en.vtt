00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.350
 all'uci of mobile magazine vi 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.340
 let's show another 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.910
 galaxy s 4 this time waste 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.240
 very particular because 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.990
 ip67 model that resists to water 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.320
 powder 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.380
 all the basic features of the 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.500
 which traditional a nice display of 5 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.840
 thumbs up and see 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.710
 but here we were not immediately 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.770
 light but is a full hd with tft technology 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.300
 lcd no the operating system that moves it 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.640
 and android 4.2 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.850
 the two famous some more 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.219
 technical 2 gig of memory from 16gb of 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.590
 storage something less naturally 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.110
 invited to the user with the possibility 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:54.360
 to extend this on this storage 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:56.310
 up to me like or 64gb of micro sd 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.860
 let's go straight to one of the more functions 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.360
 interested in the camera 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.470
 Yes No 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:07.740
 immediately an 8 megapixel camera with 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:10.380
 led flash and the front a camera from 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.440
 2 megapixels but because he spoke to you immediately 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.810
 of the camera because now let's see 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.330
 also to activate it 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.080
 we have said it and then that 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.670
 resists under water for one meter by 30 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.020
 minutes 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.120
 in this it means that underwater is 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.160
 also possible to take pictures though 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.220
 underwater the touch panel does not 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.170
 it works then samsung has thought of one 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.800
 particular bottle here which 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.880
 water mode that is appropriate and shoot 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.090
 underwater says the form written to 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.200
 moment in English because software emule 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.660
 means that the buttons of change 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.350
 you ca n't warm up by touching the 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.610
 display such as can be done this way 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.740
 automatic 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:59.510
 I took when the boulders display 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.580
 snap will have to clicking by crushing 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.670
 the barbell key is therefore possible 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.660
 to reduce to taking pictures underwater 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.060
 this has been specially designed 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.490
 first a phone that fits 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.060
 particularly the sport activity 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.100
 matter rather powerful because it is one 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.820
 2.6 trillion 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:25.820
 as of strong life lt and therefore 4 cc 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:28.070
 also wifi connectivity nfc connectivity 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.710
 the dimensions a little bigger 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:34.570
 why 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:38.590
 its 139.7 is an armored phone 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:44.220
 height 71 mm for the 3 mm width 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:47.140
 93 by 1 mm its its its profile 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.100
 is a phone for sports people we said 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.280
 yes and that's why samsung 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.530
 promised bright colors beyond 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.480
 of what you are seeing that black there 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.300
 a version will be a blue tone 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:06.960
 song is a gray color 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:09.480
 phone for enthusiasts and sportsmen who 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.970
 however, it has a great technological base between 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.030
 which one processor is then that of the axis 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:20.340
 iv of the first galaxy later s600 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:23.250
 so a quad core at 1.9 gig and like 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.860
 you if as to exclusive functions 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.020
 this example we ve s health 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.480
 shown more than once but remain 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:35.370
 all the exclusive functions of the s4 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:38.129
 with its applications and with everything 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.220
 all its software kit like ad 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:44.870
 example group you with the possibility of 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:49.500
 share with other nearby appliances 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:52.140
 video music and even documents and papers 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.569
 Calculation and album stories the possibility 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:58.200
 from here to something that someone has 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:01.260
 already left the story album the fall 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.470
 it's real digital photo album with 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.590
 the story maybe of your holidays 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:10.769
 titled dated and subtitled for each 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.010
 for each photo you also see that there are 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:16.400
 three keys below 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:19.400
 this is the key that gives access to that 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:23.320
 remember the phone but this is the 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:28.630
 return button of this 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.700
 you see access to the settings and win 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.090
 for the moment it is all this is the 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.800
 samsung galaxy s look forward then 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.370
 let's see then I said the editors 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.370
