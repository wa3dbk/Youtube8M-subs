this<00:01:04.440> very<00:01:04.650> day<00:01:04.799> if<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:06.000> have<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.210> telescope

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
this very day if you have a telescope

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.130 
this very day if you have a telescope
especially<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> full<00:01:08.760> moon<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.840> train

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
especially on a full moon and you train

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.730 
especially on a full moon and you train
your<00:01:10.259> telescope<00:01:10.859> at<00:01:11.100> any<00:01:11.310> crater<00:01:11.969> in<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.270> moon

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
your telescope at any crater in the moon

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.709 
your telescope at any crater in the moon
you<00:01:13.740> will<00:01:13.859> see<00:01:14.039> activity<00:01:14.369> there<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.539> will<00:01:15.659> see

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:15.719 
you will see activity there you will see

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:17.660 
you will see activity there you will see
lights<00:01:16.079> moving<00:01:16.259> you'll<00:01:16.740> see<00:01:16.920> vehicles<00:01:17.369> moving

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
lights moving you'll see vehicles moving

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.959 
lights moving you'll see vehicles moving
you<00:01:18.210> will<00:01:18.329> see<00:01:18.509> buildings<00:01:19.399> you<00:01:20.399> can<00:01:20.609> do<00:01:20.759> this

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:20.969 
you will see buildings you can do this

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:23.389 
you will see buildings you can do this
if<00:01:21.179> you<00:01:21.299> have<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.590> telescope<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.039> it<00:01:23.100> doesn't

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
if you have a telescope and it doesn't

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:25.160 
if you have a telescope and it doesn't
have<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.640> be<00:01:23.670> an<00:01:23.880> expensive<00:01:24.390> telescope<00:01:24.600> either

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
have to be an expensive telescope either

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:38.310 
have to be an expensive telescope either
and<00:01:26.000> they<00:01:27.000> colonized<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:28.520> continent

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.740 

and<00:01:39.320> there<00:01:40.310> are<00:01:40.399> two<00:01:40.579> main<00:01:40.789> continents<00:01:41.119> at<00:01:41.630> the

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
and there are two main continents at the

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.060 
and there are two main continents at the
time<00:01:42.020> a<00:01:43.509> continent<00:01:44.509> that<00:01:44.899> is<00:01:45.079> known<00:01:45.259> as<00:01:45.469> or<00:01:45.710> was

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
time a continent that is known as or was

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.609 
time a continent that is known as or was
known<00:01:46.340> as<00:01:46.549> Lemuria<00:01:47.119> or<00:01:47.420> and<00:01:48.259> some

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
known as Lemuria or and some

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.880 
known as Lemuria or and some
civilizations<00:01:49.399> they<00:01:49.549> called<00:01:49.789> it<00:01:49.939> mu<00:01:50.890> these

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
civilizations they called it mu these

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:59.660 
civilizations they called it mu these
were<00:01:52.100> reptilian<00:01:52.359> beings

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.889 

no<00:02:00.670> and<00:02:00.969> so<00:02:01.630> people<00:02:01.840> say<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.259> me<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:04.630> can<00:02:04.659> live

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
no and so people say to me you can live

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.950 
no and so people say to me you can live
as<00:02:05.049> much<00:02:05.259> hope<00:02:06.420> might<00:02:07.420> as<00:02:07.479> well<00:02:07.600> kill<00:02:07.780> myself

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
as much hope might as well kill myself

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.780 
as much hope might as well kill myself
now<00:02:09.629> but<00:02:10.629> that's<00:02:10.810> not<00:02:10.989> the<00:02:11.170> answer<00:02:11.379> the<00:02:12.370> answer

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
now but that's not the answer the answer

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
now but that's not the answer the answer
is<00:02:12.819> you<00:02:13.780> are<00:02:14.019> the<00:02:14.230> hope<00:02:14.410> if<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:16.060> are<00:02:16.330> able<00:02:16.510> to

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
is you are the hope if you are able to

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.960 
is you are the hope if you are able to
control<00:02:17.110> your<00:02:17.260> online<00:02:17.590> pattern<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.160> take

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
control your online pattern and take

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.530 
control your online pattern and take
control<00:02:19.090> of<00:02:19.360> your<00:02:19.569> own<00:02:19.750> victim<00:02:20.560> mentality

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
control of your own victim mentality

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.000 
control of your own victim mentality
then<00:02:22.540> those<00:02:22.810> who<00:02:22.989> control<00:02:23.290> this<00:02:23.470> planet<00:02:23.890> will

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
then those who control this planet will

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.610 
then those who control this planet will
not<00:02:24.129> have<00:02:24.280> control<00:02:24.489> over<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.470> if<00:02:26.470> you

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
not have control over you and if you

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.770 
not have control over you and if you
then<00:02:26.650> teach<00:02:27.069> that<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.340> other<00:02:27.640> people<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.269> they

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
then teach that to other people and they

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.020 
then teach that to other people and they
teach<00:02:29.049> it<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.349> other<00:02:29.500> people<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.160> there's<00:02:30.940> a

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
teach it to other people and there's a

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.479 
teach it to other people and there's a
chain<00:02:31.390> like<00:02:31.599> that<00:02:31.900> it<00:02:32.680> can<00:02:32.950> reach<00:02:33.130> a<00:02:33.250> critical

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
chain like that it can reach a critical

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.789 
chain like that it can reach a critical
mass<00:02:33.790> that<00:02:34.420> will<00:02:34.660> spill<00:02:34.930> over<00:02:34.959> to<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.440> rest<00:02:35.650> of

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
mass that will spill over to the rest of

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.580 
mass that will spill over to the rest of
the<00:02:35.890> population<00:02:36.069> that<00:02:36.810> will<00:02:37.810> then<00:02:37.989> stop<00:02:38.319> and

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
the population that will then stop and

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.150 
the population that will then stop and
prevent<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:40.170> occupation<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.349> the<00:02:41.650> tyranny

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
prevent the occupation and the tyranny

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.460 
prevent the occupation and the tyranny
