00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 It was like going into a hole 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.779
 so an eye-witness described the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.280

 It will not be easy for the police 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.250
 its the exact way to 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.560
 reconstruct 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.690
 the accident site was just behind one 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.340
 dense fog wall many vehicle drivers 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.840
 were on the fog free route 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.910

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.530

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.920
