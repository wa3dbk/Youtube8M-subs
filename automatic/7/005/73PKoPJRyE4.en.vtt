teacher and therefore it causes the
students<00:02:21.120> confidence<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.750> grow<00:02:33.020> a<00:02:35.060> few<00:02:36.060> cons

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
students confidence to grow a few cons

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.690 
students confidence to grow a few cons
are<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:37.380> there<00:02:37.560> are<00:02:37.680> lots<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:38.040> opportunities

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
are that there are lots of opportunities

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.000 
are that there are lots of opportunities
for<00:02:38.730> children<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.300> become<00:02:39.750> stressed<00:02:40.200> there

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
for children to become stressed there

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.070 
for children to become stressed there
are<00:02:41.130> disagreements<00:02:41.630> someone<00:02:42.630> not<00:02:42.780> doing

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
are disagreements someone not doing

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.990 
are disagreements someone not doing
their<00:02:43.200> fair<00:02:43.440> share<00:02:43.710> and<00:02:43.770> someone<00:02:44.340> being<00:02:44.550> bossy

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
their fair share and someone being bossy

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.540 
their fair share and someone being bossy
can<00:02:45.240> cause<00:02:45.510> children<00:02:46.170> stress<00:02:46.550> therefore

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
can cause children stress therefore

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.730 
can cause children stress therefore
leadership<00:02:48.210> and<00:02:48.450> interpersonal<00:02:48.900> skills<00:02:49.200> must

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
leadership and interpersonal skills must

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.650 
leadership and interpersonal skills must
be<00:02:49.950> practiced<00:02:50.460> in<00:02:50.640> order<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:51.030> achieve<00:02:51.270> success

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
be practiced in order to achieve success

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.320 
be practiced in order to achieve success
in<00:02:52.080> collaboration<00:02:52.770> there's<00:02:53.730> also<00:02:53.910> less

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
in collaboration there's also less

collaborative activities some students

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.510 
collaborative activities some students
might<00:02:58.140> get<00:02:58.350> away<00:02:58.560> with<00:02:58.710> doing<00:02:58.890> less<00:02:59.220> work<00:02:59.490> than

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520

one<00:03:01.410> final<00:03:01.680> con<00:03:01.980> about<00:03:02.130> collaboration<00:03:02.940> is

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
one final con about collaboration is

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.060 
one final con about collaboration is
that<00:03:03.120> some<00:03:03.630> introverts<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.320> shy<00:03:04.530> students

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
that some introverts and shy students

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.470 
that some introverts and shy students
might<00:03:05.280> be<00:03:05.460> uncomfortable<00:03:05.970> working<00:03:06.330> together

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480

on introverts in that TED talk she makes

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.310 
on introverts in that TED talk she makes
strong<00:03:14.040> arguments<00:03:14.630> against<00:03:15.630> collaboration

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
strong arguments against collaboration

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.380 
strong arguments against collaboration
however<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.160> still<00:03:17.490> believe<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.940> importance

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
however I still believe the importance

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.210 
however I still believe the importance
of<00:03:18.570> collaboration<00:03:19.170> especially<00:03:19.590> for

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220

introverted or shy students I feel that

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.240 
introverted or shy students I feel that
these<00:03:22.230> are<00:03:22.380> skills<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:22.740> they'll<00:03:23.010> need<00:03:23.220> to
