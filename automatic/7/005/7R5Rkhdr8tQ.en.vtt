will be available at least the H 0 1

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.369 
will be available at least the H 0 1
will<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.850> available<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.360> another<00:00:42.480> within

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
will be available in another within

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.680 
will be available in another within
about<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.680> month<00:00:43.920> or<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.370> scale<00:00:45.059> it's

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
about a month or so and scale it's

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.029 
about a month or so and scale it's
actually<00:00:46.050> just<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.320> test<00:00:46.530> shot<00:00:46.680> even<00:00:46.950> though

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
actually just a test shot even though

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.430 
actually just a test shot even though
it's<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> decorated<00:00:47.670> model<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:48.960> believe<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
it's a decorated model so we believe the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.020 
it's a decorated model so we believe the
N<00:00:49.649> scale<00:00:49.890> model<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.280> still<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> few<00:00:50.670> months<00:00:50.879> out

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
N scale model is still a few months out

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.910 
N scale model is still a few months out
and<00:00:51.270> likewise<00:00:51.840> with<00:00:52.020> o<00:00:52.140> scale<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.770> is

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
and likewise with o scale this is

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.819 
and likewise with o scale this is
actually<00:00:53.370> being<00:00:53.760> premiered<00:00:54.120> at<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.360> show<00:00:54.539> and

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
actually being premiered at the show and

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.170 
actually being premiered at the show and
it<00:00:55.829> will<00:00:55.980> probably<00:00:56.160> not<00:00:56.460> be<00:00:56.520> available<00:00:56.820> for

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
it will probably not be available for

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.779 
it will probably not be available for
several<00:00:57.420> months<00:00:57.510> but<00:00:57.980> they<00:00:58.980> are<00:00:59.129> attractive

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
several months but they are attractive

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.840 
several months but they are attractive

and in the Hobby have been played see so
there's<00:03:07.090> been<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.239> lot<00:03:07.390> of<00:03:07.420> interest<00:03:07.780> in<00:03:07.870> this

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
there's been a lot of interest in this

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.300 
there's been a lot of interest in this
because<00:03:08.410> of<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.739> fact<00:03:08.890> that<00:03:09.010> it<00:03:09.160> is<00:03:09.280> a

configurations just a flat car the tall
bulkhead<00:03:31.510> which<00:03:31.690> you<00:03:31.810> see<00:03:31.959> here<00:03:31.989> and<00:03:32.470> then

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
bulkhead which you see here and then

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.710 
bulkhead which you see here and then
also<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:33.100> short<00:03:33.310> bulkhead<00:03:33.640> and<00:03:33.850> this<00:03:34.600> is

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
also the short bulkhead and this is

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.020 
also the short bulkhead and this is
another<00:03:35.019> test<00:03:35.290> shot<00:03:35.470> we<00:03:35.680> don't<00:03:35.980> I<00:03:36.250> wouldn't

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
another test shot we don't I wouldn't

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.400 
another test shot we don't I wouldn't
promise<00:03:37.209> a<00:03:37.450> delivery<00:03:37.780> at<00:03:37.870> this<00:03:38.019> point<00:03:38.230> we'll

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
promise a delivery at this point we'll

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.539 
promise a delivery at this point we'll
probably<00:03:38.620> have<00:03:38.890> more<00:03:39.010> information<00:03:39.430> available

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
probably have more information available

very common today a self storage unit

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.140 
very common today a self storage unit
which<00:04:44.380> I<00:04:44.500> think<00:04:44.740> comes<00:04:45.190> in<00:04:45.310> a<00:04:45.370> pack<00:04:45.550> of<00:04:45.700> 2<00:04:45.910> and

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
which I think comes in a pack of 2 and

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.210 
which I think comes in a pack of 2 and
these<00:04:46.660> are<00:04:46.780> everywhere<00:04:47.170> and<00:04:47.350> I<00:04:47.800> don't<00:04:48.100> know<00:04:48.160> if

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
these are everywhere and I don't know if

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.530 
these are everywhere and I don't know if
anyone<00:04:48.400> else<00:04:48.610> agrees<00:04:48.910> but<00:04:49.060> I<00:04:49.120> tend<00:04:49.300> to<00:04:49.390> see

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
anyone else agrees but I tend to see

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.330 
anyone else agrees but I tend to see
these<00:04:49.660> along<00:04:50.140> rail<00:04:50.350> lines<00:04:50.590> wherever<00:04:51.070> they<00:04:51.310> go

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
these along rail lines wherever they go

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.460 
these along rail lines wherever they go
up<00:04:51.640> they<00:04:52.150> seem<00:04:52.360> to<00:04:52.390> be<00:04:52.510> located<00:04:52.780> near<00:04:53.200> a<00:04:53.230> rail

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
up they seem to be located near a rail

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.570 
up they seem to be located near a rail
line<00:04:53.650> so<00:04:53.890> I<00:04:54.070> think<00:04:54.190> it's<00:04:54.370> an<00:04:54.490> appropriate

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
line so I think it's an appropriate

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.480 
line so I think it's an appropriate
addition<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.360> the<00:04:55.750> laser<00:04:55.930> cut<00:04:56.200> line

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
addition to the laser cut line

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.070 
addition to the laser cut line
definitely<00:04:57.490> any<00:04:58.030> possibility<00:04:58.870> of<00:04:58.900> those

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
definitely any possibility of those

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.190 
definitely any possibility of those
showing<00:04:59.410> up<00:04:59.530> in<00:04:59.680> a<00:04:59.770> cho<00:05:00.010> it's<00:05:00.220> anytime<00:05:00.670> i

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
showing up in a cho it's anytime i

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.360 
showing up in a cho it's anytime i
believe<00:05:02.200> they're<00:05:02.410> in<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:02.650> works<00:05:02.830> ratio<00:05:03.220> as

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
believe they're in the works ratio as

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.530 
believe they're in the works ratio as
