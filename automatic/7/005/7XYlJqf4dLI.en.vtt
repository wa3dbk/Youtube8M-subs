00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 
and I had the same reaction initially I

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.700 
and I had the same reaction initially I
was<00:00:48.910> thinking<00:00:48.940> oh<00:00:49.390> this<00:00:49.840> is<00:00:49.989> more<00:00:50.170> politically

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
was thinking oh this is more politically

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:51.890 
was thinking oh this is more politically
correct<00:00:50.739> nonsense<00:00:51.579> this<00:00:51.730> is

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
correct nonsense this is

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.210 
correct nonsense this is
hypersensitivity<00:00:52.900> in<00:00:52.989> our<00:00:53.110> culture<00:00:53.500> and<00:00:53.680> then

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
hypersensitivity in our culture and then

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.800 
hypersensitivity in our culture and then
you<00:00:54.340> read<00:00:54.610> the<00:00:54.760> piece<00:00:54.940> and<00:00:55.149> you<00:00:55.239> really<00:00:55.510> walk

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
you read the piece and you really walk

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.000 
you read the piece and you really walk
through<00:00:56.079> the<00:00:56.170> steps<00:00:56.410> with<00:00:56.470> her<00:00:56.620> I<00:00:56.680> think<00:00:56.890> it's

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
through the steps with her I think it's

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.920 
through the steps with her I think it's
a<00:00:57.070> tribute<00:00:57.250> to<00:00:57.399> her<00:00:57.579> writing<00:00:58.000> and<00:00:58.120> you<00:00:58.600> realize

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
a tribute to her writing and you realize

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.540 
a tribute to her writing and you realize

went<00:01:04.360> to<00:01:04.420> school<00:01:04.629> maybe<00:01:04.960> you<00:01:05.079> wouldn't<00:01:05.409> feel

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
went to school maybe you wouldn't feel

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:07.230 
went to school maybe you wouldn't feel
that<00:01:05.680> you<00:01:05.890> were<00:01:06.040> part<00:01:06.369> of<00:01:06.460> that<00:01:06.640> tradition

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
that you were part of that tradition

the rails

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.389 
the rails
well<00:01:11.469> I<00:01:11.499> thought<00:01:11.859> that's<00:01:12.009> kind<00:01:12.249> of

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
well I thought that's kind of

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.190 
well I thought that's kind of
interesting<00:01:12.880> though<00:01:13.030> to<00:01:13.299> have<00:01:13.509> an<00:01:13.630> animal

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
interesting though to have an animal

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.499 
interesting though to have an animal
which<00:01:14.649> is<00:01:14.679> something<00:01:15.159> that<00:01:15.310> kids<00:01:15.520> love<00:01:15.850> sort

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
which is something that kids love sort

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.419 
which is something that kids love sort
of<00:01:16.600> brings<00:01:16.810> that<00:01:16.990> cartoonish<00:01:17.590> component<00:01:18.189> into

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 
of brings that cartoonish component into

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:20.910 
of brings that cartoonish component into
it<00:01:18.579> and<00:01:18.759> I<00:01:18.789> think<00:01:18.819> that<00:01:19.119> makes<00:01:19.420> all<00:01:19.659> kids<00:01:20.200> kind

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
it and I think that makes all kids kind

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.830 
it and I think that makes all kids kind
of<00:01:21.100> feel<00:01:21.369> welcome<00:01:21.969> in<00:01:22.149> the<00:01:22.240> process<00:01:22.630> so<00:01:22.749> as
