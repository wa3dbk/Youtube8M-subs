00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.620
 hello very good to all the kids I am 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.330
 of steak crash and today we are here in the 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.970
 that is going to be a new strategy a 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.529
 new competitive analysis on a 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.810
 new pokémon that has brought us the sixth 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.790
 generation a pokémon like I did before 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.880
 with woodgate which is also of type 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.250
 ghost plant and is premiering well 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.960
 as you can see by the image and before 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.570
 nothing, let's comment a bit, you know 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.640
 before going directly to the museum and 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.860
 how to use it, I'm going to analyze a 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.660
 little what has been his type his 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.910
 characteristics and the two skills 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.920
 which has the two useful skills 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.170
 because there are three that have but good 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.719
 I'm just going to comment on natural cure and 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.910
 harvest that are to me see the two that are 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.850
 useful to climb dare before then 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.190
 good as we can see foresee and go to 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.219
 be like a pokemon gay goal of 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.250
 ghost type plant we had not 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.420
 seen before I think it was never going to be a 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.250
 combination of pretty types 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.170
 interesting not especially since so 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.930
 that I mentioned earlier with the analysis of 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.759
 gor geist is going to work as espn blogger 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.310
 you know the ghost type pokemon 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.439
 that block fast spin in such a way 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.950
 that not if we put trap rocks or quills 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:20.610
 then the opponent using fast spin did not 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.110
 he will be able to remove them and well 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.539
 ghost plant is a combination that 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.189
 it's good it's not bad it's new and 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:29.229
 you know as I said before spin blogger 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.369
 been good and good because both 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.869
 skills that have both 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.659
 skills that you are going to have are cure 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:38.829
 natural and harvest both going to go to 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:41.939
 be more or less dedicated to trying 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:44.590
 solve health problems ie 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.709
 with harvest we will use a 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.990
 strategy with rest and go stork and 

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:51.909
 with natural cure we are simply going to 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.560
 use rest and we're going to change 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.420
 pokemon you already know natural cure what 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.759
 is that it will cure us all 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.409
 changes of state when we change to the 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.450
 pokemon is to say if we use rest 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.810
 we change dare land and go out again 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.040
 dare before I would be awake and good 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.430
 well 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.500
 little more harvest and with berry stork is 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.600
 more than anything to solve all the 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.940
 types of state change over all 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.190
 dream that will give us rest and pos 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.320
 with harvest each turn that happens after 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.180
 to use that fence we will have a 50 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.610
 a hundred chance of recovering it 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.430
 so we will have almost virtually 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.650
 a recovery with rest almost 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.230
 unlimited then good first of all 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.290
 let's talk a little bit, you know about 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.390
 the stats on the characteristics of 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.530
 this guest goal forgiveness of burgess not 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.420
 I can 3 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.060
 I'm getting forgiven is decisive 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.590
 It's worth as you can see from the 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:50.230
 boom 85 76 82 is a pretty normal bug 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.390
 it's a normal life and defense bug 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.000
 special is not bad the defense maybe 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.790
 is a tad below the standard 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.700
 but it's pretty good and good because 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.230
 the offensive part 110 of attack is 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.080
 well it 's pretty good 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.950
 however 60-65 of special attacks 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.470
 low and 56 speed because it is also not 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.140
 something that stands out a lot so 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.930
 well let's move on to your set that by the 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:20.890
 musel you see how I put it here we are going to 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.770
 use it as a spin block let's say 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.950
 offensive but also to put changes 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.720
 that is to say it's going to be a pokémon 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.430
 quite versatile in this regard well 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.470
 As we can see it stands out for its good 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.960
 attack a boom enough to exercise 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.590
 his main job the work forgiveness not the 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.700
 work ball that is the one of spin blocker 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.710
 belly will be shown with a pokémon 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.630
 with strength and a very reliable way of 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.940
 health recovery that is the 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.130
 combination as I told you about rest 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.660
 more go stork plus harvest comes the 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.060
 mus set is going to take rest for 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.160
 recovery of health mazazo or until 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.830
 draw that you're going to decide 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.350
 you claw shaded also another blow 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.209
 of ghost type for greater coverage of 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.990
 guys and you get this and it's physical 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.880
 logically and willful fire then for 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:11.400
 try to annoy the clippers 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:14.409
 rival physicists mostly because 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.320
 I will be rolling all the time dare 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:20.320
 an stands out in special defense 182 and with 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.120
 a few eps in special defense 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.700
 will be well combined in this 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.730
 meaning will not be well complemented 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.680
 with fire and well let's say what 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.990
 what else does he take defensively 3 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.730
 is going to be in physical defense because if 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.370
 we burn the rival physical clippers 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.830
 so let's compensate a little this 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.450
 lack of bull for the physical part and 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.580
 Well as I said earlier as 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.220
 skill harvest object go stork 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.470
 with a decent bully and unlimited use 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.390
 between rest quotes and an attack 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.540
 good physical anticipate before trying 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.520
 make your way through over just rest 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.500
 he will cure for free thanks to his ability 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.390
 harvest with which we will recover the berry 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.820
 50 percent of the time each 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.400
 turn after fire is used 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.620
 fatuous is to get indirect damage and 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.990
 to stop physical attackers claw 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.360
 shade for cover and for this and blow 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.640
 or until drainage is already in your 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.650
 Mazazo decision is much more 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.570
 destructive in that sense and up 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.700
 drainage because it will do less damage but 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.970
 we will regenerate health which is going 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:24.790
 coming pretty well this is a good 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.440
 little the strategy that I have thought without 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.080
 However, I have also seen 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.400
 gates that use trainers 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.750
 Rest protection and fatuous fire 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.150
 drained hours protection rest and 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.280
 ghost hit is to say this is the 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.570
 strategy that I think will be 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.510
 quite well in fact I have tried it 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.550
 and nothing has gone well enough but now 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.860
 I tell you that they foresee and have enough 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.330
 more strategies and good because nothing this 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.190
 everything has been really I hope that you 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.230
 have liked the strategy that has 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.180
 it useful if it has been so really 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.220
 give x to subscribe helped me a 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.340
 heap and nothing but the question that you 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.710
 I'm going to leave today is not another more than yes yes 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.600
 you think that they are going to be over just me 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.150
 I think it's going to be used by people who are not 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.610
 see just however I do not think it's from 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.610
 tier over god is exactly let's go that 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:16.900
 is going to be an under just maybe but with 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:18.850
 quite a fairly common use in over 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.310
 just can not come to us quite well in 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.140
 over just so nothing you know, I hope 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.510
 that you liked the question you think 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.280
 that foresee and share over just put the 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:30.330
 comments of the video come I hope that 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.330
 you liked it come
