00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:06.100
 good kids, how are you doing? 

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:07.540
 here with more here it turns out that we just 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.430
 record for your channel and we're talking 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.230
 of recipe 805 and obviously when 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.540
 the cc comes out we are talking about the 'u' 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.330
 and it has given us taps to try it out to see 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.610
 how about to see how it is because it is 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.080
 alarm that here trying to save 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.700
 life from here to our colleague very 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.190
 good man but I have not got the 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.140
 good purpose 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.350
 is a weapon that in the same way that 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.760
 subject the 805 is a weapon that I 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.830
 personally he has used it more 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.450
 805 but do not you think that the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.640
 I used too much brother yo 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.470
 either itself instead of three who used 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.250
 a lot because it 's because instead of 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.870
 three good because he gives it three times to 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.480
 sometimes has has has magic has 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.580
 image hehehehe would not know how to define the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.340
 ask about some real dlc was from 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.110
 strong hands of the rooms good is 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.860
 that the weapons of the barracks were 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.460
 bad you know 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.530
 efe 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.420
 to see that I have here the party of the moment 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.070
 the first the first attempt then not 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.900
 I have enough part here I have enough 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.869
 part here is to my memory of agreement 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.750
 I'm already doing it's so good or they were 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.340
 I think he's dead all do not deceive you 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.979
 now I will try to gather here the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.680
 mate in garriga looked at least let's go 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.860
 crystals new ways by hyman over here 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:27.810
 inside you have seen them 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:31.470
 each one will go up 3 x 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.630
 they have an uncertain color 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.970
 crystals a question is me 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.560
 Well obviously it's not me because it 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.020
 I've listened to more people but we 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.119
 note a change in lighting in 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.280
 some maps 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.259
 in particular in this trunk in addition 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.390
 diversity was the first map on which 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.520
 I went in and I'm also playing with him with 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.210
 the map with with the map with the weapon with 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.909
 who played but I go in here and I say 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.039
 what has happened to this dark this results 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.319
 that have turned off the lights in theory that 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.039
 may be the one not seriously that's the 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:06.209
 explanation that I've heard where is 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.130
 is down is down is down 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.810
 down 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.819
 By the way, what they tried is not a 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.040
 My foolishness is that sometimes you give 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.480
 revive the place where they died when 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:23.159
 it has fallen off the turkey and it works 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.540
 Targeted logic does not matter where it pointed 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.640
 as if the deficits were where 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.519
 it points already good clear then when 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.359
 you have two you point to one because it's that 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.359
 always goes to the other 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:37.969
 it's science science, science fiction 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.270
 they do not fix it by chatting 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.770
 leave it in the truth is that I do not notice 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.760
 I did not have much time for 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.210
 experience it 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.210
 I must say 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.430
 to be in success 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:08.580
 very hard I put a good one because it is 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.580
 I admire from a distance but here in 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.160
 our 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.240
 to a mother of mine the pineapple is a lamela 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.100
 and ate of miracle to more it took it in addition 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.410
 I've put a green camouflage on him 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.630
 plan is flat is not a festive camouflage 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.730
 like luisa muÃ±oz a green camouflage quoted 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.720
 because that reminds me of the f3 that 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:36.050
 I had the green credit trick one thing 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:38.760
 I like what is called 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.250
 js ce or something like the submachine gun 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.100
 this tiny little square looked like 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.500
 has a charger in charger so give 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.270
 one I'm busy not looking like 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.750
 normal 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.750
 I'm failing 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:04:02.590
 I did not think I was wondering if the 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.440
 personal defense weapon that there is 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:09.060
 little dices 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.670
 j a tone a camouflage makes a tone 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.420
 basic of how very good green the truth 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.120
 It is very cute 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.160
 yes I like the other I like quite 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.200
 although clear for the camouflages so 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:26.700
 series that I liked for example the 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:29.740
 of the 16th of bf3 or the painting 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.020
 peeled emaya from that web 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.639
 that was another slight we add him though 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.010
 I would look at camouflages 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.690
 instead of 4 have started when 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.490
 they announced and I saw that there was a lot of freedom 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.050
 to customize the weapons and this is law 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.410
 that's fine but today it ended without using them 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.410
 we go 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.390
 without using the direct 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.710
 I like that you can change the 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:55.930
 camouflage the logical things but if you 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.760
 you're like for example that camouflage you 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.530
 you are going to put a desert a tank you are going to 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.150
 tell you to count but not that in the 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.320
 I do not know how good I know 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:10.230
 freedom to gather that of being exercised not 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:13.030
 I exercise my freedom by not putting it on 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.870
 quite for example I'm going to put a 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.990
 example 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.390
 if there were base colors like for example 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:23.890
 there is a hard line for example you see a 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:25.870
 video with with 416 in so pretty very 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:29.200
 nice because everything stays the whole gun 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.810
 all the weapon in that solid and then the 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.380
 moving parts and such as the breech and 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:38.060
 the mounting screws and stay 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.850
 blacks in which he was precious male 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:44.570
 but in fact I started watching the video and 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:49.190
 I say what you read to 416 is gorgeous beautiful 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:50.720
 more beautiful than normal and also everything 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.730
 this on the dust bowl map you know that 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.250
 is fucking fucking with the desert me 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:06:02.300
 love that camouflage the truth is that 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:03.580
 yes yes they are good and as they are called a 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.470
 colour 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.150
 we call it flat because I have the game 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:13.470
 in at least before I had the English game 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:13.470
 and milk 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.300
 spark 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:30.330
 before finishing the champion's head 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:33.230
 according to this partner that afterwards 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.230
 keep records 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:40.629
 but I also tell me not reduced 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:42.459
 and I break my fucking face for reviving 

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:44.469
 aa gray that I do not know and that I care 

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:46.119
 shit and I did not care less 

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:49.079
 even because then on top of you get them 

00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:52.079
 you die and seeing them they are doctors and 

00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:52.079
 Water 

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:58.409
 Well, I think it has come out 

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:58.409
 pretty good with the car 

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:14.499
 we have marked destroyed homes 

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:21.839
 and a kind of vs here does not work 

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:21.839
 it works more so to me a little bit more
