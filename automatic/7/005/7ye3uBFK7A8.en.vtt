00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
3637 tooth on me right now so I'd be

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.320 
3637 tooth on me right now so I'd be
able<00:05:47.199> to<00:05:47.349> run<00:05:47.500> a<00:05:47.949> bigger<00:05:48.219> pinion<00:05:48.729> and<00:05:48.940> see<00:05:49.180> how

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
able to run a bigger pinion and see how

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.189 
able to run a bigger pinion and see how
that<00:05:49.389> works<00:05:49.509> out

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 
that works out

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:53.760 
that works out
also<00:05:51.069> I<00:05:51.310> do<00:05:51.460> have<00:05:52.060> extra<00:05:52.389> sets<00:05:52.719> of<00:05:52.930> xo1<00:05:53.319> tyres

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
also I do have extra sets of xo1 tyres

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.369 
also I do have extra sets of xo1 tyres
now<00:05:54.400> I<00:05:54.729> might<00:05:55.300> be<00:05:55.419> going<00:05:55.569> with<00:05:55.719> this<00:05:56.020> but

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:56.379 
now I might be going with this but

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:58.140 
now I might be going with this but
there's<00:05:56.560> a<00:05:56.620> lot<00:05:56.800> of<00:05:56.889> airflow<00:05:57.129> with<00:05:57.729> that<00:05:57.939> I'm

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
there's a lot of airflow with that I'm

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.200 
there's a lot of airflow with that I'm
going<00:05:58.509> to<00:05:58.629> change<00:05:58.960> that<00:05:59.229> out<00:05:59.500> and<00:05:59.830> and<00:06:00.789> I<00:06:01.029> do

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
going to change that out and and I do

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.409 
going to change that out and and I do
have<00:06:01.569> the<00:06:01.779> black<00:06:02.080> discs<00:06:02.800> once<00:06:03.069> all<00:06:03.550> so<00:06:04.060> I<00:06:04.089> am

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
have the black discs once all so I am

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:08.040 
have the black discs once all so I am
going<00:06:04.659> to<00:06:04.779> come<00:06:05.650> across<00:06:05.770> and<00:06:06.479> strengthen<00:06:07.479> the

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
going to come across and strengthen the

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.499 
going to come across and strengthen the
body<00:06:08.669> also<00:06:09.669> thrown<00:06:09.879> a<00:06:09.909> little<00:06:10.150> bit<00:06:10.240> of<00:06:10.330> velcro

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:10.509 
body also thrown a little bit of velcro

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:12.209 
body also thrown a little bit of velcro
right<00:06:10.839> here<00:06:11.080> so<00:06:11.199> the<00:06:11.289> body<00:06:11.500> stays<00:06:11.830> intact

00:06:12.209 --> 00:06:12.219 
right here so the body stays intact

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:14.550 
right here so the body stays intact
because<00:06:12.669> there's<00:06:13.479> a<00:06:13.539> lot<00:06:13.719> of<00:06:13.750> airflow<00:06:14.050> and<00:06:14.500> a

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
because there's a lot of airflow and a

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.579 
because there's a lot of airflow and a
lot<00:06:14.680> of<00:06:14.710> ram<00:06:15.120> air<00:06:16.120> ram<00:06:16.449> going<00:06:16.839> through<00:06:17.020> the<00:06:17.169> RC

00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:17.589 
lot of ram air ram going through the RC

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:19.769 
lot of ram air ram going through the RC
so<00:06:17.860> I<00:06:18.099> want<00:06:18.580> this<00:06:18.729> to<00:06:18.879> be<00:06:18.909> as<00:06:19.120> stable<00:06:19.419> as

00:06:19.769 --> 00:06:19.779 
so I want this to be as stable as

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:24.149 
so I want this to be as stable as
possible<00:06:19.990> I<00:06:20.849> do<00:06:21.849> have<00:06:22.240> my<00:06:22.509> custom<00:06:23.169> weights<00:06:23.439> so

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:24.159 
possible I do have my custom weights so

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:26.339 
possible I do have my custom weights so
there<00:06:24.400> will<00:06:24.520> be<00:06:24.550> a<00:06:24.639> dad<00:06:24.879> to<00:06:25.210> the<00:06:25.330> front<00:06:25.599> now<00:06:26.139> if

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:26.349 
there will be a dad to the front now if

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:28.140 
there will be a dad to the front now if
you<00:06:26.439> have<00:06:26.650> the<00:06:26.800> original<00:06:27.159> X<00:06:27.339> on<00:06:27.520> one<00:06:27.669> you<00:06:27.939> don't

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
you have the original X on one you don't

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.790 
you have the original X on one you don't
need<00:06:28.330> that<00:06:28.569> but<00:06:29.020> we<00:06:29.199> are<00:06:29.229> going<00:06:29.620> to<00:06:29.680> be

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
need that but we are going to be

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.649 
need that but we are going to be
throwing<00:06:30.039> a<00:06:30.159> lot<00:06:30.339> more<00:06:30.370> power<00:06:30.759> into<00:06:31.120> this<00:06:31.240> so

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:31.659 
throwing a lot more power into this so

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:33.570 
throwing a lot more power into this so
this<00:06:31.779> is<00:06:31.839> something<00:06:32.199> that<00:06:32.229> was<00:06:32.500> that's<00:06:33.159> that's

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 
this is something that was that's that's

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.680 
this is something that was that's that's
going<00:06:34.120> to<00:06:34.240> be<00:06:34.389> needed<00:06:34.569> I'm<00:06:35.020> going<00:06:35.589> to<00:06:36.690> change

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690 
going to be needed I'm going to change

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.530 
going to be needed I'm going to change
out<00:06:37.839> the<00:06:37.990> top<00:06:38.319> chassis<00:06:39.039> mount

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.540 
out the top chassis mount

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.600 
out the top chassis mount
get<00:06:40.870> a<00:06:40.900> different<00:06:41.260> type<00:06:41.290> one<00:06:41.680> there's<00:06:42.220> a<00:06:42.310> few

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.610 
get a different type one there's a few

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.950 
get a different type one there's a few
little<00:06:42.760> customized<00:06:43.360> upgrades<00:06:43.750> that<00:06:43.870> I'm

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
little customized upgrades that I'm

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.680 
little customized upgrades that I'm
gonna<00:06:44.080> be<00:06:44.260> unveiling<00:06:44.680> very<00:06:45.520> soon<00:06:45.850> sooner<00:06:46.450> than

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:46.690 
gonna be unveiling very soon sooner than

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.170 
gonna be unveiling very soon sooner than
later<00:06:46.990> so<00:06:47.290> hopefully<00:06:47.980> look<00:06:48.160> out<00:06:48.280> for<00:06:48.430> that<00:06:48.640> on

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
later so hopefully look out for that on

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.600 
later so hopefully look out for that on
the<00:06:49.420> next<00:06:49.870> update<00:06:50.140> and<00:06:50.560> a<00:06:51.040> lot<00:06:51.190> of<00:06:51.220> people<00:06:51.520> who

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
the next update and a lot of people who

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.110 
the next update and a lot of people who
don't<00:06:51.820> think<00:06:52.120> that<00:06:52.600> this<00:06:52.870> can<00:06:53.050> go<00:06:53.340> above<00:06:54.340> the

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 
don't think that this can go above the

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.390 
don't think that this can go above the
hundred<00:06:55.510> mile<00:06:55.660> per<00:06:55.900> hour<00:06:55.930> marker<00:06:56.530> you<00:06:57.280> know

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 
hundred mile per hour marker you know

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.650 
hundred mile per hour marker you know
what<00:06:57.580> there's<00:06:57.850> a<00:06:57.910> lot<00:06:58.090> of<00:06:58.210> videos<00:06:58.480> out<00:06:58.600> there

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:58.660 
what there's a lot of videos out there

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.260 
what there's a lot of videos out there
that<00:06:58.840> can<00:06:59.140> prove<00:06:59.380> you<00:06:59.620> wrong<00:06:59.830> so<00:07:00.430> I<00:07:00.700> am<00:07:01.060> gonna

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.270 
that can prove you wrong so I am gonna

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.690 
that can prove you wrong so I am gonna
come<00:07:01.540> across<00:07:01.840> and<00:07:02.110> have<00:07:02.560> everything<00:07:02.890> this

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:03.700 
come across and have everything this

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.920 
come across and have everything this
would<00:07:03.820> be<00:07:03.910> a<00:07:03.940> little<00:07:04.270> build<00:07:04.450> series<00:07:04.660> and

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
would be a little build series and

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.260 
would be a little build series and
hopefully<00:07:05.290> we<00:07:05.410> can<00:07:05.530> get<00:07:05.680> this<00:07:05.850> going<00:07:06.850> going

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:07.270 
hopefully we can get this going going

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.930 
hopefully we can get this going going
beyond<00:07:08.260> its<00:07:08.440> means<00:07:08.730> anyway

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:09.940 
beyond its means anyway
