00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.710
 i 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.119
 do not 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.620
 hello friends today we are going to learn to 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.390
 prepare a deodorant gel for 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.029
 put it in a little bottle of these 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.600
 Rollo this is a little bottle that I had 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:37.540
 of a deodorant from some time ago and 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.680
 I had saved it so it will serve me 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.160
 to put my gel 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.230
 my gel deodorant and the ingredients 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.630
 that we are going to use are ingredients 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.460
 which in general are easy to 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.560
 get 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:55.340
 let's use the aloe vera gel what 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.739
 You can check out at the moment as I leave you 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.930
 at the end a link where they learn how 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.960
 get them out if they have the plant or it can be 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.150
 gel from which they sell packaging but see 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.930
 that is totally natural that does not carry 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.880
 alcohol or chemicals and we're going to 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.520
 use a little lemon does not 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.399
 worry that the lemon is not going to make them 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.259
 no harm besides using an antiseptic and 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:21.250
 as the amount of is little because there is no 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.140
 So severe problems of sensitive photos 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.090
 awareness because we are not going to 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.820
 walk with the zidane arm where is the 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.550
 sun in the armpit so there's no problem 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.899
 and good the bicarbonate and if not yes 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.000
 they want if they prefer instead of 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.250
 bicarbonate can use powder 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.040
 alum or the alum stone 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.160
 so they are options that you have 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:47.140
 so let's see how we prepare 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.140
 our roller deodorant 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.340
 champion 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:05.689
 Y 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.700
 here I have all the ingredients ready 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.790
 first what we are going to do is put 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.750
 the two teaspoons of baking 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.630
 I have them here measures 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.260
 I put the baking soda and I will add 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:35.040
 the teaspoon of lemon juice or can 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.040
 also use apple cider vinegar 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.120
 this is going to be foam 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.560
 but this is going to help dissolve 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.560
 well the bicarbonate 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.700
 we are going to leave it for a while resting 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.980
 before adding the other ingredients 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.190
 well after waiting a while 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.860
 we mix it well and this has already 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.870
 stayed almost like a pill then 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:08.900
 I'm going to add the infusion spoonful 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:13.450
 of sage you can use water 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:16.220
 of the band that are have properties 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.900
 deodorants or there are other infusions 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.900
 also that they can use 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:28.989
 salvia the advantage that has what is 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:31.370
 and it helps to avoid a little sweating 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:35.430
 well this keeps making us more foam 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:39.569
 let's let it rest for a while 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:41.200
 or rather let's take the aloe gel 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.230
 vera 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.910
 mine has put a bear color like that 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.349
 because two days ago I had taken it out 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.349
 and I had left it in the fridge 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.390
 we throw the two tablespoons and we go back to 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:02.510
 Now I'm going to use this to mix better 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.800
 this is going to stay like something 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.800
 slobbery by the gel 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.600
 once we have mixed well let's 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.730
 add the teaspoon of glycerin if 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.130
 you do not have glycerin, 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.720
 it is important this is only for 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.720
 soften skin a little 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.889
 there are people sometimes that baking 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:40.340
 it also irritates 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:42.220
 but I think this mix goes better 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.840
 by the gel 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:49.080
 of aloe vera that is healing 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.540
 good as all the skins react 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.870
 in a different way since everything is 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.870
 try out 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:02.090
 the lemon has no qualms about 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:04.789
 put it or as I say you can use vinegar 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.460
 of apple if they are afraid because the 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:10.520
 lemon is photosensitizing but as 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.919
 let's put in the armpits because there 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.590
 the sun gives us so I do not think there's 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:19.050
 no problem in that sense 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.020
 when we have good mixed we are going to 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.990
 add essential oil to your 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:29.700
 preferably I'll put oil 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:32.880
 lavender let's put 10 droplets or if 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:36.150
 they want to mix different scents can 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:40.020
 put 5 drops or three drops of each 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:44.450
 so that's how you give it the aroma 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.450
 more you can use and amilana 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.569
 now that we have added 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.690
 we're going to mix them all right once 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.410
 that our mix is ​​ready we miss 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.410
 in the little bottle 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.789
 Y 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:14.630
 we have our deodorant ready every 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:17.060
 Once you use it, shake it a little and 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.620
 so you can apply it so I 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.660
 tell how they are doing 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:24.250
 with this deodorant 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.250
 A kiss and until next time 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.630

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.070
 Y
