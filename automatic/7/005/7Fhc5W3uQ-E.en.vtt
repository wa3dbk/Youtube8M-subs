along<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.780> chest<00:01:40.020> area<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.710> gonna<00:01:40.890> help

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
along the chest area this is gonna help

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.770 
along the chest area this is gonna help
with<00:01:41.280> air<00:01:41.490> flow<00:01:41.700> you're<00:01:42.299> also<00:01:42.450> going<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.720> see

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
with air flow you're also going to see

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.990 
with air flow you're also going to see
slight<00:01:43.619> venting<00:01:44.159> right<00:01:44.460> underneath<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
slight venting right underneath the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.940 
slight venting right underneath the
shoulder<00:01:45.390> sliders<00:01:45.780> again<00:01:46.079> helping<00:01:46.710> just<00:01:46.860> to

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
shoulder sliders again helping just to

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.950 
shoulder sliders again helping just to
push<00:01:47.220> some<00:01:47.430> air<00:01:47.579> through<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.390> stretch

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
push some air through so you can stretch

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.999 
push some air through so you can stretch
it<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.170> little<00:01:49.409> bit<00:01:49.500> into<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.770> warmer<00:01:49.979> months

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009
