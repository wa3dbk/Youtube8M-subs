00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.950
 speak personal beauty he is nobody in 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.369
 area over a video and about 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.470
 seven years in the market of xbox 360 seems 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.840
 more and more suffer with age 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.210
 especially with regard to the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.789
 size of the games and in need in 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.310
 sometimes from two or more discs 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.040
 every game so the rumors about the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.510
 new xbox come up stronger and stronger 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.059
 I then made a collection with the 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.250
 rumors that I think are more concrete and 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:44.550
 appear to come from more reliable sources than 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:46.320
 respect to the new xbox kinect was a 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.800
 of Microsoft's strongest bets 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.629
 At this end of the 360's life then you can 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.879
 imagine that it will continue in the next 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.500
 generation is coming and maybe even 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.539
 integrated to the console 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.969
 according to the moods he would be the 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.190
 kinect version 2 and would actually have two 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.890
 sensors that would improve and 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.210
 very much the capture of the movements of 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.460
 four players 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.110
 and hopefully this time they will be able to give 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.549
 a great success with the players 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.830
 hardcore right now because 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.740
 unfortunately the focus is on players 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:22.080
 casual dance games and also 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.970
 gymnastics as well as the 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.310
 moves with cnet a new 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.750
 technology based on glasses could 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.119
 a new xbox comes up 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.799
 It's called fortress glasses and it's 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.659
 basically that of reality 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.210
 Increased we know you will 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.790
 have a kind of super mega 3d effect 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.530
 epic blaster with the elements coming out 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.140
 almost invading literally 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.970
 your living room well that with a game 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.590
 these are you seeing this effect 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.590
 it would be very interesting, huh? 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.590
 this system of games should enable 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.840
 also that you use the walls of the 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.360
 your home as the game picture picture 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.090
 would still be on your TV screen 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.520
 but your side view would show you the 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.550
 which is beyond the scenery shown on tv 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.869
 bringing an intense realism and 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.490
 What is my suggestion to be? 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.830
 used in this technology 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:18.380
 this scene is one of the features 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.900
 that would possibly come the two years 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.270
 after the launch of the new xbox would be 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.100
 the transmission of online games 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.440
 This way you could play in 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.140
 anywhere without having to make a 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.210
 download the game this because it will rotate 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.760
 directly on microsoft's servers 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.040
 that you would only receive you could then 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.020
 play on pcs notebooks and even on 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.090
 mobile devices because what 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.200
 it would even interest your connection 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.760
 with the internet 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.350
 I already thought here in Brazil with 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.430
 Internet crap that we have 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.430
 how would it be 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.040
 microsoft has been trying more and more 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.260
 strengthen xbox 360 not only as 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.670
 videogame but also as a central 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.280
 entertainment 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.680
 therefore it would be appropriate to include 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.940
 an internal console recording system 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.770
 That's why I 'm twisting a lot. 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.810
 because this is very good 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.709
 record gameplay without the need for a 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.709
 catch for this 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.080
 although many people talk in xbox 720 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.610
 this does not seem to be the real trend 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.320
 to the new console name 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.709
 if it were so, the next would be what 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:28.220
 xbox 1.440 nothing to see bizarre right then 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.630
 two likely names are xbox infinity and 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.910
 xbox lupi 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.769
 the two come from some very real clues 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.030
 as domains registered by the 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.530
 microsoft 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.530
 So which one do you prefer? 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.220
 this is by far the most 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.260
 controversy 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.540
 industry is increasingly suffering from 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.520
 sale of used games, so the 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.310
 tendency may be to actually try 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.470
 the valley since this market does not generate 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.540
 direct profit for producers who only 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.890
 won the first sale of the games and did not 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.960
 on next sales 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.200
 this is something that happens a lot 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.360
 in the pc's with the cd wanted if this is even 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.070
 It was true that this happened, it 's good to leave. 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.070
 selling used games while it 's time 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.080
 no one has an idea yet with humor 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.640
 about what the new xbox would look like but I 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.700
 I separated some images on the internet 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.280
 made by users illustrating how they 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.560
 would like the new microsoft console to 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.780
 majority is bizarre and look will take 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.610
 microsoft do something better than them and 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.160
 this was my previous rumor that it is 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.290
 based on rumors of the new xbox 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.690
 according to analysts and moods he 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.690
 must be officially announced on the e3 of 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.030
 2013 in June or in an event of the 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.160
 microsoft in the first half the 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.979
 release could be even in the 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.960
 end of 2013 to fight with yu 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:49.370
 but the most likely would be the end of 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.320
 2014 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.180
 and this is it if you liked the video not 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.560
 forget a young man and add to the 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:59.169
 favorites to help spread the word 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.169
 Beauty is thank you, until the next time.
