00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.960
 good with this clear heat that we 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.120
 it seems a very useful and why not 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.940
 do it now mango you'll see what 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.730
 easy how simple but how good is it going 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.299
 to stay and well the ingredients is a 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.949
 pretty big petacÃ³n handle if you do not 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.679
 they find very large then they occupy 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:24.669
 two me in this case if it's big 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:26.259
 I'm going to need half a sugar cup 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:30.279
 because remember inter mango has 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:32.320
 pretty sugar then if you like it very 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.500
 sweet adds a little more but if not with 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.620
 half cup sugar is fine we will 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.950
 need a liter of water and now yes 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.810
 do it ok the liter of water we are going to 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.400
 divide in two half liter to the 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:51.060
 blender and half a liter we put them to 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.810
 warm up we add sugar we move it 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.130
 perfectly fine until it 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.540
 turn into syrup 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.540
 we add the command 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:07.290
 we add the hot water already made 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.830
 syrup for the sugar and we beat all this 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.960
 for 3 minutes since we have it milkshake 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.600
 we're going to put it on a fret that 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.480
 you have more or less big we go 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.920
 to store it in the freezer for three 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:27.750
 hours until it becomes us 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.729
 ice not not very frozen but if more or 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.550
 unless we cover it and keep it and 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.009
 we wait now three hours have passed already 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.880
 three hours and as you see it has already been done 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.910
 ice now what we're going to do is going to 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.150
 be beat again for 2 minutes and ready 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.310
 if you want me to have more ice 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.770
 what you can do is add cubes 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.369
 I 'm going to leave it like that in this case 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.280
 because I like that one more step 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.490
 I want to give them is if your blender is not 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.910
 Special to crush ice please 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.620
 do not do it because you'll burn your blender 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.850
 so good now 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.240
 finally this is the consistency that 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:14.709
 we have to stay and serve and 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:17.380
 be it in a big glass or in a glass that 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.470
 already as you want it the truth is 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.110
 that you really want in this hot season 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.790
 I'm going to decorate it with these umbrellas 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.530
 what is done is extremely flirtatious and 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.250
 good for any day coming 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:38.830
 Some friend here at home, you put this 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.500
 So with a straw and you will tell me the 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.430
 truth is that the idea is super easy 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:48.070
 simple and you will love it you liked the 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.340
 recipe that good do not forget to give it 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:54.340
 I like to subscribe to the strawberry and 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:58.470
 yes no and if you are new and you liked it 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.470
 forget that cooking boom can help you
