00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
close to 90,000 people was a lot more

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.990 
close to 90,000 people was a lot more
thrilling<00:02:12.830> than<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.040> four<00:02:13.250> people

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
thrilling than the four people

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.420 
thrilling than the four people
but<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:15.200> was<00:02:15.350> at<00:02:15.470> different<00:02:15.770> stages<00:02:16.160> of<00:02:16.190> my

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
performing I feed off of people's energy

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.290 
performing I feed off of people's energy
and<00:02:23.800> that's<00:02:24.800> where<00:02:25.160> I<00:02:25.190> might<00:02:25.520> strengthen<00:02:26.150> my

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
and that's where I might strengthen my

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.500 
and that's where I might strengthen my
fire<00:02:26.570> and<00:02:27.020> and<00:02:27.290> my<00:02:27.620> I<00:02:27.980> just<00:02:28.490> kind<00:02:28.670> of<00:02:28.700> use<00:02:29.480> that

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
fire and and my I just kind of use that

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.230 
fire and and my I just kind of use that
as<00:02:29.690> fuel<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:31.220> know<00:02:31.340> perform<00:02:32.000> better

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
as fuel to to you know perform better

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.380 
as fuel to to you know perform better
and<00:02:32.540> so<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:33.410> more<00:02:33.620> people<00:02:33.650> for<00:02:34.310> me<00:02:34.490> the<00:02:35.030> more

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
and so the more people for me the more

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.350 
and so the more people for me the more
energy<00:02:36.350> I<00:02:36.380> have<00:02:36.650> but<00:02:36.860> I<00:02:36.890> find<00:02:37.160> that<00:02:37.430> coming<00:02:38.270> and

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
energy I have but I find that coming and

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.480 
energy I have but I find that coming and
doing<00:02:38.510> smaller<00:02:38.959> events<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.620> smaller<00:02:39.980> yeah<00:02:40.459> I

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
doing smaller events and smaller yeah I

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.980 
doing smaller events and smaller yeah I
can<00:02:40.640> actually<00:02:40.820> like<00:02:41.180> look<00:02:41.570> people<00:02:41.720> in<00:02:41.959> the

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
can actually like look people in the

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.680 
can actually like look people in the
eyes<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.650> see<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.430> happiness<00:02:44.030> on<00:02:44.300> their<00:02:44.450> face

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
eyes and see the happiness on their face

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.360 
eyes and see the happiness on their face
where<00:02:44.990> sometimes<00:02:45.290> I<00:02:45.560> don't<00:02:45.620> always<00:02:45.890> get<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.250> do

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
where sometimes I don't always get to do

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.830 
where sometimes I don't always get to do
that<00:02:46.520> because<00:02:46.580> you're<00:02:47.090> looking<00:02:47.239> at<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.660> mass

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
that because you're looking at the mass

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.780 
that because you're looking at the mass
amount<00:02:48.140> of<00:02:48.230> people<00:02:48.350> instead<00:02:48.739> of<00:02:48.860> just<00:02:49.160> the

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
amount of people instead of just the

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.970 
amount of people instead of just the
individual<00:02:50.390> so<00:02:50.959> I<00:02:50.989> feel<00:02:51.290> like<00:02:51.320> sometimes<00:02:51.709> at

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
individual so I feel like sometimes at

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.650 
individual so I feel like sometimes at
the<00:02:52.160> smaller<00:02:52.430> shows<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:53.000> connect<00:02:53.360> a<00:02:53.450> little

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
the smaller shows you connect a little

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.979 
the smaller shows you connect a little
bit<00:02:53.780> more<00:02:54.020> so<00:02:55.330> so<00:02:56.330> do<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.510> have<00:02:56.600> any<00:02:56.750> words<00:02:56.900> for

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
bit more so so do you have any words for

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.630 
bit more so so do you have any words for
our<00:02:57.110> viewers<00:02:57.200> well<00:02:57.830> I<00:02:57.860> just<00:02:57.920> I<00:02:58.280> think<00:02:58.520> that

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
our viewers well I just I think that

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.330 
our viewers well I just I think that
it's<00:02:58.760> imperative<00:02:59.180> that<00:02:59.920> you<00:03:00.920> follow<00:03:01.100> your

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
it's imperative that you follow your

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.290 
it's imperative that you follow your
dreams<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:02.000> I<00:03:02.980> think<00:03:03.980> I'm<00:03:04.070> a<00:03:04.160> shining<00:03:04.370> example

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
dreams and I think I'm a shining example

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.690 
dreams and I think I'm a shining example
of<00:03:05.570> I<00:03:05.900> was<00:03:06.080> told<00:03:06.350> that<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:06.860> would<00:03:06.950> never<00:03:07.100> make<00:03:07.459> it

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
of I was told that I would never make it

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.020 
of I was told that I would never make it
I'm<00:03:07.880> too<00:03:08.090> small<00:03:08.450> I'm<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:08.900> female<00:03:09.110> and<00:03:09.709> I'm<00:03:10.670> just

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
I'm too small I'm a female and I'm just

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.030 
I'm too small I'm a female and I'm just
kind<00:03:11.300> of<00:03:11.390> doing<00:03:11.900> a<00:03:12.080> shot<00:03:12.290> in<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.530> dark<00:03:12.560> and

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
kind of doing a shot in the dark and

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.380 
kind of doing a shot in the dark and
that<00:03:13.070> you<00:03:13.430> know<00:03:13.550> maybe<00:03:13.700> I<00:03:13.820> should<00:03:13.880> think<00:03:14.150> about

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
that you know maybe I should think about

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.850 
that you know maybe I should think about
something<00:03:14.600> a<00:03:14.780> little<00:03:14.959> more<00:03:14.989> realistic<00:03:15.440> but<00:03:15.830> I

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
something a little more realistic but I

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.490 
something a little more realistic but I
believed<00:03:16.220> in<00:03:16.370> myself<00:03:16.520> and<00:03:17.000> I<00:03:17.090> knew<00:03:17.360> deep<00:03:18.320> down

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
believed in myself and I knew deep down

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.050 
believed in myself and I knew deep down
in<00:03:18.620> my<00:03:18.709> heart<00:03:18.739> that<00:03:19.100> I<00:03:19.130> would<00:03:19.310> make<00:03:19.489> it<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:19.910> it

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
in my heart that I would make it and it

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.360 
in my heart that I would make it and it
may<00:03:20.209> have<00:03:20.330> taken<00:03:20.510> six<00:03:21.230> years<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.650> do<00:03:21.799> that<00:03:22.040> and

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
may have taken six years to do that and

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.150 
may have taken six years to do that and
then<00:03:23.299> another<00:03:23.840> three<00:03:24.200> on<00:03:24.230> top<00:03:24.560> of<00:03:24.709> that<00:03:24.799> before

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
then another three on top of that before

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.590 
then another three on top of that before
I<00:03:25.190> even<00:03:25.310> made<00:03:25.549> my<00:03:25.700> first<00:03:25.880> television<00:03:26.150> debut

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
I even made my first television debut

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.600 
I even made my first television debut
but<00:03:27.019> I<00:03:27.049> knew<00:03:27.350> in<00:03:27.620> my<00:03:27.650> heart<00:03:27.890> of<00:03:28.040> hearts<00:03:28.100> that<00:03:28.519> it

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
but I knew in my heart of hearts that it

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.820 
but I knew in my heart of hearts that it
was<00:03:28.700> going<00:03:28.880> to<00:03:29.000> happen<00:03:29.299> and<00:03:29.750> so<00:03:30.320> if<00:03:30.620> you
