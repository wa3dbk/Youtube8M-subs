00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.879
 if johannes principle calculator for 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.680
 he always wears a helmet 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.540
 not only because it makes it safer 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.840
 is on the way but also because he is one 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.260
 great fan latest advice is fashion and from 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.359
 developed professionally because of the 27-year-old 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.560
 and design bike helmets and the 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.570
 he designs according to fashionable 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.850
 but also after 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.859
 safety aspects of the range 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.340
 different bicycle helmets is 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.050
 huge at that time on the one hand forest away 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.480
 really for the pure sport 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.940
 thought is big vents for 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.250
 a good climate and a low weight 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.879
 then of course there are pure children's helmets 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.489
 childlike graphics mostly very colorful and 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.910
 nice motives then we have a helmet 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.440
 the city area especially for the 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.079
 There are a few ventilation openings 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.870
 and good weather protection and then there is 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.960
 the rail of the leitz three youth 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.180
 The direction is strong in 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.809
 in the skateboard snowboarding area 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.909
 Orient a helmet first arises 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.070
 the signboard here is outlined 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.840
 young designers get their first ideas and 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.490
 is geared primarily to 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.830
 Safety and fashion awareness 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:17.659
 cyclists and play of course 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:20.180
 Colors also play an important role in black 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.369
 and white always goes and muted colors 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.990
 subtle colors are actually the 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.690
 women who are the most sold 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.280
 and then it's very personal 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.619
 tastes and also very 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.700
 depending on the target audience for the 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.700
 to shape the gentleman 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.159
 the boy translates with a tone mass 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.380
 Designer drawing the pencil in one 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.460
 3d model the idea slowly takes 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.890
 contours 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.130
 The shape of the helmet has been in progress 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.020
 the years changed a lot 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.600
 So today you would have designed rather 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.319
 behind roundish that hellmann 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.490
 more of the head shape and the head contour 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:00.399
 then sooner you have that more 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.039
 beauty ideal say it had that 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.360
 the film is very ergonomically shaped 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.739
 and continue behind the head abroad 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.989
 after he has scanned the tone model 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.489
 can johannes kunze fechner draft 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.799
 edit digitally 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.110
 Of course, not only fashionable ones count here 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:20.230
 Aspects of the helmet should above all the head 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.579
 protect the European 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.700
 The seals of approval guarantee the 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:26.530
 Resistance of new helmets who 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.599
 the helmet is already very important 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.819
 or the head is the part of what 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.400
 worthy of protection is probably from 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.560
 bodies are there is the most important 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.269
 center in there should therefore each one 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.019
 Helmet wear that especially important 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.639
 to protect him 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.040
 and then I think it is now 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:44.560
 we have reached in the age where it 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.170
 even a piece of fashion is simply a 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.359
 helmet to wear and to have as it is 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.980
 Of course there comes the interest of me 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:53.970
 also a diesel model itself 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.380
 co-design mitzerstralten 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.760
 johannes kunze fechner has made it 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.069
 to unite two goals 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.110
 he designs helmets not only the head 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.620
 protect but also really good 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.620
 appearance
