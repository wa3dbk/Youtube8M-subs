 Hello friends, you are watching a video on

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.380
 runner from sega sonic dash 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.539
 the game is infinite 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.240
 arcade where you have to manage the most 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.890
 the world's fastest hedgehog to all locations will be 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.590
 attend various enemies and 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.660
 huge bosses are constant barriers and 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.350
 spikes will disturb you on the run so 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.030

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.260

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.269
 only sony available 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.239
 but if you want to play from others 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.780
 Heroes will have to collect bonuses 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.059
 presented in rings and 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.650
 extra plates but be 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.449
 careful don't get carried away 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.640
 because every bonus can be hidden 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.269
 craft that wants to master 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.460
 bonuses 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.710
 the characters themselves will be several 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.070
 of course sonic and his friends 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.960
 Tells on calls &amp; shadow as I already 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.659

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.490
 epic battles with them so you 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.979
 there will be a chance to fight the most villain 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.770
 Somi enemies Sonic boss Zazu 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.600
 to make things a little easier for you 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.880
 developers have added improvements such 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.170
 like jerks at the start resurrection and 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.509
 magnetic rings 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.159

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.970

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.650
 beautifully traced textures 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.500
 now turn to management and 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.840
 the possibilities of the blue hedgehog and so the track 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.130
 divided into 3 lines to move along 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.890
 it uses swipe 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.950
 for jumping similarly your up for 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.210
 curling down swipe 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.810
 management is convenient and does not cause 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.610
 complaints 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.770
