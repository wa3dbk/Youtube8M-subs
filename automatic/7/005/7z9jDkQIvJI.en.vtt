00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.280
 ah 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.150
 very good everyone do to the micro and 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.520
 here I bring you another pokemon combat 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.860
 I was doing a lot that did not go up any 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.390
 good as you said to me sandwiching 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.210
 videos and other unfair how to start the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.130
 Icarus kid series as my cheerleader 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.320
 now a combat the truth is that I 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.760
 I notice quite from trained but good 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.560
 is and little by little he returned to the habit 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.330
 well here you have the rival team the 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.250
 two missing pokemon are one that is he 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.290
 and there is a gross goal so good 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.020
 put first air with armani so on 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.670
 all thinking about growing already to knock it down 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.830
 of unity and turn of the hand or in 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.960
 case it was not enough that what 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.530
 I doubt enough to poke him with a pulse 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.210
 dragon shine 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.980
 efe reason a little support on everything 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.980
 thinking about what the look looks like though 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.839
 contradictory but for what reason then 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.370
 first because I want two it did not work 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:56.719
 of much in this combat was very 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.879
 exposed to the weaknesses of the opponent 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.530
 and it really did not help me much against 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.570
 none 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.129
 and bring them together which is the one that is missing from measuring 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.260
 it's because it costs us to meet against 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.119
 with heat because, as you know, 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.740
 mine carries basic charge and not psychic and 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.840
 it hurts based on the defense instead 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.549
 of the special and good defense with that 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.520
 the hard one is a brown beast in a against 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.890
 defense and it did not serve against anything's 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.290
 so he has not left out to gather the 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.869
 struggled and well the rest are the ones 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.350
 they'd better come to me so we're not going to see anything 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.350
 how the thing has gone 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.060
 and well, as you have seen at the end 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:35.270
 has not gotten to grow already in the team 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.790
 so when I've seen the process in the 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.909
 field has touched me play it a bit 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.350
 because, well 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.929
 and I say it's not clear that I was not going to 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.020
 leave it because it's a cannon fodder for 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.399
 it seems that just as he does not 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.050
 you will be because it is cannon fodder for me 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.850
 sister 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.400
 I should give I do not understand a little but 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.500
 well there are times you do not know if the 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.180
 opponent will change or not because it is 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.310
 say the change is so obvious that the 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.350
 opponent takes advantage to heal some 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.780
 movement is to imagine that I 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.660
 I have a guided and the opponent is a 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.580
 zoom is pretty obvious that is going to attack me 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.100
 with electricity as the opponent 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.570
 thinking to get up to me thinking 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.580
 It is clear that it will change 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.650
 I'm going to take advantage to put a neutrino 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.450
 to that hole in that gap that goes 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.370
 downloaded and for the extra the next 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.790
 as though I am between to put one of thousands 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.790
 example 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.470
 good here as you see has changed has 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.760
 resurgent has put to tyrannize me 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.880
 invite me I have not done much 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.630
 damage and here on this turn as I have seen 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.300
 that has jumped on the flame sphere with 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.220
 hard gel because naturally it is one of the 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.660
 more gods 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.210
 which are also used online is 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.010
 the one with the guts that is to raise him 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.100
 the attack 50 percent when it suffers 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.140
 change of state so I've decided 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.360
 play it with give little hand with envite and not 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.280
 I am sincere I thought that I was not going to 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.980
 kill because as I said before with 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.070
 that the hard one has very very good defense 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.260
 and I thought I was not going to kill him but 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.410
 good being before one that offers reason 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.180
 has gone to to tyrannize naturally 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.570
 as elvis all protected but good 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.459
 here the truth is that give little hand too 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.440
 stick hosts like loaves talking in 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.240
 but silver can look as good 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.990
 over a blow apart from that already 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.550
 I was touched 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.390
 and here in this shift has changed to 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.700
 dragon thinking mostly about earthquakes 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.670
 I thought tyrannizing was going to go for a 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.290
 earthquake because good little sister 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.000
 grave practically at a stroke 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.540
 practically does not knock down a blow of 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.650
 sure and do what you've done quite 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.820
 little too not much but good 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.170
 take advantage to touch the two and make 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.390
 that is, do a little with the other 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.160
 leave a little more touched so the 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.870
 cast and dragon but we see that he has 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.670
 surprised there with a fist game that the 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.730
 it's true that you can not see but good 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.420
 it is more rare they have been seen and 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.940
 practically not in the mind you can 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.640
 expect everything and the truth is that this 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.660
 pull half I see it a little 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.550
 wasted but good can reach 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.970
 surprise at some point like how to 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.970
 me now 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.950
 sure that just as it suits me 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.990
 the fang full of guide sides that 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.500
 a lot of people are waiting for us and that 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:22.590
 got caught off guard and here's good 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.210
 this is when it has been shared 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.850
 slightly uphill quotes 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.950
 why 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.310
 I got two attack points down 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.890
 special with the draco kite there is dragon 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.290
 and right now as the fight is 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.400
 do not ask me why but while 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.590
 I was fighting, I was gone 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.180
 completely the pot and thought that only 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.560
 I had these two pokemon left 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.880
 I thought my little sister was not 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.610
 dead 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.560
 efe reason also because it is the in the 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.690
 previous turn novation for turns 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.730
 Well, he's killed him dynamiting a fist 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.040
 fire do not ask me why but I 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:58.160
 I thought my little sister was in the 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:01.400
 soil and that I only had these two 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.440
 Now I see the living earth that makes me 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.240
 this star gift but everything that takes away 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.550
 that and this is when I get scared of 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.320
 mogollÃ³n because I did not think it was not 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.380
 so much and especially knowing that it 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.449
 Holds a pretty special defense 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.270
 decent 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:19.200
 it's not that it's wonderful but good 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.260
 and neither the evil at all 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.140
 and good here nothing 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:28.650
 bullet fist was not clear either 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.330
 that he was going to kill him is also true 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.560
 that I'm very used to my ancients 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.360
 notice because I was not wearing the chosen ribbon 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.070
 and the truth is that he has not thought that 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.860
 can do so much damage from a single 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.730
 blow is to say I know that fist bullet does 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.950
 quite hurt by the ability to know 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.350
 and others and for the bonus of 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.350
 kind but it's hard for me to get used to it 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.610
 especially this set because although the 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.500
 videos that you have uploaded to this channel 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.729
 with this television I am more 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:58.699
 used to my sword dance set 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:00.259
 and good here and practically as 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:02.150
 attentive I decided once is lying to the other 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:04.400
 because well they still had six 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.110
 about and dragon and we see the little damage that 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.569
 is doing gastrobar but as 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.399
 commented 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:12.009
 I do not know why I was convinced that 

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:15.670
 I did not have only 2 pokemon left 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:19.600
 I was dead I do not know why but 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:21.910
 but good in case I had not 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.940
 there's no pokemon left 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:27.570
 say in this turn would have finished 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:29.560
 killing them I suppose good I hope and good 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:32.230
 have tempted to luck also a 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.240
 little with the recoil of the cold pulse and 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.860
 I will say other luck male jo see you 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.690
 had there with the burn and so on and 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.120
 Well the case of not having had a weapon or 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.220
 so good here he has retired as 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.410
 you have seen from the burn as 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.240
 You know, I'm in favor of not being 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.910
 they like this kind of thing is to say the 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.260
 chance that a burn or a 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.910
 critical blow at a certain moment because 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.350
 can turn him into combat but in 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.270
 these cases as you have seen gives a 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.040
 little equal because the combat was 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.630
 practically decided today here what else 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.400
 It gives rise to a burn that jumps a 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.440
 critical is to say the same is the same 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.270
 that he has killed me has happened with a 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.820
 critical and good that I did not care 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:09.070
 a lot so I'm not going to see if I go up 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.220
 this fight and then another as always 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.180
 is the favorite if you liked the video 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.980
 subscribe shitting milk if you are not 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.600
 comment to your friends and how 

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.560
 always a thousand thanks for watching the video and 

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.560
 see you in the next
