somebody<00:02:59.570> way<00:02:59.930> this<00:03:01.300> which<00:03:02.300> would<00:03:02.450> be<00:03:02.720> I<00:03:02.900> would

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
somebody way this which would be I would

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.430 
somebody way this which would be I would
think<00:03:03.320> impossible<00:03:03.800> but<00:03:04.340> no<00:03:05.080> that<00:03:06.080> looks<00:03:06.110> like

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
think impossible but no that looks like

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.040 
think impossible but no that looks like
it<00:03:06.620> might<00:03:06.650> be<00:03:06.860> holographic<00:03:07.490> there<00:03:08.000> oh<00:03:08.920> oh<00:03:11.050> I

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
it might be holographic there oh oh I

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.850 
it might be holographic there oh oh I

very cool it's actually a really good
actually<00:03:19.880> it's<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:20.810> only<00:03:20.840> the<00:03:21.290> second<00:03:21.770> of<00:03:21.950> the

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
actually it's the only the second of the

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.390 
actually it's the only the second of the
level<00:03:23.900> three<00:03:24.170> synchros<00:03:24.620> but<00:03:25.130> this<00:03:25.220> one's

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
level three synchros but this one's

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.500 
level three synchros but this one's
actually<00:03:25.520> really<00:03:25.880> good<00:03:25.970> because<00:03:26.120> it<00:03:26.300> doesn't

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
actually really good because it doesn't

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.560 
actually really good because it doesn't
have<00:03:26.650> dumb<00:03:27.650> requirements<00:03:28.400> to<00:03:28.550> make<00:03:28.700> where<00:03:29.480> the

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
and although the other level 3 synchro

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.199 
and although the other level 3 synchro
but<00:03:47.840> i<00:03:47.870> could<00:03:48.230> be<00:03:48.590> i<00:03:48.830> could<00:03:49.700> be<00:03:49.820> wrong<00:03:49.850> on<00:03:50.150> that

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
but i could be i could be wrong on that

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.930 
but i could be i could be wrong on that
but<00:03:50.570> i<00:03:50.810> think<00:03:50.870> that's<00:03:51.230> what<00:03:51.380> it<00:03:51.470> is<00:03:51.500> I<00:03:51.940> don't

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
but i think that's what it is I don't

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:53.949 
but i think that's what it is I don't
know<00:03:53.000> I'll<00:03:53.390> have<00:03:53.570> to<00:03:53.600> look<00:03:53.780> that<00:03:53.840> up

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
know I'll have to look that up

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.280 
know I'll have to look that up
afterwards<00:03:54.500> cuz<00:03:54.770> it's<00:03:55.459> gonna<00:03:55.550> drive<00:03:55.820> me<00:03:55.850> crazy

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
afterwards cuz it's gonna drive me crazy

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.580 
afterwards cuz it's gonna drive me crazy
so<00:03:57.290> two<00:03:57.350> packs<00:03:57.680> left<00:03:58.450> not<00:03:59.450> only<00:03:59.660> one<00:03:59.900> super<00:04:00.380> so

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
so two packs left not only one super so

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.270 
so two packs left not only one super so
far<00:04:00.860> let's<00:04:01.790> see<00:04:02.410> can<00:04:03.410> we<00:04:03.470> pull<00:04:03.770> this<00:04:03.920> off<00:04:04.070> at

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
far let's see can we pull this off at

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.340 
far let's see can we pull this off at
the<00:04:04.430> end<00:04:04.520> though<00:04:04.760> can<00:04:05.600> we<00:04:05.690> get<00:04:05.810> something<00:04:06.050> epic

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
the end though can we get something epic

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:13.120 
the end though can we get something epic
here<00:04:06.830> and<00:04:08.920> 00<00:04:11.170> hurts<00:04:12.170> a<00:04:12.350> little<00:04:12.500> bit<00:04:12.740> seeing

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
here and 00 hurts a little bit seeing

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.180 
here and 00 hurts a little bit seeing
all<00:04:13.880> those<00:04:14.120> facts<00:04:14.420> would<00:04:14.690> just<00:04:15.050> rares<00:04:15.830> at<00:04:16.070> them

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
all those facts would just rares at them

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.270 
all those facts would just rares at them
but<00:04:16.400> this<00:04:16.609> one<00:04:16.940> this<00:04:17.900> one<00:04:18.140> I<00:04:18.170> know<00:04:18.290> save

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
but this one this one I know save

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.740 
but this one this one I know save
yourself<00:04:19.760> for<00:04:19.940> the<00:04:20.000> end

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
yourself for the end

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.980 
yourself for the end
