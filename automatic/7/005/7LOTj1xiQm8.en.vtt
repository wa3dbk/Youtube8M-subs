00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.340
 next friends on the link and gentlemen 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.990
 Chinese in recent years begins 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.849
 please with their efficiency despite 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.950
 even for these things to be ordered 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.379
 two different suppliers from two different 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.750
 the ends of China but they look like friends one 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.640
 in one literally two brothers and long 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.279
 China will work operational they apparently 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.869
 one bag for wrapping for all 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.180
 parcels so let's start with 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.460
 small, I basically guess that 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.769
 there is inside and through the site 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.710
 ebay I ordered this time decided 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.270
 a little change aliexpress and we will 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.460
 hope that not on ebay or me on 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.200
 this very ebay and they sent what I 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.030
 indeed I ordered although ordered 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.460
 on ebay anyway from hong kong it all 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.160
 business went to us let's friends the whole thing 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.289
 quickly unpack what kind of snail 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.449
 there was some kind of gasket 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.670
 was and with great desire on this 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.320
 use it as a pillow but let's 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.750
 we will postpone this whole thing and see what 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.059
 in the green package in the green package i am so 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.850
 imagine we are waiting for even more green 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.860
 scotch thing didn't spare the guys let's up 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.049
 Basically, your mark on the acid package 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.479
 it is already possible to understand what is inside ordered 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.030
 I long-awaited gamepad friends from 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.220
 x-box 360 and as usual, gentlemen Chinese 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.990
 of course here with these things with these 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.880
 Komi pedal got a little hotter I basically 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.340
 Already ordered a similar thing only 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.229
 wired and I'm just not strong 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.270
 liked how they knock the cactus loudly 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.799
 ring here these here are the most pedals in 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.470
 the rest is all cool and look 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.900
 really aggressive perky and so 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.150
 let's see here the battery of course which 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.890
 batteries of friends and batteries in the kit 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.720
 we did not put but as old 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.759
 gamepad already squeezed his really 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.650
 the last days I just have a plus 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.360
 even see yourself see here mirror 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.549
 button sometimes you can and know 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.740
 look at your stubborn face and 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.990
 do not do this otherwise 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.200
 like sticks go well 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.520
 the only thing that's the way it often 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.470
 loud buttons let me try it 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.790
 connect so friends well and the first 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.610
 the problem with which I already had 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.049
 face what 's this battery 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.729
 Doesn't want to get in there in any way 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.009
 standard x-box battery and something 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.400
 yes but so he basically got involved in 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.550
 Anyway, I think these buttons will go 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.530
 replaced and 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.540
 and the rest of the rest of the gamepad to 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.940
 gamepad of course hint that this 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.920
 there is no original here because 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.720
 there are no original stickers here 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.270
 as it was with my past gamepad 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.490
 the guys decided to really clean 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.470
 soul come here and appeared just 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.000
 Xbox narrow greens like 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.010
 gamepad is great even more so for 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.600
 twenty bucks something that doctor 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.640
 registered too now complain about 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.920
 broken hammers in games I won't 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.050
 I hope stick sticks all the buttons will be 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.300
 work fine 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.830
 good move they all have and great i'm 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.360
 the principle is not quite an action but these 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.580
 loud came 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.170
 cutting ears and really they don't 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.910
 very smoothly not like the original 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.370
 joseki go here these buttons but in 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.350
 the rest is otherwise very good and 2 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.690
 friends sending for today but which 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.300
 came on a week after the one that we 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.540
 saw just a few seconds ago 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.570
 parcel ordered from China friends not with 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.600
 of that world , the packaging level is just 10 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:13.510
 goals above friends nice such paper 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.100
 from recyclable components and other 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.050
 things are a bunch of different buns and 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.130
 really beautiful all packaged 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.290
 just for love is worth it 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.390
 the English because it was from England 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.130
 I ordered the whole thing I know about 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.830
 what's inside there today with us 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.780
 Do you know this kind of game? 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.090
 the boxing up to the knife was too lazy to go therefore 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.610
 some weed 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.220
 the case is packed again focus reading film 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.260
 my friends are probably my whole apartment 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.130
 You can open this pimply film but 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:45.700
 nevertheless yes it is 10 friends drive for 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.650
 xbox 360 th game that came just in 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.890
 the volume of decades well for a long time I do not know 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.050
 yes year in 1005 year in 1006 and this is a drive and 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.910
 lived to our times and see ordered 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.700
 i have quite interesting with the supplier with 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.459
 good reviews with a huge percentage 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.140
 sales and this is my first game ordering experience 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.510
 from abroad because of the hillock in general then 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.760
 just boxed versions and even despite 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.769
 the fact that it was written that it is not new 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.840
 the game that she was in use but 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.770
 outwardly that is, and all the normal box 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.380
 not until the price is given 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.130
 and the colors are not faded and the disc should not be 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.810
 scratched 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.000
 really if ever this thing is 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.190
 credit box is very worthy of departure 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.770
 as if Iâ€™ve just come from the store 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.050
 released here don't distinguish just i twist 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.030
 no chipping no scratching a hint 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.700
 on scratches no let's open 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.770
 friends some viewers of my channel 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.630
 special boxing fans ask 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.700
 any when there will be a fight night round and i 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.440
 constantly in podcasts in some species 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.530
 and say I'm finally waiting for when 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.960
 come the disk came to me for 3 weeks and 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.290
 came really everything is 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:51.170
 inside everything that should be in the disk 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:53.630
 instruction from the little book and and he dice his eyes 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:56.180
 who are friends I turned over and 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.850
 not a single scratch, I'm just looking 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.670
 can't see any scratches now 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.600
 Here seriously not knowing who used here 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.420
 this one is a disk 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.150
 put it in the store and glue on it 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:10.100
 I took it to the sky price sticker 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.020
 would not even notice the catch just 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.240
 holy to drive a man in apparently 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.920
 enjoyed the whole thing none 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.290
 scratch friends here is even a single 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.720
 there is no dust particles i look i cost everything to me 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.250
 I think it's 15 bucks here 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.960
 The guys took care even 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.600
 transportation put here 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.680
 specially pimply film to 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.120
 minimize 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.880
 before applying the first and only 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.190
 perhaps scratches are not there everything is fine 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.190
 friends first drive and first damn how 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.170
 it turned out I turned out to be a lump in everything 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.630
 excellent condition all in perfect condition in 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.610
 pristine literally and player even you 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.780

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.430
 year well can not be 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.190
 that so much time already from that time 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.740
 gone sorry friends for tautology 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.350
 but as I understand it , the sixth year will not help either. 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.669
 still this game came out 16 plus here 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:00.590
 there must be a sea of â€‹â€‹blood and 16 + and 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:02.419
 actually this game gives us a chance and 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.100
 to pursue a career for my zero therefore 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:05.570
