00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello everybody here is adriana oliveira 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.150
 barbosa training and giving 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.099
 continuity to our hardware course 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.920
 today we will continue talking about 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.080
 the rockets more precisely by those 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.830
 used by branded processors 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.830
 OMG 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:24.930
 first we will look and md 941 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.890
 in 1940 was released in 2003 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.520
 and as the name implies it has 940 to 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.610
 inputs are for processors with 940 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.079
 terminals and is a pva penguin of the avaí 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.879
 for those who do not remember p &amp; g then 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.940
 means that the terminals are on the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.739
 microprocessor and not in the socket 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.320
 and was used by the first 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.450
 amd opteron processors though 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.329
 workstations with the servers and 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.960
 by the first generation of athlon of 64 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.230
 bits and sex 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.690
 in the sequence you have there the amd kit 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.400
 aam 2 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.760
 to m2 it then replaced socket 754 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.000
 1939 and 1940 that we saw in 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.420
 previously it also has 940 pins 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.210
 however it is processors produced for 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.540
 running on socket am3 two are not 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.540
 compatible with your 940 kit until you 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.049
 this type of socket is already designed 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:32.400
 for the motherboard that works with ddr2 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:35.729
 né a 940 worked there with dr 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.500
 not r 2 and he also here too 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.200
 compatible with various types of 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.750
 processors such as athlon ii without 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:49.470
 and your focus leaves the bank will vary 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:51.630
 from 200 megahertz to 1ghz the socket efe 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.479
 it was released in 2006 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.020
 The interesting thing about the chef is that he is from 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.899
 type lg a and do not ask you guys go 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.759
 to realize that these are the kit that people 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.330
 is looking at md today 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:09.160
 are almost all legea né 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.500
 in the last video when we talked about 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.540
 the 500 used by intel we saw 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.330
 that most of them were what they were 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.450
 precisely the lg here in case gave me 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.360
 the opposite grandson's everything hurts pg ae 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.430
 we only have these what you f that is the lg 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.550
 The King's Legend 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.190
 and this guy who has 1207 contacts was 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.430
 released in 2006 and it is compatible with 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.230
 opteron and athlon processors there 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.880
 have to pay attention to the series in 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.800
 that they are compatible, right? 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.070
 it is compatible with the 2000 series some 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.380
 something 8,000 something and so on. 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.959
 in doubt take a look at the 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.030
 motherboard and consult and what are the 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.030
 processors that it can work with 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:03:00.040
 in 2007 amd released sukit am2 plus m2 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.350
 more physically equal to m2 than 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.959
 People saw earlier, right? 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.030
 been some changes in the MP he has 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.270
 some small changes that make the 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.980
 computer with the best performance and 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.209
 also in the management part of 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.980
 energy 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.330
 according to the mp the processors that 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.970
 a kit very MDA m2 can be more 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.260
 used on motherboard for kits a m2 and 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.840
 vice versa 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.760
 in both cases is going to have an upgrade 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.470
 of bilzen you will need to do 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.470
 to match it 100% 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.540
 the other is that we need to know 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:41.410
 others we need to know the kit is 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:45.760
 the m3 a m3 it was released in 2009 and he 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:49.330
 has 941 pins 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.519
 it is very similar to the previous ones 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.010
 processors produced for the huc 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:57.640
 time 3 they can even be used to leave with 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.980
 the soul kitchen m2 and the most né since 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.980
 May you update God 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.610
 the interesting here that you can use 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:11.290
 here processors on motherboards that already 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:14.200
 accept the memory ddr3 m3 it is 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.880
 compatible with both ddr2 and r3 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.340
 that you can work with 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:24.290
 two phenom processors act two 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:26.480
 good and also you have a big angel of 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:30.110
 speed with the cole can work 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:36.410
 you can is to use processors like 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:40.780
 act two from 1.8 ghz until the phenom 23 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.780
 7 points ghz is cool 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.900
 another processor other than the kit 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:52.100
 Also, what we need to know is the 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.600
 m3 plus he was released in 2011 as 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.070
 you can see it also does not have large 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.160
 differences 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:02.540
 is physically speaking about your 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:05.780
 predecessor he has 942 pines 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:09.320
 What I am saying is that amd processors 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:13.010
 three older ones can be used 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:16.600
 in socket am3 more beauty only than 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:19.039
 contrary is not supported by the amd 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.979
 which supports these processors 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:24.560
 up to eight cores in the ex 8,000 series 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:28.550
 something and has already worked with memory 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.960
 ddr3 of oxygen then it the kit 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.169
 it withstands the processors well 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.900
 and there is still still 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:40.760
 Today features a performance is excellent 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:45.050
 for most applications and ultimately 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.760
 we have the fmi kit with a né this guy 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.500
 he no longer has much he is no longer 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.830
 compatible with others in it only 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:58.700
 supports the processors made for fm 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:06:00.860
 1 905 pins and 1 you should remember that 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.080
 this type of socket it accepts 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.870
 series processors to which they are 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.599
 which have integrated gpu 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.490
 so it 's a very interesting socket 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:14.180
 already brings some good features 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:17.030
 cool and once again they accept angel 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:20.690
 fairly large speed right from 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:22.940
 processors range from 2.1 ghz up to 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.180
 processor models up to 3 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.180
 ghz 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:29.669
 That's it folks this video is getting 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:31.379
 around here 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:33.509
 We thank everyone who is 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:35.909
 accompanying the channel bonzão trainings 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:40.019
 Every week we're posting new ones. 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:41.129
 videos on a network radio to a bank of 

00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:44.069
 data 

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:47.129
 linux windows and so on 

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:49.589
 twitter there you can follow us 

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:51.989
 stole a workout you can contact 

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:54.360
 with us via facebook out there 

00:06:51.989 --> 00:06:57.800
 will once again so much guys 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.800
 Thank you and see you next time.
