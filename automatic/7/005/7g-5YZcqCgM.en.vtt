00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.770 

and<00:03:21.939> then<00:03:22.060> you're<00:03:22.180> gonna<00:03:22.269> hit<00:03:22.420> that<00:03:22.599> high<00:03:22.750> e

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
and then you're gonna hit that high e

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:42.360 
and then you're gonna hit that high e
again<00:03:23.939> so<00:03:24.939> like<00:03:40.409> so<00:03:41.409> that<00:03:41.560> last<00:03:41.799> one<00:03:42.010> I<00:03:42.159> did

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
again so like so that last one I did

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.069 
again so like so that last one I did
it's<00:03:42.549> kind<00:03:42.700> of<00:03:42.760> a<00:03:42.849> variation<00:03:43.150> where<00:03:43.900> the

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
it's kind of a variation where the

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.809 
it's kind of a variation where the
second<00:03:44.530> part<00:03:44.680> of<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.859> lick<00:03:45.069> were<00:03:45.250> waiting<00:03:45.730> a

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
second part of the lick were waiting a

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.569 
second part of the lick were waiting a
little<00:03:45.970> bit<00:03:46.120> so<00:03:46.599> it's<00:03:46.720> gonna<00:03:46.810> go<00:03:46.959> like<00:03:47.049> this

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.520 

start<00:03:51.579> over

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.410 

so<00:03:56.530> it's<00:03:56.859> almost<00:03:57.069> a<00:03:57.220> combination<00:03:57.879> of<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.180> of

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
so it's almost a combination of the of

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.229 
so it's almost a combination of the of
the<00:03:58.569> two<00:03:58.989> licks<00:03:59.260> together<00:03:59.700> now<00:04:00.700> it's<00:04:00.879> all<00:04:01.060> put

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
the two licks together now it's all put

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.720 
the two licks together now it's all put
together<00:04:01.329> he<00:04:01.720> also<00:04:01.870> did<00:04:02.139> some<00:04:02.170> mutes<00:04:02.730> like

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
together he also did some mutes like

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:16.790 
together he also did some mutes like
this

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:16.800 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:28.150 

together<00:04:17.800> it<00:04:17.920> sounds<00:04:18.070> like<00:04:18.220> this

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.950 

now<00:04:29.030> I<00:04:30.670> know<00:04:31.670> this<00:04:31.910> bit<00:04:32.180> will<00:04:32.420> be<00:04:32.510> a<00:04:32.540> little<00:04:32.780> bit
