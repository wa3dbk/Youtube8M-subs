there any plans to make something

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.940 
there any plans to make something
similar<00:04:26.050> with<00:04:26.169> maybe<00:04:26.410> hd-sdi<00:04:27.160> input<00:04:27.790> or<00:04:27.970> not

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
similar with maybe hd-sdi input or not

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.440 
similar with maybe hd-sdi input or not
you<00:04:29.950> could<00:04:30.190> just<00:04:30.370> put<00:04:30.640> a<00:04:30.820> connect<00:04:31.120> on<00:04:31.240> the<00:04:31.330> back

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
you could just put a connect on the back

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.159 
you could just put a connect on the back
of<00:04:31.479> it<00:04:31.690> and<00:04:31.780> get<00:04:32.410> your<00:04:32.530> HD<00:04:32.800> SDI<00:04:33.660> no<00:04:34.660> plans<00:04:35.020> at

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
of it and get your HD SDI no plans at

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.350 
of it and get your HD SDI no plans at
this<00:04:35.200> stage<00:04:35.560> but<00:04:35.800> if<00:04:36.010> customers<00:04:36.490> are<00:04:36.520> you<00:04:37.270> know

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
this stage but if customers are you know

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.250 
this stage but if customers are you know
screaming<00:04:37.720> for<00:04:37.840> that<00:04:37.930> and<00:04:38.020> they<00:04:38.080> want

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
screaming for that and they want

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.010 
screaming for that and they want
something<00:04:38.470> for<00:04:38.890> their<00:04:39.340> SDI<00:04:40.030> cameras<00:04:40.510> and<00:04:40.690> they

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
something for their SDI cameras and they

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.300 
something for their SDI cameras and they
don't<00:04:41.169> want<00:04:41.289> to<00:04:41.349> use<00:04:41.440> a<00:04:41.470> connect<00:04:41.800> on<00:04:41.919> the<00:04:42.010> back

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
don't want to use a connect on the back

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.610 
don't want to use a connect on the back
it<00:04:42.460> is<00:04:42.580> it's<00:04:42.940> not<00:04:43.150> the<00:04:43.210> ideal<00:04:43.630> solution<00:04:43.870> but<00:04:44.440> DS

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
it is it's not the ideal solution but DS

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.940 
it is it's not the ideal solution but DS
a<00:04:44.740> solution<00:04:45.600> then<00:04:46.600> yeah<00:04:47.020> let<00:04:47.320> us<00:04:47.410> know<00:04:47.560> because

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
a solution then yeah let us know because

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.980 
a solution then yeah let us know because
we<00:04:48.610> listen<00:04:48.880> to<00:04:48.970> our<00:04:49.000> customers<00:04:49.090> every<00:04:49.630> day<00:04:49.660> and
