now<00:01:17.009> beer<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.720> east<00:01:18.990> will<00:01:19.140> start

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
now beer and the east will start

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.260 
now beer and the east will start
fermenting<00:01:19.500> away<00:01:19.890> for<00:01:20.340> about<00:01:20.430> three<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.880> seven
