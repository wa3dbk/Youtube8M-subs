right<00:02:55.950> there<00:02:56.690> nothing<00:02:57.690> too<00:02:57.840> fancy<00:02:58.019> just

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
right there nothing too fancy just

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.199 
right there nothing too fancy just
fundamentally

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.290 

and<00:03:05.209> we're<00:03:05.750> going<00:03:06.110> back<00:03:06.319> to<00:03:06.349> battlefield<00:03:07.300> and

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
and we're going back to battlefield and

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.350 
and we're going back to battlefield and
crunk<00:03:09.110> is<00:03:09.349> going<00:03:10.099> luigi<00:03:10.519> luigi<00:03:10.700> is<00:03:10.970> actually

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
that like you just kind of threw out

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.520 
that like you just kind of threw out
moves<00:05:57.550> and<00:05:57.880> he<00:05:58.030> had<00:05:58.180> to<00:05:58.270> respect<00:05:58.570> them<00:05:58.840> and<00:05:59.260> his

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
moves and he had to respect them and his

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.410 
moves and he had to respect them and his
shield<00:05:59.710> is<00:05:59.830> so<00:05:59.920> like<00:06:00.190> yeah<00:06:00.880> so<00:06:01.060> low<00:06:01.180> traction

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.420 
shield is so like yeah so low traction

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.910
