00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.109
 Hello everyone today in my kitchen doing 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.950
 delicious open pie with plums 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:15.690
 and for this pie we need kefir 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.449
 here I have 150 grams of vegetable oil 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.580
 100g 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:23.670
 sugar naturally to taste I 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:28.320
 about add to the dough 2 tablespoons 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.840
 Spoons pinch soda and flour flour need 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.890
 so much so that we get cool 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.820
 the dough but about me will leave without such 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.370
 in the cup and you will also need plums 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.239
 naturally and so for a start we 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.210
 prepare the dough I said no 150 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:53.489
 I add about two grams of kefir 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:57.289
 tablespoons of sugar stir here 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:00.149
 I pour in vegetable oil 100 grams and 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:03.480
 sprinkle a pinch of soda 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:09.060
 soda do not need to quench because kefir 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:12.090
 petting if after which we pour flour dough 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.900
 you will be steep hard dough not 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.180
 hammer it must be very gentle 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:22.049
 soft all while at this stage 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.720
 we postpone our father. towards the foundations 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.470
 extract the bone and every cream I 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.439
 I divide the cake into 4 pieces very 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.619
 delicious sour for example i love 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:38.130
 such combinations let's say cherry pie 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.340
 either pie with plum 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.689
 all the plums are ready I took the form for 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.200
 baking bottom and sides 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:50.759
 must be lubricated with vegetable oil and 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.380
 distribute the dough in this way 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:58.439
 to make us small bumpers 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.480
 everything and in the middle we start to lay 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:05.380
 our 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:08.320
 for cream we sprinkle on top of sugar 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.840
 also on top is literally a spoonful of flour 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:16.010
 sprinkled to our filling 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:20.150
 was not too liquid that is flour she 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:23.300
 in turn will not allow the juice to make our 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.580
 the dough is too wet all and now 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.600
 Expose warmed to 200 degrees 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.750
