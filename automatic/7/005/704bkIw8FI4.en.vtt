you're<00:00:06.830> going<00:00:06.980> to<00:00:07.040> explore<00:00:07.490> the<00:00:07.729> new<00:00:07.880> copy<00:00:08.210> and

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 
you're going to explore the new copy and

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.560 
you're going to explore the new copy and
paste<00:00:08.719> motion<00:00:09.230> feature<00:00:09.469> in<00:00:09.770> flash<00:00:10.070> cs3<00:00:10.570> this

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
paste motion feature in flash cs3 this

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.029 
paste motion feature in flash cs3 this
allows<00:00:11.900> you<00:00:12.049> to<00:00:12.139> copy<00:00:12.350> motion<00:00:12.950> between

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:13.039 
allows you to copy motion between

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.280 
allows you to copy motion between
behavior<00:00:13.670> from<00:00:13.849> one<00:00:14.090> object<00:00:14.269> and<00:00:14.719> paste<00:00:14.960> it<00:00:15.139> to

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:15.290 
behavior from one object and paste it to

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.589 
behavior from one object and paste it to
another<00:00:15.530> this<00:00:16.400> way<00:00:16.640> you<00:00:16.700> can<00:00:16.849> give<00:00:17.180> two<00:00:17.450> or

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:17.599 
another this way you can give two or

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:19.570 
another this way you can give two or
more<00:00:17.750> symbols<00:00:18.230> the<00:00:18.410> exact<00:00:18.860> same<00:00:19.130> animation

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
more symbols the exact same animation

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.089 
more symbols the exact same animation
behavior<00:00:20.240> without<00:00:20.390> having<00:00:20.930> to<00:00:21.050> recreate<00:00:21.470> the

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.099 
behavior without having to recreate the

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.490 
behavior without having to recreate the
animation<00:00:22.669> again<00:00:22.910> and<00:00:23.119> again<00:00:23.329> simply<00:00:24.230> copy

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
animation again and again simply copy

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.069 
animation again and again simply copy
and<00:00:24.739> paste<00:00:25.300> so<00:00:26.300> what<00:00:26.480> we're<00:00:26.630> looking<00:00:26.930> at<00:00:27.020> here

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:27.079 
and paste so what we're looking at here

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.350 
and paste so what we're looking at here
on<00:00:27.410> my<00:00:27.590> stage<00:00:27.919> is<00:00:28.250> I<00:00:28.279> have<00:00:28.489> a<00:00:28.550> bird<00:00:28.759> graphic

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
on my stage is I have a bird graphic

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.940 
on my stage is I have a bird graphic
that's<00:00:29.599> being<00:00:29.809> twinned<00:00:30.140> across<00:00:30.500> the<00:00:30.710> stage

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:30.950 
that's being twinned across the stage

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.130 
that's being twinned across the stage
from<00:00:31.250> frames<00:00:31.550> 1<00:00:31.910> through<00:00:32.149> 50<00:00:34.690> if<00:00:35.690> I<00:00:35.840> hit<00:00:36.020> the

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
from frames 1 through 50 if I hit the

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.689 
from frames 1 through 50 if I hit the
return<00:00:36.500> key<00:00:36.530> you'll<00:00:36.980> see<00:00:37.160> it<00:00:37.250> moved<00:00:37.519> from

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
return key you'll see it moved from

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:40.419 
return key you'll see it moved from
right<00:00:37.940> to<00:00:38.120> left<00:00:38.149> across<00:00:38.539> the<00:00:38.960> stage<00:00:39.280> now<00:00:40.280> what

00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:40.429 
right to left across the stage now what

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:42.340 
right to left across the stage now what
I'd<00:00:40.550> like<00:00:40.579> to<00:00:40.760> do<00:00:41.059> is<00:00:41.269> take<00:00:41.449> another<00:00:41.839> instance

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
I'd like to do is take another instance

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.139 
I'd like to do is take another instance
of<00:00:42.440> this<00:00:42.559> bird<00:00:42.800> symbol<00:00:43.280> and<00:00:43.399> animate<00:00:43.850> it<00:00:43.999> in

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
of this bird symbol and animate it in

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.319 
of this bird symbol and animate it in
the<00:00:44.269> exact<00:00:44.600> same<00:00:44.870> way<00:00:45.109> on<00:00:45.350> a<00:00:45.440> whole<00:00:45.769> new<00:00:45.920> layer

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
the exact same way on a whole new layer

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.849 
the exact same way on a whole new layer
so<00:00:47.329> first<00:00:47.600> I'm<00:00:47.780> going<00:00:47.929> to<00:00:47.989> set<00:00:48.199> myself<00:00:48.379> up<00:00:48.800> for

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
so first I'm going to set myself up for

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.700 
so first I'm going to set myself up for
a<00:00:49.070> new<00:00:49.309> tweed<00:00:49.640> by<00:00:50.480> clicking<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:50.960> insert<00:00:51.170> layer

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
a new tweed by clicking the insert layer

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.649 
a new tweed by clicking the insert layer
icon<00:00:51.949> in<00:00:52.399> the<00:00:52.489> bottom<00:00:52.640> left<00:00:52.850> hand<00:00:53.149> corner<00:00:53.359> of

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659 
icon in the bottom left hand corner of

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:56.079 
icon in the bottom left hand corner of
the<00:00:53.809> timeline<00:00:53.960> panel<00:00:54.469> and<00:00:54.829> this<00:00:55.730> is<00:00:55.850> going<00:00:56.030> to

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
the timeline panel and this is going to

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.910 
the timeline panel and this is going to
create<00:00:56.210> a<00:00:56.359> new<00:00:56.420> blank<00:00:56.839> layer<00:00:57.050> with<00:00:57.409> a<00:00:57.440> single

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
create a new blank layer with a single

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.399 
create a new blank layer with a single
keyframe<00:00:58.510> now<00:00:59.510> I'm<00:00:59.600> going<00:00:59.780> to<00:00:59.839> go<00:00:59.989> over<00:01:00.019> to<00:01:00.199> my

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
keyframe now I'm going to go over to my

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:02.349 
keyframe now I'm going to go over to my
library<00:01:00.649> and<00:01:01.039> drag<00:01:01.249> a<00:01:01.280> brand<00:01:01.699> new<00:01:01.850> instance<00:01:02.269> of

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
library and drag a brand new instance of

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.450 
library and drag a brand new instance of
the<00:01:02.480> bird<00:01:02.659> symbol<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:03.319> just<00:01:03.859> place<00:01:04.129> it<00:01:04.159> on<00:01:04.430> the

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
the bird symbol and just place it on the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.920 
the bird symbol and just place it on the
bottom<00:01:04.729> over<00:01:05.089> here<00:01:05.300> where<00:01:05.479> I<00:01:05.510> want<00:01:05.780> the

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
bottom over here where I want the

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.460 
bottom over here where I want the
animation<00:01:06.290> to<00:01:06.530> start<00:01:06.979> in<00:01:07.900> order<00:01:08.900> to<00:01:08.990> copy<00:01:09.200> the

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
animation to start in order to copy the

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.110 
animation to start in order to copy the
motion<00:01:09.890> tween<00:01:10.130> behavior<00:01:10.610> from<00:01:10.730> the<00:01:10.880> first

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
motion tween behavior from the first

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.850 
motion tween behavior from the first
animation<00:01:11.600> I<00:01:11.870> have<00:01:12.050> to<00:01:12.200> select<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:12.710> entire
