on the highest heat setting possible
some<00:04:14.670> people<00:04:14.910> ask<00:04:15.090> me<00:04:15.330> you<00:04:15.510> know<00:04:15.540> how<00:04:16.500> do<00:04:16.560> you

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
some people ask me you know how do you

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.080 
some people ask me you know how do you
get<00:04:16.859> your<00:04:16.950> hair<00:04:17.100> so<00:04:17.489> straight<00:04:17.850> from

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
get your hair so straight from

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.030 
get your hair so straight from
blow-drying<00:04:18.479> or<00:04:18.810> natural<00:04:19.260> I<00:04:19.440> think<00:04:19.709> it<00:04:19.950> really

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
blow-drying or natural I think it really

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.009 
blow-drying or natural I think it really
depends<00:04:20.459> on<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:21.030> type<00:04:21.269> of<00:04:21.330> blow-dryer<00:04:21.840> that

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
depends on the type of blow-dryer that

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.480 
depends on the type of blow-dryer that
you<00:04:22.169> use<00:04:22.290> along<00:04:22.740> with<00:04:22.979> the<00:04:23.280> leave-in

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
you use along with the leave-in

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.159 
you use along with the leave-in
conditioner<00:04:24.000> as<00:04:24.150> well<00:04:24.360> I<00:04:24.630> think<00:04:24.870> they<00:04:24.960> both

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
conditioner as well I think they both

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.110 
conditioner as well I think they both
aid<00:04:25.470> in<00:04:25.830> getting<00:04:25.860> your<00:04:26.160> hair<00:04:26.370> as<00:04:26.550> straight

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
aid in getting your hair as straight

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.820 
aid in getting your hair as straight
as<00:04:27.180> possible<00:04:27.419> but<00:04:28.080> obviously<00:04:28.530> there<00:04:28.800> are

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
as possible but obviously there are

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.469 
as possible but obviously there are
other<00:04:29.370> ways<00:04:29.580> to<00:04:29.639> get<00:04:30.030> your<00:04:30.150> hair<00:04:30.330> even

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
other ways to get your hair even

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.570 
other ways to get your hair even
straighter<00:04:30.930> like<00:04:31.229> if<00:04:31.350> you<00:04:31.470> use<00:04:31.650> a<00:04:31.889> round<00:04:32.460> brush

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
straighter like if you use a round brush

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.490 
straighter like if you use a round brush
or<00:04:33.060> you<00:04:33.330> know<00:04:33.449> if<00:04:33.570> you<00:04:33.660> go<00:04:33.780> get<00:04:33.960> a<00:04:33.990> Dominican

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
or you know if you go get a Dominican

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.439 
or you know if you go get a Dominican
blowout<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:35.340> method<00:04:35.639> that<00:04:35.760> they<00:04:35.910> use<00:04:36.150> you

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
blowout the method that they use you

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.450 
blowout the method that they use you
know<00:04:36.570> and<00:04:36.750> how<00:04:36.810> straight<00:04:37.199> it<00:04:37.350> gets<00:04:37.560> but<00:04:38.100> that's

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
know and how straight it gets but that's

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.920 
know and how straight it gets but that's
just<00:04:38.610> way<00:04:38.790> too<00:04:38.850> much<00:04:39.120> heat<00:04:39.419> to<00:04:39.600> put<00:04:39.750> on<00:04:39.840> your

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
just way too much heat to put on your

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.140 
just way too much heat to put on your
hair<00:04:40.139> you<00:04:40.380> know<00:04:40.500> on<00:04:40.860> a<00:04:40.949> bi-monthly<00:04:41.190> basis<00:04:41.970> or

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
hair you know on a bi-monthly basis or

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.610 
hair you know on a bi-monthly basis or
just<00:04:42.330> every<00:04:42.540> time<00:04:42.690> you<00:04:42.780> wash<00:04:42.930> your<00:04:43.080> hair<00:04:43.229> and<00:04:43.470> I

just every time you wash your hair and I

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.560

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
think this is a lot more effective in my

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.310 
think this is a lot more effective in my
opinion<00:04:46.160> it's<00:04:47.160> less<00:04:47.669> tiring<00:04:48.360> on<00:04:48.660> your<00:04:48.840> arms
