00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
for like controller as a set which you

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.500 
for like controller as a set which you
can<00:01:04.140> switch<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.650> their<00:01:04.890> place<00:01:05.189> 30<00:01:05.909> presets<00:01:06.450> and

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.889 
but in a sense you can see that the
right<00:01:45.780> side<00:01:45.990> screen<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.920> lot<00:01:47.189> darker<00:01:47.899> in

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
right side screen is a lot darker in

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.080 
right side screen is a lot darker in
shadow<00:01:49.470> if<00:01:49.680> it's<00:01:49.920> like<00:01:50.189> everything<00:01:50.549> gets<00:01:50.790> just

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
shadow if it's like everything gets just

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.780 
shadow if it's like everything gets just
a<00:01:51.180> lot<00:01:51.450> more<00:01:51.659> shady<00:01:52.229> year<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.799> gas<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
a lot more shady year and gas and on the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.550 
a lot more shady year and gas and on the
left<00:01:53.970> side<00:01:54.149> it's<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.509> lot<00:01:54.659> brighter<00:01:54.990> its<00:01:55.380> lot

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
left side it's a lot brighter its lot

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.289 
left side it's a lot brighter its lot
clearer<00:01:55.969> especially<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.030> could<00:01:57.119> see<00:01:57.270> right

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
clearer especially you could see right

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.200 
clearer especially you could see right
here<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.229> that's<00:01:58.619> what<00:01:58.860> makes<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.460> benq<00:01:59.850> the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
here so that's what makes the benq the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.850 
here so that's what makes the benq the
mantra<00:02:00.509> really<00:02:00.899> really<00:02:01.079> good<00:02:01.290> cuz<00:02:01.500> it's<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.710> lot

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
mantra really really good cuz it's a lot

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.060 
mantra really really good cuz it's a lot
brighter<00:02:02.250> whiter<00:02:03.060> actually<00:02:03.780> whites<00:02:04.110> some

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
brighter whiter actually whites some

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.160 
brighter whiter actually whites some
colors<00:02:05.340> must<00:02:05.579> might<00:02:06.119> be<00:02:06.270> washed<00:02:06.479> out<00:02:06.780> but<00:02:07.079> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
colors must might be washed out but the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.139 
colors must might be washed out but the
point<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.590> when<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.310> play<00:02:08.429> FPS<00:02:08.580> games<00:02:09.000> and

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
point is when you play FPS games and

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.240 
point is when you play FPS games and
work<00:02:09.270> when<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.750> play<00:02:09.899> games<00:02:10.140> like<00:02:10.200> me<00:02:10.500> hands
