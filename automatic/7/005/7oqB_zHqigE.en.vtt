00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 the main goal is to show that space 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.750
 contemporary 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:11.010
 it does not necessarily have to be cold 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.099
 It does not have to be that space is cold without 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.720
 soul can not conceive of space and with 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:21.600
 straight lines a common space that does not 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.910
 we have furniture clicking objects but he 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.400
 stay warm when the space is 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.679
 than space then this 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.030
 It was my starting point. It 's me and I. 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.370
 I picked it up so I guess the 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.540
 important was to ensure more 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.329
 processes when you make the space that 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:46.110
 the more contemporary you want to have cleaner 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:50.100
 a fundamental point is the proportion né 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:54.870
 I think it's the ratio that sets it apart 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:59.699
 space in a space is rich with few 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:03.149
 things or simple poor space is then it is 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.240
 fireplace size is the size of the 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.750
 shelf is the size of the camera means 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.360
 the proportion that when equal is a 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.030
 woman to understand how she was several 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.680
 She's going to be this vest client . 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.640
 It means when she is very 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.770
 it's obvious it's already gone 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.799
 exchange information was there places 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.930
 just a mix of a black man with nothing 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.869
 this size has to be perfect 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.670
 finish has to be perfect the shoulder 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.460
 has to be the spirit of what he just 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.730
 it is then cut was made 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.270
 perfect trim 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:43.270
 what will show if this dress is rich 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.490
 It's minimalist by scenes he's rich 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.520
 with him at the door so he 'll take care of you. 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.430
 episode that the same penalty so I 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.490
 I have some friends right furniture - the object 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.420
 moves in space and a cleaner and 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.700
 ' no size bracelet for abusei in 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.690
 proportion then knowing has a way of 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:08.200
 two meters and 10 necker a pond one 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.760
 fireplace or salts a universal scut want 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.010
 tell a bed when I have the foot 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.600
 equal right because I made a bed with 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.530
 a football from here 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.110
 neco baldaque is actually an evil here 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.170
 steel and aluminum 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.880
 so I think that's the size and 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.690
 enriches you power for example this 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.970
 barrier 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.480
 the way of marlon and compadre mané 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.150
 to do is nothing special but the 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.350
 image if it were that way in size 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.900
 smaller 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.240
 she did not have this greatness she did not 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.670
 It would be rich was plan would have been 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.630
 Of course, charging everything then is the 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.810
 size is not the size that you 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.090
 differentiates the same thing far necas 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.910
 It's a mystery of supersimples has nothing 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.180
 special on the black lacquer shelf but 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.910
 the size of it's proportion and leaves 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:07.239
 that she gets hamas is more 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:09.550
 awesome and there it is I opted I like 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.330
 wallpaper and I really like fabric 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.800
 It's because I think that for more than 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.980
 if environment 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.160
 the cleaning is cold I like to create 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:25.060
 this box is with the wallpaper with 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.800
 fabric that I think this is is leaving the 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.530
 environment more like leaving the environment 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.720
 Cozier, no problem, what? 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.150
 that it is one color only because people 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.310
 have also often thought that the 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.380
 wallpaper with fabric has to be 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.260
 stamped has to be given must 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:45.670
 must not be a color just like 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:48.420
 I know here but I think and that even in this 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.160
 if it would be a gaucho wallpaper ' 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.250
 but I think the wallpaper he 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:58.150
 closes and warms up the environment, right? 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:01.180
 I decided to apply these rates 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.880
 do not reread the balls and 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.340
 risk because there would be no one element 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.190
 classic in architecture and decoration 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:13.570
 flaccid and I wanted to do this rereading 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:19.150
 of the wcr on top of the role of heartthrob xará 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:22.990
 paranaense weapons for this finish, right? 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:26.500
 Upstairs is actually stayed is modern 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.960
 it was contemporary but with a small 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.570
 detail that does not compromise 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.940
 straight lines that do not compromise 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.820
 this simplicity of space 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.270
 I think it is 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.550
 I think the house has to have the face of 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.100
 who looks 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.990
 I think when you hire a 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.140
 professional can buy curator's committee 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.270
 and is a good professional is one who 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:54.720
 can capture with the client's pocket 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.330
 nor can capture the customer likes 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.270
 do it in a better way either 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.020
 to say is to materialize the desire of the 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.830
 client 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:08.100
 I do not think there is what is ugly and e 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.770
 It's beautiful, then, I think you have a 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.410
 shelf at home for example you have 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:17.540
 books old books you read 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:21.180
 The objects you brought from travel are 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.490
 I can not put it all in, I do not think 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.340
 one right and wrong means all that 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.310
 What do you have that you have conquered 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.850
 life on a journey an inheritance of 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:35.640
 family a book to be a step strand 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:39.660
 Guys, I think it's just you take everything. 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.790
 This is putting on and feeling like you. 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.830
 You think you're cool as it gets 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.580
 mixing without having a logic I think 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:50.700
 that's the only tip but as soon as Maria is 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.600
 not having logic no no no no 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.450
 has rule 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:58.950
 in this mix the vase style of the book 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:06:01.140
 boot portrait of flower as an object and 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.850
 movie puts everything you have 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:06.210
 everything you like all that 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:09.440
 that is part of your life that 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.440
 denounce who you
