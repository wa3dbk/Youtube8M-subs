00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.990
 the last part of this chapter 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.580
 geographical area therefore concerns the population 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.990
 French and we will see first 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.030
 the distribution of this population 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.340
 starting with a density map 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.990
 population in europe who is we 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.700
 lets see that France does not have a 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.080
 very high density compared to its 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.580
 feet to neighboring countries since 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.820
 germany belgium or even 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.930
 northern italy where the king eyes the south 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.300
 from England are much more 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.710
 densely populated France has a 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.160
 population density quite close to 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.570
 that of Spain where countries of Europe 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.800
 from the east 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.110
 so this population distribution 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.030
 we see it better on this map of 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.430
 more precise density 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.230
 we can see that where intensity is 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.430
 extremely strong more than 300 inhabitants 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.890
 per square kilometer 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.750
 these are the large urban areas of which 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.190
 we have already spoken in a chapter in 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.829
 beginning of the paris and lyon chapter or 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.020
 marseille and that red orange is at 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.270
 say more than 80km inhabitants by 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.430
 square kilometer well on wax she gets 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.379
 so this time these urban spaces 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.140
 but also along the borders 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.530
 like that of Alsace to that 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.360
 germany that of belgium along 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.670
 coastlines since if we follow all the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.340
 French coastline we see a lot of 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.869
 the place in orange at over 80 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.250
 inhabitants per square kilometer but 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.590
 also along the rivers one along the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.540
 role of the onda scene along the Loire 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.430
 we see that population densities 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.840
 are much stronger though 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.540
 teeth site populations are clearly 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.610
 weaker throughout the center of the 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.700
 France the very numerous rural areas 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.430
 here and in the mountains 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.100
 so why do we have one of the densities of 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.270
 populations that are contrasts and 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.810
 in this way there that which 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.400
 explains the low densities to some 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.560
 places and high density to others 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.590
 so we can go back especially where the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.700
 19th century for big changes 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.170
 population density with 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.930
 the industrialization that pushed 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.490
 especially an important rural exodus so 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.219
 of peasants they started campaigns 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.799
 with agricultural mechanization to go 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.540
 work in factories near the 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.060
 cities and that explains why 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.819
 the urbanization of the north of France with 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:13.080
 the presence of coal mines 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:14.819
 so here to sum up to remember we can 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.290
 to say that France is 63 million 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.700
 inhabitants of metropolitan France + 2 million 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.090
 overseas what makes 65 million 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.730
 people 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.050
 population density and therefore 115 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.060
 inhabitants per square kilometer 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.349
 the population is concentrated in 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.459
 large urban areas along the 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.230
 rivers of so-called roses and 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.819
 borders in the space of weak 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.260
 density that we saw on the map a 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.700
 moment stretching from the worst sounded 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.980
 just the pyrenees forgiveness up to 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.140
 ardennes is called the diagonal of the 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.780
 empty so the French population is 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.879
 unevenly distributed since 60% of 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.459
 inhabitants live on eight percent of the 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:47.489
 territory then in 2nd what are the 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.800
 dynamics of this population one can 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.960
 see the seven cards from there 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.880
 the variation the French population by 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.650
 region as the population increases 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.860
 quite important way in the south 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:06.180
 with regions that are more red 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.820
 but also along the west the 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.870
 regions of western France and in 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.850
 alsace or in ile de france 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.980
 on the other hand, the regions which have 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.180
 small increase in number 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.980
 of inhabitants are those of the north 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.780
 especially the champagne ardenne and 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:23.220
 center of the country 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:25.410
 so this map shows that the 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.640
 population dynamics are linked to 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.780
 breasts of the reasons that found in 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.460
 France for several years 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.930
 dozens of reported rapes 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.030
 old industrial region since the 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.620
 north no calais loses inhabitants or 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.620
 lorraine which are regions 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.560
 many hibernators 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:47.370
 jobs for quite a few years at the same 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.640
 time is back which n littoralization of 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.380
 the population that tends to migrate from 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.750
 more and more towards the ribs 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.580
 and finally so-called places too 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.410
 prism ie an attraction for 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.660
 the sun since these are the regions of 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.480
 southern sunniest who sees 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:07.320
 happen the most population so these 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.690
 mobility affects a relatively 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.400
 pop way of people in France but 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:16.709
 it is much more 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:18.840
 aged between 20 and 39 and 41 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.989
 little 49 years old also who are the 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.640
 people in the job or who are the 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.980
 more dynamic and who do not hesitate to 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.500
 change of commune of department 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.790
 to find a job or a job 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.280
 better better conditions of 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.660
 life then to summarize the French the 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.530
 younger people migrate more easily 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.790
 from one region to another 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.830
 they are looking for a better living environment 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.990
 and work the regions that attract 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.550
 are on lees tour so from Brittany to 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.350
 the Riviera and in the south 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.090
 what's called the dummies tropism to 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.140
 the attraction to the sun so two 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.150
 cities like montpellier attracts a lot 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.870
 of inhabitants the regions of the north and 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.640
 northeast 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.860
 except Alsace are less attractive and 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.690
 lose inhabitants so 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.840
 another migratory phenomenon concerns the 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.419
 France are the 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.810
 international migrations so we can 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:04.780
 see that immigrants are 10% of the 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.100
 French population around around 6 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.919
 million they are mostly installed 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.910
 in the big cities and in the east and 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.979
 the south east of the country 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.360
 migratory flows ie the 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.949
 displacement of migrants from one country to another 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.690
 other come mostly from the Maghreb 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:19.030
 so as we can see on this 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.850
 pie chart one third of 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.530
 immigrants are from the maghreb one 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.780
 third come from other countries of the union 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.949
 European Union and the other third 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.229
 sharing on the other regions of the 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:31.080
 world with such a good part 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:35.229
 of Africans and Asians 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.570
 so that's why finally to finish 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.820
 the demographic dynamism of the 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.700
 French population that shows us that 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.680
 the French population sees today 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.780
 three major demographic dynamics 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.820
 the first touch is a rate of 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.570
 fertility which is high enough around 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:55.960
 two children per woman what is the 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:59.680
 most important European countries in 2d 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.240
 we have a number of pensioners who are growing up 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.810
 without stopping thanks to a life expectancy 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:07.380
 more important also with the arrival at 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.220
 the retirement age of many 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.450
 baby boomers ie people 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.789
 who were born after the second war 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.590
 world until the 60s finally 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:16.660
 last thing growth 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.200
 French demographic is regular and 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.190
 supported 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.910
 so what keeps the country going 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.789
 win people 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.530
 this boils down to a demographics 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:29.080
 more dynamic than neighboring countries with 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.610
 a high fertility rate a rate of 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.810
 birthrate which is higher than the rate of 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.250
 mortality that allows an increase 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.440
 natural study ie 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.780
 the population increase and a 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.700
 increase in life expectancy that has 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.590
 reaches 81 years in total 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.970
 or that 84 for women and 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.190
 seventy eight for men 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.479
 about with a what causes a 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.919
 aging of the population so 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:50.380
 either we can call the pepy the 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:51.789
 own grandpa boom which will result in 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.830
 a problem of taking charge of 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:57.849
 elderly people especially with the 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:59.190
 retirement that is going to be difficult to pay 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:02.050
 in the coming years 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.720
 so that's the end of this part 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.280
 just to finish 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.400
 quickly on the sketch of the 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.260
 dynamic population distribution 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:16.860
 so with this blank sketch 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:18.750
 directed by my colleague fred sauzeau this 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.390
 sketch so using the map of 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.340
 densities we can complete the densities 

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:26.190
 population is also supplemented the 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:28.290
 so pesky migrations it's from these 

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:31.800
 three cards together on the sketch that 

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:33.420
 gives us very obviously 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.570
 high densities that lies as one 

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:38.310
 said it on paris the littoral waters and 

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.900
 along rivers and be as 

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.910
 low density frontiers 

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.640
 especially at the diagonal of the vacuum at 

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:47.580
 middle of attractive regions that locates 

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:50.610
 in the entire southern half of France and
