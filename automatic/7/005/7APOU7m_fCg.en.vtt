00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
very unexpectedly the same way that a

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.060 
very unexpectedly the same way that a
lot<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.689> last<00:00:21.960> time<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.199> live<00:00:22.529> streams<00:00:22.859> which

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
lot of last time I live streams which

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.820 
lot of last time I live streams which
was<00:00:23.279> like<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:24.240> seems<00:00:24.480> four<00:00:24.750> months<00:00:25.050> ago<00:00:25.170> on

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
was like it seems four months ago on

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.460 
was like it seems four months ago on
moon<00:00:26.099> around<00:00:26.670> 80<00:00:27.240> for<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.570> exact<00:00:28.050> same<00:00:28.260> thing

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
moon around 80 for the exact same thing

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.389 
moon around 80 for the exact same thing
happened<00:00:28.880> so<00:00:29.880> um<00:00:30.300> if<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.529> can<00:00:32.160> figure

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
happened so um if you can figure

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.610 
happened so um if you can figure
something<00:00:32.940> out<00:00:33.180> by<00:00:33.809> what<00:00:34.170> I've<00:00:34.260> just<00:00:34.290> said

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
something out by what I've just said

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.440 
something out by what I've just said
there's<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.130> correlation<00:00:35.460> between<00:00:35.730> streaming

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
there's a correlation between streaming

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.220 
there's a correlation between streaming
and<00:00:36.829> high<00:00:37.829> round<00:00:38.100> games<00:00:38.370> ending<00:00:38.780> and<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:40.050> is

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
and high round games ending and that is

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.430 
and high round games ending and that is
that<00:00:40.530> xsplit<00:00:41.399> kills<00:00:41.879> my<00:00:42.059> computer<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:43.110> i<00:00:43.140> will

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
that xsplit kills my computer so i will

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.990 
that xsplit kills my computer so i will
not<00:00:43.590> be<00:00:43.770> streaming<00:00:44.070> again<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.579> thought<00:00:44.850> it

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
not be streaming again I thought it

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.330 
not be streaming again I thought it
fixed<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.510> Oh<00:00:45.800> before<00:00:46.800> starting<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.250> game

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
fixed it Oh before starting this game

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.190 
fixed it Oh before starting this game
but<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.730> guess<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.030> didn't<00:00:48.329> after<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.809> guy<00:00:48.989> oh

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
but I guess I didn't after that guy oh

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.150 
but I guess I didn't after that guy oh
well<00:00:49.760> um<00:00:50.760> yeah<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.329> actually<00:00:52.039> restarted<00:00:53.039> this

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
well um yeah I actually restarted this

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.750 
well um yeah I actually restarted this
game<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:54.350> then<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.559> ended<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.100> different<00:00:56.640> way

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
game and then it ended a different way

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.950 
game and then it ended a different way
