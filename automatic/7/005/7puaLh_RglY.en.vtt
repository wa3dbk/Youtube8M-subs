modified<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:55.440> thermal<00:00:57.260> then<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.410> couple

modified the the thermal then the couple

modified the the thermal then the couple
was<00:00:59.370> replaced<00:00:59.760> by<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> thermistor<00:01:01.760> other<00:01:02.760> than

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.630 

it's<00:01:07.320> normally<00:01:07.619> going<00:01:07.680> faster<00:01:08.310> than<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.460> but

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
it's normally going faster than this but

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.219 
it's normally going faster than this but
I've<00:01:08.760> turned<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.210> accelerations<00:01:09.780> down<00:01:09.960> I

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
I've turned the accelerations down I

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.649 
I've turned the accelerations down I
think<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> little<00:01:11.250> bit<00:01:11.369> too<00:01:11.549> slow<00:01:11.790> now<00:01:12.000> so

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
think it's a little bit too slow now so

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.910 
think it's a little bit too slow now so
I'll<00:01:12.900> turn<00:01:13.140> them<00:01:13.260> off<00:01:13.350> again<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> next

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
I'll turn them off again for the next

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.649 
I'll turn them off again for the next

to put this Cable Guy on there fairly

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.160 
to put this Cable Guy on there fairly
soon<00:02:06.819> and<00:02:07.819> that<00:02:07.970> will<00:02:08.090> allow<00:02:08.299> me<00:02:08.450> to<00:02:08.479> enclose

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
soon and that will allow me to enclose

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
soon and that will allow me to enclose
the<00:02:10.099> whole<00:02:10.280> thing<00:02:10.519> to<00:02:10.849> keep<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:12.099> keep<00:02:13.099> the
