blade the Tri flex actually heat treated

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:36.620 
blade the Tri flex actually heat treated
in<00:00:35.200> a<00:00:35.290> way<00:00:35.320> where<00:00:35.530> the<00:00:35.620> cutting<00:00:35.860> edge<00:00:36.130> is

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
in a way where the cutting edge is

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.069 
in a way where the cutting edge is
harder<00:00:37.630> than<00:00:38.140> the<00:00:38.200> spine<00:00:38.710> and<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:40.239> know<00:00:40.899> let

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
harder than the spine and you know let

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.209 
harder than the spine and you know let
me<00:00:41.170> tell<00:00:41.350> you<00:00:41.440> about<00:00:41.500> something<00:00:41.770> real<00:00:42.010> quick

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
me tell you about something real quick

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:43.520 
me tell you about something real quick
that<00:00:42.370> I<00:00:42.430> found<00:00:42.640> out<00:00:42.730> about<00:00:42.880> the<00:00:43.120> spine

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
that I found out about the spine

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.200 
that I found out about the spine
initially<00:00:44.530> you<00:00:45.130> know<00:00:45.280> the<00:00:45.670> backs<00:00:45.910> of<00:00:46.090> these

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
initially you know the backs of these

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.110 
initially you know the backs of these
spines<00:00:46.570> aren't<00:00:47.380> a<00:00:47.440> perfect<00:00:47.980> 90<00:00:48.370> degree<00:00:48.520> angle

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
spines aren't a perfect 90 degree angle

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.290 
spines aren't a perfect 90 degree angle
there's<00:00:49.300> a<00:00:49.360> slight<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:51.640> rounded<00:00:52.090> over

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
there's a slight it's rounded over

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.260 
there's a slight it's rounded over
slightly<00:00:52.630> so<00:00:53.380> like<00:00:54.250> most<00:00:54.550> people<00:00:54.940> with<00:00:55.060> more

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
slightly so like most people with more

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.660 
slightly so like most people with more
knives<00:00:55.510> they<00:00:55.810> just<00:00:56.050> follow<00:00:56.320> that<00:00:56.560> down<00:00:56.800> since

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
knives they just follow that down since

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.340 
knives they just follow that down since
this<00:00:57.790> is<00:00:57.940> a<00:00:57.970> carbon<00:00:58.390> steel<00:00:58.540> blade<00:00:58.960> you'll<00:00:59.200> be

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
this is a carbon steel blade you'll be

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.830 
this is a carbon steel blade you'll be
able<00:00:59.470> to<00:00:59.680> you<00:01:00.400> know<00:01:00.490> use<00:01:00.670> your<00:01:00.820> fire<00:01:01.090> steel<00:01:01.480> and

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
able to you know use your fire steel and

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.189 
able to you know use your fire steel and
you<00:01:01.990> can<00:01:02.079> get<00:01:02.200> a<00:01:02.230> fire<00:01:02.800> going<00:01:03.130> that<00:01:03.340> way<00:01:03.520> so<00:01:04.199> as

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
you can get a fire going that way so as

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.469 
you can get a fire going that way so as
I<00:01:05.350> was<00:01:05.470> starting<00:01:05.680> to<00:01:05.860> follow<00:01:06.130> this<00:01:06.460> and<00:01:06.759> I

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
I was starting to follow this and I

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.210 
I was starting to follow this and I
realized<00:01:07.900> that<00:01:08.020> this<00:01:08.259> front<00:01:08.619> wedge<00:01:08.890> it's

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
realized that this front wedge it's

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.210 
realized that this front wedge it's
about<00:01:09.430> an<00:01:09.549> inch<00:01:09.640> and<00:01:09.850> a<00:01:09.880> half<00:01:09.909> here<00:01:10.090> is<00:01:11.220> built

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
about an inch and a half here is built

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.600 
about an inch and a half here is built
for<00:01:12.579> using<00:01:13.210> a<00:01:13.299> fire<00:01:13.540> steel<00:01:13.840> and<00:01:14.200> I'll<00:01:14.979> roll<00:01:15.460> in

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
for using a fire steel and I'll roll in

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.530 
for using a fire steel and I'll roll in
some<00:01:15.790> footage<00:01:15.850> here<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:17.560> me<00:01:17.860> doing<00:01:18.190> just<00:01:18.400> that

far as an attachment I use a mini tech

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.800 
far as an attachment I use a mini tech
lock<00:01:53.619> clip<00:01:53.920> here<00:01:54.220> to<00:01:54.909> attach<00:01:55.180> it<00:01:55.390> and<00:01:55.510> this<00:01:55.570> can

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
lock clip here to attach it and this can

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.289 
lock clip here to attach it and this can
rotate<00:01:56.020> to<00:01:56.409> different<00:01:56.710> positions<00:01:56.970> and<00:01:57.970> it

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
rotate to different positions and it

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.990 
rotate to different positions and it
will<00:01:58.689> retain<00:01:59.049> it<00:01:59.260> and<00:01:59.439> retain<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.460> knife<00:02:00.670> in
