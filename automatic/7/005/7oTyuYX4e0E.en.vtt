00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
on to make sure that we can be a

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.920 
on to make sure that we can be a
competitive<00:02:02.610> team<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.090> league<00:02:03.180> you've

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
competitive team in this league you've

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.050 
competitive team in this league you've
had<00:02:04.110> two<00:02:04.530> days<00:02:04.770> pretty<00:02:05.070> much<00:02:05.219> this<00:02:05.460> first<00:02:05.880> two

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
had two days pretty much this first two

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.580 
had two days pretty much this first two
weeks<00:02:06.299> what<00:02:06.570> has<00:02:06.689> been<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.960> focus<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.469> what's

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
weeks what has been the focus and what's

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.309 
weeks what has been the focus and what's
the<00:02:07.680> continued<00:02:08.039> focus<00:02:08.360> I'm<00:02:09.360> just<00:02:09.899> setting<00:02:10.110> a

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
the continued focus I'm just setting a

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.410 
the continued focus I'm just setting a
strategy<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.190> our<00:02:11.280> tactics<00:02:11.790> for<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.030> season

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
strategy and our tactics for the season

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.820 
strategy and our tactics for the season
i<00:02:12.540> think<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:12.989> huge<00:02:13.379> thing

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
i think is a huge thing

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.220 
i think is a huge thing
and<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:15.030> know<00:02:15.150> we've<00:02:15.510> worked<00:02:15.750> hard<00:02:15.870> in<00:02:16.110> the

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
and you know we've worked hard in the

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.440 
and you know we've worked hard in the
offseason<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.770> get<00:02:16.890> players<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.880> it's<00:02:18.330> not

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
offseason to get players in and it's not

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.850 
offseason to get players in and it's not
making<00:02:18.660> sure<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:19.080> they<00:02:19.230> know<00:02:19.260> their<00:02:19.620> roles

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
making sure that they know their roles

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.040 
making sure that they know their roles
and<00:02:20.130> their<00:02:20.250> jobs<00:02:20.520> in<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.790> team<00:02:21.030> so<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.360> we

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
and their jobs in the team so that we

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.690 
and their jobs in the team so that we
can<00:02:22.230> function<00:02:22.710> collectively<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.520> be<00:02:23.670> a

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
can function collectively to be a

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.850 
can function collectively to be a
competitive<00:02:24.270> team<00:02:24.380> setting<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.470> strategy

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
competitive team setting that strategy

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.680 
competitive team setting that strategy
difficult<00:02:26.550> when<00:02:26.670> they're<00:02:26.850> such<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.120> new<00:02:27.360> group

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
difficult when they're such a new group

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.330 
difficult when they're such a new group
of<00:02:27.840> players<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.440> not<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.620> lot<00:02:28.770> of<00:02:28.800> returners

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
of players and not a lot of returners

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.210 
of players and not a lot of returners
necessarily<00:02:29.940> not<00:02:30.690> really<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:32.070> know<00:02:32.100> I

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
necessarily not really and you know I

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.680 
necessarily not really and you know I
think<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:32.700> know<00:02:32.820> someone<00:02:33.000> locked<00:02:33.210> Kim<00:02:33.450> it's

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
think you know someone locked Kim it's

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.270 
think you know someone locked Kim it's
it's<00:02:33.990> not<00:02:34.170> really<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.470> different<00:02:34.800> strategy<00:02:34.950> to

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
it's not really a different strategy to

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.520 
it's not really a different strategy to
what<00:02:35.400> we<00:02:35.460> had<00:02:35.580> at<00:02:35.670> Arsenal<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.330> you<00:02:37.200> know<00:02:37.290> good

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
what we had at Arsenal and you know good

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.170 
what we had at Arsenal and you know good
players<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:37.980> good<00:02:38.250> place<00:02:38.460> for<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.700> reason<00:02:38.880> and

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
players a good place for a reason and

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.060 
players a good place for a reason and
it's<00:02:39.300> because<00:02:39.540> they've<00:02:39.750> got<00:02:39.930> talent<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.530> they

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
it's because they've got talent and they

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.560 
it's because they've got talent and they
know<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.250> little<00:02:41.430> bit<00:02:41.580> about<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.940> game<00:02:42.150> so

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
know a little bit about the game so

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.200 
know a little bit about the game so
being<00:02:43.350> able<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.710> just<00:02:43.740> tinker<00:02:44.520> with<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:44.940> and

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
being able to just tinker with that and

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.460 
being able to just tinker with that and
give<00:02:45.660> them<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.870> little<00:02:45.960> bit<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.230> information

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
give them a little bit of information

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.160 
give them a little bit of information
he's<00:02:46.920> always<00:02:47.220> beneficial<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.690> both<00:02:48.870> them

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
he's always beneficial to to both them

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.610 
he's always beneficial to to both them
and<00:02:49.200> hopefully<00:02:50.040> for<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.370> team
