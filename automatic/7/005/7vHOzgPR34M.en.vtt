for<00:00:15.000> this<00:00:15.120> game<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:17.930> quite<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.960> few<00:00:19.020> people

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
for this game and quite a few people

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.630 
for this game and quite a few people
have<00:00:19.590> been<00:00:19.740> saying<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.189> having<00:00:20.340> some

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
have been saying that having some

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.370 
have been saying that having some
trouble<00:00:21.000> getting<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.779> game<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.260> run<00:00:22.439> so<00:00:23.240> I'm

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
trouble getting the game to run so I'm

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.050 
trouble getting the game to run so I'm
not<00:00:25.380> too<00:00:25.650> sure<00:00:25.920> if<00:00:25.949> it's<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.340> previous<00:00:26.789> bill

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
not too sure if it's a previous bill

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.019 
not too sure if it's a previous bill
that's<00:00:27.330> actually<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.750> problem<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:28.820> if<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:29.939> is

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
that's actually the problem so if it is

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.420 
that's actually the problem so if it is
a<00:00:30.060> breathing<00:00:30.449> spell<00:00:30.720> then<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:32.070> need<00:00:32.309> to

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
a breathing spell then you need to

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.080 
a breathing spell then you need to
ideally<00:00:33.420> happy<00:00:33.719> having<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> latest<00:00:34.260> one<00:00:35.090> most

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
ideally happy having the latest one most

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.250 
ideally happy having the latest one most
people<00:00:36.360> have<00:00:36.450> been<00:00:36.510> reporting<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.110> it's

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
people have been reporting that it's

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.680 
people have been reporting that it's
actually<00:00:37.559> at<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:39.210> been<00:00:39.390> having<00:00:39.629> the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
actually at the have been having the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.860 
actually at the have been having the
same<00:00:39.870> problem<00:00:40.379> with<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.649> game<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.870> there's

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
same problem with the game so there's

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.430 
same problem with the game so there's
probably<00:00:42.960> because<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.649> video<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.489> video<00:00:45.440> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
probably because the video the video the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.560 
probably because the video the video the
link<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.680> which<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.129> provided<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.910> very<00:00:48.300> old

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
link that which I provided is very old

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.560 
link that which I provided is very old
so<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:50.190> most<00:00:50.370> recent<00:00:50.910> one<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.090> think<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.449> only

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
so the most recent one I think is only

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.799 
so the most recent one I think is only
like<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> couple<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.320> months<00:00:52.590> old<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.629> I'm<00:00:54.629> gonna

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
for some reason anyway that's pretty

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.509 
for some reason anyway that's pretty
much<00:02:54.140> it<00:02:55.180> works<00:02:56.180> fine<00:02:56.540> as<00:02:56.720> well<00:02:56.870> so<00:02:57.370> I've<00:02:58.370> not

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
much it works fine as well so I've not

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.550 
much it works fine as well so I've not
any<00:02:58.760> problems<00:02:59.150> running<00:02:59.390> it<00:02:59.629> I<00:02:59.810> tried<00:03:00.349> it<00:03:00.470> a

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
any problems running it I tried it a

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.900 
any problems running it I tried it a
couple<00:03:00.590> of<00:03:00.890> times<00:03:01.129> already<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.640> it<00:03:01.730> works

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
couple of times already and it works

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.449 
couple of times already and it works
fine<00:03:02.180> I<00:03:02.889> think<00:03:03.889> the<00:03:03.950> problem<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.400> some

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
fine I think the problem that some

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.490 
fine I think the problem that some
people<00:03:04.940> were<00:03:05.030> having<00:03:05.389> was<00:03:05.599> that<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:06.319> game

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
people were having was that the game

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.569 
people were having was that the game

certain component from your computer to

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.509 
certain component from your computer to

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
was quite old so I highly recommend just

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.710

your<00:03:41.450> previous<00:03:41.959> version<00:03:42.380> of<00:03:42.530> this<00:03:42.739> game<00:03:42.980> that

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
your previous version of this game that

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.120 
your previous version of this game that
you<00:03:43.190> have<00:03:43.220> on<00:03:43.430> your<00:03:43.549> computer<00:03:44.859> if<00:03:45.859> you<00:03:46.010> have

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
you have on your computer if you have

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.039 
you have on your computer if you have
any<00:03:46.310> save<00:03:46.549> files<00:03:46.940> there<00:03:47.269> I<00:03:47.299> recommend<00:03:47.810> keeping

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
any save files there I recommend keeping

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:49.539 
any save files there I recommend keeping
them<00:03:48.440> because<00:03:48.590> this<00:03:49.130> game<00:03:49.310> is<00:03:49.430> quite

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
them because this game is quite

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.170 
them because this game is quite
difficult<00:03:49.880> and<00:03:51.400> if<00:03:52.400> you're<00:03:52.579> quite<00:03:52.790> far<00:03:53.030> into

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
difficult and if you're quite far into

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.970 
difficult and if you're quite far into
the<00:03:53.329> game<00:03:53.510> and<00:03:54.290> you<00:03:54.410> don't<00:03:54.590> really<00:03:54.739> want<00:03:54.950> to

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
the game and you don't really want to

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.619 
the game and you don't really want to
lose<00:03:55.160> that<00:03:55.340> save<00:03:55.579> data<00:03:55.819> unless<00:03:56.299> you<00:03:56.419> want<00:03:56.540> to

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
lose that save data unless you want to

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:57.849 
lose that save data unless you want to
play<00:03:56.750> it<00:03:56.810> from<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.049> beginning<00:03:57.139> to<00:03:57.410> see<00:03:57.799> if

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
play it from the beginning to see if

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.610 
play it from the beginning to see if
there's<00:03:58.010> any<00:03:58.099> changes<00:03:58.930> which<00:03:59.930> I<00:04:00.139> imagine<00:04:00.319> is

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
there's any changes which I imagine is

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.400 
there's any changes which I imagine is
probably<00:04:00.919> quite<00:04:01.099> a<00:04:01.160> few<00:04:01.569> but<00:04:02.569> anyway<00:04:02.840> just

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
probably quite a few but anyway just

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.859 
probably quite a few but anyway just
watching<00:04:03.739> guys
