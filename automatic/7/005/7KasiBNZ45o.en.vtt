to<00:00:26.199> get<00:00:26.380> it<00:00:26.530> on<00:00:26.680> the<00:00:27.010> dolphin<00:00:27.490> 2.0<00:00:28.030> so<00:00:28.360> you

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:28.449 
to get it on the dolphin 2.0 so you

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.890 
to get it on the dolphin 2.0 so you

could play endless ocean I don't

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.959

recommend<00:00:32.199> using<00:00:32.949> the<00:00:33.159> controller<00:00:33.579> for<00:00:33.850> an

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969 
recommend using the controller for an

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.500 
recommend using the controller for an
associate<00:00:34.480> because<00:00:35.469> it's<00:00:35.649> really<00:00:35.980> not<00:00:36.159> great

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
associate because it's really not great

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.479 
associate because it's really not great
but<00:00:37.510> there<00:00:38.379> are<00:00:38.469> some<00:00:38.649> bits<00:00:38.800> that<00:00:39.010> require<00:00:39.280> you

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
but there are some bits that require you

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.759 
but there are some bits that require you
to<00:00:39.550> use<00:00:39.729> a<00:00:39.850> shake<00:00:40.659> function<00:00:41.229> like<00:00:41.499> you<00:00:41.649> know

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
to use a shake function like you know

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:45.389 
to use a shake function like you know
you<00:00:41.829> shake<00:00:42.249> your<00:00:42.600> Wii<00:00:43.600> mode<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:45.010> can't<00:00:45.249> do

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
you shake your Wii mode you can't do

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.910 
you shake your Wii mode you can't do
that<00:00:45.550> with<00:00:45.879> a<00:00:45.929> emulated<00:00:46.929> Wii<00:00:47.109> mote<00:00:47.319> you<00:00:47.649> can

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
that with a emulated Wii mote you can

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.209

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
it the game is compatible with the

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.500 
it the game is compatible with the
classic<00:02:17.620> controller<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.790> in<00:02:19.180> order<00:02:19.360> to

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
classic controller so in order to

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.930 
classic controller so in order to
emulate<00:02:20.230> that<00:02:21.210> move<00:02:22.210> some<00:02:22.390> stuff<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:23.140> simply

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
emulate that move some stuff you simply

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.660 
emulate that move some stuff you simply
need<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:24.970> make<00:02:25.240> sure<00:02:25.270> that<00:02:25.690> you<00:02:25.840> have<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:27.070> left

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
need to make sure that you have the left

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.300 
need to make sure that you have the left
trigger<00:02:28.020> or<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.320> left<00:02:29.500> um

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.780 

analog<00:02:33.310> sticks<00:02:33.610> or<00:02:34.180> button<00:02:35.080> pad<00:02:35.320> thing<00:02:35.790> down

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
analog sticks or button pad thing down

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.230 
analog sticks or button pad thing down
sets<00:02:37.180> first<00:02:37.420> for<00:02:37.750> or<00:02:37.900> under<00:02:38.170> left<00:02:38.860> stick<00:02:39.240> right

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
sets first for or under left stick right

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.590 
sets first for or under left stick right
stick<00:02:40.270> you<00:02:40.660> up<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.870> first<00:02:41.080> four<00:02:41.440> and<00:02:41.800> a<00:02:42.459> B<00:02:43.300> and

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
stick you up the first four and a B and

stick you up the first four and a B and
x<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:43.930> y<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:45.580> you<00:02:45.640> want<00:02:45.790> everything<00:02:45.910> under

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
x and y so you want everything under

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.110 
x and y so you want everything under
right<00:02:46.450> stick<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.110> then<00:02:48.100> under<00:02:48.489> triggers<00:02:48.850> you

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
right stick and then under triggers you

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.020 
right stick and then under triggers you
want<00:02:49.300> left<00:02:49.930> trigger<00:02:50.200> right<00:02:50.530> trigger<00:02:51.030> don't

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
want left trigger right trigger don't

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.370 
want left trigger right trigger don't
don't<00:02:52.330> worry<00:02:52.450> about<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.810> digital<00:02:53.140> left

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
don't worry about the digital left

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.710 
don't worry about the digital left
digital<00:02:53.770> right<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.160> do<00:02:54.670> that<00:02:55.270> they're<00:02:55.450> just

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
digital right to do that they're just

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.300 
digital right to do that they're just
the<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:58.000> arrows<00:02:58.420> which<00:02:59.380> I<00:02:59.560> mean<00:02:59.709> you<00:02:59.800> can<00:03:00.040> use

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
the the arrows which I mean you can use

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.620 
the the arrows which I mean you can use
them<00:03:00.520> and<00:03:00.700> they<00:03:00.790> do<00:03:00.850> have<00:03:01.030> functions<00:03:01.450> in<00:03:01.570> the

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
them and they do have functions in the

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.060 
them and they do have functions in the
game<00:03:01.780> but<00:03:01.959> if<00:03:02.020> you<00:03:02.110> just<00:03:02.290> want<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.650> get<00:03:02.890> through
