00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
can bring it everywhere and you have

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.800 
can bring it everywhere and you have
this<00:01:42.399> group<00:01:42.700> this<00:01:42.940> group<00:01:43.000> is<00:01:43.360> usually

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
this group this group is usually

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.690 
this group this group is usually
installed<00:01:44.020> on<00:01:44.410> professional<00:01:45.100> coffee<00:01:45.280> machine

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
installed on professional coffee machine

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.550 
installed on professional coffee machine
so<00:01:45.880> you<00:01:45.940> need<00:01:46.179> to<00:01:46.270> be<00:01:46.390> boiler<00:01:46.869> on<00:01:47.050> the<00:01:47.170> back<00:01:47.320> to

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
so you need to be boiler on the back to

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.480 
so you need to be boiler on the back to
keep<00:01:47.590> it<00:01:47.860> hot<00:01:48.450> yeah<00:01:49.450> we<00:01:49.810> thought<00:01:50.229> to<00:01:50.619> install

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
keep it hot yeah we thought to install

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.450 
keep it hot yeah we thought to install
to<00:01:51.850> eating<00:01:52.149> element<00:01:52.630> into<00:01:53.259> the<00:01:53.350> group<00:01:53.590> and

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
to eating element into the group and

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.029 
to eating element into the group and
instead<00:01:54.970> of<00:01:55.450> eating<00:01:55.690> it<00:01:56.020> with<00:01:56.259> the<00:01:56.470> heat<00:01:57.009> of

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
instead of eating it with the heat of

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.430 
instead of eating it with the heat of
the<00:01:57.369> boiler<00:01:57.610> we<00:01:58.210> tipped<00:01:58.539> with<00:01:58.960> two<00:01:59.170> heating

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
the boiler we tipped with two heating

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.120 
the boiler we tipped with two heating
elements<00:01:59.890> so<00:02:00.119> we<00:02:01.119> can<00:02:01.500> keep<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.950> group

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
elements so we can keep the group

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.550 
elements so we can keep the group
interpolator<00:02:03.790> with<00:02:04.150> a<00:02:04.180> small<00:02:04.540> boiler<00:02:04.810> put<00:02:05.409> it

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
interpolator with a small boiler put it

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.770 
interpolator with a small boiler put it
at<00:02:05.680> home<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.220> use<00:02:06.939> the<00:02:07.689> lever<00:02:08.470> machine<00:02:09.780> system

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
at home and use the lever machine system

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.920 
at home and use the lever machine system
that<00:02:11.019> is<00:02:11.340> one<00:02:12.340> of<00:02:12.549> the<00:02:12.760> oldest<00:02:13.150> system<00:02:13.720> and

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
that is one of the oldest system and

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.280 
that is one of the oldest system and
that<00:02:14.829> give<00:02:15.070> good<00:02:16.030> result<00:02:16.540> with<00:02:16.720> with<00:02:17.170> the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
that give good result with with the

it was what we do here so okay I mean

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:44.880 
it was what we do here so okay I mean
bit<00:02:40.860> so<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:42.220> difference<00:02:43.140> in<00:02:44.140> between<00:02:44.350> the

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
bit so the difference in between the

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.600 
bit so the difference in between the
normal<00:02:45.250> machine<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:45.850> this<00:02:45.970> machine<00:02:46.030> is<00:02:46.600> that

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
normal machine and this machine is that

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.010 
normal machine and this machine is that
