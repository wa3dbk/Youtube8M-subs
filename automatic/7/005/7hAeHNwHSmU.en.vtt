00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
a cup of medicine is a high definition

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.159 
a cup of medicine is a high definition
or<00:05:56.889> maybe<00:05:57.099> one<00:05:57.370> minute<00:05:57.550> but<00:05:57.899> well<00:05:58.899> it's<00:05:59.050> not

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
or maybe one minute but well it's not

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:01.529 
or maybe one minute but well it's not
say<00:05:59.409> they<00:05:59.979> put<00:06:00.159> it<00:06:00.279> in<00:06:00.399> i<00:06:00.610> also<00:06:01.120> bought<00:06:01.360> this

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:01.539 
say they put it in i also bought this

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:05.219 
say they put it in i also bought this
this<00:06:01.990> isn't<00:06:02.169> a<00:06:02.469> filter<00:06:03.189> UV<00:06:03.610> filter<00:06:04.229> main

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:05.229 
this isn't a filter UV filter main

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:07.860 
this isn't a filter UV filter main
reason<00:06:05.589> why<00:06:05.709> about<00:06:06.009> this<00:06:06.189> is<00:06:06.550> because<00:06:06.909> for<00:06:07.719> the

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
reason why about this is because for the

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.059 
reason why about this is because for the
lens<00:06:08.050> protection<00:06:09.689> so<00:06:10.689> yeah<00:06:10.990> it<00:06:11.169> is<00:06:11.529> very<00:06:11.740> handy

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:12.069 
lens protection so yeah it is very handy

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:13.649 
lens protection so yeah it is very handy
because<00:06:12.249> if<00:06:12.759> something<00:06:13.029> has<00:06:13.270> to<00:06:13.389> through<00:06:13.539> the

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:13.659 
because if something has to through the

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:15.839 
because if something has to through the
lens<00:06:13.870> is<00:06:14.110> probably<00:06:14.439> very<00:06:14.499> expensive<00:06:15.370> to

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:15.849 
lens is probably very expensive to

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:18.600 
lens is probably very expensive to
replace<00:06:16.180> so<00:06:16.740> this<00:06:17.740> one<00:06:17.949> is<00:06:18.099> pure<00:06:18.370> for

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
replace so this one is pure for

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:42.750 
replace so this one is pure for
protection<00:06:19.120> it<00:06:19.300> was<00:06:19.449> 25<00:06:19.749> year<00:06:20.080> olds
