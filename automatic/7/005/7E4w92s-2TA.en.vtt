00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.660
 here 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.570
 Switch the loudness of the bell 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.560
 ghost 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:27.390
 Ueno 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.990
 LCD pride lights up 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.300
 2 I knew 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.960
 With model number 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.180
 There is a park 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.000
 It is four AA 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.820
 Alkaline battery 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.840
 Well, that 's a cartoon 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:49.210
 As we move crowded, little things are full 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.620
 There is a setting behind 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.920
 Here's an alarming alarm 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.970
 Here to the 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:02.120
 If you set the alarm time setting recommendation and back at the same time manually 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.990
 Time setting 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.880
 There is a monitor here, but I do not understand well 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:13.560
 Reset to button 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:16.720
 There is a center button here and there is a radio wave 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.160
 Spared when you visit 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.160
 Here at the watch 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:31.820
 Although there is to say competing for date time combined because this radio clock 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.650
 If you receive an emper with the center of gravity radio clock 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.270
 I will do it myself 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.810
 Because 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:45.260
 You only need to set the time for this alarm 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:48.659
 You can set the ram time by long-pressing the forward / back button here 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:54.560
 For example, now it is ten o'clock 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.560
 With continued towards the return will change in such a feeling 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:02.310
 When I hear it climb 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.310
 It is the smallest mode now, but it looks like this 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.530
 It's like this in the middle 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.430
 It is such a feeling if it is the super largest sound 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.700
 It is so loud 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.890
 Well if this alarm 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.250
 To say and not wake up in the morning is 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.220
 It is not 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.210
 No matter how low your blood pressure is 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.210
 I think you notice 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.880
 It is not a top and bottom introduction disaster prevention statement 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.090
 Because it is a sound like this 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.390
 Issue in the public facilities 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.040
 things and 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.630
 In the sound that passed 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.760
 Something 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.760
 I think that happens in the sense of 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.280
 If Wakere say that was the alarm of introduction
