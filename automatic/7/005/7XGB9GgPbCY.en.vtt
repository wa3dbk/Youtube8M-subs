00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.350
 I'm going to give a review of what I 

00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:09.080
 I have an idea, so I'll give you a 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.110
 revised give a right pass then 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.839
 I started to explain to you that the whole 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:19.130
 articulation of the truth of what is the 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:21.320
 articulation is when I'm going to join bones to 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.570
 are here in this example of 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.760
 shoulder joint 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.750
 I have two articulated bones which is a 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.690
 number and escape and then I said what 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:37.700
 for me and this one of yours had a 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:41.560
 soft tissue structure is that it is the 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:45.380
 joint capsule then all this here รณ 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:49.190
 closing the knee here is the 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:52.610
 joint capsule to joint capsule 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.890
 She's going to have two memories. 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.980
 so I can see here this one 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.160
 The membrane I see on the outside is 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.610
 fibrous membrane was then formed by 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.460
 fibrous tissue and it gives resistance 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:12.260
 in team bones union 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.870
 when I pick up and look inside 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.630
 so now I will watch for them're 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:22.010
 seeing this fabric here 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:25.340
 This membrane here is this here is the 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.620
 synovial membrane that it is 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.260
 within're 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:35.720
 and it is this one that makes possible what there is 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:38.360
 the application of the synovial fluid I spoke 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.260
 she's going to filter it's going to be going 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.260
 serve as a pity a filter then there 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.870
 I'll have a synovial fluid here should 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.880
 okay then I had explained it right here 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:56.659
 of the membrane fibrous membrane 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:58.280
 not in the note classifying the 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.990
 articulation as to the type of tissue 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.000
 fibrous is only the future 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.420
 What I'm saying here is the capsule. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.140
 articulate it has the fibrous membrane and 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.310
 synovial membrane inside there I come 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.060
 I also explained what when I get 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.410
 two partners 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.410
 now I pick up the bones 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.180
 Only then, when I get it, it's just me. 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.680
 I'm going to both like that I have to 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.330
 knee situation 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.709
 the phenomena if observed looks at the coloration 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.319
 of bone 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.100
 only when it articulates with the 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.670
 sharing 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.250
 he changes his face with prayer because the 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.580
 I've been covering this part of the 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:47.750
 bone that will be in the joint is a 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:51.769
 cartilage which is the articular cartilage 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:56.360
 this piece I can see then O 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.769
 here the darker is a bone and that more 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.190
 white here 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.769
 is the cartilage then all the south in a 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.820
 articulation with the eleven who will 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:12.410
 circular will be covered by cartilage 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:14.630
 articulating the bone itself is the 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.840
 that it is called surface 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:21.049
 joining the joint surface is the 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:26.620
 articular bone cartilage what it covers 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:29.650
 the bone then promises a joint 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.720
 complete up to the joint capsule 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.600
 bone and cartilage 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.130
 I will observe here within the 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.220
 inside the joint 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.160
 He'll have a cavity if I get it. 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.540
 This knee here, you see that he is 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.709
 calculated in 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.569
 it has a quality because this 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.269
 charity because I have to have a 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.519
 synovial fluid, so that's why I 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.250
 I will have this quality and that this 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:01.030
 quality will be called cavity 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.030
 articulate 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:08.870
 in the joint cavity which is what 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:13.490
 inside the joint that is what goes 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:16.310
 contain or synovial fluids in the court I 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.140
 I can see the then I have a 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.700
 here frontal cut 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:25.070
 I can see the number and the part 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.720
 of the bone here costs us right? 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.830
 and here I can see that he has a 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.740
 quality is also this quality here 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.230
 then this is the joint cavity 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:39.020
 that any joint that has movement 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.970
 she will have this quality of then 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.970
 consequently to single joints 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:49.510
 normal because the twin booklets 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.510
 fibrous 90 and in that capacity 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.130
 see only 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.210
 besides I have the joint capsule 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.690
 bonding the bones 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.540
 only the capsule does not give resistance with straight 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:08.300
 so what I do I'm going to put 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:10.970
 structures of fibrous tissue that 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.730
 the joint capsule so that it 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.750
 will give more resistance to this 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.180
 articulation 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:21.590
 these structures that I place are 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.940
 called ligaments and then I'm going to have three 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.310
 types of ligament 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.280
 The first ligament I'm going to have is 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.410
 O this drug here that is taking 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:35.630
 on his knee he 'll be fine here in the 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:38.710
 front is the capsular ligament because it 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:42.410
 I start going down this piece here 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.090
 for me to be able to open the capsule 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.020
 articulate I have to cut this 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.300
 ligament 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:51.320
 then it means that the capsular ligament 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:53.540
 he's is exploited it is along with the 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:57.320
 joint capsule so that it is the 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.790
 capsule ligament is an example of 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.730
 capsular ligament is that here is the 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:06.669
 patellar ligament that here is 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:09.770
 I can get old that will connect the capsule 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:11.260
 It is an example of native ligament 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.370
 capsule is this medicine 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:17.830
 by then besides that I have ligaments 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:21.700
 What are these extracapsular extracts? 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:24.190
 the entire joint capsule and I do not 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:27.940
 need to damage the ligament 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:31.390
 then they are only put out into the possession 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.430
 it was a feint so I'm going to have it 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.620
 knee joint is an example of 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:42.940
 I will have two ligaments extracapsular es 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:44.260
 one medial and one lateral 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:47.500
 then these are the ligaments 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:51.100
 extracapsular that the then definition are 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:54.910
 ligaments placed outside the capsule 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:59.640
 such as ligaments 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:07:06.280
 the medial collateral ligament 

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:08.890
 and the regular collateral ligament in the 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:12.160
 old and another getting in jail in the queue 

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:15.880
 the collateral is then eth- 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:19.570
 regular collateral and some 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:25.300
 joints in addition to disconnections will 

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:27.820
 present ligaments in there they will 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:32.200
 ligaments within the 

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:33.940
 knee joint they are called 

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:37.330
 of cruciate ligaments 

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:39.430
 the posterior cross- crusader is 

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:42.670
 so here I'm looking in the front 

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:47.170
 flexing knee and here I look back 

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:50.710
 then what is the ultra ligament 

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:53.940
 capsule that lies within the 

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:58.390
 joints and will also join the bones 

00:07:53.940 --> 00:08:01.600
 inside then are these three types of 

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:09.240
 medicines that exist or capsulate or 

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:09.240
 extracapsular and one capsule're
