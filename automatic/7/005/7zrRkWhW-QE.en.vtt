00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.820 
so far we were taking the best of
Android<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.210> basically<00:00:12.900> optimizing<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.679> for

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
Android and basically optimizing it for

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.560 
Android and basically optimizing it for
all<00:00:13.950> devices<00:00:14.099> including<00:00:14.820> tablets<00:00:14.880> we<00:00:15.480> were

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
all devices including tablets we were

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.029 
all devices including tablets we were
off<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:15.960> great<00:00:16.170> start<00:00:16.320> fights<00:00:16.830> cream

sandwich<00:00:17.400> but<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:18.000> wasn't<00:00:18.330> nearly<00:00:18.510> far<00:00:18.869> enough

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
sandwich but it wasn't nearly far enough

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.960 
sandwich but it wasn't nearly far enough
so<00:00:19.289> we<00:00:19.470> put<00:00:19.710> android<00:00:20.039> under<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.670> microscope

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
so we put android under the microscope

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.810 
so we put android under the microscope
in<00:00:21.359> android<00:00:21.750> 4.1<00:00:22.170> jelly<00:00:22.859> bean<00:00:22.949> that's<00:00:23.310> name<00:00:23.550> we

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
in android 4.1 jelly bean that's name we

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.250
