00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:09.190
 our partner with anv and the week 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:11.340
 last went to a fight in monclova 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.340
 Coahuila 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:17.910
 who accompanied him in that fight 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:23.660
 reclaim 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:28.050
 pierre with the son of piero the symbol 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:32.460
 big neurosis and I think he was out there 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.180
 golden boy I think do not believe it to me I must 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.580
 confirm a bit later 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.360
 and when it was carrying out the 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:45.660
 shower in one of the 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:49.680
 classic situations that arise 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:54.920
 when the adrenaline runs through the body 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:59.659
 with anv and the third rope goes up 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.440
 is thrown from the top of three 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:05.810
 meters and a half can be 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.960
 and when he goes in flight 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.580
 the fighters that should wait for it 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.020
 good wait 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.310
 they stand aside 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.220
 and when they step aside with anv and 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.390
 falls off 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.660
 I think on the pavement because it 's a 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.240
 cement that is there there are no tables like 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.550
 in other arenas where you throw yourself 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.160
 outside the ring and there is a table that 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.340
 cushion your fall a bit in this case 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:42.799
 with anv and you see 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:46.530
 in the scene that goes flying and lands 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:49.230
 giving a blow to the knee giving 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.800
 a blow to the head 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:57.120
 the son of the ninja who is an expert in 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:01.100
 this wrestling world told me by 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.100
 whatsapp that had slipped 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.590
 that was the problem with with anv and that 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.979
 slips the moment you go up to the 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:15.180
 third string and on impulse it seems 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:18.209
 to be skated and that causes not 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.030
 arrive or not go to the place where 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.560
 I had to fall 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:28.030
 for me those are more forced part 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.360
 of the child of the child trying 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.540
 d 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.220
 lighten the pulp of those who should 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.090
 be down 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.290
 I have the images 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:45.230
 of what happened in monclova in this fight 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.569
 I'm going to ask the public to analyze 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.459
 all the situation 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.530
 because a lot of people through networks 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.859
 Social has sent me many messages 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.730
 saying that this program and that what 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:00.720
 I say is 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.260
 with a game tone 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.180
 if I accept that this is a show if not the 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.189
 Carmela would not come like Carmela 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.550
 doing to tuntÃºn would not come as dad 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:15.990
 of pilot 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:20.220
 like the mariachi they all come in handy 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:23.020
 handsome only you stayed 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.240
 like in the coffin 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.950
 a little bit of the 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:32.700
 work work 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:35.410
 Well, it's a show but in the show 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.580
 Well, there are also things 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:43.000
 serious that we should attend then in that 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:46.390
 tone because we are talking about health 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.550
 from one of our colleagues for me 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:53.770
 talking about konami is talking about one of the 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:57.010
 bigger 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.670
 of the program and wrestling and 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:04.270
 trajectory I think if there's someone who 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:08.710
 it deserves a recognition a respect 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:12.790
 for all it means is konami 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:17.290
 for me with andy it's a great great 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.090
 fighter despite his 65 years old 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.850
 69 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.580
 still 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.940
 they are delivered in the ring of that 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.140
 way and that 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.140
 it is to be admired
