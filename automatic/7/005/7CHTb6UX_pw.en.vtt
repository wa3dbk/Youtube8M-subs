00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello very good to all and welcome to

 my channel here 2 the gamer let's see today 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.919
 a video game that looks very good 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.260
 and I like it very much because nothing else 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.540
 and nothing less than 'jurassic park' of the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.480
 creators of the also famous the 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.850
 walking dead so please let's 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.760
 try and start a game this 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.699
 It must be the tenth attempt I make 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.300
 to be able to record this first episode 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.890
 I will comment 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.570
 do not worry about this game you already have 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.240
 seen on another channel if you already have 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.040
 played because you're also going to have to 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.649
 understand that it's like a movie 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.420
 interactive voucher makes you sit down with 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.309
 some popcorn with something that you like 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.399
 eat a lot and we will enjoy this 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.410
 video game will come as a video 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.890
 secondary although today this presentation 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.010
 be it at the usual time and the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.350
 next way monday tuesday friday and 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.820
 Saturday will be on the channel as a video 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.960
 secondary this means that what 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.340
 I'll go up early at three-thirty something 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.340
 well now peninsular 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.400
 for a while 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.040
 and then later, in the afternoon, a normal video 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.320
 from minecraft crap pokemon watch to 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.240
 see what I play with pokemon reindeer the 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.310
 I want to quickly say that I am 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.049
 waiting because there is a month left for 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.150
 come out the complete cube so I'm going to 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.550
 wait that month to be able to resume it 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.869
 from scratch it's worth it because if I do not go 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.119
 to play it and I'm going to have to go back to 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.970
 play it in a month so I'm going 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.040
 to do this way this series will give 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.960
 more or less for a month I'm going to do it 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.119
 all of the flip with a duration 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.550
 estimated about 30 minutes to those of 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.289
 here how many people like 'jurassic park' 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.990
 I love me I want to read the first 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:44.390
 book because I have not done it yet 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.220
 let's put ourselves in situation I repeat 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.530
 as a secondary life this is not going to remove 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:54.310
 nothing island when cloudy 120 miles west 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.310
 from costa rica 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.830
 I think it's our protagonist and this 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.620
 ok with the cursor ok 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.200
 I'm not learning how to modeling 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.010
 What do I have to do? I think I'm going to 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.850
 eat between seconds no please no 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.850
 die is so soon 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.790
 it's a little badly wounded 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.080
 velociraptor noises are excellent 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.150
 bloom use the cursor keys 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.450
 to find objects and click on them 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.450
 valdÃ©s 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.530
 there is something 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.420
 look I think they are the raptors can 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.540
 be released not always because I 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.800
 how are they all going to eat me 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.640
 pick up stones 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.640
 I will take 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.049
 and is that if I fail then I give myself a blow or 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.790
 anything can happen and that 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.790
 kill or anything 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.110
 no no 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.890
 or the mouse for the case the goal is 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.890
 stabilize your mind 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.430
 barea 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.450
 if it goes a little pull do not worry is 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.960
 normal in this beginning of the game worth 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.520
 host 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.650
 some keys require pressing a 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.850
 sequence of keys to complete it 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.840
 exact voucher 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.840
 my mother 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.000
 either the left as only 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:56.700
 is backwards good girl then now 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.209
 well right and back very well 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.209
 today 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.950
 now you have to keep that pressed 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.689
 we are / well I know it's a bit 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.390
 different play a game like that but good 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:10.239
 as more or less it's going to be like watching a 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.800
 movie 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:17.230
 mother 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.230
 that we are going to die the protagonist 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:30.440
 and he can regulate there 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:35.830
 you are not by density so fast 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.830
 not so fast very well here 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.460
 girl 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.260
 but then completed gold rank very well 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.010
 of gold rank I have completed without dying 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.010
 I still not believe it 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.220
 Now that's worth it with the mouse or that a 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.340
 bit weird is the first time I play the 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.340
 true 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.570
 the days is complicated and over 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.570
 it makes the computer dumb 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.390
 it shows that it is not lara croft and that 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.500
 you are prepared in a car and finally 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.500
 we are going to save ourselves from this 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.840
 this 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:30.560
 hello no no no of valentine 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.560
 you tell him now 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.449
 I run over 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:41.990
 that is, it just fell from an altitude of 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:44.889
 nador I just ran away from dinosaur and 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.889
 I get hit by a car 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:52.550
 before that day 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.260
 and the music of the soundtrack always 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.850
 It is beautiful and I love what is yours 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.160
 that we will have preferred my shelter 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.710
 ex I love him and this is true of small 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:04.630
 I loved the t-rex above all things and 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.630
 I hate him spinosaurio the rival 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.290
 if it's a great sight to see where the 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.160
 dinosaurs should have third 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.160
 actor there to be able 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.949
 dix 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.330
 two 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.670
 to see 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.920
 and if it is no longer 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.050
 I think it leaving this chapter 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.880
 over here because I wanted it especially 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.850
 so he could see more or less as 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.970
 now we are entering another type of 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.800
 situation 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.270
 then I would like also who 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.830
 want to see the series with me that I go back to 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.990
 repeat will be Monday, Tuesday, Friday and 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:53.140
 Saturday as a secondary video this is not going 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:55.210
 to remove anything and prefer to prefer that 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.970
 the texts as they just came out now I 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.490
 read them out loud or listen to them 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.710
 English and you can read it with the 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.460
 subtitles you tell me and I already 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.440
 I do vale 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.410

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.330

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:13.180

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.370
 I lost control of the command just 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:23.710
 xbox and they are games that I think we are 

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:26.050
 to play them just like that with that fluency 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.490
 ok but this game yes I want it 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.560

 park not having very good reviews 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.430
 this game but anyway anyway to me
