Conservancy first came you know we were

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.279 
Conservancy first came you know we were
glad<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.950> have<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.519> help<00:00:14.670> with<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.000> weeds<00:00:15.289> and

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
glad to have to help with the weeds and

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.990 
glad to have to help with the weeds and

things but it was it was a very
untrusting<00:00:18.750> relationship<00:00:19.500> by<00:00:19.859> working

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
untrusting relationship by working

different projects they've realized that

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.849 
different projects they've realized that
we<00:00:24.210> really<00:00:24.240> valued<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.960> ranching<00:00:25.380> community

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
we really valued the ranching community

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.040 
we really valued the ranching community
and<00:00:26.250> we<00:00:26.400> want<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.730> keep<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.119> ranchers<00:00:27.510> on<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
and we want to keep the ranchers on the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.380 
and we want to keep the ranchers on the
land<00:00:28.260> because<00:00:29.010> they<00:00:29.130> understand<00:00:30.000> how<00:00:30.090> this

keep doing what they've been doing for
multiple<00:00:43.020> generations<00:00:43.440> but<00:00:43.890> prevent<00:00:44.430> the

multiple generations but prevent the

future subdivision and fragmentation of
those<00:00:47.610> ranches<00:00:48.059> we<00:00:49.050> want<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.379> landscape<00:00:49.890> to

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.660 
be as healthy as possible for our future
generations<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.180> we<00:00:54.300> manage<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.809> for<00:00:55.020> that

of<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.850> wildlife<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.990> have<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.439> graze<00:01:52.649> the

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
of the wildlife you have to graze the

of the wildlife you have to graze the
riparian<00:01:53.159> zones<00:01:53.520> it's<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.970> matter<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.270> you

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
riparian zones it's just a matter of you

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.170 
riparian zones it's just a matter of you
you<00:01:54.960> need<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.189> do<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.340> like<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.610> Buffalo<00:01:56.939> used

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
you need to do it like the Buffalo used

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.280 
you need to do it like the Buffalo used
to<00:01:57.270> do<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.600> have<00:01:57.750> them<00:01:57.899> there<00:01:58.049> real

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
to do it and have them there real

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.620 
to do it and have them there real
quickly<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.799> then<00:01:58.890> gone<00:01:59.210> grazing<00:02:00.210> also

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
quickly and then gone grazing also

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.780 
quickly and then gone grazing also

four<00:02:06.740> kinds<00:02:07.009> of<00:02:07.100> habitats<00:02:07.579> certain<00:02:08.420> birds

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
four kinds of habitats certain birds

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.630 
four kinds of habitats certain birds
like<00:02:08.810> long-billed<00:02:09.470> curlews<00:02:10.069> like<00:02:10.250> to<00:02:10.429> nest

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
like long-billed curlews like to nest

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.160 
like long-billed curlews like to nest
where<00:02:10.879> there's<00:02:11.030> very<00:02:11.330> little<00:02:11.540> covered<00:02:11.989> where

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
where there's very little covered where

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.229 
where there's very little covered where
it's<00:02:12.530> pretty<00:02:12.860> much<00:02:12.980> grazed<00:02:13.370> down<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.970> golf

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
it's pretty much grazed down to golf

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.839 
it's pretty much grazed down to golf
course<00:02:14.569> height<00:02:15.040> whereas<00:02:16.040> sandhill<00:02:16.489> cranes

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
course height whereas sandhill cranes

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.690 
course height whereas sandhill cranes
prefer<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:18.140> taller<00:02:18.410> grass<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:19.220> so<00:02:19.400> if<00:02:19.519> we're

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
prefer the taller grass and so if we're

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.790 
prefer the taller grass and so if we're
managing<00:02:20.000> without<00:02:20.450> grazing<00:02:21.170> we<00:02:21.290> really<00:02:21.590> are

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
managing without grazing we really are

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.979 
managing without grazing we really are
missing<00:02:22.280> half<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.580> habitat<00:02:23.180> that<00:02:23.360> we<00:02:23.480> need<00:02:23.690> to

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
missing half the habitat that we need to

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.860 
missing half the habitat that we need to
support<00:02:24.290> these<00:02:24.470> two<00:02:24.680> really<00:02:24.860> important<00:02:25.370> birds

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
support these two really important birds

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.119 
support these two really important birds
just<00:02:26.870> like<00:02:27.019> we<00:02:27.170> want<00:02:27.349> our<00:02:27.440> cattle<00:02:27.799> to<00:02:27.920> flow

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
just like we want our cattle to flow

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.589 
just like we want our cattle to flow
across<00:02:28.250> this<00:02:28.640> landscape<00:02:28.910> we<00:02:29.269> want<00:02:29.480> the

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
across this landscape we want the

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.330

antelope and elk and everything else to
flow<00:02:31.549> across<00:02:31.670> because<00:02:32.180> it's<00:02:32.599> just<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:32.930> really<00:02:33.379> a

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
flow across because it's just a really a

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.890 
flow across because it's just a really a
mobile<00:02:33.860> composting<00:02:34.610> unit<00:02:34.940> that<00:02:35.120> transfers

mobile composting unit that transfers

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.509 
mobile composting unit that transfers
minerals<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:36.650> nutrients<00:02:36.980> all<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.340> way

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
across this landscape of course we

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.100 
across this landscape of course we
always<00:02:40.190> enjoy<00:02:40.610> seeing<00:02:40.640> wildlife<00:02:41.299> you<00:02:41.989> know

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110

would be it looked a lot like it looks

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.610 
would be it looked a lot like it looks
now<00:03:11.690> with<00:03:12.170> fewer<00:03:12.560> fences<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:14.230> yeah<00:03:15.230> pretty

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
now with fewer fences and yeah pretty
