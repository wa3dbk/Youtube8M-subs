00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.359
 and then personal youtube just looking and 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.120
 messi stock with a flashlight and a 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.040
 bike where I'll prepare good staff 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.240
 There was a person I do not know if you 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.490
 can see 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.379
 I think you will not see will 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.660
 having to turn off the light can see until 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.580
 a marquinha here marquinhas here 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.970
 O 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.340
 but horizontal markers on the screen of the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.070
 bike and one person got worried 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.289
 youngest girl she saw it here on the bike ge 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.100
 that it is because they do not pollute 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.350
 right to the screen because this is risk 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.480
 because we here I go 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.059
 show you are the sensors of 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.350
 Lilior sees the risks here I go. 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.360
 pay the 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.539
 I'm going to light the flashlight and I'll try 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.110
 show you here the risks that 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.570
 there are censors because as 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.149
 which works the screen to the screen actually 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.640
 You 're not playing an Lcd on the led 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.820
 on LED or LCD screen that I have the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.119
 equipment is playing a movie. 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.520
 next comes before a layer before 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.939
 the film that when you 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.790
 she touches has an electric charge and 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.530
 he knows when you touch it the x and y one 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.740
 where you 're playing and you know that 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.409
 point there is how it works to the screens 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.170
 different from that of the resistive 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.240
 you had to press to know x or 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.360
 and by resisting working with two 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.750
 layers when you push a layer 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:37.110
 joining the resistive with the other so 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.180
 resistive and capacitive 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.869
 What you do is capacitive you just 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.790
 to touch her she passes a load 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.579
 electromagnetic and knows there in that place 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.740
 Where are you touching the screen? 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.619
 understood then he has an x ​​and an y and he 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.780
 a dog of some say magnetic field that 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.140
 generates a magnetic field in that 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.500
 region due to the fear that it induces 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.810
 Neither do you know what is 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.960
 I'm going to turn off that light in that region. 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.690
 okay and I'll show you around like that 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.099
 are the sensors of good reaction lines 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.140
 on the horizontal 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.910
 you look 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.940
 if that was not the one I'm going to light 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.970
 Here the antenna in lantern 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:30.840
 O my, if I can show you 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:31.860
 Also there are also rosées in these lines 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.380
 here o 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.520
 are all personal sensors are the 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.410
 sensors that have the phone 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.959
 So every corner of that there you 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:49.170
 You see there every corner of this 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.750
 type a marcelo a coordinate that 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.310
 it is here where dirt is here 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.480
 but myself here in that part that the 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.780
 dirt 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:03.900
 My god, now, it's for those who do not know it. 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:05.610
 ó could show you I 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.660
 I was able to show or not 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.670
 here we have the we have the sensors 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.640
 here I'm afraid will not give it to girl 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.410
 right side we have the oled but here I 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.310
 wanted to show you one of the see that only 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:23.549
 with a sun here, you see there it is open 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.440
 what's on the bike x which is white background 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.299
 white buffet you can see this 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.269
 here more clearly 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.200
 but what I had to show you 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:37.530
 here o 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.340
 these lines here are the sale of these 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.160
 lines 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.940
 they represent that they are 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.150
 touch they know eye has to pick up 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:52.110
 If you had or the angulation here to show 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.880
 for you even more sometimes the camera 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:04:03.000
 she did not focus on personal law 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:04.470
 Let us then ask the question of the user who 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.470
 wrote this 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.780
 Oh you can see are several lines I 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.070
 I have an hour that I can get legal. 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.070
 It's here to show you. 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.650
 good 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.390
 there is not and I will not succeed but it is 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.550
 important that at the beginning of the video I 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:34.240
 I got to show you guys on the weekends. 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.220
 forró lines 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.240
 the lines will be near the led here 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:43.120
 There's my finger here, see you then. 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.890
 these are the sensors that run through 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.400
 all the screen 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:50.080
 So this is a lot here. 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.410
 I'll leave the flashlight 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.260
 lit here because the Lusa now this is 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.400
 a feature of the engine and the bike gp 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:03.880
 and I do not remember if I had this or not 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.680
 and it's cool here you can see a lot 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.930
 a little 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.520
 if you call there they practically 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.100
 disappear because it has light 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.740
 Do not you realize you'll realize when 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.230
 hit a very strong light on the screen that 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:23.500
 you will realize that he has chances 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:27.100
 these wine sensors there is no risk are 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.500
 the touch screen tank sensors and the 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.960
 motor or in general the person spoke 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.210
 To me there, in the e-mail that you sent me. 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.830
 Send all worried, will you? 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:41.440
 problems is that normal is normal 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.840
 It's not normal, and it would not be our team. 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.710
 be a risk only here but how are they? 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.169
 various 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.910
 then it seems likely that they are the 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.660
 personal touch sensors then this will 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:56.490
 you like the OSCE joinha leaves message 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.490
 Thank you and even more people spoke
