00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
reality of a real submarine there's a

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.760 
reality of a real submarine there's a
sense<00:02:59.610> of<00:02:59.850> scale<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.450> scope<00:03:00.720> with<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.590> real

sense of scale and scope with the real
submarine<00:03:02.070> we<00:03:02.489> really<00:03:02.880> left<00:03:03.060> it<00:03:03.300> as<00:03:03.720> it<00:03:03.959> is

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
submarine we really left it as it is

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.530 
submarine we really left it as it is
because<00:03:04.620> it's<00:03:04.800> just<00:03:04.980> an<00:03:05.100> amazing<00:03:05.760> structure

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
because it's just an amazing structure

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.660 
because it's just an amazing structure
with<00:03:06.840> fantastic<00:03:07.230> sort<00:03:07.739> of<00:03:07.800> detail<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.220> you

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
with fantastic sort of detail you you

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.949 
with fantastic sort of detail you you
really<00:03:08.940> wouldn't<00:03:09.120> want<00:03:09.270> to<00:03:09.330> touch<00:03:09.510> that

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
really wouldn't want to touch that

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.770 
really wouldn't want to touch that
but<00:03:10.650> it's<00:03:10.770> incredibly<00:03:11.550> complicated<00:03:12.270> and

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
but it's incredibly complicated and

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.680 
but it's incredibly complicated and
difficult<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.470> shoot<00:03:13.650> on<00:03:13.799> a<00:03:13.830> real<00:03:14.040> submarine

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
difficult to shoot on a real submarine

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.199 
difficult to shoot on a real submarine
finding<00:03:15.690> new<00:03:16.019> angles<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.070> just<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.670> physical

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
finding new angles and just the physical

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.150 
finding new angles and just the physical
proximity<00:03:18.360> of<00:03:18.780> allowing<00:03:19.410> each<00:03:19.530> other<00:03:19.769> space

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
proximity of allowing each other space

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.699 
proximity of allowing each other space
to<00:03:20.400> move<00:03:20.549> around<00:03:20.730> is<00:03:21.239> really<00:03:21.600> grueling<00:03:21.900> shoot

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
to move around is really grueling shoot

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.199 
to move around is really grueling shoot
it<00:03:22.830> on<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.070> sub<00:03:23.280> definitely<00:03:23.820> gives<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.180> a

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
it on the sub definitely gives you a

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.610 
it on the sub definitely gives you a
little<00:03:24.480> bit<00:03:24.660> of<00:03:24.780> that<00:03:24.900> feeling<00:03:25.470> of

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
little bit of that feeling of

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.759 
little bit of that feeling of
claustrophobia<00:03:26.360> so<00:03:27.360> they<00:03:27.989> learned<00:03:28.530> how

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
claustrophobia so they learned how

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.350 
claustrophobia so they learned how
difficult<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:29.340> is<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.459> walk<00:03:29.700> past<00:03:30.000> each<00:03:30.150> other

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
difficult it is to walk past each other

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.720 
difficult it is to walk past each other
how<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:30.600> bump<00:03:30.930> your<00:03:31.019> head<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.440> whole<00:03:31.560> time
