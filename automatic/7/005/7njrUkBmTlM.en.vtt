00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
the lid and this is where we're going to

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.050 
the lid and this is where we're going to
start<00:00:04.410> out<00:00:04.589> with<00:00:04.620> our<00:00:04.770> really<00:00:05.190> metallic

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
start out with our really metallic

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.570 
start out with our really metallic
silver<00:00:06.359> now<00:00:07.109> then<00:00:07.230> we<00:00:07.319> put<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.560> base<00:00:07.950> on<00:00:08.250> and

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
silver now then we put the base on and

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.709 
silver now then we put the base on and
we<00:00:08.639> have<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.790> nice<00:00:08.910> palette<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.360> work<00:00:09.540> with

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
we have a nice palette to work with

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.749 
we have a nice palette to work with
we're<00:00:10.260> really<00:00:10.410> going<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.620> pile<00:00:10.920> on<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.250> silver

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
we're really going to pile on the silver

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.789 
we're really going to pile on the silver
because<00:00:12.150> silver<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.719> bright<00:00:13.170> but<00:00:13.200> it's<00:00:13.650> not

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
because silver is bright but it's not

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.410 
because silver is bright but it's not
dark<00:00:14.099> so<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:14.490> really<00:00:14.969> don't<00:00:15.059> have<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.299> be

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
dark so you really don't have to be

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.720 
dark so you really don't have to be
afraid<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.780> putting<00:00:16.529> on<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.800> lot<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.400> and

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
afraid of putting on a lot of it and

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.220 
afraid of putting on a lot of it and
we're<00:00:18.270> going<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.449> put<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.690> all<00:00:18.840> over<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.199> I
