actually the pretty much the same curl

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.719 
actually the pretty much the same curl
pattern<00:04:05.120> if<00:04:05.329> I<00:04:05.449> do<00:04:05.509> a<00:04:05.659> bantu<00:04:06.199> knot<00:04:06.409> out<00:04:06.439> and<00:04:06.979> I

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.499 
don't really have the 30 in my hair
anymore<00:04:09.769> but<00:04:10.519> it<00:04:10.669> still<00:04:10.939> will<00:04:11.090> blend<00:04:11.389> very

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:11.509 
anymore but it still will blend very
