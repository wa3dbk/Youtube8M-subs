we go
has<00:00:24.570> like<00:00:24.810> nice<00:00:25.080> little<00:00:25.320> road<00:00:25.590> sound<00:00:25.920> in<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
has like nice little road sound in the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.830 
has like nice little road sound in the
beginning<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.910> mean<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.359> chords<00:00:27.599> are<00:00:27.689> easy

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
beginning and I mean the chords are easy

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.540 
beginning and I mean the chords are easy
but<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.349> figured<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.769> just<00:00:28.800> might<00:00:29.099> as<00:00:29.220> well<00:00:29.310> do<00:00:29.519> it

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
but I figured I just might as well do it

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.730 
but I figured I just might as well do it
because<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.150> always<00:00:31.080> like<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.320> look<00:00:31.500> for<00:00:31.560> a

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
before you could even add the F if you

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.180 
before you could even add the F if you
want<00:03:55.760> because<00:03:56.180> F<00:03:56.930> is<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.379> same<00:03:57.590> and<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.010> left
