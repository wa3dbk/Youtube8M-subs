belt<00:02:05.200> it<00:02:05.380> matches<00:02:05.799> this<00:02:06.130> which<00:02:06.369> is<00:02:06.520> really

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
belt it matches this which is really

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.749 
belt it matches this which is really
cool<00:02:06.999> but<00:02:07.899> um<00:02:08.110> just<00:02:08.800> so<00:02:08.920> I'd<00:02:08.979> left<00:02:09.190> there<00:02:09.429> and

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
cool but um just so I'd left there and

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.880 
cool but um just so I'd left there and

the<00:03:45.940> flash<00:03:46.210> is<00:03:46.420> not<00:03:46.570> going<00:03:46.750> to<00:03:46.810> bother<00:03:46.930> because

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
the flash is not going to bother because

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.560 
the flash is not going to bother because
it<00:03:47.410> has<00:03:47.530> a<00:03:47.560> black<00:03:48.220> ring<00:03:48.670> on<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.030> inside<00:03:49.330> here

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
it has a black ring on the inside here

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.420 
it has a black ring on the inside here
so<00:03:50.020> it<00:03:50.140> makes<00:03:50.290> it<00:03:50.440> so<00:03:50.680> it<00:03:50.830> doesn't<00:03:50.860> do<00:03:51.250> that

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
so it makes it so it doesn't do that

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.920 
so it makes it so it doesn't do that
yeah<00:03:51.730> I've<00:03:51.880> haven't<00:03:52.240> had<00:03:52.330> any<00:03:52.450> problems<00:03:52.480> with
