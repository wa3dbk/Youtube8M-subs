green shades um so I was super excited
about<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:50.399> because<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.729> don't<00:01:50.880> have<00:01:50.939> any<00:01:51.180> of

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
about this because I don't have any of

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.700 
about this because I don't have any of
these<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.570> think<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.840> have<00:01:51.990> ransom<00:01:52.380> already

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
these I think I have ransom already

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.770 
these I think I have ransom already
which<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.850> purple<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.390> guess<00:01:54.539> I<00:01:54.630> can

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
which is the purple and I guess I can

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.740 
which is the purple and I guess I can
show<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.140> one<00:01:55.320> now<00:01:55.789> but<00:01:56.789> there<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.630> is

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
show you that one now but there this is

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.830

a<00:01:57.780> size<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.380> haven't<00:01:58.679> used<00:01:58.770> them<00:01:58.950> yet<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.840> i'm

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
a size I haven't used them yet and i'm

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.529 
a size I haven't used them yet and i'm
going<00:02:01.109> to<00:02:01.200> do<00:02:01.320> swatches<00:02:01.859> so<00:02:02.039> that<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.670> the

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
going to do swatches so that is the

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.039 
going to do swatches so that is the
purple<00:02:03.960> it's<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.130> really<00:02:05.520> nice<00:02:06.030> purple<00:02:06.659> shade

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
purple it's a really nice purple shade

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.680 
purple it's a really nice purple shade
and<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.340> obviously<00:02:08.460> blend<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.030> out<00:02:09.149> right

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
and you can obviously blend it out right

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.930 
and you can obviously blend it out right
now<00:02:09.869> before<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.470> sets<00:02:10.710> once<00:02:10.979> it's<00:02:11.190> set<00:02:11.370> it's
