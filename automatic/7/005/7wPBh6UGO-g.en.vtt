little skirt in this really pretty peach
color<00:01:43.409> but<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.159> thought<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.549> was<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:44.909> fun

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
color but I thought this was so fun

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.260 
color but I thought this was so fun
because<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.899> sequins<00:01:46.470> on<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.799> it's<00:01:47.729> not<00:01:48.030> a

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
because of the sequins on it it's not a

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.870 
because of the sequins on it it's not a
very<00:01:48.689> loud<00:01:49.110> or<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:49.799> your<00:01:49.920> face<00:01:50.189> sequence<00:01:50.670> it's

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
very loud or in your face sequence it's

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.910 
very loud or in your face sequence it's
kind<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.210> like<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.450> clear<00:01:51.899> sequence<00:01:52.409> but<00:01:52.649> it

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
kind of like a clear sequence but it

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.700 
kind of like a clear sequence but it
makes<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.790> skirt<00:01:54.149> look<00:01:54.360> really<00:01:54.720> cool<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.439> I
