know we used a little oil map just keep
it<00:02:25.989> separated<00:02:26.379> so<00:02:26.769> basically<00:02:27.099> what<00:02:27.189> we<00:02:27.280> do<00:02:27.430> now

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
it separated so basically what we do now

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.670 
it separated so basically what we do now
is<00:02:27.969> and<00:02:28.239> we<00:02:28.299> put<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:28.510> in<00:02:28.749> the<00:02:28.810> oven<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.560> then

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
is and we put that in the oven and then

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.860 
is and we put that in the oven and then
the<00:02:29.769> end<00:02:29.799> result<00:02:30.129> is<00:02:30.579> you're<00:02:31.420> going<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.599> put<00:02:31.780> it

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870
