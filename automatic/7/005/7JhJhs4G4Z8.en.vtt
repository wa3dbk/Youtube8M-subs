00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
about I guess something quite funny to

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.750 
about I guess something quite funny to
me<00:00:33.300> see<00:00:33.540> Zombo<00:00:34.020> which<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:35.070> believe<00:00:35.489> he's<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
me see Zombo which I believe he's the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.350 
me see Zombo which I believe he's the
gatekeeper<00:00:35.940> what<00:00:36.510> not<00:00:36.719> he's<00:00:37.380> just<00:00:37.860> like

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
gatekeeper what not he's just like

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.270 
gatekeeper what not he's just like
rampaging<00:00:39.360> into<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:40.320> fight<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.649> guess<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.129> what

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
rampaging into the fight I guess so what

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.310 
rampaging into the fight I guess so what
not<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.460> don't<00:00:41.610> know<00:00:41.760> what<00:00:41.820> was<00:00:42.300> up<00:00:42.570> with<00:00:42.930> him<00:00:43.290> I

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
not I don't know what was up with him I

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.990 
not I don't know what was up with him I
guess<00:00:43.739> he<00:00:43.890> doesn't<00:00:44.100> want<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.370> wait<00:00:44.520> around<00:00:44.640> and

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
guess he doesn't want to wait around and

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.700 
guess he doesn't want to wait around and
whatnot<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:45.930> thought<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.320> was<00:00:46.440> kind

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
whatnot so I thought that that was kind

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.670 
whatnot so I thought that that was kind
of<00:00:46.770> funny<00:00:47.039> um<00:00:47.719> Ichigo<00:00:48.719> trapped<00:00:49.140> inside<00:00:49.350> the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
of funny um Ichigo trapped inside the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.889 
of funny um Ichigo trapped inside the
thing<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.190> he's<00:00:50.640> going<00:00:50.879> crazy<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.750> don't

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.150 
thing and he's going crazy and I don't
know<00:00:51.989> if<00:00:52.079> he's<00:00:52.199> developing<00:00:52.680> some<00:00:52.890> sort<00:00:53.100> of

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
know if he's developing some sort of

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.130 
know if he's developing some sort of
awareness<00:00:53.460> or<00:00:54.000> what<00:00:54.270> because<00:00:54.570> he's<00:00:54.780> hearing

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140

obstacle that he's gonna overcome and

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.460 
obstacle that he's gonna overcome and
get<00:01:11.760> probably<00:01:12.270> even<00:01:12.450> stronger<00:01:12.720> by<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.110> because

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
get probably even stronger by it because

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.170 
get probably even stronger by it because
he's<00:01:13.619> trapped<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.250> gate<00:01:14.460> right<00:01:14.490> now<00:01:14.850> just

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180

problems<00:01:40.110> with<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.290> whole<00:01:40.380> grim<00:01:40.590> child

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
problems with the whole grim child

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.920 
problems with the whole grim child
theory<00:01:41.040> for<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.310> simple<00:01:41.549> fact<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.850> if<00:01:42.659> ha

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
theory for the simple fact that if ha

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.109 
theory for the simple fact that if ha
Tebow<00:01:43.200> got<00:01:43.470> whipped<00:01:44.280> up<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.670> dragged<00:01:44.909> away

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
Tebow got whipped up and dragged away

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.730 
Tebow got whipped up and dragged away
what<00:01:45.659> makes<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.899> think<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.110> Grimmjow<00:01:46.560> will

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
what makes you think that Grimmjow will

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.289 
what makes you think that Grimmjow will
stand<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.220> better<00:01:47.520> chance<00:01:47.670> because<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.180> know

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
stand a better chance because you know

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.660 
stand a better chance because you know
Grimmjow<00:01:48.659> was<00:01:48.899> always<00:01:49.079> weaker<00:01:49.439> now<00:01:49.920> i<00:01:50.310> guess

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
Grimmjow was always weaker now i guess

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.770 
Grimmjow was always weaker now i guess
he<00:01:50.820> could<00:01:50.970> have<00:01:51.000> powered<00:01:51.299> up<00:01:51.420> with<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
he could have powered up with in the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.630 
he could have powered up with in the
time<00:01:51.960> between<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.829> know<00:01:52.950> his<00:01:53.100> disappearance

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
time between you know his disappearance

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.700 
time between you know his disappearance
to<00:01:53.759> now<00:01:54.000> which<00:01:54.720> would<00:01:54.869> be<00:01:55.049> very<00:01:55.259> interesting

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
to now which would be very interesting

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.399 
to now which would be very interesting
to<00:01:55.740> see<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.549> if<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.060> Grimmjow<00:01:57.540> I'm<00:01:57.810> excited

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
to see so if it is Grimmjow I'm excited

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.050 
to see so if it is Grimmjow I'm excited
I<00:01:58.530> don't<00:01:58.740> think<00:01:59.130> it's<00:01:59.250> burned<00:01:59.430> out<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.880> might

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
I don't think it's burned out it might

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.330 
I don't think it's burned out it might
be<00:02:00.240> maybe<00:02:00.479> ichigo's<00:02:00.930> dad<00:02:01.170> or<00:02:01.740> somebody<00:02:02.009> else

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.340 
be maybe ichigo's dad or somebody else
I'm<00:02:02.549> betting<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.509> maybe<00:02:03.750> it's<00:02:03.930> ichigo's

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
I'm betting on that maybe it's ichigo's

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.499 
I'm betting on that maybe it's ichigo's
dad<00:02:04.649> but<00:02:04.920> we'll<00:02:05.100> see<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.939> know<00:02:06.060> as<00:02:06.240> either

ichigo's<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:07.079> or<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.409> would<00:02:07.500> be<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.590> crazy

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
ichigo's that or it would be a crazy

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.669 
ichigo's that or it would be a crazy
shock<00:02:08.220> grimmjow<00:02:09.030> if<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.629> don't<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.140> heard

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
see what happened with Chad in order he

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.460 
see what happened with Chad in order he
may<00:02:55.880> cause<00:02:56.360> Chad<00:02:56.600> was<00:02:56.720> like<00:02:56.810> missing<00:02:57.080> a<00:02:57.140> chunk

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
may cause Chad was like missing a chunk

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.020 
may cause Chad was like missing a chunk
of<00:02:57.530> his<00:02:57.620> arm<00:02:57.860> and<00:02:58.070> it<00:02:58.160> took<00:02:58.280> his<00:02:58.490> hip<00:02:58.700> I<00:02:58.910> was

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
of his arm and it took his hip I was

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.890 
of his arm and it took his hip I was
like<00:02:59.150> you<00:02:59.270> know<00:02:59.360> what's<00:02:59.540> going<00:02:59.660> on<00:02:59.780> with<00:02:59.870> that

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
like you know what's going on with that

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.780 
like you know what's going on with that
I<00:03:00.020> think<00:03:00.350> or<00:03:00.500> he<00:03:00.830> may<00:03:00.950> have<00:03:00.980> holes<00:03:01.340> in<00:03:01.490> her<00:03:01.580> to

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
I think or he may have holes in her to

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.940 
I think or he may have holes in her to
so<00:03:02.060> it's<00:03:02.840> Kirk<00:03:03.110> a<00:03:03.230> dead<00:03:03.440> as<00:03:03.620> well<00:03:03.740> that's

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
so it's Kirk a dead as well that's

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.410 
so it's Kirk a dead as well that's
another<00:03:04.070> question<00:03:04.340> is<00:03:04.730> Craig<00:03:04.970> either<00:03:05.180> because

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420
