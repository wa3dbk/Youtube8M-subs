 When he went to his house, the owner of the cartridge connected his family, and he placed a 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.979
 cartridge that they had never seen and where it was apparently in 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:36.039
 levels that there is not in any known mario this myth is not confirmed 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:39.989

 they will become a portable video game console that pretended to compete with the nintendo 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:52.909
 ds and the psp although it was actually a cover for a capital scam to 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.709

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:01.220
 tiger telemÃ¡tica was the company in charge of manufacturing the faith 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.850
 also and the truth is that the features of the video game console were

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.540
 and its global launch project would never happen after 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.019
 successive delays 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.170
 It was in the year 2006 when the tiger telematics company declared itself 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.989
 bankruptcy and how they were not canceled because of all the products are 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.499
 the company's accounts were not clear and the losses amounted to 210 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:38.879
 millions of dollars 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.469
 how was it possible 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:44.439
 because, in addition to the typical expenses, the development of 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:49.069

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.299
 unjustified payments and bank transfers to tax havens where the 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.039
 managers of the companies had their accounts the Swedish newspaper 

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:09.049

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.869
 directors of quismondo with the magic of living room and also stressed that many 

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:16.709
 they had been convicted earlier for different crimes of fraud 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.059
 blackmail fraud 

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:21.620
 blowing the cartridge 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.600
 blowing the cartridge is a ritual that many players have been doing 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.700
 for decades every time our game did not start by entering it into the 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:34.080
 videoconsola however it is not a recommended practice since the air 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.300
 wet that comes out of our mouth will slowly oxidize the drivers 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.280
 another option 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.740
 defended by many and also contraindicated in the manuals of 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.670
 nintendo is to use a cotton ball with a few drops of alcohol as it is a 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.940
 liquid to be evacuated before and leaves the cleanest surface perfect for 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.599
 the encysted goal 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.870
 but before resorting to these two options 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.000
 and if you want your cartridge to last much longer you can try to clean it with a 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.629
 ear swab 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:06.639
 well here ends the video I want to tell you that the contest has already started 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:07.849
