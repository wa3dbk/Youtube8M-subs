00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.060
 good 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.700
 We deeply regret that today we 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.610
 dawned with four dead in our 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.490
 city ​​means that in October respect 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.289
 last year we are worse this year than 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.510
 previous 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.130
 that means then that I with the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.590
 greater respect but with all the 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.110
 I demand forcefulness from Colonel 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.970
 benavides that he faces the 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.650
 citizenship and explain him the lord 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.140
 mayor what is happening 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.050
 because we from the administration 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.410
 municipal, the mayor has given 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.150
 the police everything they have been able to much 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.880
 before the problems arise 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.310
 I am already there to solve them with 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.170
 all the heart and with all the will 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.880
 we have made from the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.800
 municipal administration by 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.590
 clear instructions from the mayor 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.510
 all the support to the public force in 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.730
 special to the police that are the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.120
 responsible for citizen security 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.460
 this means that it can not be that today 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.280
 let's wake up with four dead and we have 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.829
 and we demand a concrete response to 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.209
 Mr. Colonel Benavides and of course 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:13.200
 some results absolutely 

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:14.399
 forceful 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.259
 Well, what I 'm asking the 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.360
 police are results we do not 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.009
 we can continue waiting like that, it works 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.090
 it works because we 're giving it all the 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.250
 tool and if it's not the police 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.719
 then who if we put a 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.240
 private security team are going to 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.679
 say paramilitaries well surely with 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.319
 justice for that is the police 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:35.250
 national projects that also respond 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:37.620
 to special situations a situation 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.050
 that had not been presented to us 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.900
 but in the same way I want to express to you 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.720
 which are isolated cases, that is, they are not 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.340
 cases that correlate we have a 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.570
 very good research by part of 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.030
 our research section we have 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.620
 he also offered a reward of up 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.440
 two million pesos to people 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:02.030
 provide us with valuable information for 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.860
 to be able to capture the authors of 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.570
 materials of these facts and also 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.090
 tell them that if they have actually 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.730
 presented is not the common denominator in 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.160
 the city and what are we doing all 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.890
 the plans programs so to avoid 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.640
 continue to increase this type of 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.640
 events 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.810
 no no
