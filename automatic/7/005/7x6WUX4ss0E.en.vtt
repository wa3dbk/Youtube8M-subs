 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.580
 video on my channel today I bring you the 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.300
 review of a very special book and that 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.610
 he has loved when he has read it and without 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.800
 doubt I appreciate everything a jewel and wanted 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.980
 share it with you this book is 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:25.760
 as you already know by the title of 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.760
 video would give you the world of jandy nelson 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.210
 I found this book a very book 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.089
 original and very out of the ordinary of what 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.170
 that we normally have in the literature 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:48.239
 youthful here in Spain so it has 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.089
 surprised for good at all 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.699
 aspects and I will tell you what it 's about 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.350
 a little bit would give you the world tells us 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.589
 the story of noa 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.979
 and jude both are twin brothers is not 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.359
 the boy and jude is the girl always 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:08.550
 they have always been very close 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:10.860
 but an event makes no separate 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.259
 physically but stop taking away 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.200
 as well as they take and they stop 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.000
 practically share your life to go 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.159
 every man for himself despite living 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.530
 under the same roof that story the 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.350
 we will know through two points of 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.159
 seen one in genoa in the past when 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.799
 they are 13 years old and even 14 and another in the 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.869
 present through it I do not have much 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.570
 more than telling you because really 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.320
 this story is to discover it 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.900
 without knowing almost nothing about her but 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.150
 if I'm going to tell you some little things that 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.890
 I liked it a lot, the first thing is that 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.660
 I loved how he writes and andy 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.000
 nelson is the first book I read of 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.880
 her but I've got my eye on 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.880
 another that is published in Spain and 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.710
 I hope to get it soon because I 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.570
 I have fallen in love with how he writes the point 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.450
 strong of this novel is not the story 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.759
 in itself that too but certainly the point 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.900
 strong are the characters especially 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.430
 for my taste 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.560
 noa noa is a boy of 13 years and good 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.770
 either 13 years old we are a little bit 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.080
 we do not know what we wanted or 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.690
 where are we going but nothing has enough 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.790
 of course that he wants to draw him 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.450
 I love to draw and I love how he draws 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.060
 in his head, living in art loves and 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.550
 It's very clear to me that he likes them 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.110
 the real guys never exploded 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.420
 administered homosexuals do not 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.610
 they stop against them if they are 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.950
 ideal and they are super cookies and they are 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.990
 normal people like others and for 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.510
 end in this novel I was found 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.120
 until he was very clear that he 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.090
 they like boys and that is very clear 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.340
 ideas and despite being 13 years old already 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.910
 I see that at last they are daring to 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.110
 get more books with protagonists 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.600
 homosexuals which is the most normal 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.850
 world and it's about time that I stop 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.680
 be a bit of a taboo subject in books 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.480
 of juvenile literature here in Spain 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.950
 united states and other countries yes is 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.140
 true that they come out more but here it seems 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.660
 that encourage us to translate them and 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.180
 even Spanish authors are encouraged 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.700
 to write about 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.250
 that's so good that's been a point 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.420
 super in favor in this book the story 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.219
 that boy I loved and are 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.609
 parts that I liked most about the book 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:32.400
 the parts that were narrated by not to 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:34.650
 I liked youtube but it's true that 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.079
 the first half bored me quite 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.569
 everything that counted but good at the end 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.159
 I ended up taking a lot of love the book 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.650
 is full of other characters 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:46.349
 side effects that are wonderful as 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.700
 they are oscar or brien and also william 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:53.430
 that he is one of the masters of 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.620
 sculpture of jude and generates much more than 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.590
 see in the history of what we think and 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.769
 My mother, I only have the voice here 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.870
 for this beautiful and wonderful book 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:06.659
 and I'm not the best at making reviews 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.790
 but if I can try to get you through the 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:12.180
 head that you have to read this book 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.829
 because it's wonderful and I do not care 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.840
 say you are everywhere 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:18.000
 it's everywhere because it deserves it 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.910
 because it's wonderful because you have to 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.840
 read what's worth 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.610
 already this is a novel with a plot that 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.950
 focuses a lot on relationships 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.020
 relatives and I liked that is not a 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.450
 novel that focuses the stories of 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.610
 love that we already have it a lot 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.220
 everywhere is not focused 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.840
 family relationships especially in the 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.160
 Relationships between two brothers although 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.920
 we will also see the relationship they have 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.470
 with their parents they also have their 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.020
 little pinch of love if you have it you have your 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.780
 romantic stories but what's important 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.180
 is the relationship between no to jude and which 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.740
 it was the conflict that happened between them 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.280
 so that they read or get along just as well 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.280
 that before 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.130
 you have to read I would give you the world and this 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.530
 It has been all for today I hope you have
