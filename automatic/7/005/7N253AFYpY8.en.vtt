00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:10.769
 today friends I bring to show you my 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.190
 new acquisition is a pokémon picacho 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.360
 two 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.240
 gs and well this is a pedometer is 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.280
 say measure your steps as in some 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.380
 pokémon games happens only that 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.420
 now the are not the steps of your 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:30.350
 character but those of you who 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:34.160
 are giving watts in this case we can 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:36.710
 you can use picasso and well we are going 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.739
 giving watts or watts I do not know how to be 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.350
 call but we can change that in the 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.980
 gold and silver games of the game boy 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.379
 color with the mystery gift option is 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.430
 very interesting of course we can also 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.730
 to cheat 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:56.980
 and we can go good as you already 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.030
 I commented on the 2 another version came out that 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.760
 previous to this one that was blank and 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:06.230
 black and good then came out the 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:09.590
 pokéwalker that was to be used with 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:12.930
 the versions pokémon gold and something and 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.390
 pokemon silver soulsilver 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.240
 they have the same function but again 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.730
 they do again in black and white 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.970
 monochromatic 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:27.360
 in this sense, if it is a bit strange 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:31.100
 but that did come for free in the 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.900
 games mentioned in the nintendo 10 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.330
 then well probably that's why 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.560
 they lowered the quality of the pokemon a little 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.690
 walker but then the functionality is 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.900
 still a little better because here 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.930
 we always use pikachu 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.340
 in the pokemon walker that we use to 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.340
 any character from those two games 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.680
 and good continuing with the explanation 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.860
 is that I tell them that every 20 steps is 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.590
 equal to one watt 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.720
 well then you have your click to get in 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.530
 the belt and that is counting the 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.490
 Steps 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.530
 which we can give them as food 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.350
 as a gift to our peak and between 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.390
 more then the happiest is to say if we are 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.530
 loose to walk or less to 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.770
 shake the pedometer as the picacho 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.680
 will be unhappy then it is a 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.290
 very interesting device that took advantage 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.400
 two different fevers that was generated 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.910
 by the aforementioned tamagotchis and that of the 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.910
 yellow fever 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:44.900
 an exit as competition to the 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.969
 to the tamagotchis but like you 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.299
 they will know how to take advantage of the license of 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:53.060
 Pokemon is a very interesting device 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:57.440
 I suppose 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:01.250
 that pokémon fans had in mind 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.930
 his then his trinkets this to me 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.439
 cost 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.569
 30 pesos what are two dollars and me 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:11.390
 it seems to me a great collectable I have not 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.989
 played already know the Pokémon games 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.650
 but I like to buy items from 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.650
 these animals 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.300
 and well here we have set it as 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.400
 you can see it is in color 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.180
 It has other interesting features 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:32.340
 apart from every subway and being able to be 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.489
 used in game boy color games 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.519
 it is a clock that is alarm clock has a 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:41.790
 simple game then we can 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:44.940
 to entertain a lot with the the matter 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.980
 it lasts for a long time and well 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.069
 I tell you an excellent collectable for 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.530
 pokémon fans I hope you have them 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.849
 seemed interesting and good well we 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.849
 we see in the following video
