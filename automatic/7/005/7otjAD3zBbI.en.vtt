but<00:00:13.620> yeah<00:00:14.099> we'll<00:00:14.219> be<00:00:14.340> using<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.610> stakeout<00:00:14.969> one

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
but yeah we'll be using the stakeout one

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.939 
but yeah we'll be using the stakeout one
of<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.360> only<00:00:15.690> guns<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:16.320> do<00:00:16.379> use<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:16.830> this

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
of the only guns that I do use in this

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.920 
of the only guns that I do use in this
game<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.369> unfortunately<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.420> does<00:00:18.600> get<00:00:18.779> its

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
game and unfortunately it does get its

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.570 
game and unfortunately it does get its
fair<00:00:19.140> share<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.410> hitmarkers<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.070> think<00:00:20.279> there's

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
fair share of hitmarkers I think there's

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.279 
fair share of hitmarkers I think there's
actually<00:00:21.000> an<00:00:21.119> instance<00:00:21.510> later<00:00:21.720> on<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
actually an instance later on in the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.320 
actually an instance later on in the
game<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.740> don't<00:00:23.340> know<00:00:23.400> if<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.580> was<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:23.820> game<00:00:24.029> or

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
game I don't know if it was this game or

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.689 
game I don't know if it was this game or
one<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.170> next<00:00:25.769> games<00:00:25.980> after<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.490> but<00:00:26.670> I

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
one of the next games after this but I

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.189 
one of the next games after this but I
actually<00:00:26.789> got<00:00:27.119> three<00:00:27.449> hit<00:00:27.630> markers<00:00:27.960> with<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
actually got three hit markers with the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.620 
actually got three hit markers with the
stakeout<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.820> actually<00:00:29.849> took<00:00:30.269> me<00:00:30.480> like

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
stakeout and it actually took me like

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.049 
stakeout and it actually took me like
four<00:00:31.140> shotgun<00:00:31.830> bullets<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.399> get<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.640> kill<00:00:32.850> I

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
four shotgun bullets to get the kill I

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.150 
four shotgun bullets to get the kill I
don't<00:00:33.690> know<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.809> had<00:00:33.989> i<00:00:34.260> always<00:00:34.440> think<00:00:34.680> shotgun

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
don't know I had i always think shotgun

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.370 
don't know I had i always think shotgun
should<00:00:35.430> be<00:00:35.610> like<00:00:36.120> modern<00:00:36.570> warfare<00:00:36.719> two<00:00:37.020> strong

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
should be like modern warfare two strong

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.170 
should be like modern warfare two strong
because<00:00:37.829> their<00:00:38.129> shotguns<00:00:38.670> they<00:00:38.879> should<00:00:39.059> be

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
because their shotguns they should be

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.030 
because their shotguns they should be
really<00:00:39.540> strong<00:00:39.750> at<00:00:39.930> close<00:00:40.110> range<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.950> all

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
really strong at close range and all

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.530 
really strong at close range and all
that<00:00:41.160> kind<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.340> stuff<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.700> don't<00:00:41.850> think<00:00:41.910> that

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
that kind of stuff I don't think that

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.970 
that kind of stuff I don't think that
you<00:00:42.660> should<00:00:42.690> be<00:00:42.960> able<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.200> get<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.770> three

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
you should be able to get to in three

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.350 
you should be able to get to in three
hit<00:00:44.129> markers<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.579> all<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.789> kind<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.000> stuff<00:00:45.059> I

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
hit markers and all that kind of stuff I

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.080 
hit markers and all that kind of stuff I
think<00:00:45.390> that's<00:00:45.690> just<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.989> little<00:00:46.140> bit<00:00:46.350> too<00:00:46.530> weak

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
think that's just a little bit too weak

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.819 
think that's just a little bit too weak
but<00:00:48.090> as<00:00:48.300> for<00:00:48.870> me<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.020> just<00:00:49.140> wanted<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.559> talk<00:00:49.770> to

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
but as for me I just wanted to talk to

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.119 
but as for me I just wanted to talk to
you<00:00:50.100> guys<00:00:50.129> about<00:00:50.489> some<00:00:51.239> black<00:00:51.510> ops<00:00:51.719> 2<00:00:52.129> shotguns

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
you guys about some black ops 2 shotguns

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.580 
you guys about some black ops 2 shotguns
and<00:00:53.370> possibly<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.750> how<00:00:55.260> they're<00:00:55.440> going<00:00:55.530> to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
and possibly like how they're going to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.350 
and possibly like how they're going to
be<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:56.039> my<00:00:56.370> predictions<00:00:56.879> for<00:00:57.030> them<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.270> all

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
be in my predictions for them and all

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.810 
be in my predictions for them and all
that<00:00:57.480> kind<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.690> stuff<00:00:57.750> because<00:00:58.820> treyarch

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
that kind of stuff because treyarch

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.490 
that kind of stuff because treyarch
always<00:01:00.090> has<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> tendency<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.140> make<00:01:01.289> their

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
always has a tendency to make their

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.650 
always has a tendency to make their
shotguns<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.070> little<00:01:02.340> bit<00:01:02.460> weaker<00:01:02.879> than<00:01:03.090> say

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
shotguns a little bit weaker than say

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.700 
shotguns a little bit weaker than say
infinity<00:01:04.199> ward<00:01:04.409> would<00:01:04.880> unfortunately

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
infinity ward would unfortunately

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.980 
infinity ward would unfortunately
because<00:01:07.710> if<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.220> look<00:01:08.369> at<00:01:08.490> modern<00:01:08.640> warfare

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
because if you look at modern warfare

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.539 
because if you look at modern warfare
call<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.049> duty<00:01:10.290> 4<00:01:10.320> there<00:01:11.040> was<00:01:11.189> only<00:01:11.280> two

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
call of duty 4 there was only two

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.039 
call of duty 4 there was only two
shotguns<00:01:12.000> but<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.180> think<00:01:12.479> they<00:01:12.600> did<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> good<00:01:12.990> job

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
shotguns but I think they did a good job

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.030 
shotguns but I think they did a good job
with<00:01:13.260> him<00:01:13.470> because<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.549> m1014<00:01:15.240> was

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
with him because the the m1014 was

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.740 
with him because the the m1014 was
semi-automatic<00:01:17.040> obviously<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.490> mean<00:01:17.750> wasn't

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
semi-automatic obviously I mean wasn't

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.840 
semi-automatic obviously I mean wasn't
pump<00:01:19.049> action<00:01:19.229> or<00:01:19.530> anything<00:01:19.830> but<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.250> did<00:01:20.520> it

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
pump action or anything but it did it

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.179 
pump action or anything but it did it
did<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.810> did<00:01:22.080> do<00:01:22.350> its<00:01:22.500> fair<00:01:22.740> share<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.979> damage

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
did it did do its fair share of damage

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.609 
did it did do its fair share of damage
but<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:24.119> only<00:01:24.210> had<00:01:24.420> four<00:01:24.659> bullets<00:01:24.990> unlike<00:01:25.380> you

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
but it only had four bullets unlike you

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.530 
but it only had four bullets unlike you
know<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:26.040> black<00:01:26.340> ops<00:01:26.580> there<00:01:27.000> was<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.270> spaz

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
know in black ops there was the spaz

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.480 
know in black ops there was the spaz
which<00:01:27.840> pretty<00:01:28.229> much<00:01:28.320> had<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> same<00:01:29.009> fire<00:01:29.250> rate

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
which pretty much had the same fire rate

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.080 
which pretty much had the same fire rate
as<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.670> m10<00:01:30.090> but<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.170> had<00:01:31.979> April<00:01:32.310> its<00:01:32.549> end<00:01:32.790> like

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
as the m10 but it had April its end like

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.560 
as the m10 but it had April its end like
the<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.810> W<00:01:34.170> 1200<00:01:34.799> was<00:01:35.100> pump<00:01:35.820> action<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.479> it

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
the the W 1200 was pump action and it

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.910 
the the W 1200 was pump action and it
had<00:01:36.689> April<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.229> think<00:01:37.439> they<00:01:37.500> did<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.710> good<00:01:37.860> job

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
had April so I think they did a good job

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.940 
had April so I think they did a good job
on<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:38.700> um<00:01:39.150> Treyarch<00:01:40.140> shotguns<00:01:40.619> like<00:01:40.890> I

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
on that but um Treyarch shotguns like I

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.760 
on that but um Treyarch shotguns like I

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
said are always a little bit more weaker

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.319 
said are always a little bit more weaker
than<00:01:43.770> infinity<00:01:44.159> ward<00:01:44.520> like<00:01:44.729> especially<00:01:45.060> with

sucks that guy just timed out right

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.969 
sucks that guy just timed out right
before<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.549> shot<00:01:56.759> him<00:01:56.909> um<00:01:57.719> but<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.530> know<00:01:58.560> black

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
before I shot him um but you know black

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.560 
before I shot him um but you know black
ops<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.729> know<00:01:59.759> they<00:01:59.969> were<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.119> little<00:02:00.360> bit

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
ops you know they were a little bit

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.569 
ops you know they were a little bit
weaker<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.990> only<00:02:01.229> half-decent<00:02:01.649> shotgun<00:02:02.250> at

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
weaker the only half-decent shotgun at

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.080 
weaker the only half-decent shotgun at
my<00:02:02.820> opinion<00:02:03.590> was<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.619> spaz<00:02:05.430> 12<00:02:05.729> because<00:02:05.880> you

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
my opinion was the spaz 12 because you

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.910 
my opinion was the spaz 12 because you
could<00:02:06.240> spit<00:02:06.630> cool<00:02:07.020> like<00:02:07.140> spray<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.619> stuff

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
could spit cool like spray it and stuff

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.520 
could spit cool like spray it and stuff
but<00:02:08.160> um<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:09.420> know<00:02:09.539> world<00:02:09.810> at<00:02:09.899> war<00:02:10.020> shotguns

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
that is kind of left out with weapons

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.580 
that is kind of left out with weapons
they<00:02:36.570> always<00:02:36.780> have<00:02:36.960> the<00:02:37.110> least<00:02:37.290> amount<00:02:37.380> of

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.960 
I hope they're all pump-action I don't
really<00:02:43.860> think<00:02:44.100> there<00:02:44.310> should<00:02:44.460> be<00:02:44.610> like<00:02:44.790> an

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
really think there should be like an

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.660 
really think there should be like an
automatic<00:02:45.690> shotgun<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:47.250> all<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.490> kind<00:02:47.640> of

automatic shotgun and all that kind of
stuff<00:02:47.760> I<00:02:48.060> hope<00:02:48.240> there's<00:02:48.480> just<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:49.020> know<00:02:49.140> pump

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
stuff I hope there's just you know pump

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.990 
stuff I hope there's just you know pump
action<00:02:49.560> because<00:02:49.980> pump<00:02:50.250> action<00:02:50.430> is<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.850> way<00:02:50.940> to

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
action because pump action is the way to

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.180 
action because pump action is the way to
go<00:02:51.210> I<00:02:51.420> hope<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:52.020> have<00:02:52.140> like<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.470> model<00:02:52.890> referred

said<00:02:57.060> Treyarch<00:02:57.840> has<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:58.020> tendency<00:02:58.320> to<00:02:58.590> make<00:02:58.710> the

submachine guns a little more a little

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.440 
submachine guns a little more a little
more<00:03:02.340> dominant<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.060> all<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.210> kind<00:03:03.360> of<00:03:03.390> stuff

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
more dominant and all that kind of stuff

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.450 
more dominant and all that kind of stuff
but<00:03:03.810> hopefully<00:03:04.110> they<00:03:04.230> can<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:04.920> know<00:03:04.950> even<00:03:05.250> it

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
but hopefully they can you know even it

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.350 
but hopefully they can you know even it
out<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:05.760> stuff<00:03:05.970> um<00:03:06.320> as<00:03:07.320> for<00:03:07.970> black<00:03:08.970> ops<00:03:09.000> 2

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360

out and stuff um as for black ops 2
shotguns<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:10.140> would<00:03:10.290> really<00:03:10.530> really<00:03:10.980> love<00:03:11.280> to

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
shotguns I would really really love to

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.380 
shotguns I would really really love to
see<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:13.020> shotguns<00:03:13.560> become<00:03:14.490> secondaries<00:03:15.210> um

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
see the shotguns become secondaries um

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.720 
see the shotguns become secondaries um
in<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.320> game<00:03:16.950> like<00:03:17.130> it<00:03:17.280> wasn't<00:03:17.550> model

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
in that game like it wasn't model

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.340 
in that game like it wasn't model
referred<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.090> by<00:03:18.209> because<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:18.540> think<00:03:18.690> shotguns

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
referred to by because I think shotguns

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.440 
referred to by because I think shotguns
are<00:03:19.500> pretty<00:03:19.800> good<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.880> they<00:03:21.120> they're

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
are pretty good and they they're

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.210 
are pretty good and they they're
definitely<00:03:21.680> you<00:03:22.680> you<00:03:22.860> know<00:03:22.950> you<00:03:22.980> can

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
definitely you you know you can

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.710 
definitely you you know you can
definitely<00:03:23.580> use<00:03:23.640> them<00:03:23.820> as<00:03:23.970> primary<00:03:24.390> weapons

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
definitely use them as primary weapons

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.080 
definitely use them as primary weapons
but<00:03:24.930> sometimes<00:03:25.830> I<00:03:26.070> would<00:03:26.340> rather<00:03:26.489> have<00:03:27.060> a

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
but sometimes I would rather have a

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.000 
but sometimes I would rather have a
shotgun<00:03:27.780> as<00:03:27.900> a<00:03:27.930> secondary<00:03:28.380> weapon<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:28.920> I

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
shotgun as a secondary weapon and I

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.830 
shotgun as a secondary weapon and I
don't<00:03:29.340> really<00:03:29.459> want<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:29.760> waste<00:03:30.270> the<00:03:30.480> perk<00:03:30.660> on

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
don't really want to waste the perk on

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.120 
don't really want to waste the perk on
it<00:03:30.989> like<00:03:31.110> I<00:03:31.200> don't<00:03:31.320> want<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.500> have<00:03:31.620> overkill

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
it like I don't want to have overkill

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.940 
it like I don't want to have overkill
just<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.489> carry<00:03:32.700> shotgun<00:03:33.180> as<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.390> secondary<00:03:33.950> but

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
just to carry shotgun as a secondary but

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.650 
just to carry shotgun as a secondary but
I<00:03:34.980> wish<00:03:35.430> they<00:03:35.610> hope<00:03:35.970> they<00:03:36.120> do<00:03:36.180> put<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:36.510> back

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
I wish they hope they do put it back

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.630 
I wish they hope they do put it back
because<00:03:36.840> my<00:03:37.230> opinion<00:03:37.620> shotgun<00:03:38.040> secondaries

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
because my opinion shotgun secondaries

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.290 
because my opinion shotgun secondaries
weren't<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:39.720> bad<00:03:39.930> they<00:03:40.290> really<00:03:40.590> weren't<00:03:40.739> um

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
weren't that bad they really weren't um

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.970 
weren't that bad they really weren't um
in<00:03:42.300> modern<00:03:42.600> warfare<00:03:42.630> 2<00:03:42.989> I<00:03:43.020> really<00:03:43.620> like<00:03:43.770> that

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
in modern warfare 2 I really like that

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.920 
in modern warfare 2 I really like that
how<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.370> could<00:03:44.670> you<00:03:45.180> know<00:03:45.300> carry<00:03:45.570> around<00:03:45.720> a

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
how you could you know carry around a

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.240 
how you could you know carry around a
sniper<00:03:46.170> rifle<00:03:46.290> or<00:03:46.620> something<00:03:46.950> like<00:03:47.040> that<00:03:47.100> and

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
sniper rifle or something like that and

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.040 
sniper rifle or something like that and
then<00:03:47.520> you<00:03:47.610> could<00:03:47.820> you<00:03:48.390> know<00:03:48.480> if<00:03:48.600> you<00:03:48.690> got<00:03:48.840> into

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
then you could you know if you got into

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.750 
then you could you know if you got into
a<00:03:49.080> sticky<00:03:49.530> situation<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:50.130> got<00:03:50.190> into<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.459> close

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
a sticky situation you got into a close

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.270 
a sticky situation you got into a close
quarter<00:03:51.120> combat<00:03:51.150> or<00:03:52.050> whatever<00:03:52.320> you<00:03:53.100> could

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
quarter combat or whatever you could

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.979 
quarter combat or whatever you could
take<00:03:53.610> out<00:03:53.790> your<00:03:53.910> shotgun<00:03:54.330> and<00:03:54.510> pretty<00:03:54.930> much

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
take out your shotgun and pretty much

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.070 
take out your shotgun and pretty much
you<00:03:55.980> know<00:03:56.520> go<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.030> work<00:03:57.239> with<00:03:57.390> it<00:03:57.540> but<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:57.750> think

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
you know go to work with it but I think

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.660 
you know go to work with it but I think
if<00:03:58.260> there<00:03:58.440> are<00:03:58.560> primary<00:03:58.980> weapons<00:03:59.340> they<00:03:59.489> should

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
if there are primary weapons they should

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.210 
if there are primary weapons they should
be<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.820> lot<00:04:00.000> stronger<00:04:00.500> then<00:04:01.500> they<00:04:01.830> were<00:04:01.890> in

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
be a lot stronger then they were in

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.250 
be a lot stronger then they were in
black<00:04:02.520> ops<00:04:02.730> because<00:04:03.150> like<00:04:03.540> I<00:04:03.630> said<00:04:03.690> you<00:04:04.050> can't

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
black ops because like I said you can't

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.810 
black ops because like I said you can't
really<00:04:04.500> have<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:04.650> primary<00:04:04.920> weapon<00:04:05.370> this<00:04:05.520> this

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
really have a primary weapon this this

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.470 
really have a primary weapon this this
week<00:04:06.090> and<00:04:06.360> have<00:04:06.930> a<00:04:07.200> famas<00:04:07.860> that's<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:08.670> know<00:04:08.790> so

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
week and have a famas that's you know so

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.910 
week and have a famas that's you know so
dominant<00:04:10.019> and<00:04:10.140> all<00:04:10.200> that<00:04:10.320> kind<00:04:10.500> of<00:04:10.530> stuff<00:04:10.590> that

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
dominant and all that kind of stuff that

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.440 
dominant and all that kind of stuff that
was<00:04:11.070> never<00:04:11.340> really<00:04:11.580> fixed<00:04:12.030> or<00:04:12.150> anything<00:04:12.420> like

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
was never really fixed or anything like

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.650 
was never really fixed or anything like
that<00:04:12.570> I<00:04:12.989> just<00:04:13.709> hope<00:04:13.830> they<00:04:14.070> um<00:04:14.459> put<00:04:15.360> a<00:04:15.390> little

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
that I just hope they um put a little

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.270 
that I just hope they um put a little
bit<00:04:15.840> more<00:04:15.959> thought<00:04:16.169> into<00:04:16.230> the<00:04:16.530> shotguns<00:04:16.980> and<00:04:17.190> I

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
bit more thought into the shotguns and I

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.680 
bit more thought into the shotguns and I
hope<00:04:17.430> they<00:04:17.459> make<00:04:17.820> them<00:04:18.000> a<00:04:18.090> lot<00:04:18.239> better<00:04:18.390> because

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
hope they make them a lot better because

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.509 
hope they make them a lot better because
like<00:04:19.350> I<00:04:19.470> said<00:04:19.530> they're<00:04:19.830> my<00:04:19.950> favorite<00:04:20.280> thing<00:04:20.430> to

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
like I said they're my favorite thing to

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.029 
like I said they're my favorite thing to
use<00:04:20.700> and<00:04:21.030> hopefully<00:04:21.600> I'm<00:04:22.289> looking<00:04:22.650> forward<00:04:22.890> to

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
use and hopefully I'm looking forward to

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.620 
use and hopefully I'm looking forward to
seeing<00:04:23.220> what<00:04:23.760> they<00:04:23.880> do<00:04:23.940> with<00:04:24.150> them<00:04:24.270> but<00:04:24.419> like<00:04:24.570> I

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
seeing what they do with them but like I

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.090 
seeing what they do with them but like I
said<00:04:24.690> I<00:04:24.840> hope<00:04:24.990> they<00:04:25.169> make<00:04:25.380> them<00:04:25.560> shotgun

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
said I hope they make them shotgun

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.100 
said I hope they make them shotgun
