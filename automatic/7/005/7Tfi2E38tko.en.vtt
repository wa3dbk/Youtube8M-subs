00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
really blue and I like the way that it

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.019 
really blue and I like the way that it
looks<00:00:21.240> on<00:00:21.390> me<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:22.500> that's<00:00:23.279> what<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:23.820> looks

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
looks on me so that's what this looks

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.870 
looks on me so that's what this looks
like<00:00:24.180> it's<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.539> very<00:00:24.949> smoky<00:00:25.949> it's<00:00:26.340> kind<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.730> fun

so<00:06:13.150> we<00:06:13.330> have<00:06:13.450> that<00:06:14.169> so<00:06:14.530> it's<00:06:14.770> subtle<00:06:15.160> with<00:06:15.490> the

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:17.980 
lashes but it still kind of gives a

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.670 
lashes but it still kind of gives a
little<00:06:18.100> bit<00:06:18.250> of<00:06:18.310> a<00:06:18.430> contrast<00:06:18.850> to<00:06:19.030> all<00:06:19.210> the<00:06:19.330> red
