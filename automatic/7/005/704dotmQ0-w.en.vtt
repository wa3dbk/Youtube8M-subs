00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.559

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:44.660
 whether their hot rod is the learn her 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:44.660
 Now it's in the closet and bed 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.420
 you are now allowed to give our beets 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.479
 was small 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.910
 the 16 year old carol white is that 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.900
 typical outsider girl of hers 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.730
 highschool she is shy 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.800
 withdrawn and that too is theirs 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.810
 Mother succumbed to religious madness 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.540
 thinks everything personally and you get it 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.760
 with pray again and also if 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.460
 Carey fruit then she must go pray like that 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.050
 according to the motto as the Carinthians 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.170
 a physical education session in the 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.850
 girl shower starts to bleed 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.820
 you know that and she thinks she is 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.350
 bleeding curves on the ground and turns white 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.790
 do not know what to do and 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.560
 All girls throw them with tampons 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.140
 and laugh at her for tormenting her 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.090
 dash and thread plus white carey unfortunately 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.700
 not that it's your days so the 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.800
 menstrual bleeding and of course bitter 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.720
 one of the girls has thus solved 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.550
 afterwards, he is so sorry that she 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.140
 her friend tommy haas the absolute 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.700
 Schonling the highschool asks 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.790
 as a reparation with carey on the 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.170
 instead of going with her 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.459
 so much time to the story then what 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.800
 you see happening in the movie then 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.580
 if necessary, you look at brain 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.860
 de palmas classic is here by mary 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.299
 pierce repositioned and doing so 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.150
 send properly converted 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.860
 because this tries to happen 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.510
 to emphasize the current time so stressed 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.430
 they decided, for example, typical 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.140
 high school behave the way with 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.650
 cell phones or even mobbing and its 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.930
 consequences 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.590
 Unfortunately, Plus loses on her mission 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.430
 this film on the current time too 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.840
 unfortunately always adapt the 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.549
 Character formation of the supporting actors and 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.080
 they never really have the chance 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.610
 to convey her role convincingly 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.260
 because if the director does not lose 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.910
 then you can do what you want what 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.790
 no chance in this movie somehow 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.230
 convincing are added also is carrie 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.360
 and her mother played by Julia Mohr 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.280
 completely different than shown 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.410
 example in the hofer classic by brian de 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.220
 palma or in the novel by 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.340
 stephen king 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.739
 unfortunately, chloe grace moretz is not 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.739
 little overweight ugly 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.250
 engine and she can play what you like 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.019
 want 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.930
 like toni little ugly and 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.280
 overweight for the acting performance 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.220
 It is a pity even if I have to say 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.959
 that grace moretz well in the back of your mind 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.400
 always off kickers somehow incredibly 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.840
 is burdened but she brings it anyway 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.700
 to play the shy girl 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.049
 And also the contrast from the beginning to 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.379
 film until the end until you are there 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.670
 bloody 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.769
 exaggeratedly blatantly skipping the girl 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.120
 that is already really good 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.569
 is definitely a plus point for the 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.579
 Movie 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.530
 what do you think about the cast is chloe 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.849
 grace moretz should be misplaced 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.349
 rather a real ugly one 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:56.659
 take similar or almost only beautiful 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.430
 Actress Grace Moretz always said 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.110
 your opinion station in the comments 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.329
 The movie will definitely get from me 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.950
 Unfortunately, 5 out of 10 score no cinema 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.840
 cinema movie he sure is something nice 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.519
 for a small stool drama evening 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.109
 It's more drama than horror 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:13.220
 should set just because the 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:14.540
 Aspects of mobbing and religious beliefs 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.669
 and how far he can go for one 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.109
 shown here very clearly and me 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.389
 I'll be a big one again 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.169
 Bend around cars with a small fish 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.389
 do it on the back 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:26.570
 that was it from me i wish you a lot 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:28.520
 fun in the cinema or at home by dvd 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.650
 By the way, it is advisable at the end there 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.660
 There are many cool filmed bids though 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.070
 even incidental if your hands 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.600
 liked expresses what I do when 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.010
 to subscribe to the weapons and ten times 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.080
 and in the car if now the 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.699
 possibility to you the extended trailer too 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.780
 carry in I wish you much 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:46.130
 fun until then size a poor 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.310
 lonely girl a prank too 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.310

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.000
 new king and your kings are
