00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 good morning good afternoon, good evening, and you're welcome 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.940
 anyone that you are speaking is rock 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.660
 English with one plus one more frog 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.790
 a series 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.380
 I bet you were feeling the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.210
 my lack 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.210
 it's not ours 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.990
 well this one is going to have some some 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.609
 very simple modes but they can 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.609
 being half heavy of the pc 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.620
 well I 'm here with one with a lot of 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.720
 shadows can improve greatly and this 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.290
 here there are more effects 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.330
 improve you and your world if it 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.550
 It's too heavy, we can not. 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.030
 leave it alone and take 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.030
 is lighter 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:02.200
 I do not understand, the fucking do not understand 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.390
 Look, look, this is what this looks like. 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.820
 they humbled much in contrast and 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.820
 It was very strange to play. 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.310
 not worth it ah I can leave 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.890
 beautiful to see that I do not cut very handsome 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.160
 Which I think looks ugly. 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.350
 I'm going to take nice, nice guys, great. 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.050
 perfect water and sic for me is the best 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.920
 The younger one with him just does not record much 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.350
 with him 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.890
 it does not have that shape either 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.140
 you become the camera of your character but 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.910
 he looks great great and lets go to the 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.650
 next time I do not want to run away from 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:41.590
 stay big understands does not understand and does not 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.140
 I understand too much lighting or do not understand 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.259
 why the coolest lighting that 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.710
 let this movement in the trees 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.210
 that getting nice and nice house 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.700
 So it's going to be more or less like that for 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:02:01.360
 You, but it will not disturb anything. 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:05.110
 Why are we fucking fears? 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.780
 about more obese this is it 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:12.130
 I do not know, I did not see any crap. 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:15.630
 change then it stopped there is a movement 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.630
 of the leaves 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.459
 honey 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.900
 so if you do not like the moves 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.390
 sheet is making you very light. 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.160
 then take off that bucci and you can 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.370
 help a lot 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.959
 Now let's see if this one is going to see 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.690
 that's because I do not know either 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:43.670
 great and I know it's really fucking old 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.480
 problem that requires too much of your 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.480
 video galley 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.390
 has a good relation to the movement in 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.140
 leaves great combination of new stands 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.870
 great 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.710
 we became cute and it gets very 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.000
 sexy 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.700
 Only when we're going to break, is it? 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.340
 With this or whatever your name is 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.840
 so let's go to the next mode and 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.350
 if it will require a little more of your board 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.150
 guys are going to enter the water is the same 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.280
 This is very interesting because 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.760
 We 're going here if I'm going back here. 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.250
 Let's go to the next one next. 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.040
 stanzas here I'm seeing nothing much 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.260
 that's where this is also what a 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.780
 I play a lot because then I think a lot 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.930
 cold is this movement for us will turn 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.950
 So is it has motion and is 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.950
 movement on the leaves 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:43.460
 the character was blonde is not good 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.550
 so we are very slow very good 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.360
 if you liked s / a and you liked this 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.360
 posture 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.700
 oh no 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:58.130
 Caraca needed such rudeness. 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:00.800
 so let's go the next do not understand 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.930
 I really do not understand, I did not see 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:08.960
 A lot of things stayed on the picture. 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:11.540
 Lighting, I can not but have many 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:15.290
 things have up to do not have a move 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.580
 of the leaves is interesting this one is 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.130
 more for lightweight 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.570
 is lighter when you place the 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.020
 movement of the leaves can see that 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.980
 there are clouds the sun does not have only 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.650
 feature attention on this does not 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:32.510
 it reaches the sun, which neither I 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.830
 I knew it was a place nearby that I 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.410
 I do not play much I'm in a hurry 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.090
 I'm not too rushed that it's too 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.380
 stop will be lighter to stay longer 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.720
 age for you 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.730
 he knows shape when you see him 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.250
 for with these sheets not 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.620
 this year and also has the clouds 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.490
 the good and interesting clouds and the sun is 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.490
 of course I think it's more important 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:59.339
 well this one does not have that figure 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:01.409
 When you see him by the way, here it is. 

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:04.469
 focused on water but even so the water 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:08.039
 It was not so good that the front is 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:12.629
 weird strange medium does not have a 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:15.479
 moving on the next leaves 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:18.029
 getting to know geek 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:21.509
 good this one is very good but this one 

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:24.029
 You do not know if it's because the sun comes out 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:28.949
 although I think so, but this one has 

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:31.559
 a great deal of great effects like that 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:33.989
 say on call works 

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:35.969
 Thank you. Thank you for giving me your things. 

00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:38.489
 so it's very good this effect does not have 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:39.299
 nothing wrong you can use do not know if 

00:05:38.489 --> 00:05:45.349
 it's so light 

00:05:39.299 --> 00:05:48.029
 if your benefit anaceu pinto feeling 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:50.249
 Come on let's get this one with me soon. 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:53.399
 I went with one of the ones I liked the most 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:56.669
 stay with rock no no no and me too 

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:59.909
 I put a mold more than the op fine 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:02.519
 It can improve a lot for you there and it's 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:04.349
 the receipt then thanks guys the video 

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:05.789
 It's getting here, I wanted to see you so much. 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:09.629
 on top to try to escape to the galley 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:12.059
 RapidÃ£o guys guys I forgot to 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:14.639
 I'll tell you something about that too. 

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:15.569
 came with some textures packages of 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.789
 textures 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:20.789
 so you may be testing each one 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:23.939
 it was just a quick press release so 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:26.219
 continued to do what he was doing 

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:28.169
 So it's okay, people, the video is getting 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:30.409
 here and until the next 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:30.409
 went
