00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
iPhone 4 and pre iPad 2 then you can

tether<00:00:24.760> now<00:00:25.360> what<00:00:25.600> this<00:00:25.780> does<00:00:25.840> is<00:00:26.380> basically

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
tether now what this does is basically

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.520 
tether now what this does is basically
allows<00:00:27.460> you<00:00:27.790> to<00:00:27.850> boot<00:00:28.390> up<00:00:28.570> your<00:00:28.720> device<00:00:29.080> even

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:29.530 
allows you to boot up your device even

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.910 
allows you to boot up your device even
if<00:00:29.950> you<00:00:30.130> have<00:00:30.370> a<00:00:30.400> tethered<00:00:31.120> jailbreak<00:00:31.290> so<00:00:32.290> you

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
if you have a tethered jailbreak so you

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.040 
if you have a tethered jailbreak so you
won't<00:00:33.190> really<00:00:33.460> get<00:00:33.910> to<00:00:34.059> keep<00:00:34.329> your<00:00:34.629> jailbreak

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
won't really get to keep your jailbreak

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.440 
won't really get to keep your jailbreak
when<00:00:35.410> you<00:00:35.559> boot<00:00:35.800> it<00:00:35.980> up<00:00:36.100> again<00:00:36.460> but<00:00:37.000> when<00:00:37.300> you

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
when you boot it up again but when you

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.450 
when you boot it up again but when you
boot<00:00:37.660> tethered<00:00:37.900> from<00:00:38.320> your<00:00:38.470> computer<00:00:38.920> after

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
boot tethered from your computer after

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.819 
boot tethered from your computer after
booting<00:00:39.820> it<00:00:39.970> up<00:00:40.120> it<00:00:40.540> will<00:00:40.780> work<00:00:41.020> once<00:00:41.320> again<00:00:41.650> so

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
booting it up it will work once again so

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.140 
booting it up it will work once again so
you'll<00:00:41.980> get<00:00:42.130> to<00:00:42.190> keep<00:00:42.430> all<00:00:42.610> of<00:00:42.670> your<00:00:42.850> tweaks

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
you'll get to keep all of your tweaks

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.780 
you'll get to keep all of your tweaks
and<00:00:43.360> everything<00:00:43.780> so<00:00:44.260> put<00:00:44.680> it<00:00:44.800> like<00:00:44.980> this<00:00:45.220> you

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
and everything so put it like this you

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.520 
and everything so put it like this you
lose<00:00:46.000> battery<00:00:46.300> on<00:00:46.600> your<00:00:46.630> device<00:00:47.020> which<00:00:47.320> is

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
lose battery on your device which is

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.370 
lose battery on your device which is
tethered<00:00:48.160> jailbroken<00:00:48.670> it<00:00:49.270> goes<00:00:49.780> and<00:00:50.079> drains

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
tethered jailbroken it goes and drains

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.500 
tethered jailbroken it goes and drains
and<00:00:50.680> turns<00:00:50.890> off<00:00:51.130> you'll<00:00:51.640> be<00:00:51.700> able<00:00:51.940> to<00:00:52.149> turn<00:00:52.360> it

really downloaded from Cydia before

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.630 
really downloaded from Cydia before
Safari<00:01:01.899> didn't<00:01:02.320> work<00:01:02.470> and<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:03.190> mail<00:01:03.370> app

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
Safari didn't work and the mail app

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.580 
Safari didn't work and the mail app
didn't<00:01:04.059> really<00:01:04.269> work<00:01:04.509> when<00:01:04.869> doing<00:01:05.229> the<00:01:05.350> semi

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
didn't really work when doing the semi

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.130 
didn't really work when doing the semi
tethered<00:01:06.070> and<00:01:06.250> turning<00:01:06.820> it<00:01:06.969> back<00:01:07.000> on<00:01:07.390> but<00:01:07.930> now

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
tethered and turning it back on but now

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.260 
tethered and turning it back on but now
they've<00:01:08.409> released<00:01:08.619> an<00:01:09.070> update<00:01:09.549> to<00:01:09.909> semi

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
they've released an update to semi

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.940 
they've released an update to semi
tether<00:01:10.630> which<00:01:10.990> will<00:01:11.200> allow<00:01:11.500> you<00:01:11.560> to<00:01:11.740> use

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
tether which will allow you to use

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.210 
tether which will allow you to use
Safari<00:01:12.540> after<00:01:13.540> you<00:01:13.659> turn<00:01:13.900> it<00:01:14.020> back<00:01:14.200> on<00:01:14.229> so<00:01:14.680> this

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
Safari after you turn it back on so this

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.190 
Safari after you turn it back on so this
is<00:01:15.280> kind<00:01:15.640> of<00:01:15.729> getting<00:01:15.970> closer<00:01:16.270> and<00:01:16.420> closer<00:01:16.780> to

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
is kind of getting closer and closer to

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.620 
is kind of getting closer and closer to
a<00:01:17.229> little<00:01:17.590> bit<00:01:17.710> of<00:01:18.010> a<00:01:18.190> stronger<00:01:18.790> semi<00:01:19.270> tether

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
a little bit of a stronger semi tether

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.930 
a little bit of a stronger semi tether
and<00:01:19.930> kind<00:01:20.530> of<00:01:20.590> closer<00:01:20.920> to<00:01:21.310> an<00:01:21.460> untethered

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
and kind of closer to an untethered

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.300 
and kind of closer to an untethered
jailbreak<00:01:22.140> not<00:01:23.140> really<00:01:23.590> because<00:01:23.799> an

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
jailbreak not really because an

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.000 
jailbreak not really because an
untethered<00:01:24.909> jailbreak<00:01:25.060> would<00:01:25.720> be<00:01:25.930> a<00:01:26.140> complete

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
untethered jailbreak would be a complete

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.710 
untethered jailbreak would be a complete
jailbreak<00:01:27.490> that<00:01:27.700> would<00:01:27.850> work<00:01:28.090> with<00:01:28.360> turning

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
jailbreak that would work with turning

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.230 
jailbreak that would work with turning
on<00:01:28.900> your<00:01:29.080> device<00:01:29.409> and<00:01:29.770> all<00:01:30.280> your<00:01:30.700> tweaks<00:01:31.000> would

on your device and all your tweaks would

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.760 
on your device and all your tweaks would
be<00:01:31.360> there<00:01:31.570> all<00:01:31.750> of<00:01:31.869> your<00:01:31.990> Cydia<00:01:32.350> downloads

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
be there all of your Cydia downloads

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.679 
be there all of your Cydia downloads
would<00:01:32.950> be<00:01:33.070> there<00:01:33.280> and<00:01:33.490> working<00:01:34.270> after<00:01:34.420> you've

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
would be there and working after you've

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.840 
would be there and working after you've
turned<00:01:34.930> it<00:01:35.080> back<00:01:35.200> on<00:01:35.260> at<00:01:35.770> least<00:01:36.280> this<00:01:36.610> way

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
turned it back on at least this way

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.580 
turned it back on at least this way
you'll<00:01:37.060> be<00:01:37.119> able<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.540> use<00:01:37.750> all<00:01:38.049> of<00:01:38.080> your<00:01:38.350> native
