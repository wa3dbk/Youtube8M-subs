00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.300 
and most recently as some of you may
have<00:01:36.509> noticed<00:01:36.840> on<00:01:36.930> Twitter<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.860> Rockstar

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
have noticed on Twitter that Rockstar

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.490 
have noticed on Twitter that Rockstar
actually<00:01:38.610> watches<00:01:39.360> our<00:01:39.600> videos<00:01:39.869> Tom<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.439> i's

actually watches our videos Tom and i's
videos<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:40.950> i<00:01:41.729> assume<00:01:42.299> they<00:01:42.509> would<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.720> seen

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899

videos and i assume they would have seen
it<00:01:43.049> right<00:01:43.079> because<00:01:43.409> there<00:01:43.560> was<00:01:43.649> there<00:01:43.860> was<00:01:43.950> one

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
it right because there was there was one

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.859 
it right because there was there was one
specifically<00:01:44.729> where<00:01:45.240> they<00:01:45.360> tweeted<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.810> out

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
specifically where they tweeted it out

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.480 
specifically where they tweeted it out
and<00:01:46.140> i<00:01:46.439> remember<00:01:46.710> getting<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.009> nat<00:01:47.159> replies
