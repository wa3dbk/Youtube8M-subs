and<00:04:02.100> they<00:04:02.760> were<00:04:02.820> just<00:04:03.209> saying<00:04:03.390> they<00:04:03.540> came<00:04:03.690> to

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
and they were just saying they came to

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.560 
and they were just saying they came to
see<00:04:03.900> us<00:04:03.989> live<00:04:04.170> and<00:04:04.530> I<00:04:05.070> guess<00:04:05.730> they<00:04:05.910> thought<00:04:06.390> our

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
see us live and I guess they thought our

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.140 
see us live and I guess they thought our
live<00:04:06.690> show<00:04:06.870> is<00:04:06.989> pretty<00:04:07.950> energetic<00:04:08.100> so<00:04:08.519> so<00:04:09.000> they

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
live show is pretty energetic so so they

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.000 
live show is pretty energetic so so they
had<00:04:09.239> this<00:04:09.360> idea<00:04:09.510> to<00:04:09.780> sort<00:04:09.959> of<00:04:10.050> like<00:04:10.170> do<00:04:10.890> this

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
had this idea to sort of like do this

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.240
