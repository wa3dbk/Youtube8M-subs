00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:04.040 
hi guys Paul and Thomas here hello and

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.130 
hi guys Paul and Thomas here hello and
this<00:00:04.850> is<00:00:05.149> a<00:00:05.269> test<00:00:05.539> that<00:00:05.660> we<00:00:05.749> did<00:00:05.870> probably

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:06.140 
this is a test that we did probably

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.599 
this is a test that we did probably
would<00:00:06.499> you<00:00:06.620> say<00:00:06.740> four<00:00:06.979> days<00:00:07.129> ago<00:00:07.249> or<00:00:07.490> there

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:07.609 
would you say four days ago or there

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:10.810 
would you say four days ago or there
abouts<00:00:07.789> yes<00:00:08.300> so<00:00:09.260> yeah<00:00:09.440> and<00:00:09.770> it's<00:00:10.430> basically

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
abouts yes so yeah and it's basically

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.400 
abouts yes so yeah and it's basically
the<00:00:11.000> GoPro<00:00:11.330> hero3<00:00:11.660> and<00:00:12.310> Hero<00:00:13.310> 3<00:00:13.520> Black<00:00:13.610> Edition

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:14.410 
the GoPro hero3 and Hero 3 Black Edition

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.410 
the GoPro hero3 and Hero 3 Black Edition
so<00:00:15.410> and<00:00:16.010> as<00:00:16.189> you<00:00:16.279> can<00:00:16.430> see<00:00:16.609> on<00:00:16.910> the<00:00:17.060> picture<00:00:17.090> in

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
so and as you can see on the picture in

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.970 
so and as you can see on the picture in
the<00:00:17.480> bottom<00:00:17.600> left<00:00:17.900> we've<00:00:18.080> got<00:00:18.110> the<00:00:18.440> test<00:00:18.830> rig

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
the bottom left we've got the test rig

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.200 
the bottom left we've got the test rig
that<00:00:19.100> we<00:00:19.250> used<00:00:19.400> so<00:00:19.580> cameras<00:00:20.060> were<00:00:20.150> mounted

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
that we used so cameras were mounted

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.300 
that we used so cameras were mounted
basically<00:00:20.869> side<00:00:21.080> by<00:00:21.230> side<00:00:21.440> and<00:00:21.650> we<00:00:21.710> we<00:00:22.070> took<00:00:22.190> a

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
basically side by side and we we took a

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.750 
basically side by side and we we took a
walk<00:00:22.520> down<00:00:23.380> the<00:00:24.380> streets<00:00:24.890> locally<00:00:25.369> and<00:00:25.580> just

and we were heading towards jacob which
is<00:00:29.630> a<00:00:30.130> electronics<00:00:31.130> shop<00:00:31.369> um<00:00:32.050> yes<00:00:33.079> people<00:00:34.010> that

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
is a electronics shop um yes people that

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.290 
is a electronics shop um yes people that
don't<00:00:34.310> know<00:00:34.399> what<00:00:34.550> it<00:00:34.670> is<00:00:34.760> especially<00:00:34.910> people

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300

that are from Australia yes is an

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:38.860 
that are from Australia yes is an
electronic<00:00:37.970> shop<00:00:38.090> they<00:00:38.239> have<00:00:38.270> basically

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
electronic shop they have basically

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.900 
electronic shop they have basically
components<00:00:39.710> resistors<00:00:40.220> transistors

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
components resistors transistors

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.460 
components resistors transistors
soldering<00:00:41.420> gear<00:00:41.780> and<00:00:41.989> all<00:00:42.140> that<00:00:42.260> sort<00:00:42.440> of

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
soldering gear and all that sort of

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.660 
soldering gear and all that sort of
stuff<00:00:42.530> so<00:00:42.739> that's<00:00:42.770> really<00:00:43.010> cool<00:00:43.250> having<00:00:43.430> that

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
stuff so that's really cool having that

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.270 
stuff so that's really cool having that
nearby<00:00:44.420> but<00:00:45.140> anyway<00:00:45.410> look<00:00:45.559> we<00:00:45.680> ran<00:00:45.860> the<00:00:45.980> test

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
nearby but anyway look we ran the test

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.510 
nearby but anyway look we ran the test
and<00:00:46.780> look<00:00:47.780> it's<00:00:48.680> pretty<00:00:48.920> much<00:00:49.010> as<00:00:49.250> I<00:00:49.370> expected

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
and look it's pretty much as I expected

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.600 
and look it's pretty much as I expected
the<00:00:49.880> GoPro<00:00:50.239> Hero<00:00:50.480> 3<00:00:50.510> plus<00:00:51.079> it's<00:00:51.950> a<00:00:52.070> fantastic

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
the GoPro Hero 3 plus it's a fantastic

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.229 
the GoPro Hero 3 plus it's a fantastic
camera<00:00:52.790> no<00:00:53.030> two<00:00:53.090> ways<00:00:53.360> bad<00:00:53.660> at<00:00:53.809> all<00:00:54.309> I<00:00:55.309> don't

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
camera no two ways bad at all I don't

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:57.910 
camera no two ways bad at all I don't
think<00:00:56.600> it's<00:00:56.840> significantly<00:00:57.350> better<00:00:57.559> to<00:00:57.829> you

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
think it's significantly better to you

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.240 
think it's significantly better to you
know<00:00:58.809> and<00:00:59.809> we<00:00:59.960> actually<00:01:00.110> had<00:01:00.440> pictures<00:01:00.980> I<00:01:01.010> took

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
know and we actually had pictures I took

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.920 
know and we actually had pictures I took
screenshots<00:01:01.670> that<00:01:02.030> I<00:01:02.149> put<00:01:02.390> up<00:01:02.480> on<00:01:02.690> our

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
screenshots that I put up on our

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.569 
screenshots that I put up on our
Facebook<00:01:03.500> page<00:01:03.530> and<00:01:03.950> it<00:01:04.039> people<00:01:04.309> try<00:01:04.460> and

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:04.579 
Facebook page and it people try and

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:06.730 
Facebook page and it people try and
guess<00:01:04.760> which<00:01:05.510> one<00:01:05.720> was<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:05.990> GoPro<00:01:06.380> Hero<00:01:06.619> 3

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
guess which one was the GoPro Hero 3

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.149 
guess which one was the GoPro Hero 3
which<00:01:07.190> one<00:01:07.340> was<00:01:07.460> a<00:01:07.490> Hero<00:01:07.729> 3<00:01:07.940> plus<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:08.860> look<00:01:09.860> I

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
which one was a Hero 3 plus and look I

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.280 
which one was a Hero 3 plus and look I
think<00:01:10.640> was<00:01:10.940> about<00:01:11.030> even<00:01:11.450> if<00:01:11.690> it<00:01:11.810> were<00:01:11.960> picking

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
think was about even if it were picking

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.660 
think was about even if it were picking
sometimes<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:12.920> one<00:01:13.070> on<00:01:13.190> the<00:01:13.250> left<00:01:13.460> and<00:01:13.610> the

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
sometimes the one on the left and the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.250 
sometimes the one on the left and the
image<00:01:13.880> on<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.060> right<00:01:14.210> and<00:01:14.479> vice<00:01:14.630> versa

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
image on the right and vice versa

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.170 
image on the right and vice versa
oh<00:01:15.290> yes<00:01:15.560> since<00:01:15.860> we<00:01:15.950> did<00:01:16.220> find<00:01:16.549> by<00:01:16.909> even

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
oh yes since we did find by even

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.730 
oh yes since we did find by even
assessing<00:01:17.540> the<00:01:17.630> audio<00:01:17.960> that<00:01:18.200> there<00:01:18.380> were<00:01:18.470> both

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
assessing the audio that there were both

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.260 
assessing the audio that there were both
good<00:01:18.950> for<00:01:19.100> different<00:01:19.220> situations<00:01:19.909> that's

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
good for different situations that's

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.910 
good for different situations that's
right<00:01:20.479> even<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:20.750> audio<00:01:21.110> it's<00:01:21.320> different<00:01:21.680> but

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
right even the audio it's different but

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.530 
right even the audio it's different but
it's<00:01:22.040> not<00:01:22.159> necessarily<00:01:22.760> that<00:01:22.880> one<00:01:23.299> is

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
it's not necessarily that one is

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.789 
it's not necessarily that one is
actually<00:01:23.720> better<00:01:24.080> than<00:01:24.320> the<00:01:24.380> other<00:01:24.590> I

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
actually better than the other I

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.280 
actually better than the other I
personally<00:01:25.280> prefer<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:25.670> GoPro<00:01:26.119> Hero<00:01:26.150> 3<00:01:26.540> but

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
personally prefer the GoPro Hero 3 but

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.050 
personally prefer the GoPro Hero 3 but
the<00:01:27.439> Hero<00:01:27.680> 3<00:01:27.920> plus<00:01:28.310> in<00:01:28.610> a<00:01:28.670> noisy<00:01:29.000> environment

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
the Hero 3 plus in a noisy environment

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.880 
the Hero 3 plus in a noisy environment
is<00:01:29.869> probably<00:01:30.229> going<00:01:30.350> to<00:01:30.409> have<00:01:30.500> more<00:01:30.530> of<00:01:30.740> a

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
is probably going to have more of a
