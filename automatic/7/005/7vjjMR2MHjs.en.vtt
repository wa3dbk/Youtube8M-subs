00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:14.329
 Hello in this way I would like to show how they are currently updating 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:17.990
 check or monitor without them giving you one 

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:19.769
 own this is nasty 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.449
 provide 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.710
 if the corporation of a website changes me is a separate one 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.899
 rss feed today is actually mandatory 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:29.720
 so far it was the hardest for 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.970
 to find this video at all a time that offers no difference and where 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.490
 it would still be reasonably useful 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.420
 but should still have found one and that computer questionnaire in March 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.610
 A website where you can ask questions that will be asked by the community 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.470
 answered Â«I just looked for a question like this 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.360
 If one changes with HP their attitude is the e-mail offerer 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.110
 so answers are not yet given 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.230
 PET sda is interested in who could ask this question 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.620
 pc-user are these are currently wanting to watch 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.470
 So coupe I go everytime 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.470
 Open cache Neustadt 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.920
 or like here my Firefox to the site http // blog points / ww punks 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.280
 the EHC 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.200
 first it with the touring life with 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.650
 two is written 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.240
 Come point 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.240
 promptly come by RSS 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.290
 if we enter here the appropriate URL 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.880
 to press it came 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.570
 and pretty 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.140
 only if the page meets them 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.140
 offered as rss-feed 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.840
 here is the link with the problem we are back in ours 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.070
 cache 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.840
 Legend address copying Solar System Firefox that would of course be ours 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.140
 Open Feed Reader I'll do it four times now 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.360
 with the 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.360
 Mozilla also regrets 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.150
 they definitely do the fan work of their own mistakes for that 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.109
 has become a block and justice administration 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:13.369
 Of course Berlin has it so easy here then on the right side 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:15.239
 but you have to manage 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.690
 just add the whole thing 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.109
 a movie is created only in the back 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.109
 you should see it all here 

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:28.529
 I do not see any of this right now 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:30.939
 let's go 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:32.209
 were discovered 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.939
 and staff as something is discovered gets what she is quite normal as 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.469
 Peace offered 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:41.640
 Of course it depends on how often this website is checked here 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.930
 a normal Philipp who certainly updates almost now I say 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.239
 happy so 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.109
 for example, our Fed itself as the governments from Neuss online 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.109
 So everything is right at peace and when we are losing peace 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:57.009
 About 15 minutes later, then he gets the course, too 

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:02.689
 directly with work can not stand how often Red Stuhr RSS this 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:05.689
 web pages checked we assume that the but a lot 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:10.680
 Websites have to check that they're really now 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:14.449
 Do not assume that it's better than once a day 

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:15.790
 pro only holds 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.010
 but much wanted is still better than hundreds of pages over 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.789
 be open 

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:23.789
 just to see if I did something then 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:26.019
 So just know the whole thing
