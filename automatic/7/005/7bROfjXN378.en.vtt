00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.360
 good this is a video for the channel 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.270
 of boxing without reviews of 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.970
 dfc box for youtube and well then 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.300
 we will be the power source 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.770
 Templar emperor 750 should be noted 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:31.270
 which is a power source 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:31.270
 modular 750 watt voltage the truth 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:34.809
 i 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.910
 that is to say that I wait for the truth 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.710
 on the part of templars as always 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.909
 the box is the modules that now 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.630
 we will teach how it works and such is 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:18.850
 rather curious the modular sources 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.850
 and here already all the cables collected 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.360
 current 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.360
 to plug it in directly 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:35.090
 and good here we have 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.070
 when screws to put it in the box 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.700
 comes well protected to the source that is 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.700
 important 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.689
 At first glance we see that it is quite 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:52.049
 curious the truth because it has here the 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.010
 Templars shield what did not we 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.000
 we usually find in others 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.960
 8 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.960
 and good 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.170
 let's get it out of the plastic 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:19.110
 If I'm not mistaken, it's a 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:21.710
 It is a 14-inch fan 14 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.710
 centimeters 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.490
 two 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.640
 and this is where we put the modules that 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.140
 we will need these already have positions 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.590
 because this is what is going to be used 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:39.250
 yes or yes and they are 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:42.430
 the plate connector which is 20 + 4 pins 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.970
 that this one goes to the beach and this is the one 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.890
 the cpu that we usually put one or 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.209
 we put the two already in plates more 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.430
 powerful that is the 44 and well these the 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.560
 sets already on the source because 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.350
 you are going to grind them yes or yes and if not 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.440
 you put them, you will not have a computer 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.710
 and well now we will explain how the 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:10.370
 different modules we found that 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:16.310
 have we found that has 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:18.920
 for 5 that is, we have 5 moles cables 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.700
 which are the so-called cables of 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.450
 food and d 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:29.819
 everyone has this has two and this 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:32.160
 has three we have five are used 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.170
 for recorders and old hard drives 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.920
 and is currently used to 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.870
 fans and other good things of 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.390
 low voltage and that link scared 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.900
 plugged in plates simply goes with the 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.480
 power supply and direct 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.330
 and now 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.680
 this plug directly plugs 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.940
 here 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.060
 in each module of the 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.060
 It is not 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:08.530
 and well we already have a module placed 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:11.459
 if we also notice 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.459
 this connector 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.570
 and good and so the grace of the modules 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.610
 is to put since they are sources of 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.970
 high voltage power and get 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:31.150
 for many many many many many many 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.190
 connectors then clear if it were not 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.870
 with modules what happens to us is that we 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.790
 all cables are very loose 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.550
 then with this we have a computer 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.010
 very well collected inside without hardly 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.470
 cables or more than anything those that 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.890
 let's use and it's already there are never 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.780
 hanging wires or anything and well let's 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.560
 teach what else has we already taught 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.560
 the moles 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.530
 we see that it has the attacks are those that 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.600
 are currently used for discs 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:03.950
 hard and recorders but the ones that we have 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.420
 here four and here are other pictures what 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.500
 that will allow us to put eight 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.500
 room devices 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.320
 here this is the same thing you put in the 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.320
 same sites 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:31.439
 and here we have the fish 3 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.420
 62 that are exclusively for 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.420
 graphs 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:41.380
 for the quite powerful graphics that 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:46.080
 they require consumption 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:49.770
 then we see that we have 2 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:52.770
 2 and in each there are two to put up 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.670
 two powerful graphics or 4 consumption 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:58.169
 pretty basic 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:00.810
 and good 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:03.689
 until the ice in boxing we have seen the 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.870
 Templar emperor 750 the fountain 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:12.110
 very powerful 750 watt power 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:12.110
 that covers almost all 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.659
 and professionals 

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:20.849
 and good to today's singh quilombo 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:23.269
 Thanks for the visit and we will see you in 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:23.269
 another video
