and then I'll be showing some examples

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.550 
and then I'll be showing some examples
so<00:00:19.020> first<00:00:19.939> duplicate<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.090> layer<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.900> this

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
so first duplicate the layer of this

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.500

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
screenshot of soy una and in one of my

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.750 
screenshot of soy una and in one of my
animations<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.289> I'll<00:00:25.740> go<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:25.980> Gaussian<00:00:26.550> blur

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
animations and I'll go to Gaussian blur

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.080 
animations and I'll go to Gaussian blur
and<00:00:28.340> make<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.640> blur<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:30.029> little<00:00:31.520> then<00:00:32.520> set<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
and make and blur a little then set the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.760 
and make and blur a little then set the
opacity<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.719> 40%<00:00:34.969> and<00:00:35.969> merge<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.200> layer<00:00:37.500> with

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
opacity to 40% and merge that layer with

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.280 
opacity to 40% and merge that layer with
original<00:00:39.500> and<00:00:40.610> now<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.670> can<00:00:42.059> go<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.719> apply

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
original and now you can go and apply

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.010 
original and now you can go and apply
different<00:00:43.379> effects<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.629> adjustments<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.899> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
different effects and adjustments to the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.970 
different effects and adjustments to the
image<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.950> duplicate<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.640> layer<00:00:47.789> again<00:00:48.980> and

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
image so duplicate the layer again and

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.930 
image so duplicate the layer again and
go<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.309> blur<00:00:50.629> Gaussian<00:00:51.629> blur<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.730> make<00:00:53.730> it

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
go to blur Gaussian blur and make it

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:02.030 
go to blur Gaussian blur and make it
even<00:00:54.780> more<00:00:54.930> blur<00:00:55.260> than<00:00:55.530> before

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.630 

click<00:01:02.820> okay<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.480> set<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.500> opacity<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:05.070> 40%<00:01:05.220> of

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
click okay and set the opacity to 40% of

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.580 
click okay and set the opacity to 40% of
one<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:05.970> once<00:01:06.360> again

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.429 

so<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.310> original<00:01:14.369> looks<00:01:14.939> like<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
so the original looks like this and the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.620 
so the original looks like this and the
after<00:01:16.860> I'll<00:01:17.040> come<00:01:17.310> with<00:01:17.460> like<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.360> it

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
after I'll come with like this and it

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.499 
after I'll come with like this and it
gives<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:19.170> really<00:01:19.290> soft<00:01:20.159> effective<00:01:20.909> image<00:01:21.240> and

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
gives a really soft effective image and

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.260 
gives a really soft effective image and
you<00:01:22.229> can<00:01:22.340> experiment<00:01:23.340> with<00:01:23.610> many<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.119> the

bring the image even more color dodge
will<00:03:04.830> give<00:03:04.980> it<00:03:05.099> a<00:03:05.160> really<00:03:05.459> nice<00:03:05.760> negative

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
will give it a really nice negative

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.800 
will give it a really nice negative
inverted<00:03:06.780> effect<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:08.489> color<00:03:09.180> burn<00:03:09.390> will<00:03:09.690> make

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
inverted effect and color burn will make

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.040 
inverted effect and color burn will make
it<00:03:09.930> look<00:03:10.050> like<00:03:10.110> this<00:03:10.970> dark<00:03:11.970> in<00:03:12.239> so<00:03:12.810> just

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
it look like this dark in so just

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.870 
it look like this dark in so just
experiment<00:03:13.650> with<00:03:13.739> many<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.280> filters<00:03:14.700> and

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
experiment with many of the filters and

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:25.670 
experiment with many of the filters and
adjustments

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:34.860 

so<00:03:26.370> brighten<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.090> image<00:03:27.209> again

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.500 

and<00:03:35.290> now<00:03:35.470> I'm<00:03:35.650> going<00:03:35.890> to<00:03:36.040> do<00:03:36.220> is<00:03:36.519> modify<00:03:37.360> the

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
and now I'm going to do is modify the

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.900 
and now I'm going to do is modify the
colors<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.440> image<00:03:38.739> here<00:03:39.280> you<00:03:39.340> can<00:03:39.459> modify<00:03:39.730> the

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
colors the image here you can modify the

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.009 
colors the image here you can modify the
tones<00:03:40.450> and<00:03:41.290> brightness<00:03:42.480> for<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:43.540> highlights

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
tones and brightness for the highlights

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.589 
tones and brightness for the highlights
I'll<00:03:44.379> modify<00:03:44.800> the<00:03:45.010> colors<00:03:45.640> of<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.090> fright<00:03:46.420> or

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
I'll modify the colors of the fright or

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.809 
I'll modify the colors of the fright or
colors<00:03:46.930> and<00:03:47.769> I'll<00:03:47.890> make<00:03:48.040> it<00:03:48.190> yellow<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:48.730> the

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
colors and I'll make it yellow and the

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.420 
colors and I'll make it yellow and the
shadows<00:03:49.269> I'll<00:03:49.510> make<00:03:49.690> them<00:03:49.840> rent<00:03:50.200> so<00:03:51.099> give<00:03:51.400> a

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
shadows I'll make them rent so give a

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:58.410 
shadows I'll make them rent so give a
nice<00:03:51.750> golden<00:03:52.750> kind<00:03:53.319> of<00:03:53.410> know<00:03:55.890> and<00:03:57.390> they're<00:03:58.390> all

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
nice golden kind of know and they're all

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:14.680 
nice golden kind of know and they're all
seem<00:03:58.810> like<00:03:59.220> she's<00:04:00.220> looking<00:04:00.519> at<00:04:00.730> a<00:04:00.760> fire

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.890 

and<00:04:14.780> you<00:04:15.110> can<00:04:15.260> also<00:04:15.410> make<00:04:15.800> it<00:04:16.420> extrude<00:04:17.420> out<00:04:17.600> and

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
and you can also make it extrude out and

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.890 
and you can also make it extrude out and
stuff<00:04:18.140> like<00:04:18.940> when<00:04:19.940> you're<00:04:20.360> zooming<00:04:20.750> out

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
stuff like when you're zooming out

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.800 
stuff like when you're zooming out
really<00:04:21.620> fast<00:04:22.460> or<00:04:22.730> zooming<00:04:23.090> in<00:04:23.270> really<00:04:23.630> fast

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
really fast or zooming in really fast

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.770 
really fast or zooming in really fast
you<00:04:24.080> can<00:04:24.320> also<00:04:24.530> make<00:04:24.950> it<00:04:24.980> like<00:04:25.280> a<00:04:25.870> like<00:04:26.870> a<00:04:27.080> blur

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
you can also make it like a like a blur

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.080 
you can also make it like a like a blur
so<00:04:29.780> you<00:04:29.840> can<00:04:30.350> instead<00:04:31.340> of<00:04:31.430> doing<00:04:31.640> Gaussian

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
so you can instead of doing Gaussian

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.590 
so you can instead of doing Gaussian
blur<00:04:32.300> -<00:04:32.630> radial<00:04:33.140> blur<00:04:33.580> and<00:04:34.580> it'll<00:04:35.390> look<00:04:35.450> like

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
blur - radial blur and it'll look like

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.850 
blur - radial blur and it'll look like
this<00:04:35.840> and<00:04:36.080> set<00:04:36.350> though<00:04:36.470> fast<00:04:36.740> feet<00:04:36.980> to<00:04:37.190> 40<00:04:37.610> and

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
this and set though fast feet to 40 and

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:49.350 
this and set though fast feet to 40 and
I'll<00:04:39.860> look<00:04:40.070> something<00:04:40.370> like<00:04:40.400> this

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:56.710 

and<00:04:49.840> all<00:04:50.319> of<00:04:50.349> this<00:04:50.590> add<00:04:50.860> a<00:04:50.889> few<00:04:51.159> more

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.050 

and<00:04:56.810> these<00:04:57.410> effects<00:04:57.770> can<00:04:57.950> be<00:04:57.980> used<00:04:58.400> at<00:04:58.700> a<00:04:58.730> fight

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
and these effects can be used at a fight

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.050 
and these effects can be used at a fight
and<00:04:59.570> a<00:05:00.200> lot<00:05:00.470> of<00:05:00.500> things<00:05:00.860> look<00:05:01.520> just<00:05:01.760> like<00:05:01.910> I

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
and a lot of things look just like I

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.600 
and a lot of things look just like I
said<00:05:02.330> here<00:05:02.990> are<00:05:03.140> a<00:05:03.170> few<00:05:03.200> examples<00:05:03.950> of<00:05:04.280> some<00:05:04.580> of

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
said here are a few examples of some of

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.730 
said here are a few examples of some of
my<00:05:04.850> artworks<00:05:05.300> that<00:05:05.390> I've<00:05:05.570> drawn<00:05:05.900> in<00:05:06.260> Photoshop

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.280 
my artworks that I've drawn in Photoshop
I<00:05:06.770> painted<00:05:07.280> myself<00:05:07.460> and<00:05:08.000> some<00:05:08.900> screenshots

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290
