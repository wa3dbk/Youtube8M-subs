00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.010
 but today 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.610
 At 1040 now theatrical computer right in the limelight with the 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.700
 France's FM 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:13.699
 Let's go with it 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:15.579
 Fleck sinn-Leffers 2 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:18.029
 seven passengers made 87 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.029
 we will 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:22.779
 software 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.460
 while Heidfeld 15 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.359
 Knut the Neuburger Cessna 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.359
 wants to give up 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.500
 from there topped with fresh food 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.500
 located 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.660
 the 1 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.810
 against real added value 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.810
 SchÃ¤ffler in Dortmund talk 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.380
 just the final touch 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.670
 the escape 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.670
 20 years ago already at the children's game 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.740
 This publication easily falls into the body 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.750
 the noise 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.190
 the years and 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.910
 it builds 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.910
 new game on that you all know 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.460
 were parallel 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.400
 did not bring 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.720
 hours 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.710
 Days and 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.710
 Manchester and months with it 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.250
 and now 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.150
 Samples won because of the advise 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.280
 your opponent's less sense 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.280
 played next to clouds and occasional 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.530
 greaves 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.550
 had in the program 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.790
 which a decade ago two decades ago 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.060
 and contest the next game, "he said 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.229
 World loaded with these is GST 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:15.889
 sports at home entertainment 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:17.170
 is controlled 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.609
 it is 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:22.929
 Spindler variant central to Razavi Dorfstr Med 

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:29.619
 Nearly 30 000 this trend has once let a mac computer 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.939
 Power cable and food eaten 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:37.119
 instead of the inscription points earned as you still buoyancy 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.709
 I am going to enter in place now 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:47.469
 but for that 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:49.259
 for the music 

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:50.359
 li plays 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.359
 because the fault 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:09.049
 and yet Metzelder starts 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.989
 Peter Struck, however, still sees considerable growth 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.789
 I can not do that 

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:19.639
 At least in the world the capital has become called 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:23.309
 Go to point pm 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.939
 one at that time 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.299
 earth-shattering 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.639
 STEK EBIT these ranks this one program once with the man 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.659
 the bands are 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:38.179
 with weapons Bochum could today 

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:41.179
 Of course, every program was also bugged 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:45.669
 maunz 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.669
 with a new program 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:51.999
 not even music style but if 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:54.719
 she demands the big one 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:55.969
 Stories of 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:57.809
 port-au-prince 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:00.609
 and above all, as once the cost 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.319
 Canas 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:03.609
 I am in this case 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:04.560
 under it were 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.560
 but is unlearned leader in the last 20 years 

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:12.929
 this includes the toll is also a bit rusty 

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:15.929
 a Basler important at least 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.519
 and that will be the next one 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.360
 despite all this applause belongs to my opponent's computer 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:27.840
 Port-au-prince liked 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.779
 lead this 

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:29.619
 played for him
