one was revealed back in May we knew
that<00:00:23.039> as<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.609> games<00:00:23.880> when<00:00:24.240> stalling<00:00:24.810> from<00:00:25.080> the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
disk onto the hard drive of the system

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.169 
disk onto the hard drive of the system
you<00:00:29.099> would<00:00:29.279> actually<00:00:29.400> be<00:00:29.609> able<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.970> play<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
you would actually be able to play the

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.120 
you would actually be able to play the
title<00:00:30.570> now<00:00:30.960> there's<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.320> purpose<00:00:31.710> behind<00:00:31.859> this

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
title now there's a purpose behind this

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.389 
title now there's a purpose behind this
of<00:00:32.340> course<00:00:32.399> back<00:00:33.329> then<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.870> system<00:00:34.399> required

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
of course back then the system required

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.459 
of course back then the system required
an<00:00:35.670> always-online<00:00:36.120> connection<00:00:36.960> and

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
an always-online connection and

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.760 
an always-online connection and
therefore<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.760> desk<00:00:39.059> once<00:00:39.480> been<00:00:40.200> installed

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
therefore the desk once been installed

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.530 
therefore the desk once been installed
you<00:00:41.129> could<00:00:41.280> basically<00:00:41.460> throw<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.000> disc<00:00:42.149> away

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
you could basically throw the disc away

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.110 
you could basically throw the disc away
now<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.530> course<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:44.010> disc<00:00:44.219> still<00:00:44.640> must<00:00:44.850> be<00:00:44.940> in

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
now of course the disc still must be in

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.720 
now of course the disc still must be in
the<00:00:45.239> tray<00:00:45.539> however<00:00:46.350> Microsoft<00:00:47.129> have<00:00:47.610> been

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
the tray however Microsoft have been

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.139 
the tray however Microsoft have been
extremely<00:00:48.090> keen<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:49.410> encourage<00:00:50.149> digital

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
extremely keen to encourage digital

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.700 
extremely keen to encourage digital
downloads<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.870> there<00:00:51.989> are<00:00:52.079> numerous<00:00:52.320> reasons

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
downloads and there are numerous reasons

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.319 
downloads and there are numerous reasons
for<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:55.489> suffice<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.550> say<00:00:56.730> one<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
for this but suffice to say one of the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.209 
for this but suffice to say one of the
best<00:00:57.629> ways<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.840> do<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.230> would<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.859> course<00:00:59.100> be

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
best ways to do this would of course be

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.240 
best ways to do this would of course be
to<00:00:59.609> allow<00:00:59.879> players<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.469> get<00:01:01.469> hold<00:01:01.739> off<00:01:02.010> and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
to allow players to get hold off and

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.250 
to allow players to get hold off and
start<00:01:02.760> enjoying<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.300> titles<00:01:03.719> as<00:01:03.870> early<00:01:04.170> as

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
start enjoying the titles as early as

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.770 
start enjoying the titles as early as
possible<00:01:04.559> therefore<00:01:05.519> just<00:01:06.360> like<00:01:06.600> their

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
possible therefore just like their

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.920 
possible therefore just like their
rivals<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.560> PlayStation<00:01:08.430> with<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.510> xbox

playing that title and that's really
good<00:01:25.259> news<00:01:25.290> because<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.950> means<00:01:26.070> you'll<00:01:26.340> be

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
good news because that means you'll be

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
able to jump in a hell of a lot faster

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.690 
able to jump in a hell of a lot faster
and<00:01:28.170> when<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.619> consider<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.189> games<00:01:29.460> now

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
and when you consider the games now

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.160 
and when you consider the games now
going<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.030> become<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.420> hell<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.840> lot<00:01:30.960> bigger

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
going to become a hell of a lot bigger

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.890 
going to become a hell of a lot bigger
thanks<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.490> much<00:01:32.670> bigger<00:01:32.850> texture<00:01:33.420> sizes

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
thanks to the much bigger texture sizes

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.899 
thanks to the much bigger texture sizes
and<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.229> forth<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:35.189> course<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.700> amount

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
and so forth that of course the amount

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.429 
and so forth that of course the amount
of<00:01:35.939> RAM<00:01:36.180> on<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.479> console<00:01:36.869> as<00:01:37.020> well<00:01:37.229> as<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
of RAM on the console as well as the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.219 
of RAM on the console as well as the
blu-ray<00:01:37.860> drive<00:01:38.390> inherent<00:01:39.390> into<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.750> system

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
blu-ray drive inherent into the system

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.289 
blu-ray drive inherent into the system
you<00:01:40.829> can<00:01:40.979> imagine<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:41.790> how<00:01:41.939> much<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.210> a

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
you can imagine it just how much of a

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.719 
you can imagine it just how much of a
difference<00:01:42.600> that's<00:01:42.780> going<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.110> make<00:01:43.290> in

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
difference that's going to make in

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.660 
difference that's going to make in
ballooning<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.939> size<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.450> games<00:01:46.490> so<00:01:47.490> does

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
ballooning the size of the games so does

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.310 
ballooning the size of the games so does
that<00:01:47.700> mean<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:49.020> pure

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
that mean that and this is pure

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.170 
that mean that and this is pure
speculation<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:50.130> my<00:01:50.280> part<00:01:50.310> does<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:50.970> mean

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
speculation on my part does that mean

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.090 
speculation on my part does that mean
that<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.630> going<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.840> be<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.079> same<00:01:52.350> for

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
that this is going to be the same for

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.569 
that this is going to be the same for
updates<00:01:53.610> as<00:01:53.790> well<00:01:54.149> well<00:01:55.079> most<00:01:55.649> likely<00:01:56.009> for

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
updates as well well most likely for

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.120 
updates as well well most likely for
multiplayer<00:01:57.180> focused<00:01:57.540> games<00:01:58.049> probably<00:01:58.530> not

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
multiplayer focused games probably not

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.539 
multiplayer focused games probably not
because<00:02:00.110> obviously<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:02.009> would<00:02:02.159> not<00:02:02.310> simply

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
because obviously you would not simply

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.709 
because obviously you would not simply
be<00:02:02.729> able<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.509> jump<00:02:03.869> into<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.290> server<00:02:05.090> while<00:02:06.090> you

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
be able to jump into a server while you

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.020 
be able to jump into a server while you
have<00:02:06.750> an<00:02:07.320> old<00:02:07.619> portion<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.610> code<00:02:08.819> for

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
have an old portion of the code for

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.790 
have an old portion of the code for
example<00:02:09.479> let's<00:02:09.509> say<00:02:09.780> you're<00:02:09.929> playing<00:02:10.200> call<00:02:10.770> of

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
example let's say you're playing call of

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.320 
example let's say you're playing call of
duty<00:02:11.030> ghosts

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
duty ghosts

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.570 
duty ghosts
and<00:02:12.510> this<00:02:13.020> just<00:02:13.290> make<00:02:13.500> this<00:02:13.680> easy<00:02:13.830> let's<00:02:14.340> say

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
and this just make this easy let's say

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.540 
and this just make this easy let's say
that<00:02:14.790> your<00:02:15.000> base<00:02:15.270> game<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.900> 1.0<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.010> the

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
that your base game is 1.0 and the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.220 
that your base game is 1.0 and the
version<00:02:17.850> on<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.090> server<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.750> everyone<00:02:19.110> else

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
version on the server that everyone else

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.950 
version on the server that everyone else
is<00:02:19.350> playing<00:02:19.590> is<00:02:19.860> 2.0<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:20.910> let's<00:02:21.390> say<00:02:21.630> that

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
is playing is 2.0 and let's say that

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.820 
is playing is 2.0 and let's say that
their<00:02:22.140> 2.0<00:02:22.920> patch<00:02:23.340> fixed<00:02:24.590> various<00:02:25.590> issues

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
their 2.0 patch fixed various issues

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.730 
their 2.0 patch fixed various issues
that's<00:02:26.520> safe<00:02:26.790> example<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.660> I'm<00:02:27.870> just<00:02:28.590> going

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
that's safe example that I'm just going

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.440 
that's safe example that I'm just going
to<00:02:28.770> use<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:28.950> very<00:02:29.430> silly<00:02:29.760> example<00:02:30.210> but<00:02:30.240> let's

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
to use a very silly example but let's

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.300 
to use a very silly example but let's
just<00:02:30.540> say<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:31.050> in<00:02:31.200> one<00:02:31.410> particular<00:02:31.620> area<00:02:32.040> of

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
just say that in one particular area of

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.880 
just say that in one particular area of
one<00:02:32.520> map<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:33.360> could<00:02:33.600> say<00:02:33.810> semi<00:02:34.200> clip<00:02:34.590> for<00:02:34.830> a

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
one map you could say semi clip for a

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.770 
one map you could say semi clip for a
wall<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.430> still<00:02:35.670> shoot<00:02:35.970> someone<00:02:36.330> through<00:02:36.630> it

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
wall and still shoot someone through it

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.050 
wall and still shoot someone through it
as<00:02:36.900> well<00:02:36.930> as<00:02:37.260> say<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.740> couple<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.520> guns<00:02:38.790> were

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
as well as say a couple of the guns were

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.780 
as well as say a couple of the guns were
a<00:02:39.120> bit<00:02:39.330> too<00:02:39.480> overpowered<00:02:40.170> on<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.220> base<00:02:41.430> games

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
a bit too overpowered on the base games

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.830 
a bit too overpowered on the base games
that'd<00:02:42.120> be<00:02:42.210> 1.0<00:02:43.160> well<00:02:44.160> on<00:02:44.250> 2.0<00:02:44.820> of<00:02:45.120> course<00:02:45.390> that

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
that'd be 1.0 well on 2.0 of course that

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.080 
that'd be 1.0 well on 2.0 of course that
could<00:02:46.080> remain<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.440> problem<00:02:47.010> on<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.700> other<00:02:47.850> hand

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
could remain a problem on the other hand

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.120 
could remain a problem on the other hand
what<00:02:48.360> could<00:02:48.600> possibly<00:02:49.080> happen<00:02:49.380> is<00:02:49.740> when<00:02:50.010> you

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
what could possibly happen is when you

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.980 
what could possibly happen is when you
join<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.820> server<00:02:51.209> though<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.600> won't<00:02:51.780> be<00:02:51.930> able

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
join the server though you won't be able

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.290 
join the server though you won't be able
to<00:02:52.110> instantaneously<00:02:52.680> jump<00:02:53.400> on<00:02:53.640> you<00:02:54.120> won't

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
to instantaneously jump on you won't

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.910 
to instantaneously jump on you won't
need<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.480> restart<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.080> game<00:02:55.290> or<00:02:55.500> whatever<00:02:55.650> it

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
need to restart the game or whatever it

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.940 
need to restart the game or whatever it
will<00:02:56.010> simply<00:02:56.310> say<00:02:56.490> okay<00:02:56.910> well<00:02:57.600> tom<00:02:58.080> has<00:02:58.380> an<00:02:58.680> old

will simply say okay well tom has an old

version of the code it will first of all
update<00:03:01.500> your<00:03:01.650> system<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:02.250> then<00:03:02.520> allow<00:03:02.790> you<00:03:02.850> to

update your system and then allow you to

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.330 
update your system and then allow you to
play<00:03:03.180> it's<00:03:03.780> just<00:03:03.990> pure<00:03:04.440> speculation<00:03:04.740> of<00:03:05.190> my

play it's just pure speculation of my

point apart by the way I haven't that's

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.800 
point apart by the way I haven't that's
not<00:03:07.650> confirmed<00:03:08.160> or<00:03:08.400> whatever<00:03:08.670> but<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:09.660> would

make some that some level of sense I

criticisms I've always had with the

criticisms I've always had with the
previous<00:03:18.510> generation<00:03:19.290> consoles<00:03:20.120> so<00:03:21.120> that

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
previous generation consoles so that

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.750 
previous generation consoles so that
would<00:03:21.390> be<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.739> Xbox<00:03:22.739> as<00:03:23.280> well<00:03:23.519> as<00:03:23.640> of<00:03:23.730> course

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
would be the Xbox as well as of course

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.460 
would be the Xbox as well as of course
the<00:03:24.150> PlayStation<00:03:24.750> particularly<00:03:25.350> the

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
PlayStation 3 as it turns out I found

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.710 
PlayStation 3 as it turns out I found
them<00:03:28.739> a<00:03:28.920> little<00:03:29.340> bit<00:03:29.580> sluggish<00:03:29.910> particularly

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
them a little bit sluggish particularly

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.310 
them a little bit sluggish particularly
the<00:03:30.959> AI<00:03:31.110> so<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.130> UI<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.790> navigation<00:03:33.570> of<00:03:33.750> the

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
the AI so the UI and navigation of the

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.890 
the AI so the UI and navigation of the
PlayStation<00:03:35.040> felt<00:03:35.580> very<00:03:36.120> much<00:03:36.269> a<00:03:36.450> hindrance

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
PlayStation felt very much a hindrance

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.259 
PlayStation felt very much a hindrance
and<00:03:37.380> very<00:03:37.739> slow<00:03:38.340> at<00:03:39.330> times<00:03:39.600> and<00:03:39.930> so<00:03:41.269> Sony

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
and very slow at times and so Sony

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.090 
and very slow at times and so Sony
themselves<00:03:42.930> admitted<00:03:43.500> that<00:03:43.709> one<00:03:43.890> of<00:03:44.040> the

eliminated most disc-based games on PC
is<00:04:13.500> simple<00:04:15.680> convenience<00:04:16.680> if<00:04:17.010> a<00:04:17.700> price<00:04:18.030> is

is simple convenience if a price is

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.900 
is simple convenience if a price is
roughly<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:18.840> same<00:04:19.609> especially<00:04:20.609> if<00:04:20.700> it's<00:04:20.820> a

roughly the same especially if it's a

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.340 
roughly the same especially if it's a
little<00:04:21.150> bit<00:04:21.270> cheaper<00:04:21.630> that's<00:04:21.840> just<00:04:22.020> a<00:04:22.140> bonus

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
little bit cheaper that's just a bonus

little bit cheaper that's just a bonus
most<00:04:22.890> people<00:04:23.250> will<00:04:23.400> say<00:04:23.580> you<00:04:23.640> know<00:04:23.760> what<00:04:24.090> I've

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
most people will say you know what I've

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.530 
most people will say you know what I've
got<00:04:24.450> the<00:04:24.570> bandwidth

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540

got the bandwidth
bear<00:04:25.690> and<00:04:25.990> therefore<00:04:26.680> I<00:04:26.710> might<00:04:27.040> as<00:04:27.220> well<00:04:27.250> just

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
bear and therefore I might as well just

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.250 
bear and therefore I might as well just
go<00:04:27.730> for<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.000> digital<00:04:28.390> download<00:04:28.780> at<00:04:28.900> least<00:04:29.080> I

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
go for the digital download at least I

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.090 
go for the digital download at least I
do<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.820> of<00:04:31.540> course<00:04:31.600> as<00:04:32.050> I<00:04:32.260> said<00:04:32.500> games<00:04:32.920> are

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
do and of course as I said games are

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.260 
do and of course as I said games are
going<00:04:33.220> to<00:04:33.280> become<00:04:33.400> a<00:04:33.550> hell<00:04:33.820> of<00:04:33.850> a<00:04:33.970> lot<00:04:34.090> bigger

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
going to become a hell of a lot bigger

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.020 
going to become a hell of a lot bigger
and<00:04:34.630> therefore<00:04:35.320> even<00:04:36.070> if<00:04:36.310> you've<00:04:36.460> got<00:04:36.640> fast

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
and therefore even if you've got fast

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.970 
and therefore even if you've got fast
internet<00:04:37.540> connection<00:04:38.110> it's<00:04:38.500> still<00:04:38.710> going<00:04:38.770> to

their<00:04:49.330> servers<00:04:49.870> again<00:04:49.990> hammered<00:04:50.590> for<00:04:51.190> example

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
their servers again hammered for example

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.030 
their servers again hammered for example
pure<00:04:53.010> talk<00:04:54.010> and<00:04:54.600> pure<00:04:55.600> thought<00:04:56.320> process<00:04:56.770> on<00:04:56.890> my

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
part pure fort exercise but my

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.240 
part pure fort exercise but my
connection<00:05:01.570> is<00:05:01.750> more<00:05:02.080> than<00:05:02.230> capable<00:05:02.380> of<00:05:02.770> doing

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
connection is more than capable of doing

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.280 
connection is more than capable of doing
16<00:05:03.730> megabytes<00:05:04.150> per<00:05:04.450> second<00:05:04.780> download<00:05:04.930> I've

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
16 megabytes per second download I've

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.310 
16 megabytes per second download I've
got<00:05:05.440> 120<00:05:06.010> megabyte<00:05:06.370> per<00:05:06.490> second<00:05:06.820> connection

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
got 120 megabyte per second connection

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.000 
got 120 megabyte per second connection
so<00:05:09.270> steam<00:05:10.270> itself<00:05:10.750> is<00:05:11.110> normally<00:05:11.710> quite

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
so steam itself is normally quite

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.160 
so steam itself is normally quite
capable<00:05:12.550> maxing<00:05:13.180> that<00:05:13.390> out<00:05:13.570> however<00:05:13.840> the

capable maxing that out however the

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.750 
capable maxing that out however the
moment<00:05:14.530> as<00:05:14.650> many<00:05:15.130> of<00:05:15.220> you<00:05:15.310> guys<00:05:15.490> probably

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
moment as many of you guys probably

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.060 
moment as many of you guys probably
aware<00:05:16.270> the<00:05:16.480> steam<00:05:16.750> summer<00:05:17.080> sales<00:05:17.440> are<00:05:17.770> running

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
aware the steam summer sales are running

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.860 
aware the steam summer sales are running
and<00:05:18.220> so<00:05:18.670> because<00:05:19.000> there<00:05:19.120> were<00:05:19.210> so<00:05:19.240> many<00:05:19.510> cheap

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
and so because there were so many cheap

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.790 
and so because there were so many cheap
titles<00:05:20.410> the<00:05:20.650> service<00:05:21.100> sometimes<00:05:21.760> get

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.350 
titles the service sometimes get
absolutely<00:05:23.800> hammered<00:05:24.010> even<00:05:24.820> though<00:05:24.970> they<00:05:25.150> are

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
absolutely hammered even though they are

absolutely hammered even though they are
