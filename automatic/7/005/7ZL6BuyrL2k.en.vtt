00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.210 

so<00:02:11.030> as<00:02:11.150> you're<00:02:11.300> running<00:02:11.569> it<00:02:11.660> just<00:02:11.690> sits

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
so as you're running it just sits

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.400 
so as you're running it just sits
lightly<00:02:13.220> on<00:02:13.520> your<00:02:13.670> waist<00:02:14.020> your<00:02:15.020> hands<00:02:15.260> are

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
lightly on your waist your hands are

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.300 
lightly on your waist your hands are
free<00:02:15.680> to<00:02:16.340> avoid<00:02:16.970> trips<00:02:17.690> or<00:02:17.930> Falls<00:02:17.959> and<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:19.190> can

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
free to avoid trips or Falls and you can

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.140 
free to avoid trips or Falls and you can
quickly<00:02:19.580> just<00:02:19.910> go<00:02:20.350> open<00:02:21.350> it<00:02:21.440> up<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:21.800> take<00:02:21.920> a<00:02:22.150> as

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
quickly just go open it up and take a as

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.350 
quickly just go open it up and take a as
much<00:02:23.420> water<00:02:23.690> as<00:02:23.870> you<00:02:23.900> want<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.209> gets

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
much water as you want and it gets

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.220 
much water as you want and it gets
lighter<00:02:26.600> as<00:02:26.900> you<00:02:27.080> as<00:02:27.410> you<00:02:27.709> run<00:02:27.920> another<00:02:29.230> type

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
lighter as you as you run another type

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.260 
lighter as you as you run another type
of<00:02:31.209> hydration<00:02:32.209> gear<00:02:32.720> is<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.890> fanny<00:02:34.580> pack<00:02:34.700> as

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
of hydration gear is the fanny pack as

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.780 
of hydration gear is the fanny pack as
we<00:02:35.480> call<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:35.959> it<00:02:36.020> takes<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.319> standard<00:02:36.890> water

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
we call it and it takes a standard water

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.500 
we call it and it takes a standard water
bottle<00:02:39.130> that<00:02:40.130> fits<00:02:40.430> in<00:02:40.670> much<00:02:41.090> like<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:41.360> one

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
bottle that fits in much like the one

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.470 
bottle that fits in much like the one
with<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.690> wrist<00:02:42.200> grip<00:02:42.380> on<00:02:42.590> it<00:02:43.300> and<00:02:44.300> it<00:02:44.390> also

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
with the wrist grip on it and it also

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.050 
with the wrist grip on it and it also
has<00:02:44.870> pockets<00:02:45.800> for<00:02:46.069> additional<00:02:46.760> items<00:02:46.850> that

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
has pockets for additional items that

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.699 
has pockets for additional items that
you<00:02:47.209> only<00:02:47.360> want<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.569> carry<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:48.440> this<00:02:48.560> one

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
you only want to carry and this one

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.030 
you only want to carry and this one
happens<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.010> have<00:02:49.100> a<00:02:50.380> an<00:02:51.380> application<00:02:51.560> that

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
happens to have a an application that

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.030 
happens to have a an application that
you<00:02:52.130> can<00:02:52.160> put<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:52.459> flask<00:02:52.850> that<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.269> can<00:02:53.420> put<00:02:54.040> goo

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
you can put a flask that you can put goo

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.500 
you can put a flask that you can put goo
or<00:02:55.220> energy<00:02:55.550> gel<00:02:55.790> in<00:02:56.030> so<00:02:56.269> that<00:02:56.360> you<00:02:56.480> don't

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
or energy gel in so that you don't

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.120 
or energy gel in so that you don't
always<00:02:56.720> have<00:02:56.959> to<00:02:57.050> carry<00:02:57.319> the<00:02:57.500> wrappers<00:02:57.950> and

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
always have to carry the wrappers and

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.400 
always have to carry the wrappers and
things<00:02:58.700> like<00:02:58.819> that<00:02:58.880> and<00:02:59.660> again<00:02:59.780> the<00:03:00.049> idea<00:03:00.350> is

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
things like that and again the idea is

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.620 
things like that and again the idea is
to<00:03:00.560> get<00:03:00.650> nice<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:00.950> snug<00:03:01.370> around<00:03:01.519> the<00:03:01.850> way<00:03:02.569> so

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
to get nice and snug around the way so

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.930 
to get nice and snug around the way so
it<00:03:02.870> doesn't<00:03:02.900> bounce<00:03:03.319> this<00:03:04.220> one<00:03:04.400> happens<00:03:04.700> to<00:03:04.760> be

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
it doesn't bounce this one happens to be

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.690 
it doesn't bounce this one happens to be
on<00:03:05.060> an<00:03:05.180> angle<00:03:05.720> so<00:03:06.290> it's<00:03:06.470> a<00:03:06.560> quick<00:03:06.769> reach<00:03:08.440> as<00:03:09.700> you

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
on an angle so it's a quick reach as you

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.819 
on an angle so it's a quick reach as you
run<00:03:10.880> so<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.180> can<00:03:11.330> get<00:03:11.540> it<00:03:11.690> without<00:03:12.260> having<00:03:12.739> to

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
run so you can get it without having to

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.630 
run so you can get it without having to
move<00:03:13.010> or<00:03:13.250> turn<00:03:13.459> a<00:03:13.670> lot<00:03:15.070> and<00:03:16.070> these<00:03:16.190> are<00:03:16.370> just<00:03:16.519> a

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
move or turn a lot and these are just a

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.130 
move or turn a lot and these are just a
couple<00:03:16.670> of<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.120> types<00:03:17.329> of<00:03:17.510> variety<00:03:17.989> of

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
couple of the types of variety of

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.890 
couple of the types of variety of
hydration<00:03:18.980> gear<00:03:19.450> my<00:03:20.450> recommendation<00:03:21.110> is<00:03:21.260> to

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
hydration gear my recommendation is to

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.310 
hydration gear my recommendation is to
look<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:24.170> do<00:03:24.950> some<00:03:25.160> research<00:03:26.079> practice<00:03:27.079> with

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
look and do some research practice with

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.470 
look and do some research practice with
some<00:03:28.010> of<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.190> different<00:03:28.340> types<00:03:28.700> this<00:03:29.150> is<00:03:29.299> the

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
some of the different types this is the

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.289 
some of the different types this is the
the<00:03:29.989> simplest<00:03:30.500> but<00:03:30.880> you're<00:03:31.880> limiting<00:03:32.239> the

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
the simplest but you're limiting the

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:33.599 
the simplest but you're limiting the
amount<00:03:32.390> of<00:03:32.570> water<00:03:32.780> that<00:03:32.930> you<00:03:32.989> could<00:03:33.200> carry

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
amount of water that you could carry

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.920 
amount of water that you could carry
some<00:03:34.609> trail<00:03:34.850> runners<00:03:35.209> will<00:03:35.359> carry<00:03:35.570> one<00:03:35.810> in

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
some trail runners will carry one in

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.289 
some trail runners will carry one in
each<00:03:36.049> hand<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.799> way<00:03:37.700> they've<00:03:37.850> got<00:03:37.880> a<00:03:38.060> lot

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
each hand that way they've got a lot

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:39.910 
each hand that way they've got a lot
more<00:03:38.329> water<00:03:38.780> and<00:03:39.109> they're<00:03:39.560> a<00:03:39.590> little<00:03:39.739> bit<00:03:39.890> more

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
more water and they're a little bit more

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.250 
more water and they're a little bit more
balanced<00:03:40.519> and<00:03:40.609> they<00:03:41.150> actually<00:03:41.600> even<00:03:41.870> use<00:03:42.049> them

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
balanced and they actually even use them

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.000 
balanced and they actually even use them
to<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:43.370> balance<00:03:44.060> themselves<00:03:44.590> if<00:03:45.590> they<00:03:45.769> happen

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
to to balance themselves if they happen

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.830 
to to balance themselves if they happen
to<00:03:46.040> fall<00:03:46.310> you<00:03:46.519> can<00:03:46.670> take<00:03:46.910> the<00:03:47.060> water<00:03:47.390> bottle

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
to fall you can take the water bottle

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.789 
to fall you can take the water bottle
we'll<00:03:48.380> take<00:03:48.560> some<00:03:48.739> of<00:03:48.769> the<00:03:48.920> impact<00:03:49.280> on<00:03:49.489> it<00:03:50.799> but

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
we'll take some of the impact on it but

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.550 
we'll take some of the impact on it but
there's<00:03:52.010> many<00:03:52.310> many<00:03:52.519> different<00:03:52.670> types<00:03:53.560> again

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
there's many many different types again
