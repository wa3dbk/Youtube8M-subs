00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.870
 Hello, they do not remember when I started my 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.240
 videos and what they did 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.360
 a little web camera and I started talking in 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.240
 front because today here the web camera 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.490
 I'm doing it is a video from me 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.120
 computer and well it happens that I'm 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.590
 taking a few days of rest because I already 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:27.449
 I needed it and I could not stop 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.130
 communicate and tell them and give them 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.219
 news that I feel are so 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.530
 important to you for me and good 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.839
 Well first of all remember that 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.039
 any kind that I give them to consult 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:43.589
 to the doctor he is the first opinion if he 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:46.949
 he says is not no if he says yes and if he says no 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:49.589
 I know I do not know and how are we going to be 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.600
 talking about inside now because 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:54.210
 many times when we have these nails 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.659
 weak or when we have our hair 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.079
 weak or when you do not believe our hair and 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:03.780
 we feel like tired is that 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.339
 we lack vitamins sometimes in the day to 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.340
 day running 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.219
 I'm studying guys I'm revealed 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.229
 much the night clubs and not 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:14.850
 we eat what we should eat I 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.429
 agreement when my children were young 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.350
 I neither food was practically the 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:21.299
 remains sometimes of the porridge of what 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.020
 accelerated that was one in the belly to 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:28.859
 another one outside and then we're going to start 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.280
 talk a little bit of the vitamins for 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:34.770
 It is very important to me to take a 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.500
 daily multivitamin does not matter which 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.039
 while it is a multivitamin that 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.369
 contain vitamin c vitamin vitamin 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.380
 e vitamin a vitamin a vitamin d good 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.539
 that I am already inventing them but a 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.549
 vitamin complex that can give us 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.679
 that food sometimes and although 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.079
 let's eat healthily 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.659
 we are not acquiring because I do not know 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.149
 how many milligrams of magnesium or zinc 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.520
 when we do not have a support of this 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.649
 way and I tell you I repeat it does not matter the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.450
 Mark me I really like zentrum in 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.729
 special because it does not hurt me 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.220
 stomach there are others that are very good 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.620
 but I feel it very heavy when 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.650
 we take a vitamin complex sometimes 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.480
 we can feel exaggeratedly 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.460
 tired exaggeratedly weak or 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.800
 we feel that the hair does not grow 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.020
 it shone that the nails are broken then 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.350
 let's start by taking a 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.290
 multivitamin after breakfast 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.780
 to have our stomach well filled 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.400
 and that it does not fall badly to us already it got rid to me 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.560
 all this little tail 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.189
 it's a tail hard to do 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.189
 to do a tutorial 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:52.850
 of vitamins but natal all 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.590
 pre natal they have practically the same 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.140
 formula when they buy a vitamin 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.780
 prenatal we already know what it has which is 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.400
 the difference of taking in 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.750
 multivitamin and a prenatal 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:08.240
 the prenatal has double quantity of everything 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:12.230
 that is, we have double double magnesium 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.920
 calcium double iron double everything 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.920
 we need 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.709
 with a deficiency of vitamins a 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.470
 little bit stronger the hair happens 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.500
 until we drop many people I made 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.950
 a great research when taking prenatal 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.739
 they see a change over time 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.159
 hair stronger hair skin 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.799
 prettiest the most beautiful nails by the 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:46.900
 reason that it has double dose as 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:54.500
 I repeat everything is a fortified center 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:56.810
 is also taken one after the 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.739
 breakfast some people feel that 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:03.650
 with the prenatal they can be constipated 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.200
 and this is because of the high dose of iron 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.239
 that has what I recommend is to use 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.209
 the prenatal if you have the case that you 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.670
 you are extracting you are nothing more or four 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.140
 times a week if you feel that you 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.750
 is squeezing a day like that 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.989
 undian and so one day there are no people who 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.210
 they do not feel anything that on the contrary I 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:28.100
 I've been using honey for a little while 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:31.150
 little duck and well I felt good 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:34.069
 felt great agility because suddenly 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:38.900
 and well, I also felt that 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:40.759
 me and if I bring the superman shirt and 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.620
 for girls or boys who are 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:44.810
 thinking that they want them to grow 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.580
 hair lighter than treatments 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.620
 what we do on the outside like shampoos and 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.349
 all this stimulate but they also take 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.419
 multivitamin is of course basic 7 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:55.250
 is a minor you have to consult 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.830
 your parents or your tutor who give you 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.320
 permission to do this but what more 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.530
 We really need if we're already going 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.030
 inward is to take care of our heart 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.210
 take care of our feelings 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.280
 strengthen us have control of our 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.919
 life because many times we are like 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.530
 the drift and we do not know where we 're going if 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:18.480
 we do not know what we want we feel 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:21.300
 out of control is important 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.850
 regain that control of our life is 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.800
 very important to know who they are to know 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.470
 what we do not want to know what we want 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.370
 know what people we want to our 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.310
 around 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.260
 enjoy a sunrise enjoy 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.370
 our friends be good friends 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:40.140
 become better people go 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.960
 strengthening inward so that 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.750
 everything we can project 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.569
 If this beautiful little flower had not 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:51.539
 started from root right from root 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:54.690
 strong from the ground with a plan of life 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.520
 I would never have come to bloom and do 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:00.060
 this beauty that we now have then 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.699
 everything has to start from the root 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.110
 inside and if we are in the image 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:06.900
 of the substance 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:10.680
 we are his perfect our perfection 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:12.960
 means having a strong spirit and 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.240
 understand that if there is a shadow in 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.820
