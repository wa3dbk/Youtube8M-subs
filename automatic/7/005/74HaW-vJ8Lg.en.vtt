my<00:00:06.150> review<00:00:06.629> of<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:07.290> Ecotech<00:00:08.189> radians<00:00:08.940> over<00:00:09.389> my

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
my review of the Ecotech radians over my

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.009 
my review of the Ecotech radians over my
90<00:00:10.110> gallon<00:00:10.410> system<00:00:10.910> a<00:00:11.910> lot<00:00:12.330> of<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.509> know<00:00:12.690> that

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
90 gallon system a lot of you know that

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.709 
90 gallon system a lot of you know that
I<00:00:13.290> was<00:00:13.590> coming<00:00:13.830> from<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.580> Eco<00:00:15.299> Tzadik

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
I was coming from the Eco Tzadik

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.230 
I was coming from the Eco Tzadik
panorama<00:00:16.320> 20<00:00:16.650> force<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:17.279> switched<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.029> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
panorama 20 force I switched to the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.470 
panorama 20 force I switched to the
radiance<00:00:18.630> mostly<00:00:19.439> because<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:20.210> really<00:00:21.210> wanted

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
radiance mostly because I really wanted

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.689 
radiance mostly because I really wanted
to<00:00:21.660> program<00:00:22.230> them<00:00:22.560> with<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.710> computer<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.250> wanted

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
to program them with a computer I wanted

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.420 
to program them with a computer I wanted
the<00:00:23.850> functionality<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:24.960> customization<00:00:25.740> that

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
the functionality and customization that

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.859 
the functionality and customization that
the<00:00:27.359> radians<00:00:27.750> offered<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.970> ended<00:00:29.970> up<00:00:30.060> selling

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
the radians offered I ended up selling

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.720 
the radians offered I ended up selling
my<00:00:31.520> eco<00:00:32.520> Tzadik<00:00:33.300> panoramic<00:00:33.989> pictures<00:00:34.350> and

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
my eco Tzadik panoramic pictures and

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.069 
my eco Tzadik panoramic pictures and
upgrading<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.850> these<00:00:35.969> radians<00:00:36.450> now<00:00:36.780> for<00:00:36.989> those

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
upgrading to these radians now for those

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.900 
upgrading to these radians now for those
of<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.380> who<00:00:37.530> don't<00:00:37.710> know<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.070> Radeon<00:00:38.370> started

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
of you who don't know the Radeon started

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.930 
of you who don't know the Radeon started
about<00:00:39.200> 749<00:00:40.200> apiece<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:41.309> they<00:00:41.430> are<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> little

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
about 749 apiece so they are a little

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.260 
about 749 apiece so they are a little
bit<00:00:42.090> more<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.450> pricey<00:00:42.660> side<00:00:43.430> so<00:00:44.430> going

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
bit more on the pricey side so going

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.690 
bit more on the pricey side so going
back<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.570> my<00:00:45.719> review<00:00:46.170> over<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.500> eco<00:00:47.160> Tzadik<00:00:47.550> I

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
back to my review over the eco Tzadik I

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.540 
back to my review over the eco Tzadik I
still<00:00:48.180> think<00:00:48.420> they're<00:00:48.570> amazing<00:00:49.350> lights<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.950> I

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
still think they're amazing lights and I

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.880 
still think they're amazing lights and I
would<00:00:51.120> recommend<00:00:51.629> them<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.780> anyone<00:00:52.170> it's<00:00:52.649> just

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
would recommend them to anyone it's just

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.700 
would recommend them to anyone it's just
these<00:00:53.460> ones<00:00:53.940> in<00:00:54.360> my<00:00:54.600> opinion<00:00:54.629> are<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> little

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
these ones in my opinion are a little

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.020 
these ones in my opinion are a little
bit<00:00:55.920> better<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.370> I'm<00:00:56.430> kind<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.670> eating<00:00:56.910> my

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
bit better so I'm kind of eating my

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.000 
bit better so I'm kind of eating my
words<00:00:57.180> here<00:00:57.510> from<00:00:57.690> my<00:00:57.809> last<00:00:58.050> review<00:00:58.910> they

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
words here from my last review they

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.009 
words here from my last review they
right<00:01:02.010> now<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.219> have<00:01:02.609> two<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.030> them<00:01:03.270> over<00:01:03.570> my<00:01:03.690> 90

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
right now I have two of them over my 90

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.870 
right now I have two of them over my 90
gallon<00:01:04.320> they're<00:01:04.680> mounted<00:01:05.250> up<00:01:05.430> there<00:01:05.670> with

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
gallon they're mounted up there with

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.060 
gallon they're mounted up there with
custom<00:01:06.479> mounts<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.080> actually<00:01:07.439> purchased

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
custom mounts that I actually purchased

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.620 
custom mounts that I actually purchased
from<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.310> place<00:01:08.549> here<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:08.939> Ohio<00:01:09.240> called

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
from a place here in Ohio called

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.870 
from a place here in Ohio called
Aquatica<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.470> will<00:01:11.010> put<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> link<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.549> their<00:01:11.850> page

Aquatica I will put a link to their page

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.870 
Aquatica I will put a link to their page
at<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> end<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.260> video<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:14.520> moms<00:01:14.700> are

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
at the end of this video the moms are

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.060 
at the end of this video the moms are
really<00:01:15.090> cool<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:16.229> one<00:01:16.409> thing<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.680> was<00:01:16.770> worried

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
really cool the one thing I was worried

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.469 
really cool the one thing I was worried
about<00:01:17.130> when<00:01:17.400> getting<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.880> radians<00:01:18.240> was

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
about when getting the radians was

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.300 
about when getting the radians was
mounting<00:01:18.960> options<00:01:19.380> because<00:01:19.740> all<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.070> really

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
mounting options because all I really

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.800 
mounting options because all I really
saw<00:01:20.549> they<00:01:20.700> had<00:01:20.850> was<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.119> hanging<00:01:21.420> kits<00:01:21.630> and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
saw they had was the hanging kits and

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.469 
saw they had was the hanging kits and
rails<00:01:22.080> which<00:01:22.409> costed<00:01:23.250> like<00:01:23.369> $100<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.210> I

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
rails which costed like $100 and I

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.359 
rails which costed like $100 and I
really<00:01:25.320> didn't<00:01:25.530> want<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.710> hang<00:01:25.860> anything<00:01:26.009> from

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
really didn't want to hang anything from

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.039 
really didn't want to hang anything from
my<00:01:26.520> ceiling<00:01:26.939> if<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.150> can't<00:01:27.330> tell<00:01:27.509> my<00:01:27.659> tank<00:01:27.930> is

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
my ceiling if you can't tell my tank is

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.780 
my ceiling if you can't tell my tank is
in<00:01:28.170> my<00:01:28.290> basement

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
in my basement

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.810 
in my basement
they<00:01:30.390> make<00:01:30.600> these<00:01:30.799> mounts<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:32.040> there<00:01:32.250> made<00:01:32.700> of

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
they make these mounts in there made of

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.819 
they make these mounts in there made of
acrylic

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
acrylic

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.679 
acrylic
they<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:35.520> can<00:01:35.700> push<00:01:35.880> him<00:01:36.030> back<00:01:36.210> push<00:01:36.540> him

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
they you can push him back push him

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.569 
they you can push him back push him
forward<00:01:36.960> remove<00:01:37.560> them<00:01:37.770> if<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.400> want<00:01:38.549> to

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
forward remove them if you want to

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.940 
forward remove them if you want to
maintenance<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.180> tank<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:40.259> slide<00:01:40.770> them

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
maintenance the tank you slide them

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.100 
maintenance the tank you slide them
wherever<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.369> want<00:01:41.460> they<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.360> little

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
wherever you want they just the little

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.929 
wherever you want they just the little
things<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.590> side<00:01:43.890> here<00:01:44.070> up<00:01:44.159> like<00:01:44.399> they<00:01:44.790> are

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
things on the side here up like they are

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.190 
things on the side here up like they are
in<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.119> camera<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.570> whole<00:01:45.600> thing<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:45.990> on<00:01:46.079> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
in the camera the whole thing is on the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.710 
in the camera the whole thing is on the
side<00:01:46.500> they're<00:01:46.860> just<00:01:47.759> kind<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:47.970> screw<00:01:48.600> right

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
side they're just kind of screw right

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.420 
side they're just kind of screw right
onto<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.079> tank<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.590> they're<00:01:49.799> really<00:01:50.009> easy<00:01:50.189> to

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
onto the tank so they're really easy to

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.840 
onto the tank so they're really easy to
install<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.090> really<00:01:51.840> nice<00:01:51.990> tank<00:01:52.259> mounts<00:01:52.619> I

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
install and really nice tank mounts I

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.270 
install and really nice tank mounts I
think<00:01:53.850> they're<00:01:54.000> like<00:01:54.530> 249<00:01:55.530> for<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.979> mounts

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
think they're like 249 for the mounts

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.969 
think they're like 249 for the mounts
but<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:57.210> call<00:01:57.960> him<00:01:58.079> up<00:01:58.200> they<00:01:58.439> customize

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
but you call him up they customize

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.530 
but you call him up they customize
whatever<00:01:59.399> tank<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.880> have<00:01:59.939> they're<00:02:00.360> really

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
whatever tank you have they're really

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.950 
whatever tank you have they're really
nice<00:02:00.719> but<00:02:01.710> back<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.040> radiance<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:03.329> far<00:02:03.570> my

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
nice but back to the radiance so far my

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.719 
nice but back to the radiance so far my
corals<00:02:04.320> have<00:02:04.439> been<00:02:04.590> responding<00:02:05.040> very<00:02:05.430> very

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
corals have been responding very very

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.609 
corals have been responding very very
well<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.270> lights<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.780> looks<00:02:06.990> like<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.409> got

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
well to the lights it looks like I got

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.250 
well to the lights it looks like I got
some<00:02:08.660> more<00:02:09.660> SPS<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.440> got<00:02:10.590> some<00:02:10.739> Acropora

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
some more SPS I got some Acropora

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.920 
some more SPS I got some Acropora
that<00:02:12.189> seems<00:02:12.489> the<00:02:12.760> polyp<00:02:13.060> extension<00:02:13.569> seems<00:02:13.810> to

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
that seems the polyp extension seems to

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.699 
that seems the polyp extension seems to
be<00:02:14.019> coming<00:02:14.769> out<00:02:14.860> you<00:02:15.340> know<00:02:15.599> my<00:02:16.599> montipora<00:02:17.230> is

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
be coming out you know my montipora is

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.009 
be coming out you know my montipora is
really<00:02:18.640> really<00:02:18.879> red<00:02:19.120> ever<00:02:19.329> since<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.720> switched

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
really really red ever since I switched

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.479 
really really red ever since I switched
these<00:02:20.230> lights<00:02:20.560> so<00:02:20.739> the<00:02:20.829> colors<00:02:21.099> are<00:02:21.250> even

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
these lights so the colors are even

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.630 
these lights so the colors are even
enhancing<00:02:22.650> also<00:02:23.650> with<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.220> lights<00:02:24.519> the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
enhancing also with the lights the

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.850 
enhancing also with the lights the
shimmer<00:02:25.030> is<00:02:25.239> amazing<00:02:25.780> like<00:02:25.959> I<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.560> video

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
shimmer is amazing like I the video

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.910 
shimmer is amazing like I the video
won't<00:02:27.579> do<00:02:27.940> it<00:02:28.090> justice<00:02:28.599> and<00:02:28.870> so<00:02:29.140> far<00:02:29.379> from<00:02:29.530> what

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
won't do it justice and so far from what

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.539 
won't do it justice and so far from what
I've<00:02:30.069> seen<00:02:30.099> on<00:02:30.430> YouTube<00:02:30.849> the<00:02:31.720> videos<00:02:32.019> don't

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
I've seen on YouTube the videos don't

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.430 
I've seen on YouTube the videos don't
they<00:02:33.549> all<00:02:33.700> look<00:02:33.970> nice<00:02:34.209> but<00:02:34.510> in<00:02:34.810> person<00:02:35.140> they're

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
they all look nice but in person they're

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.680 
they all look nice but in person they're
just<00:02:35.590> so<00:02:35.799> much<00:02:35.950> better<00:02:36.159> I<00:02:36.489> would<00:02:37.329> recommend

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
just so much better I would recommend

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.690 
just so much better I would recommend
going<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:38.049> any<00:02:38.260> place<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:38.829> see<00:02:39.010> like<00:02:39.190> a<00:02:39.220> fish

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
going to any place you see like a fish

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.640 
going to any place you see like a fish
store<00:02:40.000> maybe<00:02:40.329> he<00:02:40.420> has<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:40.900> radians<00:02:41.530> on

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
store maybe he has the radians on

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.830 
store maybe he has the radians on
display<00:02:42.099> but<00:02:42.159> in<00:02:42.730> person<00:02:43.030> they<00:02:43.299> just<00:02:43.480> look<00:02:43.599> so

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
display but in person they just look so

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.369 
display but in person they just look so

worked late a lot I actually have them
set<00:02:49.420> to<00:02:49.569> go<00:02:49.690> completely<00:02:50.349> off<00:02:50.560> around<00:02:51.040> 10

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
set to go completely off around 10

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.930 
set to go completely off around 10
o'clock<00:02:51.370> or<00:02:52.560> they<00:02:53.560> actually<00:02:54.220> sorry<00:02:54.459> they<00:02:54.730> fade

o'clock or they actually sorry they fade
into<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.239> moonlights<00:02:55.720> around<00:02:56.019> 10<00:02:56.230> o'clock

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
into the moonlights around 10 o'clock

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.580 
into the moonlights around 10 o'clock
and<00:02:56.829> then<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:57.310> get<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:58.150> complete<00:02:58.930> shutdown

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
and then I get the complete shutdown

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.319 
and then I get the complete shutdown

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.509 
then they come back on I gradually have
them<00:03:03.849> starting<00:03:04.450> up<00:03:04.829> from<00:03:05.829> artificial<00:03:06.190> mode

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
them starting up from artificial mode

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:12.899 
them starting up from artificial mode
which<00:03:07.180> is<00:03:07.359> in<00:03:07.629> the<00:03:08.489> Ecotech<00:03:09.489> software<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:12.250> I

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:12.909 
which is in the Ecotech software and I

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.970 
which is in the Ecotech software and I
kind<00:03:13.359> of<00:03:13.420> customize<00:03:14.019> this<00:03:14.139> color<00:03:14.409> spectrum<00:03:14.920> a

kind of chime in and a few months here

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:30.900 
kind of chime in and a few months here
and<00:03:29.470> let<00:03:29.560> you<00:03:29.650> guys<00:03:29.769> know<00:03:29.829> exactly<00:03:30.579> how<00:03:30.760> my

and let you guys know exactly how my

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.250 
and let you guys know exactly how my
corals<00:03:31.269> are<00:03:31.419> doing<00:03:31.690> but<00:03:33.359> the<00:03:34.359> only<00:03:34.599> bad<00:03:35.230> thing

I have to say about these lights is the

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.500 
I have to say about these lights is the
software<00:03:38.379> and<00:03:38.709> with<00:03:39.430> software<00:03:40.090> you're<00:03:40.299> gonna

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
software and with software you're gonna

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.909 
software and with software you're gonna
have<00:03:40.720> some<00:03:40.930> issues<00:03:40.959> no<00:03:41.379> matter<00:03:41.410> what<00:03:41.769> you're

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
gonna have some bugs I understand that

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.500 
gonna have some bugs I understand that
but<00:03:44.590> it's<00:03:44.919> something<00:03:45.160> I<00:03:45.519> just<00:03:45.609> gotta<00:03:46.030> address

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
I found myself I had to reprogram my

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.930

opened<00:06:19.479> up<00:06:19.839> as<00:06:20.050> much<00:06:20.469> since<00:06:20.740> I<00:06:20.889> switched<00:06:21.039> over

00:06:21.329 --> 00:06:21.339

to the lights but I think it's just got
to<00:06:23.229> get<00:06:23.409> used<00:06:23.650> to<00:06:23.830> it<00:06:24.039> you<00:06:24.279> want<00:06:24.610> to<00:06:24.669> make<00:06:24.699> sure

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
you're acclimating the corals like I

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.659 
you're acclimating the corals like I
said<00:06:26.620> in<00:06:26.710> my<00:06:26.800> last<00:06:26.949> video<00:06:27.250> it's<00:06:27.610> very

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:27.669

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:30.119

important I started off these radians at
about<00:06:30.310> 50%<00:06:30.729> and<00:06:31.210> just<00:06:31.360> kind<00:06:31.479> of<00:06:31.509> worked<00:06:31.750> my<00:06:31.960> way

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
about 50% and just kind of worked my way

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.210 
about 50% and just kind of worked my way
up<00:06:32.319> to<00:06:33.159> 100%<00:06:33.819> during<00:06:34.389> the<00:06:34.509> day<00:06:34.659> I<00:06:34.690> haven't

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
100% so like two to five I believe and

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.550 
100% so like two to five I believe and
then<00:06:37.740> it<00:06:37.830> ramps<00:06:37.950> back<00:06:38.250> down<00:06:39.290> so<00:06:40.290> yeah<00:06:40.440> guys
