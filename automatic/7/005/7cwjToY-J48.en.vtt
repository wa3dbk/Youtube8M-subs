00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.220 
glide over studs especially on the
carpet<00:02:35.860> works<00:02:36.160> really<00:02:36.460> well<00:02:36.640> on<00:02:36.790> carpet<00:02:37.360> the

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.570 

Muslim<00:02:41.230> call<00:02:41.410> it<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:41.709> figure<00:02:42.340> what<00:02:42.459> they're

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
Muslim call it I figure what they're

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.810 
Muslim call it I figure what they're
called<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:44.380> turret<00:02:44.740> spins<00:02:45.459> kind<00:02:46.450> of<00:02:47.610> just<00:02:48.610> a

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
called the turret spins kind of just a

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.090 
called the turret spins kind of just a
little<00:02:49.090> bit<00:02:49.470> doesn't<00:02:50.470> really<00:02:50.530> have<00:02:50.770> a<00:02:50.800> lot<00:02:51.040> of

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
little bit doesn't really have a lot of

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.370 
little bit doesn't really have a lot of
big<00:02:51.940> range<00:02:52.209> of<00:02:52.420> movement<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:55.780> yeah<00:02:55.930> it's<00:02:56.140> okay

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
big range of movement so yeah it's okay

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.590 
big range of movement so yeah it's okay
they<00:02:57.040> do<00:02:57.100> move<00:02:57.370> up<00:02:57.550> and<00:02:57.700> down<00:02:57.790> both<00:02:58.209> of<00:02:58.270> them

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
they do move up and down both of them

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.630 
they do move up and down both of them
again<00:02:59.290> not<00:02:59.650> very<00:02:59.890> far<00:03:00.510> put<00:03:01.510> them<00:03:01.600> up<00:03:01.750> I<00:03:02.080> guess

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
again not very far put them up I guess

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.070 
again not very far put them up I guess
we're<00:03:03.640> down<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.390> don't<00:03:04.540> know<00:03:04.630> why<00:03:04.780> do<00:03:04.840> you<00:03:04.930> want

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
one left over battle droid right here

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.760 
one left over battle droid right here
Dexter<00:04:06.420> came<00:04:06.690> with<00:04:06.840> another<00:04:07.170> part<00:04:07.440> it's<00:04:07.650> a

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
Dexter came with another part it's a

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.670 
Dexter came with another part it's a
step<00:04:08.780> probably<00:04:09.780> seen<00:04:09.959> them<00:04:10.080> in<00:04:10.230> if<00:04:10.500> you've

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
step probably seen them in if you've

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.760 
step probably seen them in if you've
watched<00:04:10.920> episode<00:04:11.370> 1<00:04:11.580> the<00:04:11.610> Star<00:04:11.910> Wars<00:04:12.090> but<00:04:13.080> it's

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
watched episode 1 the Star Wars but it's

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.539 
watched episode 1 the Star Wars but it's
okay<00:04:14.070> it's<00:04:15.500> mounted<00:04:16.500> on<00:04:16.590> this<00:04:16.739> kind<00:04:16.980> of<00:04:17.040> clear

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
okay it's mounted on this kind of clear

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.599 
okay it's mounted on this kind of clear
if<00:04:17.790> stand<00:04:18.829> so<00:04:19.829> it's<00:04:20.160> supposed<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.489> be

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
if stand so it's supposed to be

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.760 
if stand so it's supposed to be
invisible<00:04:20.730> it's<00:04:21.239> really<00:04:21.480> not<00:04:21.630> but<00:04:21.930> I<00:04:22.230> guess<00:04:22.620> it

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
invisible it's really not but I guess it

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.530 
invisible it's really not but I guess it
works<00:04:23.010> because<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.610> step<00:04:23.880> is<00:04:24.090> supposed<00:04:24.390> to

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
works because the step is supposed to

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.230 
works because the step is supposed to
float<00:04:24.870> and<00:04:25.320> then<00:04:26.280> take<00:04:26.940> your<00:04:27.090> guy<00:04:27.330> like<00:04:28.230> so

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
float and then take your guy like so

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.710 
float and then take your guy like so
wretches<00:04:30.240> arms<00:04:30.540> out<00:04:30.750> just<00:04:31.410> kind<00:04:31.710> of<00:04:32.630> put<00:04:33.630> them

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
wretches arms out just kind of put them

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.180 
wretches arms out just kind of put them
on<00:04:33.870> there<00:04:36.169> so<00:04:37.169> now<00:04:37.260> he's<00:04:37.410> driving<00:04:37.800> it<00:04:37.919> so<00:04:37.950> you

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
on there so now he's driving it so you

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.500 
on there so now he's driving it so you
have<00:04:38.280> like<00:04:38.400> a<00:04:38.460> little<00:04:38.640> support<00:04:39.210> for<00:04:39.390> your
