00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
going to be in a new position

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.499 
going to be in a new position
it's<00:00:13.259> called<00:00:13.530> middle<00:00:13.769> C<00:00:13.860> position<00:00:14.250> so<00:00:15.150> we<00:00:15.240> find

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
it's called middle C position so we find

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.140 
it's called middle C position so we find
middle<00:00:15.690> C<00:00:16.100> by<00:00:17.100> finding<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.520> white<00:00:17.730> note<00:00:18.000> in

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
middle C by finding the white note in

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.820 
middle C by finding the white note in
front<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.510> two<00:00:18.690> black<00:00:18.960> notes<00:00:19.230> right<00:00:19.529> in

front of the two black notes right in

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.340 
front of the two black notes right in
the<00:00:20.220> middle<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.609> piano<00:00:21.020> and<00:00:22.020> then<00:00:22.230> your

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
the middle of the piano and then your

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.900 
the middle of the piano and then your
thumbs<00:00:22.680> are<00:00:23.039> actually<00:00:23.430> going<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.640> share

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
thumbs are actually going to share

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.020 
thumbs are actually going to share
middle<00:00:24.300> C<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.810> then<00:00:25.410> move<00:00:25.619> out<00:00:25.769> from<00:00:25.980> there

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.030 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.000 

so<00:00:30.030> only<00:00:30.330> one<00:00:30.690> finger<00:00:31.140> will<00:00:31.410> actually<00:00:31.770> play<00:00:31.950> it

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.010
