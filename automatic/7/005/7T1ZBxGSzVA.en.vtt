 I hope you are ready 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.940
 joined 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:52.120
 pato said if you want to drown me 3rd round 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.810
 yes answer that it is necessary to know 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.450
 dry up more honor his strength of 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.890
 train here at home at home 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.390
 val d'isÃ¨re you will be held by any 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.370
 the valley will that give you some 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.380
 wings to hang this famous podium 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.270
 tomorrow I had good races 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.320
 until now and I'm coming here to the 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.840
 house in big shape 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.150
 the track is great i love the snow 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.460
 extra and everyone came to see me that 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.020
 go my thumb and gilles henry not do 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.760
 to turn a lot of people I know 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.590
 but in any case I hear them tomorrow 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.030
 and see who is screaming very loud because that 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.330
 will push me that a little laugh me very 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.330
 very quickly 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.150
 I grew up a few kilometers from here 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.400
 the tracks know them by heart because 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.840
 I spent all my youth is 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.120
 sure it's a little bit 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.560
 different because because we are 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.910
 found with the blow much less 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.230
 we know the moves we're going 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.970
 to warm up we know someone on 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.650
 meet someone it's true it's a 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.650
 another approach to the race a little bit 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.880
 so where this one for so we go 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.640
 to be in a hurry because it's not going to happen 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.069
 too fast at the same time to load the 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.140
 dock and above all we do not trigger too much 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.150
 early yeah okay exit the cross 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.959
 it's still you coming back either this 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.950
 imposes me montchanin year 2 3 which 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.060
 followed after two left feet have 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.060
 attacked the work well-prone 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.090
 I have everything in my head two or three 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.140
 places where we just do not see the 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.760
 doors that are behind what they 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.579
 name so it's important to know 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.250
 what direction should we have because 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:47.230
 when we attack our race and we can 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.329
 not to hesitate to hesitate on plain or 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.409
 on anything so the 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.450
 recognition is very very 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.609
 important to know if precisely 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:21.959
 put more or less direction at wholesale 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:03:23.980
 like that there is the sun today 104 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.669
 teaching 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.669
 First 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.209
 Yes 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.209
 m 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.080
 ba is almost worth by his left foot 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:58.250
 and I wanted to get back online and I 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:06.100
 I took the door down I have a good 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:08.030
 what's going on but I'm fine 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.500
 bass and more quite the same thing 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.180
 because I really thought to go 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.890
 look ahead and in those cases must 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.320
 to be flawless on both runs and 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:19.040
 unfortunately I make a good mistake 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.549
 to the first after the state of mind 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.769
 was good 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.880
 the envied was there I make a good ski 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.800
 after this big mistake 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.180
 I was very sure of course the whole party 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.730
 low so 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.310
 so that's already when I do not crash 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.320
 in the state of mind that I do what 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.390
 I have to do on times it's limit 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.950
 she is very beautiful and very very fine 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.660
 so there it went a little bit 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.330
 on this door I stop a little bit 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:44.360
 these games but after I'm still 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.730
 happy to have managed the 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:51.190
 stress at the beginning all that and that's 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.190
 already it's already good so that's it 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.590
 I really wanted to look for a 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.210
 big second run to ensure 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.569
 still 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.919
 points then has a little probability in 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.650
 right besides that to the first one 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.150
 big mistake of recognition and 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.349
 blow I am very very right from the door 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.479
 and there it is very expensive 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:27.020
 it's a place that's far away for sure 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.940
 but here it's holy-die harder because 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.139
 that thin we planted in front of all 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.740
 those who follow us since very 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:35.120
 a long time since there are a lot of people who 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.860
 do not have the opportunity to come on 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.539
 races abroad and then suddenly 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.949
 and can come they are there there is all the 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:46.160
 world and then as long as I cross a guy 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:47.270
 next to a little bit of disappointment when 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.960
 even because the result is not there 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.660
 in front of public 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.310
 but after a lot of joy because I 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.009
 I'm still entertained 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.240
 impressive to find themselves down and 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:58.099
 I will come full of people I knew 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.300
 not even that she was going to be there and that's 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:00.770
 people who follow me since I am 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.330
 very small it is precisely that it is 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.220
 or troop is like that in the era 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.530
 arrival you warm heart 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.300
 so that's emotions that are 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.690
 great just before the holidays in addition to a 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.460
 good Christmas 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.520
 it's beautiful that gives balm to 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.520
 heart
