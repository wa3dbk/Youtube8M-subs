 work blog ce 1.2 the latest version 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.870
 of the mode for minecraft 1.6 point 4 for 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.810
 we're going to need these four 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.750
 files that you are seeing on screen 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:22.720
 ext up up goes up there is one 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.789
 would be the dragon block mode c2 the hot 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.960
 there will be a client needed to visualize 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:31.600
 the hairs of saiáns 3 the necessary jrm 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.370
 to display the game menus and 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.679
 finally 4 the minecraft because 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.030
 universal mod necessary not only for 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:39.579
 install the dragon blocks but 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.589
 any other way is worth these files 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.960
 you will find them on the page 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:46.659
 bot officer which is what you are 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.489
 watching right now but there is a problem 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:51.370
 and is that the minecraft forge which is 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.780
 the first file does not work with what 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.850
 which I have taken the trouble of 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.429
 look for it and I found it I'll leave it 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.499
 the four link to download install 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:04.030
 previously it is worth good, just in case 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:05.379
 you want to install it from the pull sometime 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.630
 Here you have 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.990
 the installation guide on the page 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.729
 official here would be the universal jl that 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.430
 is to visualize as I have already told you 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.240
 the menu here the mod 1.2 the last 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.060
 version and 3 the jota there will be client vale 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.679
 well let's install minecraft 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.539
 dragon blocks before starting the 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:28.479
 tutorial I recommend you in your folder 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:30.369
 knit minecraft delete it since if 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.289
 previously you have previously 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.420
 installed or any other way you can 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.220
 cause any problem now what 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.500
 I'm going to do before it's create my folder 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.680
 clean minecraft point for it 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.050
 we execute minecraft as is 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.260
 to me to be premium because they force me to 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.560
 register but I'm going to try this 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.690
 be as quick as possible is already olé 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.340
 olé and good right now they are 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.190
 generating the minecraft point folder 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.870
 totally clean thing that is necessary 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.150
 if we do not want it then we have 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.890
 problems and not see me comments like I've 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.110
 had problems are not sighted the mod 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.789
 what the fuck is worth, this is because 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.470
 maybe I previously had problems with 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.989
 mods that were not compatible 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.520
 then I recommend you delete it now 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.080
 I will explain where the route of the 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.440
 minecraft point folder since I'm going to 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.370
 have to go there to place the bots 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.810
 well let's see if this is 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.400
 install as you can see it is 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.280
 installing the latest dot version 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.200
 minecraft than the 1.7 point 2 with which 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.730
 now I will have to choose version 1.6 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.220
 point 4 that is where it will be 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.970
 installed the bot and good at the end of the 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.770
 video I'll leave with the epic tutorials 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.890
 inside with blocks such as the 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:45.040
 skills or races and the day Friday 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.390
 I'll upload the attacks here, well, 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.830
 I have my minecraft point folder 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.190
 Now what I'm going to do is go 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.520
 edit profile choose version 1.6 point 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.530
 4 and create it because if not, I will not 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.790
 able to install the bot and the force that 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.400
 OK 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.400
 well let's wait a little bit and already 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.840
 I have it now minecraft will open 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.849
 with version 1.6 point 4 olé olé bueno 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.590
 Well now let's close this and now 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.490
 We are going to install the minecraft forge you 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.270
 we explain double click 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.010
 and we give you to install as a customer voucher 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:23.300
 we accept we are beginning to generate 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.040
 all the files as you can see 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.930
 and good the truth is that it is good 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.880
 easy to install the monster I blog 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.710
 but of course sometimes there are problems if 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.840
 follow the tutorial to perfection not 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.150
 you are going to have obviously good problems 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.190
 it has already been installed correctly 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.540
 As you can see we simply accept now 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.840
 we open our knit folder 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.840
 Minecraft 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.420
 we open it again and live to force 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:47.400
 to 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.099
 well not yet not worth it now 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.230
 I'm going to give profile here and you're going to 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:55.110
 fix that I get forge see you because you 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.700
 has installed us the forge le clique amos 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.700
 and they force me back 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.200
 to install the password not to install 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.560
 not to place 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.300
 Well, I put it and good now as 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.830
 you can see down here I get that already 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.010
 the minecraft forge is installed with the 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.620
 version 1.6 point 4 I simply give it to 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.780
 play and let's see really if it 's 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.450
 installed the forge is already 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.730
 absolutely nothing or is this already 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.440
 finish the tutorial 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.860
 and good as you can see I have the version 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.800
 1.6 4 with the minecraft forge installed 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.390
 Here we see it is good, so let's go 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:39.550
 close this and now we 're going to go to 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:42.250
 start to run we put app data us 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.960
 we are going to roaming and here point minecraft 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.360
 here is our knit folder 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.480
 minecraft we enter and you will see a 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.830
 folder called mods we open it and 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.340
 simply what we have to do is 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.470
 drag the three bot files here 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.560
 inside it's worth this way we already have 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.030
 installed the work in blocks 1.2 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.870
 let's check that this really is 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.010
 true 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.010
 we execute minecraft 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.190
 remember that in profile step comfort and 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:17.090
 that is version 1.6 point 4 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.090
 we give to play 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.040
 and I hope everything goes perfectly 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.660
 obviously it's the second time he installed 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.380
 the mod i do not have problems for 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.760
 install it 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.400
 but good can come in handy if 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.860
 someone has problems then good 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.930
 because we generally start I create 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.340
 a world I will make him live and dark 92 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.770

 Sometimes but I do not care 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.380
 well let's see that everything is going well and the 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.090
 truth is that this version is very much 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.730
 better than the previous one with which it is 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.440
