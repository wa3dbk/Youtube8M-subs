00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.090
 hello my name is kevin and in this 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.790
 line-up video we are going to watch two 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.299
 different pains that they controllers 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.369
 namely the 4-channel ddj-sx and are 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.550
 smaller brothers with 2 channels 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.289
 the dj-sr in the videos also one 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.850
 number of differences between these two DJs 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.619
 Controllers show you better 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.619
 know which suits you 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.040
 in the box of both devices is one 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.220
 usb cable to connect it with 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.610
 for example a laptop and join the 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.699
 ddj-sx 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.140
 an AC adapter is supplied 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:41.670
 ddj-sr gets or power if you have 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.199
 connected to the computer 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.019
 and the rest is included with both 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.000
 full serato dj software and this one 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.619
 software integrates perfectly with the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.299
 pioneer dj controllers 

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:52.860
 the greatest similarity between these 

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:54.960
 two controllers is that they both 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.449
 have 16 adjustable 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.030
 performance pet off per channel 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.430
 and with this cap you set the hot cues 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.470
 it is possible to make a noob role as well 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.270
 operate the slicer function 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.580
 to pull out a piece in 8 offers too 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.200
 and with this cap you can too 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.730
 operate the samples 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.640
 at the DJ controllers 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.590
 a 3-band eq filter and two effect 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.060
 banks that allow you to bank three with each tag 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.680
 can control effects 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.140
 the effects in streets are, by the way 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.850
 developed by iphoto and are sure of it 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.830
 high quality and through the trailer 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.060
 also produces used as the rex 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.430
 produce 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.620
 finally the jog wheels of the sx and 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.910
 the sr large and very accurate too 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.409
 during scratching 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.780
 a sensitivity of this is satisfactory 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.880
 to adjust and certainly the jog wheels 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.790
 not below for the jog wheels on the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.230
 Be professional Pioneer DJ sets then 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.100
 of course there are differences between the two 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.350
 models 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.510
 in addition to being the dj-sx one 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.180
 This controller is 4 channel and the 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.979
 ddj-sr 2-channel has this control 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.800
 no input for a cd player or 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.960
 record player you combine dj with the 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.580
 like a laptop with oldskool wheels or 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.729
 steel or a CD player 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.350
 then go for the dj-sx you also see the te 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.580
 layout a little bit different from 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.470
 both devices 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.269
 for example, the pitch fader is higher 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.510
 at the dj-sr 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:15.209
 then with the sx and the dj-sr also gives with 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.240
 lights how much does the look offer 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.340
 you want to set up with the dd at that time 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.430
 sx this can only be seen in the streets 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.770
 software itself a very cool feature on the 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.360
 sx is the needle search 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.000
 so you can swipe your finger through you quickly 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.860
 tracks can go and with the sx you can too 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.900
 adjust the curve of your crossfader 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.090
 another big difference is that the 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.920
 ddj-sx has the double deck 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.170
 feature that is not smaller 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.000
 brother is sitting with the purpose deck function 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.830
 It is possible to get two tracks from 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.190
 two different dax immediately think too 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.190
 to let go 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.870
 that's how you see the dj-sx pioneer and more 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.090
 more complete which they controller is suitable 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.460
 for the advanced and professional DJ 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.380
 he is 4 channel has the possibility 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.990
 to connect a CD or record player 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.000
 and has features such as the needle 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.960
 search the customizable label for the 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.780
 crossfader 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.310
 and of course the duo deck boat the dj-sr 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.890
 is then more and choose two channels 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.230
 controller for the hobby DJ but certainly 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.090
 is that you really with the DDJ-sr 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.860
 complete and thorough control until you 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.480
 who has one 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.000
 well-arranged layout 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.670
 16 programmable pet high-end effect 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.160
 and two crazy job news 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.490
 do you want to order the ddj-sr pioneer or 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.170
 its larger version is the ddj-sx and that 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.390
 then in white or in black 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.610
 then go to dj-controller expert.nl or 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.270
