00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
really into ice hockey and I played

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.690 
really into ice hockey and I played
roller<00:01:43.170> hockey<00:01:43.380> for<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.829> long<00:01:44.100> part<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.579> my

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
roller hockey for a long part of my

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.760 
roller hockey for a long part of my
teenage<00:01:45.149> years<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:46.020> reason<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.350> never<00:01:46.560> played

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
teenage years the reason I never played

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.039 
teenage years the reason I never played
ice<00:01:46.979> hockey<00:01:47.040> was<00:01:47.549> because<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:47.939> lived<00:01:48.420> quite<00:01:48.750> far

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
ice hockey was because I lived quite far

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.289 
ice hockey was because I lived quite far
from<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.350> rink<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.250> couldn't<00:01:51.030> really<00:01:51.149> be

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
from the rink so I couldn't really be

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.090 
from the rink so I couldn't really be
asked<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.659> make<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.960> journey<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.470> finally<00:01:52.860> I

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
asked to make the journey and finally I

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.880 
asked to make the journey and finally I
spent<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.820> majority<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.420> season<00:01:54.960> 3<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.590> Nam
