00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.760
 begin to know 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.060
 I am 22 years old I am from the team 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.370
 is the pupae where it comes a little is in 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.820
 birds this is a long time ago 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.820
 when I was little 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.469
 I used to spend with my grandfather bike was 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.870
 very very awkward and good because it is a VAT that 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.519
 we had very fond of 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.219
 Atlético de Madrid the team was called 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.680
 the dad then good when the collective and 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:01.339
 others I started in this world of 10 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.670
 languages ​​with another game and combines I'll 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:03.670
 put him 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:16.240
 how long of the first session 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.460
 practically nothing to play the portal 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.210
 They do not know when I was doing it 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:26.280
 more like fourth and from there are three 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.690
 Well when you see but what competitive 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.860
 here is very good and by when 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.330
 they will start other hours of play 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.600
 you put your favorite champion 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.610
 to see before I had my favorite champion 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.790
 has always been light but it is that this 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.590
 season oriana is the one I'm most 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.560
 playing and I think it's my favor and 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.880
 parliament as it was input to the 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.880
 giants academy 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.409
 because when you talk about selection, 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.300
 I was selected the final phase and 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.880
 they selected another partner in a 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.759
 same turn at the beginning was a bit 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.330
 sad that I was happy for him and 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:10.390
 at the time they told me hey look that fits 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.770
 with the team and others and then my 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.440
 first reaction was to surprise me a 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.380
 little and have a bit bittersweet taste 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.770
 because enter and be in the partner 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.769
 yours may or may not be a bit easy 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.660
 valuation you do your step for nothing 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.080
 giants academy or that is by brief still 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.730
 but of course you're not doing it 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.580
 good at first truth I 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.260
 he was very surprised because they in the 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.660
 selection process without prediction that 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.100
 it's already like a family and until it 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.070
 you are inside you do not realize it 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.680
 the truth that they are a great family and 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.170
 to me they have welcomed me really well and all 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.370
 they are here for anything 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.510
 that I need so I'm very 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.460
 happy 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.600
 his coach escaped a player who has 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.880
 participated the highest competitions 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.760
 Spanish in recent years 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.879
 how are you with him 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.459
 well to see he told me that he always in 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:05.470
 greater event was like the coac but the 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.950
 land practice matters so 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.140
 he likes this very much in a subject 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.090
 special things so the truth that very 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.690
 well from the first day 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.910
 We are waiting for games 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.370
 reports following is not everyone alone 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.140
 telling us what to do and what not to do 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.650
 it's really fine because it's super 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.230
 dedicated and he likes this topic to be like that 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.060
 He is very happy these weeks that 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.220
 you take in the academy and I found 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.440
 which is thing of diamond 5 to diamond 1 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.140
 in a rather quick way what 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:43.299
 should this this improvement that this micro 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.950
 to know I smoked in big head and a 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.380
 tail are also before one but 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.900
 q only plays alone and I started down 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.410
 down down until it has finished 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.269
 where to start again until the 25th and 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.459
 nothing then we are half ones with 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.650
 simple more combinative played with 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.989
 someone to help pull the car the 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.450
 big headed that you but you're not going to 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:07.550
 to be able to win the game and good in English 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.960
 this case to start looking for me 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.090
 that they were good solos players 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.070
 and that coupled with that good also when 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.530
 will win in straight games this 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.420
 attitude changes we start to win 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.780
 the parties have that predisposition not 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.430
 you come down because everything is united 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.340
 now only they have themselves before 130 pointed 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.630
 to see how it is that your relationship 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.180
 of team 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.930
 you've still been a few weeks but how can you 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.560
 you are among you 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.419
 so the relationship us to be in 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.090
 the academy all the candidates and others 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.729
 we already had some relationship now that 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.740
 we are a team we are talking very 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.300
 process know a little way back 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.970
 at least I am the last to enter and 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.949
 very little time together you also have to 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.539
 keep in mind that nothing else enter us 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:56.090
 we're going to have to sets that has 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.800
 united very much is not like when you're 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.630
 is giving in your house and you have the 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.699
 first great in a year that we have 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.400
 had super close and the truth we have 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:06.979
 very good relationship we get along very well 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.440
 and we are all there knowing the something 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.599
 that such a force that experience of 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:18.009
 tenerife nothing else to begin that as it was 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:20.529
 the tournament and a little clear 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:22.779
 and will get there 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:25.390
 what day will the hours tournaments be played 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:28.330
 We do not know, we 're going to ask 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.730
 and come on let's eat that it's late a 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.500
 chaos the truth because of course now japan 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.600
 is with us but we have 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.330
 had to organize practically everything 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.000
 between us has been very chaotic 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.890
 first days but the truth has been 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.350
 very nice to play in front of so many 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.630
 people for having measured us at the end 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.570
 because at the beginning they eliminated us but 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:52.750
 then like it did not come right gamers that 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:54.940
 we enter the repechage and we can against 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.050
 the top 8 challenge team and the truth 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.040
 we got beat up but 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.810
 we learned a lot and it was a 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.970
 experience very well indicated for everything 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:07.190
 and what objectives does the 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.940
 equipment for this year 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.460
 Well, that was 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.110
 the truth that I think because we have not 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.760
 still talked about the objectives that 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.940
 we have but I think it 's division of 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:21.330
 honor in 30 and without pain and the 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.740

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:31.560
