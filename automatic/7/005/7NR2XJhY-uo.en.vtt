all<00:00:01.350> right<00:00:01.560> so<00:00:01.829> this<00:00:01.979> is<00:00:02.159> what<00:00:02.370> makes<00:00:02.610> it<00:00:02.790> all

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
all right so this is what makes it all

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.480 
all right so this is what makes it all
happen

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:04.490 
happen

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.230 
happen
you<00:00:05.490> got<00:00:05.730> a<00:00:07.400> threaded<00:00:08.400> rod<00:00:08.429> running<00:00:09.090> the

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
you got a threaded rod running the

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.310 
you got a threaded rod running the
entire<00:00:09.540> length<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.110> truck<00:00:11.630> on<00:00:12.630> top<00:00:13.139> of

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
entire length of the truck on top of

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.120 
entire length of the truck on top of
that<00:00:13.580> you<00:00:14.580> have<00:00:14.790> this<00:00:15.030> little<00:00:15.450> mess<00:00:16.100> which<00:00:17.100> is

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
that you have this little mess which is

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.220 
that you have this little mess which is
basically<00:00:17.760> two<00:00:18.090> threaded<00:00:18.420> inserts<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.170> a

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
basically two threaded inserts and a

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.109 
basically two threaded inserts and a
block<00:00:20.420> which<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.570> connected<00:00:22.140> by<00:00:23.390> pair<00:00:24.390> links

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
block which is connected by pair links

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:34.330 
block which is connected by pair links
to<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.269> sled<00:00:27.859> that<00:00:28.859> rolls<00:00:29.130> back<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.609> forth

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.990 

and<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:35.120> sled<00:00:35.950> it's<00:00:36.950> the<00:00:37.250> end<00:00:37.400> of<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:38.330> chassis

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
and the sled it's the end of the chassis

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.560 
and the sled it's the end of the chassis
the<00:00:41.000> block<00:00:41.270> keeps<00:00:41.660> rolling<00:00:43.240> forces<00:00:44.240> the<00:00:44.390> bed

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
the block keeps rolling forces the bed

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:57.820 
the block keeps rolling forces the bed
up<00:00:45.160> I'll<00:00:46.160> show<00:00:46.190> you<00:00:46.430> how<00:00:46.580> that<00:00:46.640> works

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:08.469 

okay<00:00:58.830> so<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.250> motor<00:00:59.490> comes<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.150> gear

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:22.590 

Wow

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.710 

and<00:01:23.110> the<00:01:23.200> bed<00:01:23.410> tilts<00:01:23.830> up<00:01:23.980> or<00:01:24.970> what<00:01:25.330> if<00:01:25.450> it<00:01:25.570> was

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
and the bed tilts up or what if it was

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:51.429 
and the bed tilts up or what if it was
on<00:01:25.870> there<00:01:26.080> which<00:01:27.070> is<00:01:27.220> not<00:01:29.760> and<00:01:30.760> to<00:01:31.030> go<00:01:31.150> forward

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.609 

these<00:01:52.439> rollers<00:01:52.770> on<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.159> back<00:01:54.499> support<00:01:55.499> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
these rollers on the back support the

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.959 
these rollers on the back support the
bed<00:01:55.909> while<00:01:56.909> it's<00:01:57.119> tilting<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.749> rolling

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
bed while it's tilting and rolling

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.910 
bed while it's tilting and rolling
here's<00:01:59.969> another<00:02:00.179> shot<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.539> the<00:02:00.810> mechanism<00:02:01.799> in

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
here's another shot of the mechanism in

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:38.030 
here's another shot of the mechanism in
action

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.880 

it<00:02:38.790> was<00:02:38.910> really<00:02:39.660> simple<00:02:40.080> once<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:40.440> figured<00:02:40.770> out

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
it was really simple once I figured out

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.190 
it was really simple once I figured out
how<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.130> do<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.550> but<00:02:41.910> that<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.810> know<00:02:42.900> took<00:02:42.990> a

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
how to do it but that you know took a

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.470 
how to do it but that you know took a
month<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.560> thinking<00:02:43.890> about<00:02:44.130> it<00:02:44.280> anyway<00:02:45.060> that's

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
month of thinking about it anyway that's

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.210 
month of thinking about it anyway that's
how<00:02:45.570> it<00:02:45.750> works<00:02:45.990> that<00:02:46.320> is<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:48.090> magic<00:02:48.890> with<00:02:49.890> bed

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
how it works that is the magic with bed

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:58.690 
how it works that is the magic with bed
back<00:02:50.460> on<00:02:51.350> you<00:02:52.350> can<00:02:52.530> see<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.860> winter<00:02:53.250> action

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.030 

which<00:02:59.700> is<00:02:59.900> basically<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:01.020> converted<00:03:01.590> servo

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
which is basically a converted servo

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.680 
which is basically a converted servo
that's<00:03:02.310> not<00:03:02.520> hard<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.880> do<00:03:04.130> and<00:03:05.300> the<00:03:06.300> roll<00:03:06.480> back

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
that's not hard to do and the roll back

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.070 
that's not hard to do and the roll back
itself<00:03:07.820> here<00:03:08.820> it<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.030> with<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.270> bed<00:03:09.540> back<00:03:09.810> on

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
itself here it is with the bed back on

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:42.280 
itself here it is with the bed back on
it

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.290 

now<00:03:43.290> these<00:03:43.500> little<00:03:43.830> guides<00:03:44.280> I<00:03:44.790> don't<00:03:45.150> look

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
now these little guides I don't look

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.730 
now these little guides I don't look
like<00:03:45.570> much<00:03:45.870> but<00:03:46.430> they<00:03:47.720> provide<00:03:48.720> alignment<00:03:49.380> for

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
like much but they provide alignment for

00:03:49.740 --> 00:04:24.879 
like much but they provide alignment for
the<00:03:49.830> bed<00:03:50.040> once<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:50.970> hits<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.270> frame

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.949
