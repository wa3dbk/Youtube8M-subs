hi<00:00:00.539> everyone<00:00:01.079> I<00:00:01.110> have<00:00:01.439> a<00:00:01.469> quick<00:00:01.709> update<00:00:01.860> on<00:00:02.129> the

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
hi everyone I have a quick update on the

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.010 
hi everyone I have a quick update on the
rocket<00:00:02.580> mass<00:00:02.730> heater<00:00:02.760> since<00:00:03.480> the<00:00:03.600> stainless

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
rocket mass heater since the stainless

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.650 
rocket mass heater since the stainless
steel<00:00:04.049> heat<00:00:04.470> riser<00:00:04.650> finally<00:00:05.130> rotted<00:00:05.430> out<00:00:05.660> once

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
steel heat riser finally rotted out once

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.450 
steel heat riser finally rotted out once
again<00:00:06.960> taking<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.529> look<00:00:07.680> at<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.859> barrel<00:00:08.189> there

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
again taking a look at the barrel there

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.040 
again taking a look at the barrel there
is<00:00:08.550> still<00:00:08.790> some<00:00:08.940> flaking<00:00:09.210> on<00:00:09.420> top<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:09.900> also

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
is still some flaking on top and also

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.709 
is still some flaking on top and also
along<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.500> sides<00:00:10.769> my<00:00:11.610> guess<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.090> that<00:00:12.360> this<00:00:12.570> is

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
along the sides my guess is that this is

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.600 
along the sides my guess is that this is
from<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.929> extremely<00:00:13.620> high<00:00:13.889> humidity<00:00:14.190> in<00:00:14.519> the

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
from the extremely high humidity in the

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.490 
from the extremely high humidity in the
greenhouse<00:00:15.059> along<00:00:15.540> with<00:00:15.690> cycling<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.289> heater

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
greenhouse along with cycling the heater

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.830 
greenhouse along with cycling the heater
on<00:00:16.590> just<00:00:17.100> once<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.400> day<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.820> then<00:00:18.390> letting<00:00:18.630> it

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
on just once a day and then letting it

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.810 
on just once a day and then letting it
completely<00:00:19.350> cool<00:00:19.590> which<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:19.980> condensing<00:00:20.670> a

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
completely cool which is condensing a

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.929 
completely cool which is condensing a
little<00:00:21.060> moisture<00:00:21.240> on<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:22.730> looking<00:00:23.730> down

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
little moisture on it looking down

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.550 
little moisture on it looking down
inside<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.420> barrel<00:00:24.689> there<00:00:24.990> was<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.109> little<00:00:25.289> ash

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
inside the barrel there was a little ash

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.109 
inside the barrel there was a little ash
at<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.890> bottom<00:00:26.220> which<00:00:26.490> was<00:00:26.699> expected

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
at the bottom which was expected

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.750 
at the bottom which was expected
considering<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.320> has<00:00:28.560> run<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.980> entire<00:00:29.250> season

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
considering it has run the entire season

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.150 
considering it has run the entire season
without<00:00:29.910> being<00:00:30.330> cleaned<00:00:30.710> what<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.740> found<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.130> be

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
without being cleaned what I found to be

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.889 
without being cleaned what I found to be
a<00:00:32.250> bit<00:00:32.309> surprising<00:00:33.059> were<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.360> pieces<00:00:33.750> of

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
a bit surprising were the pieces of

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.660 
a bit surprising were the pieces of

is a very distinctive line between the
differences<00:01:29.600> I<00:01:30.580> got<00:01:31.580> about<00:01:31.759> a<00:01:31.820> thousand<00:01:32.300> hours

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
differences I got about a thousand hours

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.749 
differences I got about a thousand hours
of<00:01:32.600> burn<00:01:32.960> out<00:01:33.170> of<00:01:33.259> this<00:01:33.470> heat<00:01:33.680> riser<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.460> it<00:01:34.580> did

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
of burn out of this heat riser so it did

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.850 
of burn out of this heat riser so it did
surprisingly<00:01:35.149> well<00:01:35.420> considering<00:01:36.259> the<00:01:36.560> abuse

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
surprisingly well considering the abuse

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.219 
surprisingly well considering the abuse
I<00:01:37.070> put<00:01:37.369> it<00:01:37.460> through<00:01:37.750> once<00:01:38.750> I<00:01:38.899> pulled<00:01:39.140> the

it's<00:02:22.260> time<00:02:22.530> for<00:02:22.740> a<00:02:22.770> new<00:02:22.920> heat<00:02:23.100> riser<00:02:23.310> I'm

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
it's time for a new heat riser I'm

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.090 
it's time for a new heat riser I'm
finally<00:02:24.630> going<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.870> buckle<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.500> install<00:02:25.920> a

finally going to buckle and install a

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.880 
finally going to buckle and install a
riser<00:02:26.430> made<00:02:26.850> from<00:02:27.030> fire<00:02:27.240> brick<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.750> decided<00:02:28.620> to

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
riser made from fire brick I decided to

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.680 
riser made from fire brick I decided to
date<00:02:29.100> off<00:02:29.250> some<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.610> fire<00:02:29.790> bricks<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.570> they

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
date off some of the fire bricks so they

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.170 
date off some of the fire bricks so they
couldn't<00:02:30.870> collapse<00:02:31.260> into<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.650> center<00:02:32.180> the

couldn't collapse into the center the

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
profile of 28.3 square inches to

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.430 
profile of 28.3 square inches to
minimize<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.910> waste<00:02:39.090> of<00:02:39.270> brick<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.720> dado<00:02:40.170> cut

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
minimize the waste of brick a dado cut

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.350 
minimize the waste of brick a dado cut
to<00:02:40.680> bricks<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.220> then<00:02:41.580> set<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:42.090> complete

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
to bricks and then set to complete

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.140 
to bricks and then set to complete
bricks<00:02:42.720> on<00:02:42.900> their<00:02:43.080> ends<00:02:43.380> with<00:02:44.370> this<00:02:44.580> setup<00:02:44.820> the

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.610 
square inches even though it's slightly
smaller<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.640> decided<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.570> take<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.900> risk<00:02:52.110> since

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
smaller I decided to take the risk since

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.260 
smaller I decided to take the risk since
the<00:02:52.770> heat<00:02:52.980> riser<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.520> taller<00:02:53.820> than<00:02:54.120> most

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
the heat riser is taller than most

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.120 
the heat riser is taller than most
heaters<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:54.900> I<00:02:55.350> should<00:02:55.530> have<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.709> stronger

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
heaters and I should have a stronger

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.970 
heaters and I should have a stronger
draft<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:57.780> cheap<00:02:57.989> wet<00:02:58.230> saw<00:02:58.440> goes<00:02:58.739> right

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
draft the cheap wet saw goes right

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.560 
draft the cheap wet saw goes right
through<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.280> fire<00:02:59.489> brick<00:02:59.760> and<00:02:59.940> it's<00:03:00.270> brittle

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
through the fire brick and it's brittle

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.720 
through the fire brick and it's brittle
enough<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:01.110> tap<00:03:01.350> off<00:03:01.590> any<00:03:01.830> extra<00:03:02.160> material

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
enough to tap off any extra material

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:20.960 
enough to tap off any extra material
that<00:03:02.970> didn't<00:03:03.270> come<00:03:03.390> off<00:03:03.570> with<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.930> saw<00:03:19.970> for

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
that didn't come off with the saw for

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.699 
that didn't come off with the saw for
the<00:03:21.090> last<00:03:21.269> step<00:03:21.600> I<00:03:21.780> built<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.170> steel<00:03:22.410> cage

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
the last step I built the steel cage

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.410 
the last step I built the steel cage
around<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.160> outside<00:03:23.549> to<00:03:23.760> hold<00:03:23.880> everything<00:03:24.209> in

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
around the outside to hold everything in

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.509 
around the outside to hold everything in
place<00:03:24.590> since<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.709> steel<00:03:25.980> frame<00:03:26.280> isn't

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
place since the steel frame isn't

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.280 
place since the steel frame isn't
directly<00:03:27.000> in<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.150> blast<00:03:27.390> zone<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:28.019> should

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
directly in the blast zone it should

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:36.610 
directly in the blast zone it should
hold<00:03:28.470> up<00:03:28.620> for<00:03:28.799> quite<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:28.980> while

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.780 

that's<00:03:37.620> about<00:03:37.860> it<00:03:38.040> for<00:03:38.190> this<00:03:38.280> heating<00:03:38.610> season

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
that's about it for this heating season

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.150 
that's about it for this heating season
I<00:03:39.120> have<00:03:39.569> a<00:03:39.600> few<00:03:39.840> more<00:03:39.959> ideas<00:03:40.319> in<00:03:40.470> mind<00:03:40.620> for<00:03:40.920> next

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
I have a few more ideas in mind for next

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.770 
I have a few more ideas in mind for next
year<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:41.490> hopefully<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:42.030> can<00:03:42.180> get<00:03:42.420> them<00:03:42.569> built

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
year so hopefully I can get them built

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.900 
year so hopefully I can get them built
before<00:03:43.170> we<00:03:43.260> start<00:03:43.500> heating<00:03:43.620> again<00:03:43.980> thanks<00:03:44.790> for

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
before we start heating again thanks for

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.180 
before we start heating again thanks for
watching
