they've<00:00:30.720> also<00:00:30.869> added<00:00:31.019> touch<00:00:31.470> controls<00:00:32.070> if<00:00:32.279> you

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
they've also added touch controls if you

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.070 
they've also added touch controls if you
saw<00:00:32.730> wish<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.090> play<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.390> but<00:00:33.570> personally<00:00:34.020> I

saw wish to play it but personally I

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.660

think<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.320> button<00:00:34.590> controls<00:00:35.040> are<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.370> only

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
think the button controls are the only

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.850 
think the button controls are the only
way<00:00:35.789> it<00:00:35.879> should<00:00:36.090> be<00:00:36.120> played

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.789 
level except on this one where you go
another<00:02:51.709> boss<00:02:51.980> right<00:02:52.549> after<00:02:53.799> gameplay-wise

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
another boss right after gameplay-wise

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.429 
another boss right after gameplay-wise
it<00:02:55.340> plays<00:02:55.609> perfect<00:02:56.209> I<00:02:56.359> think<00:02:56.480> it<00:02:56.810> controls

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:57.439 
it plays perfect I think it controls

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:59.619 
it plays perfect I think it controls
really<00:02:57.829> well<00:02:57.980> it's<00:02:58.310> so<00:02:58.819> much<00:02:59.060> better<00:02:59.269> to<00:02:59.419> have

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
really well it's so much better to have

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.569 
really well it's so much better to have
a<00:02:59.659> proper<00:03:00.019> analog<00:03:00.409> than<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.709> analog<00:03:01.069> knob<00:03:01.340> and

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
a proper analog than the analog knob and

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.539 
a proper analog than the analog knob and
I<00:03:02.329> think<00:03:02.689> using<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.109> L&amp;R<00:03:03.560> buttons<00:03:03.949> are<00:03:04.129> much

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
I think using the L&amp;R buttons are much

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.339 
I think using the L&amp;R buttons are much
better<00:03:04.760> for<00:03:04.969> firing<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:05.840> charging<00:03:06.230> up<00:03:06.319> your

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
better for firing and charging up your

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.679 
better for firing and charging up your
shot<00:03:06.709> then<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.699> world<00:03:07.879> on<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.120> PSP

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
shot then the world on the PSP

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.959 
shot then the world on the PSP
I<00:03:08.900> just<00:03:09.620> think<00:03:09.799> it's<00:03:09.949> an<00:03:10.040> awesome<00:03:10.189> game<00:03:10.459> and<00:03:10.669> if

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:10.969 
I just think it's an awesome game and if

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:12.670 
I just think it's an awesome game and if
you<00:03:11.060> liked<00:03:11.329> it<00:03:11.480> before<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:12.109> you<00:03:12.560> were

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
you liked it before and you were

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.990 
you liked it before and you were
wondering<00:03:13.040> if<00:03:13.159> it<00:03:13.280> was<00:03:13.340> worth<00:03:13.549> getting<00:03:13.849> it

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
wondering if it was worth getting it

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.179 
wondering if it was worth getting it
again<00:03:14.299> I<00:03:14.540> definitely<00:03:15.049> think<00:03:15.349> it<00:03:15.500> is<00:03:15.650> if<00:03:15.919> you

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:16.189 
again I definitely think it is if you

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:18.220 
again I definitely think it is if you
never<00:03:16.400> played<00:03:16.699> it<00:03:16.730> before<00:03:16.909> then<00:03:17.480> definitely

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
never played it before then definitely

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.220 
never played it before then definitely
get<00:03:18.650> it<00:03:18.769> because<00:03:19.010> for<00:03:19.879> two<00:03:20.000> pound<00:03:20.299> for<00:03:20.569> you<00:03:21.049> can

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
get it because for two pound for you can

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.309 
get it because for two pound for you can
do<00:03:21.409> much<00:03:21.739> worse<00:03:22.040> for<00:03:22.370> much<00:03:22.759> more<00:03:23.030> money<00:03:23.199> on<00:03:24.199> the
