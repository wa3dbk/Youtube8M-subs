00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.480
 my name is assumption agro scene I have 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.800
 29 years old and I am a fourth year resident of 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.110
 the residence of punishment for images 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.960
 I chose the austral hospital because I wanted 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.730
 an inpatient center where you can 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.550
 have a comprehensive approach to the patient 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.200
 and a follow - up of the chosen pathology 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.140
 in this type of images because it is a 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.390
 transversal specialty in that it does not 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.690
 has continuous contact with others 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.030
 specialties and is something inexhaustible or 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.220
 be one nourishes and enriches 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.110
 permanently this opens you 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.610
 possibilities to everything because as you see 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.070
 everything we see tomography ultrasound 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.839
 bone interventionism resonance 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.940
 you see everything then then it 's a 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:54.750
 complete training and that helps you 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.820
 unfold tomorrow in 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.309
 any area and know that that 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.140
 help because if it's good so what 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.299
 I like that interventionism or not 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.370
 particularly this residence is 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:08.430
 it stands out because from the first year 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.200
 we make pre-reports we have access to 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.360
 all diagnostic modalities 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.969
 including interventionism that is something 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.079
 which is not so frequent is also something 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:18.640
 important that we are always 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:21.880
 accompanied by a superior or 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.560
 supervised in all in all 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.079
 modalities that we developed and that you 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.280
 makes you feel accompanied and sure of what 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:32.799
 what you do is a residence with a lot 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.229
 academic training among them classes 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.799
 that we continually do athenaeums and 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.689
 Hospital committees and all the time 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.979
 is what we do is stimulate and 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.439
 encourage the topic of research 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.810
 for the development of articles and the 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.789
 presentation in congresses in addition 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.920
 we have the possibility of 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.679
 interact and have continuous contact 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.060
 with doctors from other specialties and 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.979
 residents of the same specialties 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.810
 of the hospital is very human, that is all 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.239
 contact with the patient and the contact 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.520
 among us doctors is a place 

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:09.369
 that there is possibility of 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.200
 continuous dialogue and that's something that 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.830
 I value we have the possibility to rotate 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.590
 in public and private hospitals and 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.849
 also abroad because the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.220
 hospital has agreements 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.410
 specific in certain places if 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.510
 they met my expectations there until 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.400
 now they are coming and every time 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.890
 more and I think it's a new residence 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.590
 but what is growing a lot and what 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.209
 is on the way to being much better tomorrow 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.209
 that I am me and if it is good
