that you are getting well and I

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.539 
that you are getting well and I
practiced<00:03:56.549> it<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:57.120> I<00:03:57.420> found<00:03:58.110> that<00:03:58.560> it<00:03:58.829> worked

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
tremendously so I continued that and I

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.600 
tremendously so I continued that and I
believe<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:05.640> helped<00:04:06.360> me<00:04:06.480> because<00:04:06.900> I<00:04:07.610> didn't

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
believe that helped me because I didn't

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.349 
believe that helped me because I didn't
have<00:04:08.970> any<00:04:09.360> feeling<00:04:09.989> for<00:04:10.040> cravings<00:04:11.040> of

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
have any feeling for cravings of

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.640 
have any feeling for cravings of
anything<00:04:13.100> so<00:04:14.100> in<00:04:14.489> a<00:04:14.609> mentally<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.449> was<00:04:16.079> assisted

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
anything so in a mentally I was assisted

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:17.990 
anything so in a mentally I was assisted
by<00:04:16.680> this

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
by this

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.210 
by this
and<00:04:18.449> physically<00:04:19.079> I<00:04:19.229> was<00:04:19.560> assisted

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
and physically I was assisted

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.939 
and physically I was assisted
tremendously<00:04:20.880> by<00:04:22.009> macrobiotics<00:04:23.030> so<00:04:24.030> I

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
tremendously by macrobiotics so I

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.279 
tremendously by macrobiotics so I
figured<00:04:25.949> that<00:04:26.190> through<00:04:26.940> macrobiotics<00:04:27.870> I

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
figured that through macrobiotics I

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.730 
figured that through macrobiotics I
change<00:04:29.220> the<00:04:29.850> whole<00:04:29.880> body<00:04:30.449> my<00:04:30.750> Constitution<00:04:31.590> is

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
change the whole body my Constitution is

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.890 
change the whole body my Constitution is
because<00:04:32.220> I<00:04:32.340> was<00:04:32.550> living<00:04:32.970> on<00:04:33.150> very<00:04:33.570> high

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
because I was living on very high

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.689 
because I was living on very high
protein<00:04:34.259> high<00:04:34.820> calorie<00:04:36.410> American<00:04:37.410> food<00:04:37.740> but

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
protein high calorie American food but

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:44.150 
protein high calorie American food but
now<00:04:39.259> very<00:04:40.259> strict<00:04:41.539> macrobiotics<00:04:42.680> so<00:04:43.680> my<00:04:43.830> whole

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
now very strict macrobiotics so my whole

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.969 
now very strict macrobiotics so my whole
Constitution<00:04:44.880> changed<00:04:45.570> all<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.289> toxins<00:04:46.770> were

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
Constitution changed all the toxins were

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.510 
Constitution changed all the toxins were
discharged<00:04:47.750> then<00:04:48.750> my<00:04:48.990> mental<00:04:49.650> attitude<00:04:50.130> was

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
discharged then my mental attitude was

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.330 
discharged then my mental attitude was
right<00:04:51.050> because<00:04:52.050> of<00:04:52.260> this<00:04:53.240> imagery<00:04:54.500> and<00:04:55.500> again

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
right because of this imagery and again

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.000 
right because of this imagery and again
that<00:04:56.669> helped<00:04:57.150> to<00:04:57.600> boost<00:04:57.990> up<00:04:58.289> my<00:04:58.320> immunity

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
that helped to boost up my immunity

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:04.850 
that helped to boost up my immunity
level<00:04:59.910> of<00:05:00.030> immunity<00:05:01.130> then<00:05:02.780> friends<00:05:03.780> of<00:05:04.350> ours

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860

thinking in terms of death and life now
for<00:05:46.440> the<00:05:46.530> first<00:05:46.710> time<00:05:46.949> in<00:05:47.130> my<00:05:47.280> life<00:05:47.520> that<00:05:47.880> there

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
for the first time in my life that there

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.710 
for the first time in my life that there
was<00:05:48.449> something<00:05:48.720> beyond<00:05:49.380> what<00:05:49.740> we<00:05:50.400> could<00:05:50.720> call

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
was something beyond what we could call

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.610 
was something beyond what we could call
scientific<00:05:52.729> understanding<00:05:54.440> something<00:05:55.440> much

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
scientific understanding something much

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.120 
scientific understanding something much
greater<00:05:57.020> including<00:05:58.020> death<00:05:58.260> and<00:05:58.620> so<00:05:58.830> on<00:05:58.889> so

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
greater including death and so on so

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.339 
greater including death and so on so

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:01.349 
forth so I was becoming very

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:05.719 
forth so I was becoming very
philosophical<00:06:02.340> and<00:06:04.490> typically<00:06:05.490> I<00:06:05.550> was

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:05.729 
philosophical and typically I was

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:07.550 
philosophical and typically I was
thinking<00:06:06.060> when<00:06:06.449> do<00:06:07.080> I<00:06:07.110> die

how<00:06:08.159> do<00:06:08.220> I<00:06:08.490> die<00:06:08.639> but<00:06:09.210> in<00:06:09.389> the<00:06:09.539> meantime<00:06:09.750> how<00:06:10.229> do

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:10.289 
how do I die but in the meantime how do

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:13.100 
how do I die but in the meantime how do
I<00:06:10.440> live<00:06:10.770> kind<00:06:11.159> of<00:06:11.280> thing<00:06:11.539> so<00:06:12.539> one<00:06:12.930> becomes

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
I live kind of thing so one becomes

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.420 
I live kind of thing so one becomes
fairly<00:06:13.740> religious<00:06:15.470> then<00:06:16.470> I<00:06:16.590> became<00:06:16.919> religious
