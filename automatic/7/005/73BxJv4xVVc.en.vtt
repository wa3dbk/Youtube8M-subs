carpets<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.930> stuff<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.140> think<00:01:22.320> early<00:01:22.409> or

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
carpets and stuff I think early or

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.200 
carpets and stuff I think early or
something<00:01:22.950> are<00:01:23.280> now<00:01:23.430> as<00:01:23.580> corner<00:01:23.880> stairs<00:01:24.090> I

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
something are now as corner stairs I

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.789 
something are now as corner stairs I
think<00:01:24.420> they<00:01:24.869> brought<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.229> some<00:01:25.380> weird<00:01:25.500> stuff

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
think they brought in some weird stuff

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.499 
think they brought in some weird stuff
like<00:01:25.920> they<00:01:26.189> bring<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.490> some<00:01:26.670> stuff<00:01:26.909> early<00:01:27.270> and

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
like they bring in some stuff early and

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.020 
like they bring in some stuff early and
then<00:01:28.200> later<00:01:28.829> on<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.579> know<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:29.820> they<00:01:29.939> have

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
then later on you know like they have

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.130 
then later on you know like they have
lessened<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.479> update<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.049> think

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
lessened the update so I think

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.569 
lessened the update so I think
eventually<00:01:31.470> they're<00:01:31.860> going<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.189> work<00:01:32.369> out

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
eventually they're going to work out

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.789 
eventually they're going to work out
where<00:01:32.970> they<00:01:33.090> can<00:01:33.240> skip<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.540> couple<00:01:33.750> updates<00:01:34.170> but

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
where they can skip a couple updates but

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:35.749 
where they can skip a couple updates but
yeah<00:01:34.890> like<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.100> said<00:01:35.280> like<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.549> we're<00:01:35.670> not

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
yeah like I said like that we're not

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.069 
yeah like I said like that we're not
gonna<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:36.000> getting<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.299> anytime<00:01:36.540> soon<00:01:36.869> I

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
gonna be getting this anytime soon I

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.109 
gonna be getting this anytime soon I
don't<00:01:37.259> think<00:01:37.320> next<00:01:38.250> question<00:01:38.579> do<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.880> think

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
don't think next question do you think

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.960 
don't think next question do you think
tio<00:01:39.479> 17<00:01:39.930> will<00:01:40.079> add<00:01:40.259> new<00:01:40.560> commands<00:01:41.159> like<00:01:41.610> stop

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
tio 17 will add new commands like stop

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.660 
tio 17 will add new commands like stop
rain<00:01:42.329> change<00:01:42.840> time<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:44.070> know<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.340> today<00:01:44.490> or

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
rain change time you know it today or

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.450 
rain change time you know it today or
tonight<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.570> change<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.590> setting<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.189> like

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
tonight and change the setting of like

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.550 
tonight and change the setting of like
the<00:01:47.579> difficulty<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.240> game<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.930> actually<00:01:49.350> don't

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
the difficulty in game I actually don't

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.260 
the difficulty in game I actually don't
think<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.700> current<00:01:51.149> generation

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
think that the current generation

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.819 
think that the current generation
consoles<00:01:52.020> will<00:01:52.140> ever<00:01:52.350> have<00:01:52.590> this

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
consoles will ever have this

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.859 
consoles will ever have this
unfortunately<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.119> do<00:01:54.180> think<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.570> next

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
unfortunately but I do think the next

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.920 
unfortunately but I do think the next
gen<00:01:55.020> consoles<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.710> xbox<00:01:56.430> one<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.700> ps4<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.570> do

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
gen consoles like xbox one and ps4 I do

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.359 
gen consoles like xbox one and ps4 I do
think<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.409> they<00:01:58.649> will<00:01:58.829> be<00:01:58.860> getting<00:01:59.250> them

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
think that they will be getting them

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.490 
think that they will be getting them
probably<00:02:00.119> not<00:02:00.299> at<00:02:00.420> like<00:02:00.570> launch<00:02:00.869> or<00:02:01.229> maybe<00:02:01.380> an

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
probably not at like launch or maybe an

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.080 
probably not at like launch or maybe an
update<00:02:01.799> or<00:02:01.920> two<00:02:02.040> later<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.579> hopefully<00:02:02.939> they

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
update or two later that hopefully they

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.459 
update or two later that hopefully they
have<00:02:03.390> enough<00:02:03.630> power<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.990> where<00:02:04.200> they<00:02:04.290> can

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
have enough power to where they can

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.219 
have enough power to where they can
actually<00:02:04.649> do<00:02:05.340> these<00:02:05.520> commands<00:02:06.090> next<00:02:06.869> question

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
actually do these commands next question

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.229 
actually do these commands next question
do<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.409> think<00:02:07.649> tu<00:02:07.829> 17<00:02:08.250> will<00:02:08.399> add<00:02:08.489> new<00:02:08.759> potions

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
do you think tu 17 will add new potions

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.869 
do you think tu 17 will add new potions
or<00:02:09.479> any<00:02:10.050> new<00:02:10.170> achievements<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.400> as<00:02:11.489> far<00:02:11.670> as<00:02:11.730> I

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
or any new achievements so as far as I

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.490 
or any new achievements so as far as I
know<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.270> next<00:02:12.420> updates<00:02:12.810> aren't<00:02:13.050> scheduled

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
know the next updates aren't scheduled

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.100 
know the next updates aren't scheduled
for<00:02:13.740> either<00:02:14.280> one<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:14.610> those<00:02:14.850> but<00:02:15.690> i<00:02:15.720> do<00:02:15.930> think

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
for either one of those but i do think

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.940 
for either one of those but i do think
they're<00:02:16.290> going<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.440> be<00:02:16.530> adding<00:02:16.620> something

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
they're going to be adding something

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.100 
they're going to be adding something
similar<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.580> potions<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.600> enchantments<00:02:19.050> and

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
similar to potions and enchantments and

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.750 
similar to potions and enchantments and
it's<00:02:19.290> called<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.530> beacon<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.430> they<00:02:20.550> don't<00:02:20.610> know

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
it's called a beacon so they don't know

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.670 
it's called a beacon so they don't know
a<00:02:20.790> beacon<00:02:21.150> like<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.570> build<00:02:21.750> up<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.990> you<00:02:22.410> look

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
a beacon like you to build up a you look

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.930 
a beacon like you to build up a you look
like<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.860> oh<00:02:23.220> no<00:02:23.400> 5<00:02:23.790> by<00:02:24.000> 5<00:02:24.530> square<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.940> like

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
like a oh no 5 by 5 square of like

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.580 
like a oh no 5 by 5 square of like
diamond<00:02:27.330> blocks<00:02:27.570> or<00:02:27.810> iron<00:02:27.990> blocks<00:02:28.380> or

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
diamond blocks or iron blocks or

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.990 
diamond blocks or iron blocks or
something<00:02:28.740> and<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.340> make<00:02:29.460> it<00:02:29.550> like<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.670> pyramid

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
something and you make it like a pyramid

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.880 
something and you make it like a pyramid
where<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.420> go<00:02:30.540> in<00:02:30.750> one<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.380> go<00:02:31.500> up<00:02:31.650> one

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
where you go in one and you go up one

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.550 
where you go in one and you go up one
and<00:02:32.160> at<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.790> top<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.209> put<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.390> beacon<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.080> you

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
and at the top you put a beacon and you

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.080 
and at the top you put a beacon and you
can<00:02:34.770> put<00:02:35.160> like<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.280> diamond<00:02:35.520> or<00:02:35.730> something<00:02:36.000> in

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
can put like a diamond or something in

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.750 
can put like a diamond or something in
the<00:02:36.150> beacon<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.690> then<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.350> can<00:02:37.500> give<00:02:37.770> a<00:02:38.070> radius

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
the beacon and then it can give a radius

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.430 
the beacon and then it can give a radius
of<00:02:39.000> however<00:02:39.360> big<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.510> towers<00:02:39.870> i<00:02:40.020> think<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.320> how

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
of however big the towers i think is how

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.530 
of however big the towers i think is how
it<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:41.190> gives<00:02:41.430> like<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:41.640> radius<00:02:42.030> around<00:02:42.180> the

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
it is it gives like a radius around the

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.990 
it is it gives like a radius around the
beacon<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.170> like<00:02:44.010> eric<00:02:44.250> creates<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.670> radius

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
beacon and like eric creates a radius

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.970 
beacon and like eric creates a radius
and<00:02:45.240> then<00:02:45.810> if<00:02:45.930> you're<00:02:46.020> inside<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.650> that<00:02:46.770> then

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
and then if you're inside of that then

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.830 
and then if you're inside of that then
you<00:02:47.070> get<00:02:47.250> an<00:02:47.340> effect<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:48.239> let's<00:02:48.390> say<00:02:48.570> like<00:02:48.720> it

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
you get an effect so let's say like it

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.780 
you get an effect so let's say like it
goes<00:02:49.020> out<00:02:49.230> 20<00:02:49.739> blocks<00:02:49.950> in<00:02:50.430> every<00:02:50.610> direction

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
goes out 20 blocks in every direction

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.240 
goes out 20 blocks in every direction
and<00:02:51.480> then<00:02:52.170> if<00:02:52.320> you're<00:02:52.440> in<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.620> if<00:02:52.950> you're<00:02:53.160> in

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
and then if you're in that if you're in

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.620 
and then if you're in that if you're in
that<00:02:53.310> certain<00:02:53.640> area<00:02:53.850> you<00:02:53.970> get<00:02:54.150> like<00:02:54.270> a<00:02:54.300> speed

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
that certain area you get like a speed

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.720 
that certain area you get like a speed
boost<00:02:54.930> or<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.230> jump<00:02:55.530> boost<00:02:55.800> or<00:02:56.070> a<00:02:56.100> mining<00:02:56.489> boost

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
boost or a jump boost or a mining boost

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.940 
boost or a jump boost or a mining boost
or<00:02:57.270> a<00:02:57.330> health<00:02:57.570> health<00:02:57.989> regeneration<00:02:58.320> boost

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
or a health health regeneration boost

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.560 
or a health health regeneration boost
you<00:02:59.130> know<00:02:59.250> something<00:02:59.520> like<00:02:59.610> that<00:02:59.820> so<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.390> didn't

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
you know something like that so I didn't

rubies<00:03:13.890> in<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.910> code<00:03:15.209> or<00:03:15.600> like<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.050> the

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
rubies in the the code or like the the

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.580 
rubies in the the code or like the the
programming<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.459> xbox<00:03:18.120> 360<00:03:18.660> like<00:03:19.290> if<00:03:19.380> you<00:03:19.470> look

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
programming of xbox 360 like if you look

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.050 
programming of xbox 360 like if you look
in<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.739> codes<00:03:20.070> you<00:03:20.250> can<00:03:20.280> actually<00:03:20.459> see<00:03:20.640> like

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
in the codes you can actually see like

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.229 
in the codes you can actually see like
they<00:03:21.209> had<00:03:21.780> created<00:03:22.049> a<00:03:22.920> visual<00:03:23.640> part<00:03:23.850> for

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
they had created a visual part for

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.390 
they had created a visual part for
rubies<00:03:24.750> which<00:03:25.019> is<00:03:25.170> weird<00:03:25.350> well<00:03:25.860> maybe<00:03:26.280> not

extra attack or whatever they would add

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.930 
extra attack or whatever they would add
it<00:04:03.720> was<00:04:04.230> change<00:04:05.100> the<00:04:05.160> coding<00:04:05.459> a<00:04:05.610> little<00:04:05.820> bit

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
it was change the coding a little bit

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.580 
it was change the coding a little bit
but<00:04:06.390> in<00:04:06.540> this<00:04:06.630> case<00:04:06.810> it<00:04:06.989> had<00:04:07.079> to<00:04:07.170> create<00:04:07.410> all

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
but in this case it had to create all

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.039 
but in this case it had to create all
new<00:04:07.920> items<00:04:08.340> i<00:04:08.549> don't<00:04:08.850> see<00:04:09.209> 4j<00:04:09.600> doing<00:04:09.930> that

in<00:04:30.410> the<00:04:30.530> LED<00:04:30.710> you<00:04:30.800> don't<00:04:30.949> know<00:04:31.010> the<00:04:31.160> last

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
in the LED you don't know the last

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.740 
in the LED you don't know the last
update<00:04:31.790> we<00:04:31.880> were<00:04:31.970> actually<00:04:32.060> supposed<00:04:32.330> to<00:04:32.630> have

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
update we were actually supposed to have

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.600 
update we were actually supposed to have
adventure<00:04:33.169> mode<00:04:33.350> and<00:04:33.590> for<00:04:34.100> some<00:04:34.280> reason<00:04:34.310> they

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
adventure mode and for some reason they

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.670 
adventure mode and for some reason they
didn't<00:04:34.820> add<00:04:34.940> it<00:04:34.970> and<00:04:35.300> so<00:04:35.990> I'm<00:04:36.139> thinking<00:04:36.500> like

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
didn't add it and so I'm thinking like

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.379 
didn't add it and so I'm thinking like
this<00:04:36.889> I<00:04:37.130> think<00:04:37.580> this<00:04:37.669> is<00:04:37.729> going<00:04:37.970> to<00:04:38.060> be<00:04:38.150> a<00:04:38.180> thing

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
this I think this is going to be a thing

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:39.250 
this I think this is going to be a thing
I<00:04:38.479> think<00:04:38.660> that<00:04:38.810> maybe<00:04:38.960> they<00:04:39.110> were<00:04:39.169> just

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
I think that maybe they were just

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.170 
I think that maybe they were just
waiting<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:39.889> add<00:04:40.010> both<00:04:40.310> of<00:04:40.430> them<00:04:40.550> at<00:04:40.610> once<00:04:40.850> or

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
waiting to add both of them at once or

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.969 
waiting to add both of them at once or
if<00:04:41.720> they<00:04:41.840> just<00:04:41.870> didn't<00:04:42.260> have<00:04:42.380> time<00:04:42.530> to<00:04:42.680> do<00:04:42.740> code

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
if they just didn't have time to do code

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:45.969 
if they just didn't have time to do code
for<00:04:43.220> I<00:04:43.250> don't<00:04:43.370> know<00:04:43.520> I<00:04:43.850> do<00:04:44.180> I'm<00:04:44.720> like<00:04:45.139> ninety

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
for I don't know I do I'm like ninety

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:47.920 
for I don't know I do I'm like ninety
ninety<00:04:46.400> percent<00:04:46.520> positive<00:04:46.910> we're<00:04:47.720> going<00:04:47.870> to

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
ninety percent positive we're going to

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.240 
ninety percent positive we're going to
be<00:04:48.050> getting<00:04:48.139> at<00:04:48.350> a<00:04:48.380> very<00:04:48.620> least<00:04:48.800> adventure

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
be getting at a very least adventure

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.490 
be getting at a very least adventure
mode<00:04:49.400> if<00:04:49.580> not<00:04:49.790> both<00:04:50.139> okay<00:04:51.139> so<00:04:51.199> the<00:04:51.380> last

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
mode if not both okay so the last

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.050 
mode if not both okay so the last
question<00:04:51.620> here<00:04:52.040> is<00:04:52.100> where<00:04:52.400> we<00:04:52.430> get<00:04:52.639> stained

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
question here is where we get stained

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.600 
question here is where we get stained
glass<00:04:53.389> and<00:04:53.419> stained<00:04:54.050> clay<00:04:54.490> actually<00:04:55.490> think

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
glass and stained clay actually think

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.460 
glass and stained clay actually think
this<00:04:55.669> is<00:04:55.820> a<00:04:55.850> super<00:04:56.389> low<00:04:56.600> chance<00:04:56.930> as<00:04:57.080> far<00:04:57.290> as<00:04:57.410> I

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
this is a super low chance as far as I

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.820 
this is a super low chance as far as I
know<00:04:57.530> stained<00:04:58.400> glass<00:04:58.790> came<00:04:59.300> in<00:04:59.570> at<00:05:00.440> one<00:05:00.650> point

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
know stained glass came in at one point

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.409 
know stained glass came in at one point
seven<00:05:01.190> so<00:05:01.760> that's<00:05:01.880> like<00:05:02.000> three<00:05:02.300> or<00:05:02.389> four

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
seven so that's like three or four

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.960 
seven so that's like three or four
updates<00:05:02.930> away<00:05:03.229> and<00:05:03.500> stained<00:05:04.040> clay<00:05:04.370> I'm<00:05:04.610> pretty

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
updates away and stained clay I'm pretty

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.640 
updates away and stained clay I'm pretty
positive<00:05:05.210> didn't<00:05:05.720> come<00:05:05.870> in<00:05:05.990> this<00:05:06.080> update<00:05:06.290> or

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
positive didn't come in this update or

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.850 
positive didn't come in this update or
the<00:05:07.310> equivalent<00:05:07.760> of<00:05:07.820> this<00:05:07.970> update<00:05:08.330> so<00:05:08.810> I

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
the equivalent of this update so I

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.420 
the equivalent of this update so I
unfortunately<00:05:09.860> I<00:05:09.889> think<00:05:09.950> we<00:05:10.070> have<00:05:10.100> to<00:05:10.220> wait

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
unfortunately I think we have to wait

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.610 
unfortunately I think we have to wait
for<00:05:10.460> both<00:05:10.820> of<00:05:10.940> these<00:05:11.260> there's<00:05:12.260> another<00:05:12.440> thing

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
for both of these there's another thing

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.409 
for both of these there's another thing
like<00:05:12.770> i<00:05:12.889> did<00:05:13.160> some<00:05:13.310> speculation<00:05:13.880> videos<00:05:14.150> about

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
like i did some speculation videos about

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.030 
like i did some speculation videos about
it<00:05:14.600> but<00:05:15.200> i'll<00:05:15.290> turn<00:05:15.560> out<00:05:15.710> to<00:05:15.770> be<00:05:15.860> wrong

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
it but i'll turn out to be wrong

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.219 
it but i'll turn out to be wrong
unfortunately<00:05:16.450> but<00:05:17.450> yeah<00:05:17.630> so<00:05:17.870> unless<00:05:18.050> they

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
unfortunately but yeah so unless they

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:20.409 
unfortunately but yeah so unless they
really<00:05:18.440> surprised<00:05:19.100> us<00:05:19.310> I<00:05:19.550> think<00:05:20.090> we're<00:05:20.240> not

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
really surprised us I think we're not

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:21.850 
really surprised us I think we're not
going<00:05:20.690> to<00:05:20.750> be<00:05:20.840> getting<00:05:20.930> these<00:05:21.169> in<00:05:21.410> the<00:05:21.530> update

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
going to be getting these in the update

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.219 
going to be getting these in the update
I<00:05:22.100> hate<00:05:22.669> dated<00:05:22.940> on<00:05:23.030> a<00:05:23.060> sour<00:05:23.270> note<00:05:23.389> but<00:05:23.840> hey<00:05:24.020> I
