did<00:01:34.510> you<00:01:34.540> think<00:01:34.690> about<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.900> nexus<00:01:35.260> talk<00:01:35.470> um

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
did you think about the nexus talk um

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.730 
did you think about the nexus talk um
I'm<00:01:36.880> really<00:01:37.210> excited<00:01:37.540> about<00:01:37.690> nexus<00:01:38.110> actually

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
I'm really excited about nexus actually

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.160 
I'm really excited about nexus actually
why<00:01:39.370> why<00:01:39.520> is<00:01:39.580> that<00:01:39.730> because<00:01:40.150> I<00:01:40.360> develop<00:01:41.020> in

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
why why is that because I develop in

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.960 
why why is that because I develop in
visual<00:01:41.620> studio<00:01:41.650> and<00:01:42.340> windows<00:01:42.640> and<00:01:42.880> I'm

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
visual studio and windows and I'm

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.280 
visual studio and windows and I'm
running<00:01:43.240> through<00:01:43.510> the<00:01:43.600> applications<00:01:44.140> right

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
running through the applications right

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.800 
running through the applications right
now<00:01:44.470> and<00:01:44.909> that's<00:01:45.909> one<00:01:46.510> of<00:01:46.540> the<00:01:46.630> big

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
now and that's one of the big

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.430 
now and that's one of the big
limitations<00:01:47.380> is<00:01:47.590> not<00:01:47.950> being<00:01:48.100> able<00:01:48.220> to<00:01:48.750> debug

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
limitations is not being able to debug

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.830 
limitations is not being able to debug
what<00:01:52.190> did<00:01:52.370> you<00:01:52.400> say<00:01:52.520> thing<00:01:52.970> in<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.480> during<00:01:53.780> the

what did you say thing in the during the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.050 
what did you say thing in the during the
talk<00:01:54.050> that<00:01:54.260> completely<00:01:54.830> surprised<00:01:55.280> you<00:01:55.520> um

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
talk that completely surprised you um

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.960 
talk that completely surprised you um
well<00:01:56.900> the<00:01:57.530> whole<00:01:58.160> talk<00:01:58.370> actually<00:01:58.640> because<00:01:58.790> I

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
well the whole talk actually because I

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.790 
well the whole talk actually because I
didn't<00:01:59.330> realize<00:01:59.630> that<00:01:59.900> this<00:02:00.200> product<00:02:00.470> was

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
didn't realize that this product was

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.310 
didn't realize that this product was
coming<00:02:01.460> out<00:02:01.610> so<00:02:01.970> I<00:02:02.000> saw<00:02:02.570> it<00:02:02.720> in<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:02.840> in<00:02:03.260> the

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
coming out so I saw it in the in the

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.170 
coming out so I saw it in the in the
program<00:02:03.830> since<00:02:04.190> I'm<00:02:04.370> of<00:02:04.580> debugging<00:02:04.940> and

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
program since I'm of debugging and

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.760 
program since I'm of debugging and
windows<00:02:05.450> of<00:02:05.600> it<00:02:05.720> that's<00:02:05.990> a<00:02:06.080> good<00:02:06.200> idea<00:02:06.290> and

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
windows of it that's a good idea and

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.389 
windows of it that's a good idea and
yeah<00:02:07.190> so<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.610> whole<00:02:07.760> product<00:02:07.970> is<00:02:09.310> what<00:02:10.310> does

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
yeah so the whole product is what does

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.870 
yeah so the whole product is what does
it<00:02:10.520> mean<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:10.880> as<00:02:11.090> a<00:02:11.120> programmer<00:02:12.670> it<00:02:13.670> just

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
it mean to you as a programmer it just

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.550 
it mean to you as a programmer it just
means<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.180> things<00:02:14.360> are<00:02:14.510> going<00:02:14.600> to<00:02:14.690> be<00:02:14.780> much

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
means that things are going to be much

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.740 
means that things are going to be much
easier<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.330> development<00:02:17.330> times<00:02:17.480> can<00:02:17.660> be

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
easier and development times can be

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.980 
easier and development times can be
shorter<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.490> less<00:02:19.490> frustrating<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.210> guess<00:02:20.240> I'd

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
shorter and less frustrating I guess I'd

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.210 
shorter and less frustrating I guess I'd
like<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.260> get<00:02:21.380> your<00:02:21.440> feedback<00:02:21.590> on<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:22.010> overall

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
like to get your feedback on the overall

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.000 
like to get your feedback on the overall
talk<00:02:22.520> how'd<00:02:22.730> it<00:02:22.850> go<00:02:22.970> well<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.810> was<00:02:24.020> very<00:02:24.410> very

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
which was very amazing and a lot of work

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.110 
which was very amazing and a lot of work
question<00:02:30.980> lots<00:02:31.220> of<00:02:31.400> interest<00:02:31.910> from<00:02:32.030> the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
question lots of interest from the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.390 
question lots of interest from the
developers<00:02:32.540> I<00:02:33.260> was<00:02:33.590> actually<00:02:33.770> surprised<00:02:34.220> to

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
developers I was actually surprised to

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.230 
developers I was actually surprised to
see<00:02:34.610> that<00:02:35.030> many<00:02:35.810> windows<00:02:36.770> developers<00:02:37.400> doing<00:02:37.970> a

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
see that many windows developers doing a

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.470 
see that many windows developers doing a
complete<00:02:38.570> work<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.110> I<00:02:39.770> think<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:41.090> Nexus

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
complete work and I think the Nexus

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.730 
complete work and I think the Nexus
product<00:02:41.840> is<00:02:41.930> going<00:02:42.020> to<00:02:42.080> be<00:02:42.200> a<00:02:42.230> big<00:02:42.440> help<00:02:42.470> for

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
product is going to be a big help for

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.800 
product is going to be a big help for
them<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.160> I<00:02:43.610> was<00:02:43.850> surprised<00:02:44.210> to<00:02:44.390> see<00:02:44.570> you<00:02:44.720> know

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
them and I was surprised to see you know

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.080 
them and I was surprised to see you know
so<00:02:45.200> many<00:02:45.320> developers<00:02:45.770> just<00:02:46.250> waiting<00:02:46.490> for<00:02:46.640> what

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
so many developers just waiting for what

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.150 
so many developers just waiting for what
do<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:47.180> think<00:02:47.270> developers<00:02:48.050> who<00:02:48.740> who<00:02:48.920> are<00:02:48.980> in

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
do you think developers who who are in

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.320 
do you think developers who who are in
the<00:02:49.250> talk<00:02:49.460> what<00:02:49.670> do<00:02:49.730> you<00:02:49.790> think<00:02:49.940> are<00:02:50.030> some<00:02:50.090> of

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
the talk what do you think are some of

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.730 
the talk what do you think are some of
the<00:02:50.450> key<00:02:50.660> points<00:02:50.870> that<00:02:51.080> developers<00:02:51.710> should

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
the key points that developers should

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.210 
the key points that developers should
know<00:02:52.040> about<00:02:52.160> nexus<00:02:52.870> well<00:02:53.870> it<00:02:54.050> enables<00:02:54.680> native

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
know about nexus well it enables native

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.850 
know about nexus well it enables native
GPU<00:02:56.000> debugging<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:56.810> that's<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.470> Destin

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
GPU debugging and that's the Destin

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.650 
GPU debugging and that's the Destin
biggest<00:02:58.160> thing<00:02:58.340> is<00:02:58.580> you<00:02:58.970> don't<00:02:59.060> need<00:02:59.209> a<00:02:59.270> cpu<00:02:59.570> to

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
biggest thing is you don't need a cpu to

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:00.790 
biggest thing is you don't need a cpu to
debug<00:02:59.840> your<00:02:59.930> code<00:02:59.989> anymore<00:03:00.350> you<00:03:00.590> don't<00:03:00.739> need

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
debug your code anymore you don't need

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.350 
debug your code anymore you don't need
to<00:03:00.920> run<00:03:01.040> an<00:03:01.160> emulation<00:03:01.459> to<00:03:01.760> devote<00:03:02.030> your<00:03:02.150> code

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
to run an emulation to devote your code

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.840 
to run an emulation to devote your code
anymore<00:03:02.570> to<00:03:03.260> just<00:03:03.560> use<00:03:03.830> Nexus<00:03:04.250> so<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.700> great

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
anymore to just use Nexus so the great

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.260 
anymore to just use Nexus so the great
point<00:03:05.120> into<00:03:05.450> your<00:03:05.860> GPU<00:03:06.860> code<00:03:07.130> to<00:03:07.459> be<00:03:07.640> graphics

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
point into your GPU code to be graphics

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.470 
point into your GPU code to be graphics
or<00:03:08.590> compute<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:09.890> you<00:03:10.640> hear<00:03:10.790> a<00:03:10.820> break<00:03:11.030> and

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
or compute and you hear a break and

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.050 
or compute and you hear a break and
debug<00:03:12.320> as<00:03:12.620> you<00:03:12.890> would<00:03:13.040> expect<00:03:13.130> no<00:03:13.670> from<00:03:13.880> any

debug as you would expect no from any
other<00:03:14.120> processor<00:03:14.660> so<00:03:15.350> what's<00:03:15.530> coming<00:03:15.800> down
