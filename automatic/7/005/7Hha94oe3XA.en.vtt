00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.190 
pencil that's going to show up on this
fabric<00:00:39.060> the<00:00:40.060> strip's<00:00:40.450> are<00:00:40.630> right<00:00:40.870> sides

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
fabric the strip's are right sides

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.410 
fabric the strip's are right sides
together<00:00:41.530> so<00:00:42.460> I'm<00:00:42.610> drawing<00:00:42.940> on<00:00:43.090> the<00:00:43.210> wrong

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
together so I'm drawing on the wrong

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.900 
together so I'm drawing on the wrong
side<00:00:43.810> of<00:00:44.020> the<00:00:44.110> fabric<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:44.770> this<00:00:45.700> is<00:00:45.880> a

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
side of the fabric and this is a

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.910 
side of the fabric and this is a
diagonal<00:00:46.360> line<00:00:46.750> that<00:00:46.780> I<00:00:46.989> want<00:00:47.230> to<00:00:47.410> sew<00:00:47.680> on
