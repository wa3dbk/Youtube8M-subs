00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.410 
ago
but<00:05:11.770> I<00:05:11.800> think<00:05:12.100> he<00:05:12.160> was<00:05:12.250> in<00:05:12.400> a<00:05:12.460> cycle<00:05:12.970> guys<00:05:13.120> come

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
but I think he was in a cycle guys come

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.690 
but I think he was in a cycle guys come
back<00:05:13.570> heavier<00:05:14.020> than<00:05:14.170> ever<00:05:14.560> why<00:05:15.340> do<00:05:15.400> you<00:05:15.520> think

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
back heavier than ever why do you think

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.820 
back heavier than ever why do you think
that<00:05:15.820> is

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
that is

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.930 
that is
major

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.020 

right<00:05:21.540> now<00:05:21.780> I<00:05:22.080> would<00:05:22.230> say<00:05:22.260> the<00:05:22.650> water<00:05:22.890> is<00:05:23.100> in

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
right now I would say the water is in

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.330 
right now I would say the water is in
good<00:05:24.210> shape<00:05:24.480> because<00:05:24.780> uh<00:05:24.990> it's<00:05:25.650> more<00:05:25.980> fished

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
good shape because uh it's more fished

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.160 
good shape because uh it's more fished
and<00:05:26.670> I've<00:05:26.820> ever<00:05:27.060> seen<00:05:27.420> in<00:05:27.660> the<00:05:27.750> water<00:05:27.930> I've

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
and I've ever seen in the water I've

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.260 
never seen so many fish was it worse a
few<00:05:31.350> years<00:05:31.590> ago<00:05:31.740> well<00:05:32.640> I<00:05:32.670> think<00:05:32.820> he<00:05:33.090> was

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
few years ago well I think he was

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.390 
few years ago well I think he was
getting<00:05:33.420> getting<00:05:34.230> pretty<00:05:34.560> bad<00:05:34.800> because

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
getting getting pretty bad because

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.280 
getting getting pretty bad because
everybody<00:05:36.150> was<00:05:36.270> dumping<00:05:36.630> everything<00:05:37.080> in<00:05:37.230> the

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
everybody was dumping everything in the

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.920 
everybody was dumping everything in the
water<00:05:37.580> the<00:05:38.580> big<00:05:39.120> fish<00:05:39.420> was<00:05:39.570> dumping

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
water the big fish was dumping

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.130 
water the big fish was dumping
chemicals<00:05:40.350> and<00:05:40.980> waste<00:05:41.730> and<00:05:42.270> everything<00:05:42.990> is

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
chemicals and waste and everything is

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.790 
chemicals and waste and everything is
boring<00:05:43.560> I<00:05:43.910> think<00:05:45.170> what<00:05:46.170> they're<00:05:46.350> doing<00:05:46.380> on

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
boring I think what they're doing on

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.220 
boring I think what they're doing on
stopping<00:05:47.100> a<00:05:47.340> lot<00:05:47.460> of<00:05:47.550> this<00:05:47.670> runoff<00:05:48.390> is<00:05:48.660> very

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
stopping a lot of this runoff is very

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.520 
stopping a lot of this runoff is very
good<00:05:49.500> I<00:05:49.860> think<00:05:50.370> it'll<00:05:50.520> help<00:05:50.580> a<00:05:50.850> lot<00:05:51.030> I<00:05:51.530> don't

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
good I think it'll help a lot I don't

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.290 
good I think it'll help a lot I don't
think<00:05:52.680> people<00:05:52.770> realize<00:05:53.100> up<00:05:53.520> in<00:05:53.670> Pennsylvania

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
think people realize up in Pennsylvania

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.700 
think people realize up in Pennsylvania
that<00:05:54.480> they're<00:05:54.690> affecting<00:05:55.140> your<00:05:55.260> livelihood

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
that they're affecting your livelihood

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.820 
that they're affecting your livelihood
now<00:05:56.280> let's<00:05:56.730> see<00:05:56.940> when<00:05:57.210> to<00:05:57.360> when<00:05:58.290> that<00:05:58.440> stuff

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
now let's see when to when that stuff

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.280 
now let's see when to when that stuff
that<00:05:59.070> they<00:05:59.220> put<00:05:59.460> on<00:05:59.610> on<00:06:00.240> the<00:06:00.600> glass<00:06:00.900> to<00:06:01.170> make

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.290 
that they put on on the glass to make

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:02.780 
that they put on on the glass to make
them<00:06:01.500> grow<00:06:01.680> gets<00:06:02.070> in<00:06:02.190> the<00:06:02.280> water<00:06:02.400> it<00:06:02.610> also

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
them grow gets in the water it also

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.850 
them grow gets in the water it also
causing<00:06:03.420> the<00:06:03.510> algae<00:06:03.900> to<00:06:04.020> grow<00:06:04.050> too<00:06:04.260> much<00:06:04.500> in

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
causing the algae to grow too much in

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.170 
causing the algae to grow too much in
the<00:06:04.920> water<00:06:05.070> and<00:06:05.280> it<00:06:05.370> eats<00:06:05.550> up<00:06:05.730> the<00:06:05.850> oxygen

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
the water and it eats up the oxygen

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.820 
the water and it eats up the oxygen
so<00:06:08.360> it's<00:06:08.510> white<00:06:08.720> saying<00:06:09.050> is<00:06:09.260> that<00:06:09.410> people<00:06:09.440> up

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
so it's white saying is that people up

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.410 
so it's white saying is that people up
in<00:06:09.950> Pennsylvania<00:06:10.550> might<00:06:10.730> be<00:06:10.820> fertilizing

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.420 
in Pennsylvania might be fertilizing

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.420 
in Pennsylvania might be fertilizing
their<00:06:11.540> lawn<00:06:11.780> to<00:06:12.020> help<00:06:12.140> the<00:06:12.230> grass<00:06:12.470> grow<00:06:12.800> are

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
their lawn to help the grass grow are

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.060 
their lawn to help the grass grow are
also<00:06:13.870> forcing<00:06:14.870> the<00:06:14.960> algae<00:06:15.350> to<00:06:15.470> bloom<00:06:15.500> a<00:06:15.830> little

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
also forcing the algae to bloom a little

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.210 
also forcing the algae to bloom a little
faster<00:06:16.520> here<00:06:16.760> in<00:06:16.880> the<00:06:16.940> water

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
faster here in the water

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.820 
faster here in the water
and<00:06:18.400> likewise<00:06:18.910> people<00:06:19.330> using<00:06:19.750> weedkiller<00:06:20.260> are

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
and likewise people using weedkiller are

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.500 
and likewise people using weedkiller are
going<00:06:20.980> to<00:06:21.040> be<00:06:21.130> killing<00:06:21.370> some<00:06:21.670> precious<00:06:22.030> plants

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.510 
going to be killing some precious plants

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.000 
going to be killing some precious plants
down<00:06:22.660> here<00:06:22.870> in<00:06:22.960> the<00:06:23.020> bay<00:06:23.170> as<00:06:23.320> well

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010 
down here in the bay as well

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.300 
down here in the bay as well
most<00:06:25.790> of<00:06:26.030> it<00:06:26.150> I<00:06:26.210> guess<00:06:26.390> is<00:06:26.540> good<00:06:26.690> common<00:06:27.170> sense

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
most of it I guess is good common sense

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:41.590 
most of it I guess is good common sense
thinking

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.900 

that's<00:06:41.930> why<00:06:42.080> were<00:06:42.290> your<00:06:42.470> parents<00:06:42.710> Waterman<00:06:43.700> -

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:43.910 
that's why were your parents Waterman -

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.660 
that's why were your parents Waterman -
yeah<00:06:44.720> so<00:06:45.560> how<00:06:45.680> long<00:06:45.860> your<00:06:46.010> family's<00:06:46.400> been<00:06:46.550> on

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:46.670 
yeah so how long your family's been on

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.930 
yeah so how long your family's been on
the<00:06:46.760> island<00:06:46.880> for<00:06:47.150> I<00:06:48.310> think<00:06:49.310> ever<00:06:49.490> since<00:06:49.760> it's

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940 
the island for I think ever since it's

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.180 
the island for I think ever since it's
been<00:06:49.970> an<00:06:50.210> island

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.190 
been an island

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.960

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:52.970 
they've been here ever since it was

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.450 
they've been here ever since it was
settled<00:06:53.480> anyway<00:06:53.870> or<00:06:54.110> you<00:06:54.770> know<00:06:54.890> pretty<00:06:55.130> close

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.460 
settled anyway or you know pretty close

the other 2% is they depend on it to

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.629 
the other 2% is they depend on it to
reality<00:07:17.509> they're<00:07:17.870> schoolteachers<00:07:18.710> or<00:07:18.919> maybe

after spending a day crabbing with
Dwight<00:07:39.210> I<00:07:39.479> realized<00:07:40.110> how<00:07:40.320> important<00:07:40.710> the

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 
Dwight I realized how important the

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.740 
Dwight I realized how important the
quality<00:07:41.010> of<00:07:41.310> the<00:07:41.430> Bay<00:07:41.580> is<00:07:41.820> not<00:07:42.270> only<00:07:42.449> to<00:07:42.660> the

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:42.750 
quality of the Bay is not only to the

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.659 
quality of the Bay is not only to the
survival<00:07:43.229> of<00:07:43.290> the<00:07:43.440> island<00:07:43.830> but<00:07:44.190> to<00:07:44.310> the<00:07:44.400> US

00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:44.669 
survival of the island but to the US

00:07:44.669 --> 00:07:47.690 
survival of the island but to the US
economy<00:07:44.850> in<00:07:45.300> general
