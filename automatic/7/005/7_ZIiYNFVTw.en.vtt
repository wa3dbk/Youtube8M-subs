00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.699 

as<00:00:00.179> well<00:00:00.480> so<00:00:00.960> I<00:00:01.020> think<00:00:01.140> that's<00:00:01.350> going<00:00:01.469> to<00:00:01.530> send

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
as well so I think that's going to send

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.230 
as well so I think that's going to send
them<00:00:01.800> up<00:00:01.890> for<00:00:02.010> a<00:00:02.100> good<00:00:02.190> position<00:00:02.490> here<00:00:02.669> as<00:00:02.939> long

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
them up for a good position here as long

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.210 
them up for a good position here as long
as<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:03.840> Terran<00:00:04.110> player<00:00:04.200> can<00:00:04.500> defend<00:00:04.859> against

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
as the Terran player can defend against

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.680 
as the Terran player can defend against
this<00:00:05.310> push<00:00:05.609> that<00:00:05.819> is<00:00:05.970> headed<00:00:06.240> out<00:00:06.359> across<00:00:06.480> the

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
this push that is headed out across the

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.600 
this push that is headed out across the
map<00:00:07.020> right<00:00:07.290> now<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.740> that's<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.429> most

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
map right now and that's the most

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.129 
map right now and that's the most
difficult<00:00:08.790> thing<00:00:09.240> really<00:00:09.450> because<00:00:09.840> why<00:00:10.110> not

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
difficult thing really because why not

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.160 
difficult thing really because why not
is<00:00:10.559> stood<00:00:10.950> 105<00:00:11.519> supply<00:00:11.910> even<00:00:12.300> though<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.960> the

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
is stood 105 supply even though the the

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.390 
is stood 105 supply even though the the
Terran<00:00:13.410> player<00:00:13.500> was<00:00:13.740> able<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.009> take<00:00:14.160> out<00:00:14.280> this

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
Terran player was able to take out this

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.550 
Terran player was able to take out this
Expo<00:00:14.849> he<00:00:15.089> lost<00:00:15.330> his<00:00:15.509> entire<00:00:15.660> army<00:00:16.170> doing<00:00:16.379> so

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
Expo he lost his entire army doing so

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.349 
Expo he lost his entire army doing so
questionable<00:00:17.490> if<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.820> was<00:00:17.910> worth<00:00:18.090> or<00:00:18.240> not

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
questionable if it was worth or not

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.779 
questionable if it was worth or not
because<00:00:18.570> why<00:00:18.869> not<00:00:18.900> add<00:00:19.140> 113<00:00:19.770> Terran<00:00:20.520> player<00:00:20.609> at

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
because why not add 113 Terran player at

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.570 
because why not add 113 Terran player at
58<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:21.779> he's<00:00:21.960> really<00:00:22.380> really<00:00:22.740> low<00:00:22.949> on<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.250> army

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
58 so he's really really low on the army

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.849 
58 so he's really really low on the army
right<00:00:23.699> now<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.750> why<00:00:25.109> not<00:00:25.260> could<00:00:25.650> make<00:00:25.830> a

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
right now and and why not could make a

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.650 
right now and and why not could make a
push<00:00:26.189> right<00:00:26.430> now<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.760> try<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.090> end<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.449> game

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
push right now and try to end the game

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.900 
push right now and try to end the game
it<00:00:28.529> would<00:00:28.800> be<00:00:28.920> difficult<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.369> break<00:00:29.670> through

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
it would be difficult to break through

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.429 
it would be difficult to break through
the<00:00:30.000> Terran<00:00:30.269> army<00:00:30.480> because<00:00:30.630> turns<00:00:30.929> just<00:00:31.320> so

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
the Terran army because turns just so

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.740 
the Terran army because turns just so
good<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.679> static<00:00:32.099> defence<00:00:32.399> we'll<00:00:33.300> have<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.570> see

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
good a static defence we'll have to see

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.479 
good a static defence we'll have to see
if<00:00:33.780> why<00:00:34.020> not<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.380> decides<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.040> push<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.309> looks

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
if why not just decides to push it looks

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.310 
if why not just decides to push it looks
like<00:00:35.640> he's<00:00:35.790> going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.180> make<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.450> scout<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.200> is

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
like he's going to make a scout this is

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.110 
like he's going to make a scout this is
a<00:00:37.350> hallucinating<00:00:37.920> Phoenix<00:00:38.399> I've<00:00:38.790> seen<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.030> lot

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
a hallucinating Phoenix I've seen a lot

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.150 
a hallucinating Phoenix I've seen a lot
of<00:00:39.300> Protoss<00:00:39.660> players<00:00:39.899> use<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.230> before<00:00:40.680> it's

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
of Protoss players use this before it's

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.470 
of Protoss players use this before it's
okay<00:00:41.489> if<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.730> lose<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.000> because<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.390> was

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
okay if you lose this because it was

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.150 
okay if you lose this because it was
just<00:00:42.690> energy<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.559> he<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.710> going<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.920> move<00:00:44.010> in

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
just energy and he is going to move in

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.100 
just energy and he is going to move in
test<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.640> front<00:00:44.850> door<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.270> now<00:00:45.690> he's<00:00:45.960> going

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
test that front door and now he's going

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.510 
test that front door and now he's going
to<00:00:46.170> make<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> decision<00:00:46.739> should<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:47.039> push<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.399> or

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
to make the decision should I push in or

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.430 
to make the decision should I push in or
should<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:47.760> wait<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.510> think<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.050> lot<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.260> it's

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
should I just wait I think a lot of it's

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.049 
should I just wait I think a lot of it's
going<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.620> come<00:00:49.739> down<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.340> expansion<00:00:50.820> but

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
going to come down to that expansion but

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.520 
going to come down to that expansion but
it<00:00:51.180> actually<00:00:51.329> lifted<00:00:51.809> off<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.230> flew<00:00:52.500> away

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
it actually lifted off and flew away

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.049 
it actually lifted off and flew away
there's<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.070> little<00:00:53.160> blue<00:00:53.370> dot<00:00:53.640> there<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:53.969> it

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
there's a little blue dot there so it

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.610 
there's a little blue dot there so it
definitely<00:00:54.239> did<00:00:54.570> get<00:00:54.719> scouted<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.230> was<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.379> dark

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
definitely did get scouted it was a dark

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.560 
definitely did get scouted it was a dark
templar<00:00:56.100> causing<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.879> ruckus<00:00:57.000> over<00:00:57.300> here<00:00:57.480> at

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
templar causing a ruckus over here at

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.610 
templar causing a ruckus over here at
this<00:00:57.660> expansion<00:00:58.050> i<00:00:58.260> think<00:00:58.440> that's<00:00:58.559> very

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
this expansion i think that's very

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.650 
this expansion i think that's very
crucial<00:00:59.250> right<00:00:59.340> now<00:00:59.399> because<00:01:00.059> like<00:01:00.329> he<00:01:00.510> said

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
crucial right now because like he said

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.299 
crucial right now because like he said
he<00:01:00.690> lost<00:01:00.989> his<00:01:01.230> entire<00:01:01.350> army<00:01:01.770> he<00:01:01.920> needs<00:01:02.129> to

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
he lost his entire army he needs to

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.340 
he lost his entire army he needs to
replenish<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.789> army<00:01:03.210> right<00:01:03.480> now<00:01:03.750> otherwise

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
replenish that army right now otherwise

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.080 
replenish that army right now otherwise
the<00:01:04.530> Protoss<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.100> just<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.489> mean<00:01:05.519> if<00:01:05.909> they're<00:01:06.060> on

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
the Protoss is just I mean if they're on

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.969 
the Protoss is just I mean if they're on
even<00:01:06.450> footing<00:01:06.659> now<00:01:06.960> then<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.590> protest<00:01:07.920> is

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
even footing now then the protest is

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.140 
even footing now then the protest is
going<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.220> carry<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.549> advantage<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.119> a

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
going to carry that advantage to a

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.570 
going to carry that advantage to a
victory<00:01:09.360> because<00:01:09.689> he<00:01:09.990> has<00:01:10.200> such<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.799> huge<00:01:11.280> sigh

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
victory because he has such a huge sigh

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.460 
victory because he has such a huge sigh
advantage<00:01:12.060> our<00:01:12.420> supply<00:01:12.780> advantage<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.320> guess

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
advantage our supply advantage I guess

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.469 
advantage our supply advantage I guess
if<00:01:13.590> you're<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> Terran<00:01:14.040> player<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.060> lot

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
if you're a Terran player and so a lot

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.820 
if you're a Terran player and so a lot
of<00:01:15.540> it's<00:01:15.720> going<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.900> come<00:01:15.990> down<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.229> if<00:01:16.530> he<00:01:16.680> can

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
of it's going to come down to if he can

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.219 
of it's going to come down to if he can
secure<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.280> expansion<00:01:17.790> or<00:01:18.150> not<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.720> I'm

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
secure that expansion or not and I'm

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.719 
secure that expansion or not and I'm
kind<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.470> curious<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.799> see<00:01:19.950> if<00:01:20.159> he<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.430> do<00:01:20.610> it

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
kind of curious to see if he can do it

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.160 
kind of curious to see if he can do it
because<00:01:20.939> his<00:01:21.150> opponent<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.630> Protoss<00:01:21.930> player

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
because his opponent the Protoss player

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.230 
because his opponent the Protoss player
why<00:01:22.409> not<00:01:22.619> he<00:01:23.100> has<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.430> expansion<00:01:23.790> back<00:01:24.060> on

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
why not he has this expansion back on

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.670 
why not he has this expansion back on
the<00:01:24.299> way<00:01:24.390> already<00:01:24.630> he<00:01:24.840> has<00:01:24.869> not<00:01:25.140> delayed<00:01:25.470> that

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
the way already he has not delayed that

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.649 
the way already he has not delayed that
whatsoever<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.490> even<00:01:26.880> warping<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.360> million

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
whatsoever and even warping in a million

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.240 
whatsoever and even warping in a million
more<00:01:27.869> units<00:01:28.229> here<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.500> his<00:01:28.619> economy<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.100> still

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
more units here so his economy is still

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.740 
more units here so his economy is still
doing<00:01:29.520> good<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.880> it's<00:01:30.270> going<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.479> be<00:01:30.540> up<00:01:30.659> to

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
doing good and it's going to be up to

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.999 
doing good and it's going to be up to
the<00:01:30.810> Terran<00:01:31.049> player<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.470> make<00:01:31.799> something

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
the Terran player to make something

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.149 
the Terran player to make something
happen<00:01:32.189> here<00:01:32.369> yeah<00:01:33.000> 131<00:01:33.960> supply<00:01:34.380> for<00:01:34.710> why<00:01:34.920> not

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
happen here yeah 131 supply for why not

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.670 
happen here yeah 131 supply for why not
right<00:01:35.369> now<00:01:35.490> not<00:01:35.729> beyblade<00:01:36.270> at<00:01:36.420> 86<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.350> still

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
right now not beyblade at 86 so still

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.640 
right now not beyblade at 86 so still
desperately<00:01:38.369> behind<00:01:38.820> he<00:01:39.600> does<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:40.020> Ravens<00:01:40.470> I

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
desperately behind he does have Ravens I

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.340 
desperately behind he does have Ravens I
suppose<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.790> best<00:01:42.030> use<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.540> unit<00:01:42.869> ability

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
suppose the best use of a unit ability

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.590 
suppose the best use of a unit ability
would<00:01:43.530> be<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.770> point<00:01:43.950> defense<00:01:44.280> drone<00:01:44.600> maybe

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
would be the point defense drone maybe

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.060 
would be the point defense drone maybe
not<00:01:45.780> actually<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.409> way<00:01:46.619> too<00:01:46.979> many

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
not actually this is way too many

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.980 
not actually this is way too many
zealots<00:01:47.310> not<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.909> not<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.240> many<00:01:48.450> stalkers

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
zealots not that not that many stalkers

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.649 
zealots not that not that many stalkers
really<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.530> maybe<00:01:50.430> hunter<00:01:50.759> secret<00:01:51.180> missile<00:01:51.479> I

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
really so maybe hunter secret missile I

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.690 
really so maybe hunter secret missile I
I<00:01:51.689> don't<00:01:51.990> know<00:01:52.140> The<00:01:52.649> Raven<00:01:52.829> really<00:01:53.280> not<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
I don't know The Raven really not the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.160 
I don't know The Raven really not the
most<00:01:53.729> cost-effective<00:01:54.149> units<00:01:54.659> because<00:01:54.930> he<00:01:55.020> did

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
most cost-effective units because he did

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.319 
most cost-effective units because he did
build<00:01:55.380> two<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.310> i'm<00:01:56.430> not<00:01:56.460> sure<00:01:56.640> why<00:01:57.030> he<00:01:57.210> would

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
do this the the auto to it's not really

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.370 
do this the the auto to it's not really

force<00:02:42.510> fields<00:02:42.750> maybe<00:02:42.930> there<00:02:43.110> was<00:02:43.260> some

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
force fields maybe there was some

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.900 
force fields maybe there was some
activity<00:02:43.830> but<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.130> majority<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.640> Terran

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
activity but the majority of the Terran

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.640 
activity but the majority of the Terran
arm<00:02:45.030> is<00:02:45.150> still<00:02:45.360> chillin<00:02:45.660> right<00:02:45.780> here<00:02:46.020> I<00:02:46.170> like

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
arm is still chillin right here I like

arm is still chillin right here I like
how<00:02:46.760> beyblade<00:02:47.760> is<00:02:47.790> switching<00:02:48.330> over<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.540> more

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
how beyblade is switching over to more

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.120 
how beyblade is switching over to more
hellions<00:02:49.230> that's<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.709> pretty<00:02:49.830> good<00:02:50.010> idea

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
hellions that's a pretty good idea

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.980 
hellions that's a pretty good idea
against<00:02:50.610> this<00:02:50.700> very<00:02:51.000> heavy<00:02:51.209> sellout<00:02:51.690> army<00:02:51.959> i

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
against this very heavy sellout army i

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.860 
against this very heavy sellout army i
think<00:02:52.290> absolutely<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.750> actually<00:02:54.750> don't

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
think absolutely and the actually don't

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.699 
think absolutely and the actually don't
know<00:02:54.959> what<00:02:55.080> that<00:02:55.110> is<00:02:55.200> cuz<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.440> Protoss

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
know what that is cuz the Protoss

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.500 
know what that is cuz the Protoss
players<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:56.160> like<00:02:56.370> 150<00:02:56.940> s<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.090> don't<00:02:57.240> know<00:02:57.300> what

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
players I like 150 s I don't know what

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.060 
players I like 150 s I don't know what
he<00:02:57.600> was<00:02:57.690> doing<00:02:57.750> with<00:02:58.020> those<00:02:58.200> hellions<00:02:58.470> but

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
he was doing with those hellions but

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.710 
he was doing with those hellions but
funny<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.430> see<00:02:59.580> that<00:02:59.730> many<00:02:59.880> force<00:03:00.180> field<00:03:00.420> just

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
funny to see that many force field just

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.290 
funny to see that many force field just
for<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.020> Hellions<00:03:01.500> but<00:03:02.070> again<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:03.000> mean<00:03:03.150> the

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
for the Hellions but again I mean the

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.670 
for the Hellions but again I mean the
Terran<00:03:03.570> player<00:03:03.690> he<00:03:04.020> doesn't<00:03:04.290> have<00:03:04.410> that<00:03:04.530> much

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
Terran player he doesn't have that much

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.500 
Terran player he doesn't have that much
so<00:03:04.860> using<00:03:05.130> that<00:03:05.160> many<00:03:05.400> force<00:03:05.640> fields<00:03:06.030> worth<00:03:06.270> it

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
so using that many force fields worth it

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.960 
so using that many force fields worth it
to<00:03:06.990> completely<00:03:07.410> just<00:03:07.920> own<00:03:08.130> that<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.730> he<00:03:08.940> is

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
to completely just own that and he is

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.790 
to completely just own that and he is
actually<00:03:09.540> way<00:03:09.690> behind<00:03:09.990> in<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.170> worker<00:03:10.350> counts

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
actually way behind in the worker counts

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.890 
actually way behind in the worker counts
off<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.490> behind<00:03:11.610> an<00:03:11.790> income<00:03:12.240> too<00:03:12.480> yeah

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
off the behind an income too yeah

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.660 
off the behind an income too yeah
absolutely<00:03:13.350> so<00:03:13.950> this<00:03:14.160> is<00:03:14.280> not<00:03:14.400> looking<00:03:14.520> good

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
absolutely so this is not looking good

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.920 
absolutely so this is not looking good
this<00:03:14.910> is<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.150> expansion<00:03:15.390> he<00:03:15.630> needed<00:03:15.870> to

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
this is the expansion he needed to

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.990 
this is the expansion he needed to
secure<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.260> while<00:03:16.590> ago<00:03:16.890> so<00:03:17.310> our<00:03:17.400> Protoss<00:03:17.760> player

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
secure a while ago so our Protoss player

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.190 
secure a while ago so our Protoss player
I<00:03:18.060> actually<00:03:18.269> honestly<00:03:18.570> thought<00:03:18.870> he<00:03:18.989> was<00:03:19.110> going

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
I actually honestly thought he was going

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.270 
I actually honestly thought he was going
to<00:03:19.260> lose<00:03:19.470> there<00:03:19.680> for<00:03:19.830> a<00:03:19.890> little<00:03:19.980> while<00:03:20.100> but

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
to lose there for a little while but

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.100 
to lose there for a little while but
he's<00:03:20.370> able<00:03:20.489> to<00:03:20.670> rimac<00:03:21.060> her<00:03:21.209> up<00:03:21.360> and<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:21.810> think<00:03:22.019> a

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
he's able to rimac her up and I think a

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.150 
he's able to rimac her up and I think a
lot<00:03:22.140> of<00:03:22.320> it<00:03:22.470> is<00:03:22.560> because<00:03:22.800> he<00:03:22.830> got<00:03:23.010> those

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
lot of it is because he got those

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.680 
lot of it is because he got those
expansions<00:03:23.459> as<00:03:23.700> he's<00:03:23.820> trying<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.269> march<00:03:24.420> up<00:03:24.450> in

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
expansions as he's trying to march up in

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.720 
expansions as he's trying to march up in
here<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.050> delay<00:03:25.709> this<00:03:25.830> expansion<00:03:26.160> again<00:03:26.550> how

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
here and delay this expansion again how

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.310 
here and delay this expansion again how
many<00:03:26.760> commanders<00:03:27.239> have<00:03:27.450> we<00:03:27.540> seen<00:03:27.720> cancel<00:03:28.200> this

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
many commanders have we seen cancel this

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.229 
many commanders have we seen cancel this
about<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.650> third<00:03:28.830> or<00:03:28.950> fourth<00:03:29.190> one<00:03:29.400> I'm<00:03:30.120> just

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
about the third or fourth one I'm just

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.240 
about the third or fourth one I'm just
barely<00:03:30.510> canceling<00:03:31.050> it<00:03:31.110> there<00:03:31.290> but<00:03:31.560> yeah<00:03:31.920> that

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
barely canceling it there but yeah that

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.770 
barely canceling it there but yeah that
I<00:03:32.459> think<00:03:32.700> he's<00:03:32.790> playing<00:03:32.940> so<00:03:33.180> smart<00:03:33.480> i<00:03:33.630> mean<00:03:33.750> i

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
I think he's playing so smart i mean i

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.390 
I think he's playing so smart i mean i
think<00:03:34.260> he<00:03:34.320> was<00:03:34.410> at<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.560> disadvantage<00:03:34.769> there<00:03:35.220> for

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
think he was at a disadvantage there for

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.009 
think he was at a disadvantage there for
a<00:03:35.459> while<00:03:35.550> but<00:03:36.090> if<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.330> notice<00:03:36.630> he's<00:03:36.780> just

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
a while but if you notice he's just

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.479 
a while but if you notice he's just
running<00:03:37.230> around<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.709> killing<00:03:38.010> expansions

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
running around and killing expansions

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:39.949 
running around and killing expansions
and<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:38.910> don't<00:03:39.060> think<00:03:39.150> that<00:03:39.239> not<00:03:39.540> beyblade<00:03:39.930> is

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
and I don't think that not beyblade is

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.300 
and I don't think that not beyblade is
very<00:03:40.230> happy<00:03:40.500> as<00:03:40.590> this<00:03:40.650> command<00:03:40.950> center<00:03:41.160> now

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
very happy as this command center now

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.789 
very happy as this command center now
has<00:03:41.550> two<00:03:42.030> sadly<00:03:42.540> leave<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:43.080> wonder<00:03:43.560> why<00:03:43.650> he

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
has two sadly leave I wonder why he

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.680 
has two sadly leave I wonder why he
didn't<00:03:44.040> just<00:03:44.070> landed<00:03:44.580> here<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.060> oh<00:03:45.390> not

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
didn't just landed here and oh not

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.690 
didn't just landed here and oh not
beyblade<00:03:46.170> saying<00:03:46.470> what<00:03:46.739> am<00:03:46.860> I<00:03:46.980> supposed<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.519> do

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
beyblade saying what am I supposed to do

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.930 
beyblade saying what am I supposed to do
versus<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:48.480> well<00:03:49.380> I<00:03:49.410> guess<00:03:49.890> when<00:03:50.280> you<00:03:50.430> really

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
versus that well I guess when you really

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.160 
versus that well I guess when you really
when<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.150> realize<00:03:51.450> that<00:03:51.480> you've<00:03:51.720> lost<00:03:51.959> the

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
when you realize that you've lost the

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.050 
when you realize that you've lost the
game<00:03:52.350> I<00:03:52.590> mean<00:03:52.890> I'm<00:03:53.100> not<00:03:53.280> saying<00:03:53.580> that<00:03:53.730> he<00:03:53.760> has

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
game I mean I'm not saying that he has

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.820 
game I mean I'm not saying that he has
lost<00:03:54.299> it<00:03:54.510> yet<00:03:54.720> but<00:03:54.870> if<00:03:54.989> you<00:03:55.080> feel<00:03:55.470> like<00:03:55.500> you

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
lost it yet but if you feel like you

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.979 
lost it yet but if you feel like you
have<00:03:56.220> no<00:03:56.430> chance<00:03:56.670> at<00:03:56.850> all<00:03:57.000> that's<00:03:57.570> about<00:03:57.780> time

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
have no chance at all that's about time

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.500 
have no chance at all that's about time
to<00:03:58.049> say<00:03:58.260> GG<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:58.799> leave<00:03:58.980> right<00:03:59.280> but<00:03:59.820> right<00:04:00.360> now

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.850 
to say GG and leave right but right now
I<00:04:00.540> don't<00:04:00.690> know<00:04:00.900> if<00:04:00.989> not<00:04:01.140> beyblade<00:04:01.500> can<00:04:01.650> really

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
I don't know if not beyblade can really

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.250 
I don't know if not beyblade can really
hold<00:04:02.040> on<00:04:02.190> too<00:04:02.430> much<00:04:02.580> longer<00:04:03.060> his<00:04:03.330> army<00:04:04.019> count

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
hold on too much longer his army count

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.789 
hold on too much longer his army count
so<00:04:04.769> much<00:04:04.980> lower<00:04:05.190> in<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.370> Protoss<00:04:05.790> 1062<00:04:06.799> 168

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
so much lower in the Protoss 1062 168

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.890 
so much lower in the Protoss 1062 168
and<00:04:08.130> its<00:04:08.940> income<00:04:09.360> 1200<00:04:10.019> whoa<00:04:10.310> haha<00:04:11.420> is<00:04:12.420> going

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
and its income 1200 whoa haha is going

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.039 
and its income 1200 whoa haha is going
guys<00:04:13.110> coming<00:04:13.860> in<00:04:13.950> here<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:15.000> if<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.630> void<00:04:15.870> rays

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
guys coming in here and if the void rays

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.080 
guys coming in here and if the void rays
overhead<00:04:16.530> can<00:04:16.739> distract<00:04:17.220> enough<00:04:17.609> of<00:04:17.729> the<00:04:17.820> fire

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
overhead can distract enough of the fire

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.870 
overhead can distract enough of the fire
from<00:04:18.450> you<00:04:18.900> know<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.290> doors<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:20.519> I<00:04:20.580> guess<00:04:20.760> the

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
from you know the doors and I guess the

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.610 
from you know the doors and I guess the
missile<00:04:21.209> turrets<00:04:21.539> then<00:04:22.049> this<00:04:22.289> could<00:04:22.440> be<00:04:22.590> a

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
missile turrets then this could be a

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.030 
missile turrets then this could be a
pretty

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
pretty

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.260 
pretty
difference<00:04:23.280> keep<00:04:23.460> in<00:04:23.550> mind<00:04:23.700> all<00:04:23.880> these<00:04:24.030> void

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
difference keep in mind all these void

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.460 
difference keep in mind all these void
rays<00:04:24.420> are<00:04:24.540> not<00:04:24.660> doing<00:04:24.840> any<00:04:24.960> damage<00:04:25.140> sir<00:04:25.350> now

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
rays are not doing any damage sir now

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.620 
rays are not doing any damage sir now
this<00:04:25.650> is<00:04:25.740> a<00:04:25.770> completely<00:04:26.160> zero<00:04:26.550> damage<00:04:26.790> but<00:04:27.450> it

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
this is a completely zero damage but it

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.360 
this is a completely zero damage but it
doesn't<00:04:28.050> really<00:04:28.230> matter<00:04:28.530> i<00:04:28.710> think<00:04:29.070> beyblade

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
doesn't really matter i think beyblade

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.470 
doesn't really matter i think beyblade
is<00:04:29.400> going<00:04:29.760> to<00:04:29.820> get<00:04:29.880> overrun<00:04:30.180> right<00:04:30.360> here

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
is going to get overrun right here

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.030 
is going to get overrun right here
absolutely<00:04:31.140> I<00:04:31.170> definitely<00:04:31.320> this<00:04:31.710> is<00:04:31.800> over

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
absolutely I definitely this is over

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.590 
absolutely I definitely this is over
really<00:04:32.370> funny<00:04:32.580> to<00:04:32.730> see<00:04:32.880> him<00:04:32.910> use<00:04:33.240> that<00:04:33.420> much

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
really funny to see him use that much

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.790 
really funny to see him use that much
hallucination<00:04:34.320> i<00:04:34.410> don't<00:04:34.560> think<00:04:34.680> i've<00:04:34.740> ever

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
hallucination i don't think i've ever

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.040 
hallucination i don't think i've ever
seen<00:04:35.160> it<00:04:35.310> used<00:04:35.490> that<00:04:35.700> well<00:04:35.910> and<00:04:36.180> a<00:04:36.570> game<00:04:36.810> or<00:04:36.960> at

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
seen it used that well and a game or at

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.360 
seen it used that well and a game or at
least<00:04:37.170> that<00:04:37.350> much<00:04:37.590> but<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:37.890> void<00:04:38.040> rays<00:04:38.220> at

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
least that much but the void rays at

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.490 
least that much but the void rays at
this<00:04:38.490> point<00:04:38.700> are<00:04:38.820> just<00:04:39.030> for<00:04:39.180> effect<00:04:39.540> and<00:04:39.840> i

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
this point are just for effect and i

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.960 
this point are just for effect and i
guess<00:04:40.710> we're<00:04:40.890> just<00:04:40.920> having<00:04:41.220> a<00:04:41.280> Protoss<00:04:41.670> rave

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
guess we're just having a Protoss rave

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.580 
guess we're just having a Protoss rave
here<00:04:42.210> and<00:04:42.390> they<00:04:42.720> were<00:04:42.810> actually<00:04:42.930> chatting<00:04:43.470> in

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
here and they were actually chatting in

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.990 
here and they were actually chatting in
game<00:04:43.800> they're<00:04:44.010> being<00:04:44.250> pretty<00:04:44.400> friendly<00:04:44.790> here

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
game they're being pretty friendly here

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.400 
game they're being pretty friendly here
so<00:04:45.120> this<00:04:45.180> was<00:04:45.390> a<00:04:45.450> pretty<00:04:45.630> entertaining<00:04:46.140> game

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
so this was a pretty entertaining game

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.770 
so this was a pretty entertaining game
but<00:04:46.920> the<00:04:47.070> Terran<00:04:47.310> player<00:04:47.400> really<00:04:47.820> I<00:04:48.360> guess

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
but the Terran player really I guess

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.150 
but the Terran player really I guess
after<00:04:48.960> he<00:04:49.080> lost<00:04:49.260> that<00:04:49.410> big<00:04:49.620> army<00:04:49.920> had<00:04:50.010> heard

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
after he lost that big army had heard

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.650 
after he lost that big army had heard
him<00:04:50.310> a<00:04:50.340> lot<00:04:50.520> more<00:04:50.670> than<00:04:50.730> I<00:04:50.940> thought<00:04:51.150> because<00:04:51.360> he

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
him a lot more than I thought because he

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.990 
him a lot more than I thought because he
wasn't<00:04:51.810> able<00:04:52.110> to<00:04:52.260> rimac<00:04:52.710> grow<00:04:52.920> up<00:04:53.100> after<00:04:53.820> that

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
wasn't able to rimac grow up after that

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.640 
wasn't able to rimac grow up after that
so<00:04:54.270> Protoss<00:04:54.810> player<00:04:55.080> it<00:04:55.230> looks<00:04:55.380> like<00:04:55.500> he's

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
so Protoss player it looks like he's

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.810 
so Protoss player it looks like he's
going<00:04:55.800> to<00:04:55.860> get<00:04:55.950> a<00:04:56.010> pretty<00:04:56.190> convincing<00:04:56.430> win

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
going to get a pretty convincing win

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.630 
going to get a pretty convincing win
here<00:04:57.030> using<00:04:57.420> Phoenix's<00:04:57.990> and<00:04:58.230> tbp<00:04:58.620> yeah<00:04:59.610> i

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
here using Phoenix's and tbp yeah i

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.370 
here using Phoenix's and tbp yeah i
think<00:04:59.910> if<00:05:00.240> we<00:05:00.270> if<00:05:00.600> we<00:05:00.630> go<00:05:00.870> back<00:05:01.080> and<00:05:01.290> just

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
think if we if we go back and just

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.810 
think if we if we go back and just
review<00:05:01.590> the<00:05:01.860> game<00:05:02.040> not<00:05:02.220> beyblade<00:05:02.640> here

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
review the game not beyblade here

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.300 
review the game not beyblade here
wondering<00:05:03.180> why<00:05:03.420> he<00:05:03.450> lost<00:05:03.900> i<00:05:04.290> think<00:05:04.860> that<00:05:05.100> the

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
wondering why he lost i think that the

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.860 
wondering why he lost i think that the
reason<00:05:05.340> might<00:05:05.850> one<00:05:06.030> of<00:05:06.120> the<00:05:06.180> reasons<00:05:06.480> is<00:05:06.600> he

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
reason might one of the reasons is he

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.450 
reason might one of the reasons is he
constructed<00:05:07.230> two<00:05:07.590> Ravens<00:05:07.980> when<00:05:08.130> he<00:05:08.220> didn't

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
constructed two Ravens when he didn't

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.250 
constructed two Ravens when he didn't
need<00:05:08.610> to<00:05:08.670> he<00:05:08.970> only<00:05:09.120> needed<00:05:09.300> one<00:05:09.420> and<00:05:09.750> if<00:05:09.930> that

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
need to he only needed one and if that

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.720 
need to he only needed one and if that
he<00:05:10.410> could<00:05:10.590> have<00:05:10.680> used<00:05:10.770> COMSAT<00:05:11.310> for<00:05:11.490> the<00:05:11.550> Dark

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
he could have used COMSAT for the Dark

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.300 
he could have used COMSAT for the Dark
Templar<00:05:12.110> number<00:05:13.110> two<00:05:13.380> we<00:05:13.680> never<00:05:13.890> saw<00:05:14.100> the<00:05:14.160> new

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
Templar number two we never saw the new

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.920 
Templar number two we never saw the new
thing<00:05:14.550> you<00:05:14.700> know<00:05:14.850> he<00:05:15.000> still<00:05:15.300> has<00:05:15.510> it<00:05:15.540> at<00:05:15.780> any

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
thing you know he still has it at any

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.080 
thing you know he still has it at any
time<00:05:16.320> still<00:05:16.680> had<00:05:16.830> it<00:05:16.950> the<00:05:17.040> whole<00:05:17.070> time<00:05:17.220> when<00:05:17.940> he

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
time still had it the whole time when he

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.550 
time still had it the whole time when he
attacked<00:05:18.420> he<00:05:18.570> had<00:05:18.690> an<00:05:18.780> opportunity<00:05:19.020> to<00:05:19.290> nuke

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
attacked he had an opportunity to nuke

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.260 
attacked he had an opportunity to nuke
the<00:05:19.590> natural<00:05:20.130> or<00:05:20.280> perhaps<00:05:20.430> who<00:05:20.760> nuke<00:05:21.000> this

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
the natural or perhaps who nuke this

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.940 
the natural or perhaps who nuke this
with<00:05:21.660> his<00:05:21.810> and<00:05:21.960> then<00:05:22.140> move<00:05:22.380> his<00:05:22.530> main<00:05:22.680> army

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
with his and then move his main army

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.550 
with his and then move his main army
somewhere<00:05:23.250> else<00:05:23.430> I<00:05:24.060> think<00:05:24.690> a<00:05:24.810> lot<00:05:24.840> of<00:05:25.050> times<00:05:25.380> he

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
somewhere else I think a lot of times he

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.170 
somewhere else I think a lot of times he
just<00:05:25.770> kept<00:05:25.980> his<00:05:26.070> attention<00:05:26.190> focus<00:05:26.820> on<00:05:26.940> one

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
just kept his attention focus on one

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.060 
just kept his attention focus on one
main<00:05:27.390> army<00:05:27.690> instead<00:05:28.170> of<00:05:28.290> splitting<00:05:28.530> off<00:05:28.860> and

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
main army instead of splitting off and

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.590 
main army instead of splitting off and
forking<00:05:29.520> and<00:05:29.670> doing<00:05:29.910> multiple<00:05:30.300> things<00:05:30.360> at

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
forking and doing multiple things at

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.420 
forking and doing multiple things at
once<00:05:30.840> and<00:05:31.050> of<00:05:31.500> course<00:05:31.740> he<00:05:31.890> allowed<00:05:32.160> his

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
once and of course he allowed his

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.010 
once and of course he allowed his
expansions<00:05:33.060> just<00:05:33.330> getting<00:05:33.540> taken<00:05:33.750> out<00:05:33.810> all

he's<00:06:06.120> actually<00:06:06.270> making<00:06:06.510> a<00:06:06.660> real<00:06:06.810> void<00:06:07.020> right

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.230 
he's actually making a real void right

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.840 
he's actually making a real void right
now<00:06:07.350> I<00:06:07.380> guess<00:06:07.680> just<00:06:07.950> because<00:06:08.220> he<00:06:08.460> wants<00:06:08.670> a<00:06:08.700> real

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
now I guess just because he wants a real

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.460 
now I guess just because he wants a real
one<00:06:08.940> after<00:06:09.150> making<00:06:09.300> all<00:06:09.450> those<00:06:09.540> fake<00:06:09.780> ones<00:06:09.990> but

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
one after making all those fake ones but

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.350 
one after making all those fake ones but
that<00:06:10.710> is<00:06:10.920> it<00:06:11.160> and<00:06:11.340> so<00:06:11.400> the<00:06:11.760> skin<00:06:12.030> was<00:06:12.120> pretty

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
that is it and so the skin was pretty

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.730 
that is it and so the skin was pretty
fun<00:06:12.540> it<00:06:12.720> definitely<00:06:13.080> was<00:06:13.320> not<00:06:13.350> what<00:06:13.710> I

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740
