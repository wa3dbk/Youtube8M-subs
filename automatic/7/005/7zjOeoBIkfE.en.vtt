00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello how about youtube friends i am your 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.670
 friend angel montiel and today we have the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.730
 review of one of these cubes the 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.580
 mattresses of 3 x 3 that is of the mark my 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.730
 first that's how I'm talking about Felix 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.039
 Special pillow designed by adam coin 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.920
 who is also the creator of the amazing 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.279
 ghosts club since this designer is 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.130
 so so but so fashionable for their 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.949
 amazing cubes the cues I found out 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.050
 that he himself designed this amazing Felix 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.780
 pilot and the truth is that it is a cube 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.950
 extremely nice that I asked for mertz you 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.450
 I leave the links in the part of the 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.649
 description so you can acquire 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.280
 this bucket but good as you can see 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.010
 simple view is a beautiful cube is a 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.140
 cube that keeps all the beauty that should 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.660
 of containing a cube of the mark me first 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.420
 and also the impressive design of 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.610
 adam but good is that what are the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.180
 details about this review of this 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.010
 cube in the first place I want to tell you that 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.830
 is a 3 x 3 cube that for a long time 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.860
 I wanted to have time since 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.690
 had the signature of Felix Index that is without 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.030
 place to doubt is the best spirit to see 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.370
 of all time and is a person 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.320
 that has all my admiration to have 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.780
 this signature here the truth is that if you 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.210
 elevates prestige a little to this cube and 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.150
 not only that but I think adam 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.510
 he made this cube especially in a 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.520
 tribute to that great child prodigy who 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.800
 broke all the world's records in 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.410
 our beloved profession that is the 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.690
 spirit but inside this cube there 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.060
 things that I do not like to tell you 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.860
 the first problem I see is the merger 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.830
 of these two colors 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.640
 I think putting the rose in this cube 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:50.700
 It's more than enough because it hits the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.070
 red and orange color that are extremely 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.880
 glued on his eyes especially with the 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.950
 red because it confuses pretty much the 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.050
 difference of colors is not in notorious 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.420
 and when the cube is scrambled the truth 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.460
 is that it does not help at all that is the 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.710
 first problem that I find the second 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.289
 problem is that it is a version 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.840
 pillow that gives us input 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.329
 that the cube is not meant to be made 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.250
 olvin speed because the cubes of this 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:20.980
 plump and pachona form are 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.379
 prohibited for official winches 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.230
 but in spite of that the cube rotates 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:29.230
 wonderful thanks to his ball court 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.680
 that we see inside the cube as 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.349
 you can see this ball core was 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.530
 adopted a long time ago by mf 8 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:41.410
 of legend that is a cube of 3 x 3 m photo 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.870
 m or f 8 legend had this core of balls 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.840
 solid and hard as seen in our 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.540
 video and also adopted it in the venus 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.010
 meffert review that I also leave here 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.260
 below in the description part for 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.870
 that you see it because this ball core 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.180
 he was also respected there we see the 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.660
 internal parts of the felix pillow in the 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:05.440
 high fucking definition they do not have 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:09.640
 absolutely nothing amazing are pieces 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.879
 Common of a curved cube of 3 x 3 see 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.920
 this concave shape is not about having 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:18.040
 this as a kind of anti system 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.920
 pop and this corner very big but well 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.069
 designed to make the bombacho bucket not 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.140
 to make him plump and handsome and it's for 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.090
 that has that oval shape 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.260
 not in the form of a pillow as you would 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.910
 know not in its form and see here the 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.209
 fusion of the two pieces and 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:40.090
 you immediately feel the curvature 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:43.810
 between the two not your screw and 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.300
 all beautiful pieces and then luxury 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.370
 the truth is that something that you have to 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.530
 highlight of the cube is that its materials 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.350
 being of me first they are of a quality 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.060
 extremely high the stickers like 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.950
 they can see even though they have the 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.640
 problem that is attached to red 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.640
 pink are very handsome are very beautiful and 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.380
 they also have an abysmal quality I have 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.200
 used many times I have given many 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:11.110
 turns and stickers are still concrete and 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.500
 they are still there as they see the turn of the cube 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:17.370
 It is also very good although the form 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.760
 oval makes it difficult to manage the step and 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.980
 see that I turn it but it's not the same 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.500
 it's not the same grip that you have with 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.470
 a cube completely cubic to say 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.550
 it's really a bit annoying to move it without 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:36.300
 However, the combination of colors 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:39.720
 it looks very very attractive in this cube of 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.120
 3 x 3 was a tribute to Felix design 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.270
 Adam Cohen and the truth has given us 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.610
 a novel hub of speed that we 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:51.600
 It grants a very aesthetic beauty 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:54.690
 very father outside of that and outside of that is 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.380
 better be the one who produced it en masse and 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.670
 that its material quality is high 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:03.540
 unfortunately the price is going to make me 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.770
 give him half logo delegan m 10 well 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.500
 what 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.139
 I'm sorry Felix pilot even though 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:14.449
 you are a very nice and novel cube and 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:18.360
 you are created by the wonderful 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:20.460
 adam who also created the two clubs did not 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.969
 I can give you the logo delegan m10 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.909
 complete and you stay in the middle 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:29.939
 for prices especially the truth is that 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:32.219
 the price of the cube is excessive taking 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:35.039
 in mind that the variety or rather the 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:37.499
 innovation in it is not very big and it's 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.299
 annoying to move it as a cube 

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:41.879
 speed however if you're 

00:05:39.299 --> 00:05:44.339
 collector if you like it or are you 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:46.649
 admirer of felix and of adam then this 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:50.279
 cube is made for you that's why we give it
