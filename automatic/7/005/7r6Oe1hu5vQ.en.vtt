00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.730 
temperature before it smokes good I
don't<00:02:36.340> think<00:02:36.430> it's<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:37.030> wine<00:02:37.240> but<00:02:38.050> I'm<00:02:38.350> not

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
don't think it's the wine but I'm not

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.770 
don't think it's the wine but I'm not
having<00:02:39.040> as<00:02:39.130> much<00:02:39.250> luck<00:02:39.310> cooking<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.330> latkes

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
having as much luck cooking the latkes

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.040 
having as much luck cooking the latkes
as<00:02:41.050> I'd<00:02:41.410> like<00:02:42.270> there's<00:02:43.270> one<00:02:43.510> in<00:02:43.690> there<00:02:43.840> and

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
as I'd like there's one in there and

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.720 
as I'd like there's one in there and
it's<00:02:44.140> just<00:02:44.320> not<00:02:44.410> cookin<00:02:44.680> very<00:02:44.860> fast<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:45.580> it's

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
it's just not cookin very fast and it's

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.600 
it's just not cookin very fast and it's
on<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:45.940> high<00:02:46.060> burner<00:02:46.330> behind<00:02:47.200> burner<00:02:47.680> all<00:02:48.430> the

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
on the high burner behind burner all the

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.010 
on the high burner behind burner all the
way<00:02:48.670> up<00:02:48.790> max<00:02:49.060> so<00:02:49.360> I<00:02:49.420> brought<00:02:49.510> up<00:02:49.750> this<00:02:49.900> other

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
way up max so I brought up this other

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.980 
way up max so I brought up this other
fine<00:02:50.350> hand<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:51.700> give<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:52.540> finishing<00:02:52.870> touch

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
fine hand to give it a finishing touch

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.120 
fine hand to give it a finishing touch
with<00:02:53.650> less<00:02:54.070> oil<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:54.700> more<00:02:55.600> direct<00:02:56.020> heat<00:02:56.320> so

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
with less oil and more direct heat so

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.010 
with less oil and more direct heat so
we'll<00:02:57.250> see<00:02:57.450> this<00:02:58.450> one<00:02:58.600> looks<00:02:58.690> a<00:02:58.780> little<00:02:58.870> bit

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
we'll see this one looks a little bit

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.010 
we'll see this one looks a little bit
better<00:02:59.400> let's<00:03:00.400> see<00:03:00.580> maybe<00:03:01.270> you<00:03:01.480> all<00:03:01.570> get<00:03:01.810> hot

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
better let's see maybe you all get hot

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.130 
better let's see maybe you all get hot
enough<00:03:02.110> one<00:03:02.920> of<00:03:03.040> my<00:03:03.160> mottos<00:03:03.370> is<00:03:03.550> being

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
enough one of my mottos is being

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.260 
enough one of my mottos is being
pre-planning<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.700> flexibility<00:03:06.700> those<00:03:07.120> are

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
pre-planning and flexibility those are

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.910 
pre-planning and flexibility those are
the<00:03:07.330> two<00:03:07.540> key<00:03:07.810> words<00:03:07.990> so<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.260> brought<00:03:08.380> out<00:03:08.560> the

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
the two key words so I brought out the

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.700 
the two key words so I brought out the
electric<00:03:09.730> griddle<00:03:10.240> I'm<00:03:10.930> going<00:03:11.230> to<00:03:11.380> try<00:03:11.680> to

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
electric griddle I'm going to try to

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.700 
electric griddle I'm going to try to
cook<00:03:12.580> the<00:03:12.790> latkes<00:03:13.210> in<00:03:13.240> this<00:03:13.720> because<00:03:14.410> I<00:03:14.500> think

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
cook the latkes in this because I think

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.670 
cook the latkes in this because I think
maybe<00:03:14.860> it<00:03:15.070> can<00:03:15.250> get<00:03:15.400> hotter<00:03:15.730> I<00:03:16.500> don't<00:03:17.500> know<00:03:17.590> why

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
maybe it can get hotter I don't know why

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.860 
maybe it can get hotter I don't know why
I<00:03:17.710> think<00:03:17.830> that<00:03:18.420> what<00:03:19.420> I<00:03:19.450> do<00:03:19.920> now<00:03:20.920> i'm<00:03:21.130> cooking

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
I think that what I do now i'm cooking

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.900 
I think that what I do now i'm cooking
all<00:03:22.870> four<00:03:23.320> burners<00:03:23.710> got<00:03:23.890> for<00:03:24.190> latkes<00:03:24.580> going

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
all four burners got for latkes going

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.000 
all four burners got for latkes going
over<00:03:25.090> here<00:03:25.330> one<00:03:26.170> here<00:03:26.200> in<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.620> experimental

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
over here one here in the experimental

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.150 
over here one here in the experimental
tray<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:27.640> two<00:03:28.300> over<00:03:28.750> here<00:03:29.010> my<00:03:30.010> other

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
tray and two over here my other

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.560 
tray and two over here my other
suggestion<00:03:30.610> is<00:03:30.850> when<00:03:31.030> things<00:03:31.060> aren't<00:03:31.480> going

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
suggestion is when things aren't going

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.380 
suggestion is when things aren't going
well<00:03:32.010> in<00:03:33.010> your<00:03:33.250> cooking<00:03:33.550> experiments<00:03:34.240> that

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
well in your cooking experiments that

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.630 
well in your cooking experiments that
perhaps<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:35.260> best<00:03:35.440> thing<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.680> do<00:03:35.830> is<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.040> hide

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
perhaps the best thing to do is to hide

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.020 
perhaps the best thing to do is to hide
the<00:03:36.910> evidence<00:03:36.940> and<00:03:37.540> there<00:03:38.440> you<00:03:38.560> have<00:03:38.590> it

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
the evidence and there you have it

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:46.070 
the evidence and there you have it
excellent<00:03:40.030> latkes<00:03:41.430> well<00:03:42.430> maybe<00:03:42.780> let's<00:03:43.780> see<00:03:44.020> oh

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
excellent latkes well maybe let's see oh

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.020 
excellent latkes well maybe let's see oh
that<00:03:47.080> layer<00:03:47.380> doesn't<00:03:47.650> look<00:03:47.860> too<00:03:48.010> bad<00:03:48.040> for

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
that layer doesn't look too bad for

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.850 
that layer doesn't look too bad for
trust<00:03:49.360> me<00:03:49.540> there's<00:03:50.140> some<00:03:50.320> bad<00:03:50.500> ones<00:03:50.650> down

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
trust me there's some bad ones down

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.900 
trust me there's some bad ones down
there<00:03:50.890> cheers<00:03:51.520> happy<00:03:52.150> latkes

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910
