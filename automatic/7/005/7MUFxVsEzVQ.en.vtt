number of new features but of course

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.120 
number of new features but of course
here<00:02:25.780> we're<00:02:26.020> most<00:02:26.290> interested<00:02:26.410> in<00:02:26.860> the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
here we're most interested in the

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.480 
here we're most interested in the
lighting<00:02:28.500> looking<00:02:29.500> fast<00:02:29.710> efficient<00:02:30.310> through

lighting looking fast efficient through
the<00:02:30.580> surface<00:02:30.820> we<00:02:31.180> can<00:02:31.330> see<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.540> clouds<00:02:31.840> and

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
the surface we can see the clouds and

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.600 
the surface we can see the clouds and
the<00:02:32.260> underwater<00:02:32.620> shading<00:02:33.010> effects<00:02:33.370> on<00:02:33.520> the

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
the underwater shading effects on the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
the subtle particle effects zipping past

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.580 
the subtle particle effects zipping past
and<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:39.820> seafloor<00:02:40.180> clutter<00:02:40.540> also<00:02:41.200> really<00:02:41.440> add

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
and the seafloor clutter also really add

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.930 
and the seafloor clutter also really add
to<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.770> overall<00:02:42.010> impression<00:02:42.700> of<00:02:42.790> being

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
to the overall impression of being

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.990 
to the overall impression of being
underwater

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.910 

okay<00:02:51.000> skipping<00:02:51.480> ahead<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:51.720> little<00:02:51.840> we<00:02:52.470> can<00:02:52.620> spot

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
okay skipping ahead a little we can spot

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.040 
okay skipping ahead a little we can spot
some<00:02:53.100> of<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.250> underwater<00:02:53.700> mines<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.360> wreck<00:02:54.810> a

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
some of the underwater mines a wreck a

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.650 
some of the underwater mines a wreck a
blanketed<00:02:55.530> Sheila<00:02:55.860> fish<00:02:56.040> an<00:02:56.250> STV<00:02:56.880> just<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.540> the

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
blanketed Sheila fish an STV just to the

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.720 
blanketed Sheila fish an STV just to the
left<00:02:57.780> behind<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.140> rock<00:02:58.350> and<00:02:58.530> of<00:02:58.950> course<00:02:59.250> some<00:02:59.580> up

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
left behind a rock and of course some up

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:07.920 
left behind a rock and of course some up
for<00:02:59.970> divers

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.120
