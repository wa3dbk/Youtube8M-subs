00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.070
 you come friends minecraft cheek 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.800
 of the iren this time the modification with 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.510
 the name smart pad, he is so called 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.090
 which is very exciting though 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.009
 You often show that you already see that 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.960
 A small beam of light in the sky 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.640
 Madness and little bit on the Beck 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.040
 blog but we just strongly imprinted 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.960
 with crafting so that just adds 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.420
 Adding this foot there are two types of pets 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.470
 once this here and once this 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.850
 but now we go just once in 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.640
 our dispenser and here we see 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.489
 already direct crafting three times stones 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.489
 labs and a golden gate to it and then 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.870
 we can get this foot we can 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.250
 then also with a right click put 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.649
 But we also find it easy if we 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.780
 I would enter that once sword 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.050
 we can find all the right typing here 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.239
 smart pad is block on which we can 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.950
 place normally you see it works 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.110
 unfortunately at the moment only one way 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.030
 but that's about to change too 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.619
 we have our swords here 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.990
 take pity once directly from the 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.479
 crate the whole series of swords 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.350
 already stored and can then 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.990
 just a right click 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.080
 place the whole looks horny is off 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.580
 but also I think the modification 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.340
 not just form yourself like that 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.260
 mini holder to bring but there is 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.060
 much more features 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.680
 if now a right click would do 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.960
 you get the sword out again but 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.520
 There is a small functional window 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.799
 what we just about the shift button 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.630
 can reach shift -key 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.240
 pressed a right click and we 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.740
 come here in this window 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.630
 first up we have the ocarina of 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.220
 time is the name of the mode we can 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.460
 but also go into the basic mode 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.140
 that he just switchen it here 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.409
 reason is just here 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.520
 yes, there are those blocks in there too 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.140
 Do not cry after one 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.049
 Direction are because as you can see they are 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:04.579
 right here and easy 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.899
 a right click and it will be 90 90 degrees 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.030
 then turned the whole thing and then sees 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.190
 the whole thing too and so on 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.720
 actually quite audible but it 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.579
 There is also much more we just now 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.299
 you have already seen it break again 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:19.700
 right click and we click on shefex 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.799
 and that adds to these surfaces as if 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.940
 the whole enchanted one thinks you see 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.230
 that we can do that well now 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.000
 fast at all just once 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.430
 go through or at the two on each 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.030
 case 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.370
 and the very effect just added 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.310
 we can continue as nothing we can 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.930
 unfortunately biemann then make it work 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.060
 this beam the front here already 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.269
 has seen that is simply activated 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.010
 and shattered lights like crazy that 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.019
 Let's go out, too, floating 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.620
 and floating is just such a steady thing 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.510
 rotate 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.719
 it's hanging over a bit 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.219
 this stature and just turns there 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:55.230
 in a circle and it just looks great 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:59.069
 interesting so you can sunny values 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.569
 keep it safe so that whole clique 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.099
 I turn here again now 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.389
 the two swords we can yes 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.810
 also rotate at different speeds 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.450
 to let 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.220
 that goes here at this speed at the 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.900
 speed led and you see here I think 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.969
 even the difference if I now 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.030
 make a comparison that one turns 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:17.010
 It should be twice as fast now 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.049
 Let's do it all again 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.939
 slower that makes me quite whole 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.310
 we're just going crazy doing it crazy 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:25.139
 times to 1, that's nice and slow 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.939
 interesting so I think so the 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:28.049
 perfect size i want the whole now 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.419
 do not destroy 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.720
 So again he can do the process 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:35.129
 Float and I advise again 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.409
 make that sorry when synonymous with 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.370
 at change the whole thing and Stellmann 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.290
 sword here 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.599
 so now we have this sorry for him though 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.889
 with me it is blue now how did that go 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.109
 the just synonymous no problem 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.040
 right click and here we can the 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.650
 select color 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.150
 up here you can see the color of this 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.799
 you'll have it later, you can always do that 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.419
 So try it a bit 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.099
 a little rum test for example brown 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:04:00.479
 and then you come so beautiful 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:03.569
 delicious kag brown out there looks 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:05.970
 interesting and right here can 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.439
 we do simply supposed to be like those 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.549
 to set the transparency 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:14.099
 that's really strong and penetrating 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.409
 and other things and shines properly 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.880
 hearty and of course we can 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.289
 turning the whole down as we 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.049
 Just turn it all the way down and on 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.490
 then is not to see a 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.159
 slightly higher and then you see 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.810
 just as easy as you seem 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:30.630
 that suits you best 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.539
 minecraft diskus with laser light possible 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.760
 very interesting the whole modification 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:38.710
 that was it already and 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.470
 simply beautifies in survival mode 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.050
 if you are traveling a bit 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.670
 yes just the area you can easily 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.170
 have a little more fun and because 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.370
 I was raised to that I should 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.650
 maybe every now and then a note 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.390
 At the end of the day, I would go after mine 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.000
 Opinion as I said that my opinion 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.440
 I would like a three plus cam out 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.380
 following reason it is correct 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.780
 cool modification but it is not 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.180
 100 percent useful from these 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.410
 I would start or design today 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.020
 Of course, give one because it 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.360
 just perfect looks just right 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.950
 but it is great modification it stop 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.690
 not so functional because it actually 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.370
 absolutely no effect but it has 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.260
 very interesting if you have his house 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.670
 and here you have starters everywhere 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.380
 RAPPED RIPS ONLY HAS ZAC HAS 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.370
 makes it difficult immediately in the hand 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.080
 simply here purely 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.400
 Zack and immediately has my sword and 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.830
 can fight right away that is 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.140
 of course a nice advantage and power 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.910
 definitely fun with it 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.930
 I thank you now for watching 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.120
 I'd have me a nice 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.170
 pleasant evening and say yes to 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.170
 his people
