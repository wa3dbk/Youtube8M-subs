this is in fact a true morel there are
false<00:00:14.070> morels<00:00:14.490> by<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.880> way<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:16.049> do

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
false morels by the way that that do

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.050 
false morels by the way that that do
look<00:00:16.470> similar<00:00:16.740> so<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.400> need<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.730> be<00:00:17.820> careful

thing you want to look for is that it's

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.019 
thing you want to look for is that it's
attached<00:00:23.490> at<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.880> base<00:00:24.740> there<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.949> one<00:00:26.369> half

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
attached at the base there is one half

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.140 
attached at the base there is one half
three<00:00:27.539> Morel<00:00:28.220> where<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.279> kind<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.580> hangs<00:00:29.910> like

a hula skirt but be careful of that one
most<00:00:34.680> morels<00:00:35.100> again<00:00:35.700> are<00:00:35.930> attached<00:00:36.930> here<00:00:37.739> at

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
most morels again are attached here at

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.270 
most morels again are attached here at
the<00:00:37.890> base<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.489> when<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.270> cut<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.600> open<00:00:40.280> you

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
the base and when you cut it open you

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.770 
the base and when you cut it open you
want<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.610> make<00:00:41.760> sure<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.120> it's<00:00:42.300> hollow<00:00:42.540> in

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
want to make sure that it's hollow in

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.410 
want to make sure that it's hollow in
the<00:00:42.840> middle<00:00:43.879> so<00:00:45.110> cut<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.230> open<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:47.090> you<00:00:48.090> can

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
the middle so cut it open and you can

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.819 
the middle so cut it open and you can
see<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:48.960> hollow<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.379> middle<00:00:49.469> a

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
see that it's hollow in the middle a

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.850 
see that it's hollow in the middle a
false<00:00:50.340> morel<00:00:50.760> would<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:51.660> fibers<00:00:52.410> like

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
false morel would have fibers like

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.490 
false morel would have fibers like
cotton<00:00:52.920> II<00:00:53.370> like<00:00:53.940> fibers<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.600> middle<00:00:54.840> so

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
cotton II like fibers in the middle so

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.389 
cotton II like fibers in the middle so
if<00:00:55.800> it's<00:00:56.039> not<00:00:56.250> hollow<00:00:56.520> don't<00:00:57.300> swallow<00:00:58.399> this

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
if it's not hollow don't swallow this

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.819 
if it's not hollow don't swallow this
one<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> really<00:01:00.149> choice<00:01:00.480> edible<00:01:01.379> it's<00:01:01.649> nice

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
one is a really choice edible it's nice

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.660 
one is a really choice edible it's nice
and<00:01:02.100> fresh<00:01:02.570> I<00:01:04.100> prepare<00:01:05.100> them<00:01:05.280> different<00:01:05.640> ways

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
and fresh I prepare them different ways

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.380 
and fresh I prepare them different ways
but<00:01:06.270> what<00:01:06.510> I've<00:01:06.659> learned<00:01:06.960> recently<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:08.390> just

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
but what I've learned recently is just

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.570 
but what I've learned recently is just
to<00:01:09.540> spray<00:01:09.930> them<00:01:10.049> off<00:01:10.260> I've<00:01:10.590> got<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.799> sprayer<00:01:11.250> on

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
to spray them off I've got a sprayer on

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.830 
to spray them off I've got a sprayer on
my<00:01:12.150> kitchen<00:01:12.900> sink<00:01:14.000> instead<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.180> soaking<00:01:15.689> them

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
my kitchen sink instead of soaking them

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.280 
my kitchen sink instead of soaking them
in<00:01:15.869> water

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
in water

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.399 
in water
I<00:01:16.439> used<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.860> soak<00:01:17.130> them<00:01:17.600> but<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.140> water

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
I used to soak them but it the water

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.300 
I used to soak them but it the water
absorbs<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> sponge<00:01:21.560> so<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.920> spray

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
absorbs just like a sponge so I spray

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.230 
absorbs just like a sponge so I spray
them<00:01:23.400> off<00:01:23.460> into<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.270> bowl<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:26.759> bowl<00:01:26.970> that

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
them off into a bowl and the bowl that

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.810 
them off into a bowl and the bowl that
has<00:01:27.299> all<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.930> spores<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:29.189> sprayed<00:01:29.640> off

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
has all of the spores that I sprayed off

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.810 
has all of the spores that I sprayed off
I'll<00:01:30.659> take<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.259> bowl<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.890> pour<00:01:32.700> it

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
I'll take that bowl and pour it

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.060 
I'll take that bowl and pour it
underneath<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.420> my<00:01:33.570> apple<00:01:33.930> tree<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.380> hopes

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
underneath of my apple tree in hopes

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.490 
underneath of my apple tree in hopes
that<00:01:35.960> maybe<00:01:36.960> one<00:01:37.290> day<00:01:37.470> I'll<00:01:37.650> have<00:01:37.680> morels

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
that maybe one day I'll have morels

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.920 
that maybe one day I'll have morels
my<00:01:38.830> apple<00:01:39.040> tree<00:01:39.220> but<00:01:40.060> after<00:01:40.390> you<00:01:40.480> spray<00:01:40.750> it<00:01:40.810> off

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
my apple tree but after you spray it off

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.870 
my apple tree but after you spray it off
with<00:01:41.080> water<00:01:41.670> again<00:01:42.670> you<00:01:42.850> can<00:01:43.090> read<00:01:43.570> it<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:44.470> can

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
with water again you can read it you can

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.340 
with water again you can read it you can
prepare<00:01:45.880> it<00:01:46.000> on<00:01:46.090> a<00:01:46.120> pizza<00:01:46.360> whatever<00:01:47.080> you<00:01:47.200> want

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
prepare it on a pizza whatever you want

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.890 
prepare it on a pizza whatever you want
to<00:01:47.440> do<00:01:47.560> but<00:01:48.190> I<00:01:48.220> like<00:01:48.430> to<00:01:48.550> bread<00:01:48.729> mine<00:01:48.940> if<00:01:49.270> it's<00:01:49.750> a

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
to do but I like to bread mine if it's a

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.590 
to do but I like to bread mine if it's a
really<00:01:50.410> thick<00:01:50.860> one<00:01:50.890> I'll<00:01:51.370> cut<00:01:51.850> it<00:01:52.030> into

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
really thick one I'll cut it into

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.560 
really thick one I'll cut it into
quarters<00:01:53.729> because<00:01:54.729> it<00:01:54.940> cooks<00:01:55.210> a<00:01:55.360> little

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
quarters because it cooks a little

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.930 
quarters because it cooks a little
better<00:01:55.920> but<00:01:56.920> it<00:01:57.250> only<00:01:57.369> takes<00:01:57.610> about<00:01:57.760> five

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
better but it only takes about five

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.440 
better but it only takes about five
minutes<00:01:58.270> each<00:01:58.780> size<00:01:59.080> so<00:01:59.110> it's<00:01:59.770> really<00:02:00.040> quick

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
minutes each size so it's really quick

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:11.300 
minutes each size so it's really quick
so<00:02:01.450> that's<00:02:01.840> how<00:02:01.990> I<00:02:02.020> prepare

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.370 

you
