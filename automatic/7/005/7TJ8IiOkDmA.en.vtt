00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
arc first came out it was rumoured that

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.219 
arc first came out it was rumoured that
pain<00:01:32.100> looks<00:01:32.579> kind<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.180> Naruto<00:01:33.869> and

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
pain looks kind of like Naruto and

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.899 
pain looks kind of like Naruto and
nobody<00:01:34.530> knew<00:01:34.770> what<00:01:34.950> happened<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.369> Naruto's

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
nobody knew what happened to Naruto's

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.359 
nobody knew what happened to Naruto's
dad<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:37.409> maybe<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:38.040> could<00:01:38.100> be<00:01:38.340> a

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
dad and that maybe it could be a

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.550 
dad and that maybe it could be a
possibility<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.210> pain<00:01:39.630> was<00:01:39.840> not<00:01:40.049> his<00:01:40.290> dad

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
possibility that pain was not his dad

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.920 
possibility that pain was not his dad
now<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.430> let<00:01:41.610> me<00:01:41.640> know<00:01:41.729> he's<00:01:42.210> not<00:01:42.420> his<00:01:42.659> father

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
now is let me know he's not his father

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.700 
now is let me know he's not his father
but<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:44.280> mean<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.360> whole<00:01:45.600> pain<00:01:46.020> arc<00:01:46.229> came<00:01:46.560> out

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
but I mean the whole pain arc came out

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.590 
but I mean the whole pain arc came out
before<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.280> knew<00:01:47.430> who<00:01:47.579> not<00:01:47.820> his<00:01:48.060> father<00:01:48.299> was

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
before you knew who not his father was

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.719 
before you knew who not his father was
so<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.020> was<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.470> kind<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.009> big<00:01:50.220> deal<00:01:50.430> and

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
so that was like kind of a big deal and

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.060 
so that was like kind of a big deal and

they didn't just roll a dice and say

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.670 
they didn't just roll a dice and say
okay<00:03:05.030> this<00:03:05.480> one's<00:03:05.810> going<00:03:06.020> to<00:03:06.050> have<00:03:06.260> this<00:03:06.410> move

matrix<00:03:28.700> camera<00:03:29.360> slow-mo<00:03:29.959> thing<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:30.590> you

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
matrix camera slow-mo thing and you

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.370 
matrix camera slow-mo thing and you
don't<00:03:31.130> very<00:03:31.489> often<00:03:32.360> see<00:03:32.600> that<00:03:32.750> in<00:03:32.959> animation

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
don't very often see that in animation

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.560 
don't very often see that in animation
and<00:03:33.830> that<00:03:34.100> must<00:03:34.430> have<00:03:34.640> took<00:03:34.820> a<00:03:34.880> lot<00:03:35.180> of<00:03:35.360> hard

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
and that must have took a lot of hard

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.290 
and that must have took a lot of hard
work<00:03:35.770> even<00:03:36.770> though<00:03:36.950> I<00:03:37.250> mean<00:03:37.730> if<00:03:37.850> they<00:03:37.970> use<00:03:38.120> the

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
work even though I mean if they use the

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.120 
work even though I mean if they use the
good<00:03:38.510> animation<00:03:39.080> they<00:03:39.170> use<00:03:39.320> for<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.560> Sasuke

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
good animation they use for the Sasuke

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.470 
good animation they use for the Sasuke
Ark<00:03:40.340> it<00:03:40.610> probably<00:03:40.910> would<00:03:41.030> have<00:03:41.090> looked<00:03:41.270> a

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
Ark it probably would have looked a

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.020 
Ark it probably would have looked a
million<00:03:42.050> times<00:03:42.290> better<00:03:42.620> but<00:03:43.430> still<00:03:43.820> like

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
million times better but still like

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.340 
million times better but still like
what's<00:03:44.209> still<00:03:44.480> pretty<00:03:44.780> cool

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
what's still pretty cool

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.620
