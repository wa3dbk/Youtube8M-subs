00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960

minus<00:05:27.259> 11<00:05:27.560> up<00:05:27.650> it<00:05:28.159> goes<00:05:28.400> down<00:05:28.819> to<00:05:29.120> ten<00:05:29.330> and<00:05:29.360> a

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:29.509 
minus 11 up it goes down to ten and a

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:31.959 
minus 11 up it goes down to ten and a
half<00:05:29.569> I<00:05:29.930> edit<00:05:30.529> it<00:05:30.650> in<00:05:30.830> well<00:05:31.129> no<00:05:31.279> it's<00:05:31.490> ten<00:05:31.699> a<00:05:31.729> nap

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:31.969 
half I edit it in well no it's ten a nap

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:33.610 
half I edit it in well no it's ten a nap
and<00:05:32.120> now<00:05:32.180> I<00:05:32.270> really<00:05:32.900> think<00:05:32.930> this<00:05:33.229> line<00:05:33.500> is

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
and now I really think this line is

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.019 
and now I really think this line is
going<00:05:33.650> to<00:05:33.800> go<00:05:33.919> up<00:05:33.949> higher<00:05:34.189> if<00:05:34.610> you<00:05:34.759> like<00:05:35.000> this

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:35.029 
going to go up higher if you like this

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:36.939 
going to go up higher if you like this

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:41.439 
I would lay it right now play it and lay
it<00:05:39.439> minus<00:05:39.740> the<00:05:39.919> 10<00:05:40.099> f<00:05:40.279> I<00:05:40.490> can't<00:05:41.120> see<00:05:41.330> this

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:41.449 
it minus the 10 f I can't see this
