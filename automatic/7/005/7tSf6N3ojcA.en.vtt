00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.799
 hello there is no wreath with you again 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.099
 be surprised because i wear heme 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.860
 all the same it is a speech and it looks like a mess 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.130
 their abilities and abilities alone 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:23.119
 mistakes as you see us left already 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.119
 four against seven two arts in fact 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:32.759
 vk and they have seen more clearly the war with 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.660
 boats in with rather dotted art 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.399
 pretty good flight path and same 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.469
 as you can see here we have already started to build 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:47.879
 against four to me can say 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.460
 go q1 in this case I want to pro 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.239
 emphasize what is left 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.160
 pictures one varieties need to highlight all 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.800
 once again essentially repeating if you are with them 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:05.930
 review fiat said need to work on 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:10.229
 Artu good we shot very well 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.729
 artillery lead here they were basically 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.990
 in the su-5 platoon 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.700
 and for what, well, thank you, well done 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.729
 far not every pump so much 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.070
 not everyone is able to 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:26.040
 for the type as long as this arteta is like mine 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.350
 she looks quite complicated 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.509
 hit and women some 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:37.590
 exactly this case you see 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:40.590
 leading him to talk skogo one i 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.940
 of course, after ours, I carried me out 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.070
 counting on help from and 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.420
 and at the same time I try to do so as not to 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.960
 hard they are not 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.810
 I didn’t get enough for what I did though 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.340
 would be well, if I stand like that 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.340
 those who often ride on 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.920
 clearly shows that the girl is playing on 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.410
 what do i do like that yes my mistake i don't 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:18.420
 so often go to ppv in this case 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:22.290
 on the analysis I am good that only in 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:28.530
 the tears from the arta helped me finally 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:31.200
 worked very well pick up the card 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.790
 finalized as you see and for me well 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:41.130
 so fired accounted for only 4 vp and 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:43.519
 I'll tell you this, it's a T-34, I'm already waiting 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.519
 him 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:52.920
 for some reason he was very brave 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:55.490
 well that means what options like 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.490
 you will see 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.250
 give way the last projectile was you aspi 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.200
 I do not know carried felts spent either 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.200
 because even despite the lighted 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.459
 that could and shine in with the 3rd and here 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.230
 the marten situation is very so tense 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.720
 all I have to do is go and wear you 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.230
 too home well starting to reach them she 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.980
 I used to be there on the street 1 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.110
 march then splashing moment he lived 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.000
 shot and face flexible teeth crawled over me 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.680
 shoot probably for information otherwise 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.080
 hit 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.150
 hurry it apparent how could such and 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.100
 here is the total vodker 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.040
 scrambled out scare 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.800
 enlighten but in essence sleep for the essence 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.470
 Fridays meaning is just the most 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.269
 know where the arch is that we collect 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:51.840
 to communicate on a cold voice 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:54.690
 so here and now here's how i would you 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.940
 I'll show you the mistake you usually make 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.780
 art water but on the other hand 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.430
 friends showed me how a forgery 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.160
 tried to catch on this error but 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.860
 I’ll show you how I updated something 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.880
 successfully show me another 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:15.060
 Artovod start it most likely 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.890
 so here I am trying to do some 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.109
 trying to figure out where 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:23.720
 he looks what he wants to see and I 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:26.120
 I caught him on the fact that I got out 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:30.020
 while it was recharging 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:35.030
 there is seven seconds recharge narrow family 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.800
 quite go and shoot again i'm to 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.780
 I appeal to you artavody not be afraid when 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.010
 you can not catch you 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:45.560
 the moment to leave the place or all the more here 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.750
 because of the angle of the moment you turn around 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.840
 shoot and do not really know the case 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.729
 the tower needs to be ahead there tank not 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.270
 I know how to us but I do not know potatoes 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.490
 bluetooth 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.490
 if you are on arte and you stand like this 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.260
 wait for you to fear nothing when god 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.530
 well then you can 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:07.610
 tune 7 minus 0 should fly up 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:09.169
 They wait here and wait in 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.330
 there are no more such mistakes 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.720
 as you see it is easy to catch but if 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.500
 you are interested in everything that ends 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.500
 but you can watch 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:26.240
 here I tried to abyss not light 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:28.030
 began visible a little stood for the fact that 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.740
 gulf of light 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.780
 so here is such a tragic 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.000
 the end is not visible here but it remains 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.460
 just two more minutes for some reason pants 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.650
 skipping replays to show to nothing 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.080
 time stayed somewhere around two 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.039
 minutes in fact if you think so for two 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:48.200
 minutes 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:50.740
 you can not manage to capture the base alone and in 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.240
 in this case, the su-5 should have just 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.720
 just go somewhere this way 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.240
 so that even if the hotel dares 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.729
 let's say hire come to capture the base 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.340
 we just, well, just I would not have time to take 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:07.220
 and it would be whose and so it turns out, and he 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:10.060
 shells and I'll show you right now what 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.390
 finish here he was advised to go there 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.860
 better not 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.950
 for some reason went completely different 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:20.030
 side than expected something 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:21.950
 cook that's all that's over 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:27.420
 losing 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:28.250
 do not repeat mistakes su-5 do not repeat 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:33.450
 mistakes 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:35.660
 rtb with the friend that you like my friend 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:38.660
 see you soon in the review 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.660
 is happy
