clean sheets for each team just some

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.940 
clean sheets for each team just some
stats<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.930> picked<00:00:37.200> up<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.649> then<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.800> went

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
stats that I picked up and then I went

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.590 
stats that I picked up and then I went
through<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.489> then<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.670> did<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.180> goal

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
through and then I did a goal

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.190 
through and then I did a goal
differential<00:00:40.230> score<00:00:41.219> based<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.329> goals

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
year just kind of rated teams based on

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.689 
year just kind of rated teams based on
there's<00:00:55.230> goal<00:00:55.680> differential<00:00:56.039> score<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.579> how

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
there's goal differential score and how

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.170 
there's goal differential score and how
they<00:00:56.910> matched<00:00:57.149> up<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.690> one<00:00:57.899> another<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:59.070> as<00:00:59.280> an

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
they matched up to one another so as an

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.299 
they matched up to one another so as an
example<00:01:00.390> i'm<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.559> going<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.710> go<00:01:01.800> back<00:01:01.980> here

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
example i'm just going to go back here

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.899 
example i'm just going to go back here
if<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:03.270> look<00:01:03.480> at<00:01:03.979> where<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.129> an<00:01:05.220> easy<00:01:05.519> one<00:01:05.820> here

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
if you look at where is an easy one here

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.469 
if you look at where is an easy one here
stokes<00:01:08.909> under<00:01:09.270> one<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.200> see<00:01:10.530> here<00:01:10.770> that

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
stokes under one so you see here that

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.740 
stokes under one so you see here that
Stoke<00:01:12.479> has<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.920> GES<00:01:13.920> score<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.610> minus<00:01:15.030> 4<00:01:15.420> and

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
Stoke has a GES score of minus 4 and

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.330 
Stoke has a GES score of minus 4 and
Senator<00:01:16.580> Sunderland<00:01:17.580> has<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:18.060> score<00:01:18.540> of

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
Senator Sunderland has a score of

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.630 
Senator Sunderland has a score of
negative<00:01:20.340> 14<00:01:21.080> when<00:01:22.080> those<00:01:22.530> two<00:01:22.770> play<00:01:23.040> each

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
negative 14 when those two play each

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.140 
negative 14 when those two play each
other<00:01:24.860> Stoke<00:01:25.860> obviously<00:01:26.729> here<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.000> going<00:01:27.090> to

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
other Stoke obviously here is going to

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.660 
other Stoke obviously here is going to
be<00:01:27.270> given<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.720> 10-point<00:01:28.290> advantage<00:01:28.670> now

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
be given the 10-point advantage now

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.490 
be given the 10-point advantage now
obviously<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.540> just<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.810> terms<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.229> cool

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
obviously this is just in terms of cool

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.679 
obviously this is just in terms of cool
differential<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.790> an<00:01:33.000> extrapolation

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
differential it is just an extrapolation

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.770 
differential it is just an extrapolation
of<00:01:34.009> statistics<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.579> doesn't<00:01:36.000> mean<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.150> Stoke

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
of statistics it doesn't mean that Stoke

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.440 
of statistics it doesn't mean that Stoke
is<00:01:36.990> actually<00:01:37.590> going<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.829> be<00:01:38.240> favored<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.420> win

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
is actually going to be favored to win

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.990 
is actually going to be favored to win
that<00:01:39.869> game<00:01:39.930> or<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.950> they<00:01:41.130> will<00:01:41.490> win<00:01:41.759> that

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
that game or that they will win that

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.410 
that game or that they will win that
game<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.630> terms<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.670> ten<00:01:44.670> points<00:01:45.030> or<00:01:45.119> one<00:01:45.299> on

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
game in terms of ten points or one on

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.340 
game in terms of ten points or one on
this<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.780> just<00:01:45.960> simply<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:48.049> scoring<00:01:49.049> system

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
this is just simply a scoring system

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.740 
this is just simply a scoring system
that<00:01:50.340> I've<00:01:50.460> used<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.970> kind<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.240> extrapolate

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
that I've used to kind of extrapolate

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.920 
that I've used to kind of extrapolate
and<00:01:52.290> over<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.369> next<00:01:53.700> 10<00:01:54.000> game<00:01:54.390> weeks<00:01:54.630> going

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
and over the next 10 game weeks going

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.580 
and over the next 10 game weeks going
into<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.350> new<00:01:55.470> year<00:01:56.240> as<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.420> follow<00:01:57.659> along<00:01:57.990> so

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
into the new year as you follow along so

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.800 
into the new year as you follow along so
what<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.219> did<00:01:59.430> here<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.909> would<00:02:00.060> add<00:02:00.270> up<00:02:00.570> each

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
what I did here is you would add up each

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.090 
what I did here is you would add up each
score<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.950> game<00:02:02.340> week<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:03.350> get<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> result<00:02:04.950> in

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
score of game week and get a result in

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.429 
score of game week and get a result in
total<00:02:05.790> for<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.240> end<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.540> year<00:02:06.570> in<00:02:07.140> terms

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
total for the end of the year in terms

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.309 
total for the end of the year in terms
and<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:08.069> titled<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.520> expected<00:02:09.060> form<00:02:09.390> over

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
and I just titled it expected form over

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.020 
and I just titled it expected form over
the<00:02:10.410> next<00:02:10.679> eight<00:02:10.830> weeks

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
the next eight weeks

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.230 
the next eight weeks
basically<00:02:12.600> at<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.350> end<00:02:13.530> this<00:02:14.459> is<00:02:14.760> the

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
basically at the end this is the

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.070 
basically at the end this is the

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
evaluate where teams are based on where

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.400 
evaluate where teams are based on where
i<00:02:31.350> think<00:02:31.470> they<00:02:32.280> are<00:02:32.310> in<00:02:32.790> terms<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.330> here<00:02:33.690> so

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
i think they are in terms of here so

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.020 
i think they are in terms of here so
moving<00:02:35.220> forward<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.610> based<00:02:35.819> on<00:02:35.970> that

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
moving forward and based on that

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.180 
moving forward and based on that
analysis<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:36.780> can<00:02:36.810> see<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.650> top<00:02:37.830> four
