00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.540
 2 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:16.449
 appeared yesterday 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.300
 human rights 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.519
 the difference between the first edition 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.359
 if there is also a lot lighter that is against the rules that was closed 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.729
 yes it is signed 

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:34.530
 you can see that a man and a woman in a very cold environment is less than 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.180
 the 4 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.520
 after the trek to the south 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.180
 the sea wool keeper tighten these nasty and fingers from us to us 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.660
 In addition, it was a bit of a problem because he said yes this key 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.990
 categories that does not bake so well 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.450
 and try a date from 3 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.120
 and that was my last 6 May 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.540
 the stones as for example because of the Netherlands 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.440
 Also there are extra threads influencing alcohol wax 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.090
 the canal street 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.120
 I played this time 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.610
 you can do very small country and then italy meter more 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.450
 the eyes 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.970
 in a very little boy and his unfolded play about the concept and then I walked 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.640
 is of course also possible 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.000
 and thus I am going to do that and after it 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.730
 but I am happy to make this beautiful voice heard 9 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.920
 I am happy that I can also do what you are not allowed to make 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.990
 and that I can do that 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.310
 what real we know would be very nice if that were not possible 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.840
 be able to do the work together 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.170
 you think this is a time travel idea 

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:10.239
 but if you do too 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.969
 shorten it in the year that more women of age 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:17.639
 And that probably will be even nicer if you own an entire orchestra 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:22.079
 plays in that it is all different things even where instruments I have what me 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.040
 who hopes to see one of the cars in it we have in the orchestra and a lot 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:29.769
 that there are more hammers with that hit on the world cup and vivian points 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.109
 the klm have it 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:35.109
 that is not common 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.849
 the fact that as many people as possible in the ordinary I have played and a couple 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:41.040
 me
