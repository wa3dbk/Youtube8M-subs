00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.200 
drizzle pitting it with my cream cheese
frosting<00:03:17.130> I'll<00:03:18.130> just<00:03:18.400> give<00:03:18.580> it<00:03:18.610> a<00:03:18.700> slight<00:03:18.910> tap

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
frosting I'll just give it a slight tap

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.660 
frosting I'll just give it a slight tap
so<00:03:19.480> it<00:03:19.570> settles<00:03:19.930> down<00:03:19.990> a<00:03:20.140> little<00:03:20.580> from<00:03:21.580> the

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
so it settles down a little from the

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.440 
so it settles down a little from the
base<00:03:21.910> like<00:03:22.150> this<00:03:23.250> yeah<00:03:24.250> so<00:03:24.850> if<00:03:25.060> there<00:03:25.240> are<00:03:25.330> any

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
base like this yeah so if there are any

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.050 
base like this yeah so if there are any
air<00:03:25.690> gaps<00:03:25.990> inside<00:03:26.670> there<00:03:27.670> will<00:03:27.760> be<00:03:27.790> none

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060
