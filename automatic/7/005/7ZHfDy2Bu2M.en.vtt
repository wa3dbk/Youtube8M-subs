it'd be nice to get over area go down
like<00:00:41.600> 37-acre<00:00:43.030> they<00:00:44.030> usually<00:00:44.269> get<00:00:44.360> down<00:00:44.570> there

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
like 37-acre they usually get down there

well I've never able to figure out is
how<00:00:50.710> do<00:00:50.770> you<00:00:50.890> get<00:00:51.010> the<00:00:51.100> precision

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
how do you get the precision

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.369 
how do you get the precision
we<00:00:53.500> have<00:00:53.620> a<00:00:53.649> job<00:00:54.550> obviously<00:00:55.539> everything<00:00:56.050> what

we have a job obviously everything what
kind<00:00:56.530> of<00:00:56.559> tolerances<00:00:57.129> are<00:00:57.309> you<00:00:57.399> working<00:00:57.699> on

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
kind of tolerances are you working on

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.770 
kind of tolerances are you working on
here<00:00:57.850> for<00:00:58.239> four

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
tanker challenges I mean this part like

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.039 
tanker challenges I mean this part like
44<00:01:06.580> flatness<00:01:07.119> right<00:01:07.360> they<00:01:07.540> do<00:01:07.600> a<00:01:07.690> quarter

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
44 flatness right they do a quarter

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.630 
44 flatness right they do a quarter

working deck so on this bed we we

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.410 
working deck so on this bed we we
installed<00:02:11.890> controls<00:02:12.340> which<00:02:12.550> it's<00:02:13.150> agreed

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
installed controls which it's agreed

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.140 
installed controls which it's agreed
