00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
position he's got it he's got to do

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.530

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
exactly what's over did him I mean Barry

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.540 
exactly what's over did him I mean Barry
he<00:02:44.110> got<00:02:44.260> buried<00:02:44.620> on<00:02:44.710> defense<00:02:45.160> that's<00:02:45.340> where

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
he got buried on defense that's where

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.760 
he got buried on defense that's where
he's<00:02:45.640> got<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:45.820> improve<00:02:46.240> on<00:02:46.390> that<00:02:46.420> end<00:02:46.780> but<00:02:47.410> he

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
he's got to improve on that end but he

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.470 
he's got to improve on that end but he
did<00:02:47.980> a<00:02:48.010> great<00:02:48.280> job<00:02:48.310> he<00:02:48.730> was<00:02:48.850> aggressive<00:02:49.090> i

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
did a great job he was aggressive i

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.330 
did a great job he was aggressive i
thought<00:02:49.660> he<00:02:49.750> kept<00:02:49.989> his<00:02:50.170> balance<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:51.070> best

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
thought he kept his balance the best

thought he kept his balance the best
he's<00:02:51.550> done<00:02:51.730> all<00:02:51.940> year<00:02:52.239> and<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.660> i<00:02:53.260> think<00:02:53.290> we

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
he's done all year and and i think we

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.590 
he's done all year and and i think we
could<00:02:53.620> have<00:02:53.680> got<00:02:53.830> it<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.040> him<00:02:54.130> more<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:54.610> but

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
could have got it to him more and but

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.870 
could have got it to him more and but
again<00:02:56.590> i'm<00:02:56.950> happy<00:02:57.310> for<00:02:57.489> him<00:02:57.580> because<00:02:57.640> he's

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
again i'm happy for him because he's

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.060 
again i'm happy for him because he's
worked<00:02:58.090> really<00:02:58.270> hard<00:02:58.390> at<00:02:58.750> it<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.050> good<00:02:59.830> things
