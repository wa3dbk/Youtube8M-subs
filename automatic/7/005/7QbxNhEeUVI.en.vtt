00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.630
 and there by the number improvement today fell today 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.030
 the video will be slightly different from the ones 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.010
 who usually leave that the 10 had other 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.380
 matters I'd like to talk about had 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.449
 I would like to do 20 but I found 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.670
 that this video had today was a 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.470
 little more important but little more 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.510
 two months I started making video for 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.369
 helping young people and growing 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.920
 of the expensive channel as the channel was 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.270
 crescendo came along with the minority channel 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.980
 What do you think is clever? 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.170
 I was thinking of making a bug. 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.719
 specific to respond to a shithead 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.610
 that I read here but I decided not to do 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.040
 instead I'll make this video here 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.960
 dedicated to the majority supporting 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.600
 with the channel and from the beginning it is 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.789
 moral support is helping to lead her into 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.070
 Channel forward I decided to make this video 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.289
 To tell a truth, guys, what's up? 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.120
 closing with me and showed 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.730
 a goal in the easy life feel 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.980
 really want to be different, seal and go 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.290
 and peniche or the objective 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.420
 with cnet the face literally touches the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.460
 fuck to everything I say to you not 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.020
 fall because half of the people who go 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.760
 take away most of the people that go 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.130
 do not have a third of the capacity 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.140
 that you have is obvious that you will 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.150
 find the radar of people a beating 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.340
 of reasons that will pass through your 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.080
 head you must exist each you 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.030
 be more toned spoon than 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.189
 existence shows that it does not matter 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.600
 people have failed with difficult whether you go 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.130
 reach your goal 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.840
 one of the greatest examples of life I 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.220
 I have a way, said a phrase once. 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.140
 that I will never forget 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.790
 he did just like that who is 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.400
 first of all no one is in the 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.439
 first place was born better or arrived 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.329
 there is no easy way for anyone who is better 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.430
 today it 's there because it just came 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.740
 from heaven is already a divine gift 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.930
 the best are better than they did 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.460
 deserve if they are better today because 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.360
 they did things that others did not 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.030
 made 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.619
 training more and dedicating more 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.899
 American after a key game the 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.270
 most important they did not want them 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.610
 even more if they are there today. 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.950
 first place because they put together a 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.869
 I'm not going back there to get there. 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.869
 your head of your goals should 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.519
 import you 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.560
 The punishment for anyone from the 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.810
 You will not become better because of it. 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.480
 other people do not 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.950
 you have to do it for you to 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.170
 to listen to the Russians for the coach 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.420
 to please everybody because he 's a bitch back 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.310
 I'm tired of seeing people who do not 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.040
 work hard people who do not work 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.319
 trying to judge who does it arrives indica 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.930
 said vk yorquina in question of the person 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.209
 can not do is transmit does not 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.040
 Do not want to make people lazy 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.110
 are judging today if you ask 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.569
 so we did try to get there 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.090
 Where are you there can not speak a layman? 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.799
 most of which are lazy 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.239
 the majority think that everything will fall from the sky 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.370
 and when it does not fall 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.510
 they break his fucking face he 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.370
 you have to criticize someone who really 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.319
 He is struggling and really 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.180
 dedicated to me that really gave utah 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.099
 where is today then how much more this 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.760
 kind of person to judge you the most 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.739
 ignore 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.720
 from time to time comes the culture that 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.730
 they will never say that they can not afford 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.500
 house that I'm pure and talking that only has 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.079
 how to grow if you use anabolic 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.700
 Old man sincerely pities a guy 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.409
 give the car a chance to be 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.810
 small and of body that she can be 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.220
 With us, I have this in mind. 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.799
 let the color of envy of the 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.019
 inability does more to put blog 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.329
 Something in your anabolic head. 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.730
 does not make magic if you do not mind 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.250
 you do not run behind do not dance from the sky 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.739
 in the skies the rain if you do not leave the 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.410
 Fucking comfort zone, nothing's gonna change. 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.340
 that there you if you really are in order 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.900
 to get somewhere if you 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.090
 It really is meant to be different. 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.069
 to let magic and 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.949
 Shortcuts are a way to a matter of 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.230
 bodybuilding who said that does not 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:47.239
 to grow then that anabolic 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.680
 What the fuck is this idea? 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.480
 to grow a little to 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.040
 give an improvement on the chip it has to 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.549
 make use of the steroid that has almost 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.859
 general horizon brother wakes up if you do 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.019
 today in Bolivia before a problem is yours 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:01.940
 but only because you are by contest and 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.340
 He felt whatever you wanted to take this 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.840
 way everyone to take the car does not 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.370
 can dedicate the car can not facilitate 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.980
 at the time you can not do a heavy workout 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.599
 and get what you got only 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.760
 because the guy is with better quality the 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.889
 your body with you greater than you 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.440
 took on the horizon the guy has defects 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:20.160
 also only that you were fact he has to 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.710
 be also 7 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.740
 envious of the weight of the guy 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.560
 take it easy to talk the guy does it's easy 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.300
 Slb that you do not have that weight if it is 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.100
 easy because you do not go there and do what 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.290
 is doing it does not equal 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.420
 in fact it's almost a better parent is 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.910
 easy to grow taking pump then take 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.800
 one is also marked I want to see if 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.410
 you grow like this the case of the great 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.970
 today pepe was dedicated the guy did things 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.680
 that you did not do because while 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.570
 criticizing showed how an animal's 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.460
 car was not really working there and you? 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.920
 died your tongue is not easy to take 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.200
 princeton easy pump and gets very expensive 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.120
 so it's better that he does the 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.710
 what he did then gets bigger because he does not 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.630
 Do you know who is capable? 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.870
 this kind of person she can not 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:06.360
 because they can not do it says in the 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.370
 themselves do not they do because they 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.380
 tried to take shortcuts so often and 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.000
 broke the face is the way out they have 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.160
 nowadays justifying the failure 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.510
 theirs is everybody is like him 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.610
 in fact you do not have to do what they 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.950
 Did you get caught? You 're a dedicated guy. 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.230
 that is striving and doing 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.210
 critical target and is not something I 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.380
 I have to leave the people who are 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.000
 accompanying a channel that is 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.070
 promoting the videos by walking with the 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.870
 support that I get fucking happy is 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.540
 that when you come across this type 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.170
 situation does nothing but leave 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.400
 pass 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.220
 who has to decide if he's on the way 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.600
 Yes, you are, your purpose is very 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.790
 greater than anyone who is 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.190
 criticizing that people are small 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.169
 so keep the door on focus and that's the 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.430
 I yell at you on the farm, I hope 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.080
