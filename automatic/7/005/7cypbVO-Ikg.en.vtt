00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.039
 hello dear friends today we are going to do 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.650
 this center of tables and we're going to do the 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:18.680
 step by step good for that we are going to 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.380
 need the figure they want to do it 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.900
 for example I have this we are going to use 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.939
 a candle a stick to stick it back 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:32.780
 our silicon machine a land and 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:37.880
 let's use a mouthpiece that is here 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:42.200
 Right next to a balloon mouthpiece 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:45.620
 a strip of this cardboard that is flexible 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.990
 I do not know what it's called and a round circle 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.090
 well let's see how it is done 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.310
 He passed 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.270
 hello friends here we are with the step to 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:59.450
 step we have the strips 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.820
 It has a line here and ready here 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:05.449
 you choose that you like me more 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:09.340
 like with the good hairline simply 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:12.600
 I 'm going to leave the measure 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.460
 the description of the video so they can see 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.789
 well let's go somewhat our being and 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.560
 with everything around and we will get there 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.070
 well in the list so there is a 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.610
 report 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.830
 A) Yes 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.860
 we wait only a few seconds and then 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.400
 we are mediando it has to be a table 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.680
 work 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.900
 or a smooth table that is going to stick a 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.500
 little of this but then it takes off very 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.470
 easy 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.770
 well already having that way we're going to do everything 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.770
 the around 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.060
 we keep looking 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.280
 and we keep circling 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.280
 A) Yes 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.119
 without really good and having everything 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.350
 complete so the video is not too long 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:08.140
 let's paint to let dry and decorate 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.460
 for example, I am this little sweet 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.710
 pink 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.900
 you can do what you 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.590
 and want good Chinese figure and 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:21.960
 let's put this here 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.960
 and that's it 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.680
 well then let's have it here I have 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.060
 a square 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.609
 and we are going to enter our finger and in 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:40.800
 come back here and we are left like a small 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:43.390
 florcita let's fill everything 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.330
 at about 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.430
 Be careful with your fingers than silicone 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:52.640
 burning 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.640
 well we keep filling 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.599
 A) Yes 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.879
 ah 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.510
 and we put everything 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:25.640
 and we continue like this and now we come 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.640
 with the other step 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.660
 good friends here we are already 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.890
 finished filling with the paper 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.870
 you can use the color that 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.489
 you want good we have our 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:43.000
 nozzle so let's paint the whole 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.000
 around 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:50.090
 and to paste in the center good 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.670
 we have the stick we can measure the 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.840
 size that we want more or less 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.440
 we want so 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.440
 we rotate 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:10.319
 we have a clean view over here 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:13.349
 to give a decoration and we will use 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:16.159
 we put with sticks of this let's go 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.159
 turning around 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:24.110
 we go around like that if they do not want more 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.110
 tiny can tighten down 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:33.470
 we all take them out and stretch a little 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:36.430
 well we put together a little bit of our 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.430
 strike hot 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:42.220
 and we put 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.220
 here 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.509

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.169
 takeoff 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:08.630
 I helped with the stick because I did not 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.670
 I wanted my fingers and good will 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.090
