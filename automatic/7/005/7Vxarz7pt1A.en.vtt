00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.620
 already recording exactly by lips of 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.030
 little animals this week in history 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.850
 animals of our presence of 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.810
 our friend as polis as police is 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.760
 a puppy type or more than approximately 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.890
 78 years old we remember friends of animals 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.720
 that already spending about 78 years the defenses 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.689
 of the puppies begin to fall and 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.420
 we started having immune problems 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.649
 deficiency or low defenses in the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.320
 puppies and the problems begin 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.219
 usually the first problems that 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.600
 we have in but then in skin this 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.719
 week friends of animals we will see 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.690
 the issue of using more skin problems 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.610
 dermatitis and mainly scabies in 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.370
 special this week let's see the topic 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.989
 of weapon of rust of sica 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.430
 this project have brought us because they 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.780
 complaint the owner of needing more than 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.370
 that wars that in a way 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.769
 pretty pretty insistent 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.560
 so let's see what they have 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.370
 to discover what it is 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:14.040
 let's do a microscopic examination a 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.990
 skin scraping to be able to us 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.850
 support veterinary doctors and know what 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.490
 It is what is happening above all we 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.990
 to need to do our backup 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.710
 cutaneous a solution 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.860
 we're going to need 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.720
 a scalpel knife of the first thing 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.130
 let's do we're going to have to detect 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.800
 the injury 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.430
 about the camera please let 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:43.530
 detect the injury later we go 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:47.880
 to pour the liquid the oily liquid and 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.870
 let's do a scraping 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.510
 okay 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:56.140
 until I have 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:59.680
 a small bleeding a hemorrhage of 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:03.730
 petechia and this liquid we are going to 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:07.890
 pour into a pause 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.890
 we have extra material 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.070
 until there was a small hemorrhage 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.880
 that obviously what we want to get to 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:21.880
 to do is to detach we can and that 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.470
 we can almost reach the dermis and 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.500
 we have our sample then we go to 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.500
 laboratory of life that is what 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.500
 we find 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.300
 animal friends that kind of aliens 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.340
 that this puppy has is full of 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.620
 aliens that means that if you do not 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.960
 we definitely deal with in a lapse of 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.600
 one month this puppy is going to stay but 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.100
 completely hairless hair you will be in 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.050
 the street we usually have a 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.760
 Gonzales project on the street that is what 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.710
 what do we do then go there because 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.900
 truth to look if less is going to me 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.460
 paste some kind of being plus some 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.540
 more salt types if you stick no brother 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:24.990
 but generally this type of scabies 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.390
 model is specific to puppies 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.460
 so do not worry not a lot 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.070
 most important to deal with this kind of 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.760
 scabies is to use acaricides because they are 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.000
 Mites 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.070
 this kind of someone are mites then 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.630
 we are not in any amount but the 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.400
 moral of this video is that it leads 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.400
 please to your usual 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.569
 in the precise 2 because its acaricides 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.420
 many times they are toxic and they can 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:54.239
 cause problems with the health of 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.830
 our little animals then friends of 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.020
 animals or in the moral of this 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.350
 video we are going to this project to give you a 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.810
 bath and acaricidal advertising we are going to 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.209
 give him treatment and this puppy with 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.300
 we all see them said Carlos of the world 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.970
 he says to drop all this to this 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:15.150
 project I recommend that you stop falling 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.239
 everyone else there in the aic and 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.130
 us for the next capsule 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.290
 definitely what we find in the 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.520
 microscope in this puppy this 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.370
 little animal that we saw that was 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.190
 moving is called molex remember 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.020
 that there are different types of weapons are 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.090
 modÃ©lica weapons arms only 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.830
 itchy sarcoptic mange in kittens 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.770
 we also have a type of scabies that 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:41.580
 is the auto erex Felix and I notice you are 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:44.880
 happy we have to be very careful 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.680
 because 'they are infectious it is transmitted 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.240
 of dog dog but remember sounds 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.800
 of animals that definitely has 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.599
 what to do with the immunity of the dog 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.060
 and if it is a dog than it is units 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:58.080
 it works obviously it is going to invent 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.379
 and he's going to have skin problems but 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.599
 yes it is a well fed puppy and its 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:05.460
 immunity is every strong one definitely 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:07.500
 in many of these pastures live in a way 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.970
 be a prophet that means they live 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.740
 there in the skin but in the hudson damage 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.780
 but nothing else is waiting for it 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:16.069
 lower the differences to be able 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:21.060
 proliferate and be able to be 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:23.580
 opportunists and opportunists then the 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:27.050
 moral of this video is that they are 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.129
 having a cleaning of your animal 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.669
 about a month they are taking a bath 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:37.820
 blue animal and well this puppy with 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:40.010
 this puppy with many demodes 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.170
 is planned with all the fears of 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:45.350
 Everyone says that they drop all 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:48.700
 demons there in the aic subscribe and 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.700
 us for the next calculated
