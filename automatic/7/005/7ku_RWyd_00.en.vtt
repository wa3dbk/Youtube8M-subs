00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello good all guys one more day and 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.519
 as you see today I bring you a new review 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.480
 as you are seeing I have here the greatest 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.000
 beast of this fifa ultimate team 14 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:19.529
 ibrahimovic report as you see 90 of 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.400
 half 77 of pace 92 of shot 80 of pas 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.130
 in 90 Dodge 55 defense and 81 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.859
 head four stars of bad leg and 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.080
 five filigree star to me the 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.329
 have left to do the review but with 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.950
 it cost him around two million one hundred 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.050
 a thousand coins now I think it's more 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.579
 expensive up to about two million five hundred 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.950
 a thousand coins as you are seeing here 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.840
 nine games 12 goals are not those 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.360
 really because I left it badly 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.390
 left twice and that's why that's why 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.989
 are the goals really counted as 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.570
 you see has normal attack rate and 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.710
 defense index under what is not 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.590
 not bad honestly 195 tall and it's 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.940
 a beast as you are seeing now 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.159
 same here we have their pros and their 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.770
 cons 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.710
 as pro we can say that is great about 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.369
 clear head also influences 195 of 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.799
 height is critical has a kilogram of 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.299
 incredible quality you will see in the 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.810
 clips got you a couple of goals from 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:23.450
 very very good quality have a shot or 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.840
 power shot very very good or 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.119
 the sticks very well the break a good pass 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.640
 could also go well from mc or I think 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.130
 I would also take many balls is very 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.009
 strong is I think the strongest player 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.530
 that I have tried it is very difficult to throw it and 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.719
 he goes many times of the rivals only 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.039
 with his body very good haggling 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:45.439
 because it has its 5 stars of 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.929
 filigree and has a good shot with the 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.659
 bad leg has four stars of 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.250
 bad leg but it hits very well like 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.079
 against we can say that it is very expensive 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.939
 true that it is expensive but of course it is a 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.549
 player that attracts a lot of attention and 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.129
 that's why its price is somewhat slow 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.599
 honestly I do not know myself this player in 

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:05.299
 real life did not see him as slow as he 

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:06.950
 they put on fifa and that sometimes it 's so bad 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.720
 positioned myself many times I 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.470
 I find that it is too low and I 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.120
 It costs a lot to carry the ball 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.700
 for nothing now let's move on to analyze 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.250
 your states as you are seeing here 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.780
 we have your are have like 20 96 of 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.340
 ball control have ball control 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.410
 excellent 94 94 dribbling effect 98 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.900
 definition incredible definition of this 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.700
 86 player precision launch 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:35.460
 of 93 foul from long shots 98 penalties 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.160
 88 short pass 99 shot power 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.040
 as he had told us before and 96 of 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.230
 volleys then we have in attributes 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.630
 physical 92 agility 91's 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.000
 anticipation 81 universities your point 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.330
 weak as I said also before 93 of 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.010
 resistance and 95 strength as well 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.100
 it had been said before very strong this 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.480
 player 97 aggressiveness and 83 of 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.580
 positioning from below also does not 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.820
 I had said before that it is not always 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.410
 well positioned and 84 division then 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.050
 up here I'm studying them in this 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.270
 player 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.590
