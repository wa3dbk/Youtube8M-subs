00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
okay so once you start of the power this

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.350 
okay so once you start of the power this
digger<00:00:55.430> right<00:00:55.670> here<00:00:55.850> is<00:00:55.940> going<00:00:56.120> to<00:00:56.180> destroy

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
digger right here is going to destroy

dome and when it does destroy dome

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.700 
dome and when it does destroy dome
you're<00:01:02.120> gonna<00:01:02.239> have<00:01:02.420> no<00:01:02.720> gravity<00:01:03.410> in<00:01:03.440> this

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
you're gonna have no gravity in this

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.999 
you're gonna have no gravity in this
room<00:01:04.010> so<00:01:04.699> when<00:01:05.509> that<00:01:05.630> happens<00:01:06.140> what<00:01:06.440> you<00:01:06.560> do<00:01:06.740> is

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
room so when that happens what you do is

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.310 
room so when that happens what you do is
on<00:01:07.220> this<00:01:07.400> lift<00:01:07.670> right<00:01:07.820> here<00:01:08.030> you<00:01:08.810> boost<00:01:09.140> right

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
on this lift right here you boost right

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.780 
on this lift right here you boost right
on<00:01:09.500> it<00:01:09.680> and<00:01:09.860> you'll<00:01:10.070> be<00:01:10.159> flown<00:01:10.340> in<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:10.460> air<00:01:10.610> for

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
on it and you'll be flown in the air for

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.219 
on it and you'll be flown in the air for
a<00:01:10.820> while<00:01:10.880> so<00:01:11.180> you're<00:01:11.330> going<00:01:11.450> to<00:01:11.509> hold<00:01:11.630> down<00:01:11.869> on

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
a while so you're going to hold down on

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.859 
a while so you're going to hold down on
the<00:01:12.259> left<00:01:12.770> analog<00:01:13.100> stick<00:01:13.310> to<00:01:14.270> try<00:01:14.540> to<00:01:14.600> keep

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
the left analog stick to try to keep

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.780 
the left analog stick to try to keep
yourself<00:01:15.080> up<00:01:15.380> in<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:15.590> aerial<00:01:16.009> to<00:01:16.190> time<00:01:16.580> you

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
yourself up in the aerial to time you

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.399 
yourself up in the aerial to time you
fall<00:01:17.090> so<00:01:17.330> that<00:01:17.479> you<00:01:17.570> fall<00:01:17.810> right<00:01:18.080> into<00:01:18.259> the

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
fall so that you fall right into the

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.980 
fall so that you fall right into the
edge<00:01:18.560> of<00:01:18.590> this<00:01:18.830> platform<00:01:19.190> up<00:01:19.490> here<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:19.990> right

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
edge of this platform up here and right

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.389 
edge of this platform up here and right
when<00:01:21.380> you<00:01:21.500> hit<00:01:21.680> it<00:01:21.830> you<00:01:21.860> want<00:01:22.130> to<00:01:22.190> do<00:01:22.340> this

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
when you hit it you want to do this

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.529 
when you hit it you want to do this
quick<00:01:22.820> sprint<00:01:23.180> into<00:01:23.660> like<00:01:23.840> a<00:01:23.869> dolphin<00:01:24.380> dive<00:01:25.539> if

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
quick sprint into like a dolphin dive if

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.630 
quick sprint into like a dolphin dive if
you<00:01:26.660> miss<00:01:26.929> it's<00:01:27.289> going<00:01:27.470> to<00:01:27.560> shoot<00:01:27.770> it<00:01:27.890> off<00:01:28.039> so<00:01:28.340> I

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
you miss it's going to shoot it off so I
