just<00:01:41.159> like<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.939> loops<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.299> my<00:01:42.450> baked<00:01:42.630> towel<00:01:42.869> so

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.370 
just like the loops in my baked towel so
I<00:01:43.790> use<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.060> emergencies<00:01:45.659> when<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.140> can't

I use this in emergencies when I can't

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.840 
I use this in emergencies when I can't
find<00:01:46.590> my<00:01:46.649> other<00:01:46.680> microfiber<00:01:47.250> towels<00:01:47.549> it's

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
really absorbent but the big loops

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.740 
really absorbent but the big loops
create<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> frizz<00:01:50.729> situation<00:01:51.299> which<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.600> can

kind of see right over here what you

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.090 
kind of see right over here what you
really<00:01:53.909> want<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.540> something<00:01:55.049> more<00:01:55.350> this

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
really want is something more this

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.149 
really want is something more this
texture<00:01:56.700> see<00:01:57.509> how<00:01:57.630> fine<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.290> if<00:01:59.009> you're

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
texture see how fine that is if you're

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
old and you're kind of pretending you're

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.410 
old and you're kind of pretending you're
grown<00:02:20.500> up<00:02:20.530> but<00:02:21.340> when<00:02:21.670> you<00:02:21.790> do<00:02:21.970> that<00:02:22.150> what

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
grown up but when you do that what

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.970 
grown up but when you do that what
you're<00:02:22.570> doing<00:02:22.960> is<00:02:23.080> you're<00:02:23.230> squashing<00:02:23.650> your

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
you're doing is you're squashing your

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.710 
you're doing is you're squashing your
hairs<00:02:24.190> natural<00:02:24.430> wave<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.180> you're<00:02:25.270> preventing

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
hairs natural wave and you're preventing

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.150 
hairs natural wave and you're preventing
it<00:02:25.810> from<00:02:25.840> clumping<00:02:26.200> into<00:02:26.650> like<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:26.920> more

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
it from clumping into like a more

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.090 
it from clumping into like a more
natural<00:02:27.520> formation<00:02:28.030> so<00:02:28.630> instead<00:02:29.440> of<00:02:29.500> wrapping

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
natural formation so instead of wrapping

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.650 
natural formation so instead of wrapping
your<00:02:30.190> hair<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.610> putting<00:02:30.760> up<00:02:30.940> in<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.180> turn<00:02:31.390> a

uses paper towels which I'm not as big
of<00:03:11.500> a<00:03:11.620> fan<00:03:11.830> of<00:03:11.980> because<00:03:12.160> you<00:03:12.489> have<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:12.670> throw

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
of a fan of because you have to throw

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.729 
of a fan of because you have to throw
them<00:03:12.940> away<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:13.270> it's<00:03:13.360> pretty<00:03:13.540> wasteful<00:03:14.050> but

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
them away and it's pretty wasteful but

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.220 
them away and it's pretty wasteful but
my<00:03:15.459> hair<00:03:15.670> clumps<00:03:16.030> clumps<00:03:16.810> sounds<00:03:17.020> gross<00:03:17.200> but

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
my hair clumps clumps sounds gross but

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.020 
my hair clumps clumps sounds gross but
what<00:03:17.530> I<00:03:17.560> mean<00:03:17.769> is<00:03:17.920> my<00:03:18.100> waves<00:03:18.549> clumped<00:03:18.940> together

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
what I mean is my waves clumped together

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.710 
what I mean is my waves clumped together
way<00:03:19.690> better<00:03:19.930> when<00:03:20.230> she<00:03:20.410> uses<00:03:20.680> paper<00:03:20.860> towels<00:03:21.100> so

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
way better when she uses paper towels so

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.500 
way better when she uses paper towels so
I'm<00:03:22.720> probably<00:03:23.320> gonna<00:03:23.920> go<00:03:24.190> so<00:03:24.489> like<00:03:25.239> a
