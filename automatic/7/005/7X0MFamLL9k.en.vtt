 again we will access at least meet screen property 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:08.389
 on the fast track 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:10.089
 the most effective way 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:11.469
 from the desk 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.199
 ashton right 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.249
 and the own option 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:17.659
 and we have our window 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:20.289
 of display properties 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.839
 let's touch now 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:25.839
 the tab of this appearance 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.279
 one click on appearance 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.649
 and here we are shown 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.690
 side someone is going to have 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.690
 the windows the different windows 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.820
 here we can configure 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.220
 this appearance tab 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.210
 we have already said that with this option to lose when we are already customizing 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.010
 in some way our 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.220
 our computer 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.230
 we were not here platoon customizing everyone put our 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.220
 taste 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.070
 in this window we have 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.550
 several fields 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.740
 the one of windows and edge and buttons 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.160
 windows and buttons 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.290
 color combination 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.970
 and font size 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.360
 we'll see 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.470
 these three 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.190
 positions that 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.000
 they all have a drop-down menu like dextrose and seeing that they have all 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.660
 your arrowheads 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.660
 down well then the first of all windows and buttons 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.320
 let's make clyde 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.890
 of rigor 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.990
 only fashion they put 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.620
 e to choose 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.620
 options two window combinations 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.280
 the same as the menu 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.240
 the style of windows xp 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.620
 and the classical style encounter style of clicking the classic style the 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.050
 jungle like this 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.410
 Preview 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.630
 changed me 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.340
 this was the style 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.690
 of windows 98 lives another previous windows 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.299
 this would be the combination 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.020
 of the window if they appear in the windows 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.470
 with this 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.580
 selected option 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.580
 metrobus viole dolly included a click on it 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:12.069
 in the min 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.939
 and I will leave the style of your ix x 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.959
 you have to have this would be the configuration of the windows 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.599
 we would say 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.229
 the next option 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:29.279
 is the combination of colors 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:32.279
 little gives us many options windows xp 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:34.689
 to combine 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.669
 the different colors of de of this central 

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:40.519
 let's try them 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.869
 this is the scale of assuming 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:45.869
 that we would be here in the preliminary presentation 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.739
 let's do a trial raised 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.100
 it posed how it would change nothing structured 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.489
 the moon moon 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.769
 the whole of the windows 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.480
 iris we will also feel 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.059
 in vertigo 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:03.089
 and that gives how they would look 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:05.149
 those windows 

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:07.439
 with this configuration 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.609
 like I always say 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.119
 a thing that ethical aesthetic sense regardless of whether 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:14.519
 themes 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.839
 of functionality as we'll see a little bit later 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:20.939
 well let's leave it to the consumer's taste 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:22.739
 in principle we go up 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.779
 I'm going to leave the one I had 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:27.029
 in principle, you are 

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:29.999
 default in ace 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:32.999
 the way if we do not go into any fan anymore 

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:36.119
 what is the form 

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:38.159
 window 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.379
 miku min 2 x 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:41.649
 well then 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:45.739
 we have been in that we have given the style of windows xp and we have left 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:46.699
 clear 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:48.379
 color combination 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:49.439
 what's wrong with it 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.439
 the default dep combination 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:58.059
 we have this option because if it is very interesting 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:03:59.939
 percent 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.429
 taking away the esthetics a bit 

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:03.999
 rather attending to the offer 

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:05.229
 functionality 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:08.119
 Arabic functionality 

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:09.929
 is the size of the font 

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:12.379
 the font that is harrison the letters 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.509
 and sometimes it's accompanied by the five years 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.259
 I also wanted to hurt 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:19.290
 on my computer 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.529
 a normal font size 

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.159
 these sources 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:27.409
 will affect not only the desk 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:29.949
 not just desktop icons 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:31.340
 but also 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.259
 to the advantages 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:35.180
 all the windows are going to have 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.180
 the size of sources that we decide here to have 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.039
 we inhabit the contextual menu 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:44.169
 sorry the drop-down menu 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:45.809
 here we have 

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:48.409
 investigation of the ejido before large 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:49.860
 and very large fonts 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:50.919
 for this I say 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.569
 the theme of its functionality 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:54.889
 uu utility 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.120
 there will be users who need 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.320
 d a larger castle font will have and montse injured 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.830
 and others that there is not a very large sources much larger than the flu 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.370
 not selected or two approve for example with 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.490
 the source also 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.360
 we go to second simulation 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.059
 of big font is that we're going to see the effect 

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:14.430
 that produces queen 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.430
 miku m desk and himself 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:21.039
 i the son 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.059
 large font 

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:26.059
 some pri with the left button encounter ness 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:29.749
 and I say and here comes the preview here 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:32.759
 is in the previous presentation of how greatness sources 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.699
 denis the active window bathtub with this source the inactive with these sources 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:40.849
 I click 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:42.860
 in the apply button 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.220
 snow and hope you're working on this trying to put the 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:49.509
 sources like I said 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:51.419
 they are already appearing here 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.650
 the sources as they are 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.600
 prevent 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.779
 finally accepted 

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:00.419
 have been a little bit bigger than how I had them 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.199
 without training in those moments 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:06.330
 it's already being the one that appear percent asks for bigger 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.659
 how he had them 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:09.569
 let's configure what for 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.569
 salgado 

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:17.039
 but large fonts 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:18.610
 Well, let's choose 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.539
 muchnik fonts 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:23.409
 application 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:25.129
 working 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:29.249
 when the platform and the fountains appear, you see that it was enlarged enough 

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:32.719
 amazon theme so much of these letters 

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:34.419
 i accept 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:36.189
 d already has them 

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:38.689
 it has already caught them being the computer 

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:42.009
 i bezabeh comoras and it shows not commented 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:45.009
 right names are much bigger 

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:48.749
 these two names not only two 

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:50.589
 the elements of the window 

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:53.619
 but also of the contents of the sale 

00:06:53.619 --> 00:06:56.460
 this is very interesting 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.050
 we can adapt it to our 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.469
 Mexico DF 

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:01.070
 we need that 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.999
 these desk supplies 

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:05.599
 that has a larger size we already know what it is 

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:06.860
 with the option 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.559
 with checho 

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:10.869
 the fact is 

00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:12.520
 to science 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.690
 and in appearance 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.690
 in size the fonts I choose very large fonts 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.059
 in agreement 

00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:22.300
 this window 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.539
 eyelash 

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:24.370
 should 

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.460
 be very useful and should go 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:31.530
 use it all those who need to modify the size of their sources to 

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:34.069
 be comfortable at home 

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:34.779
 memories
