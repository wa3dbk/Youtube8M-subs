hey youtube I'm gonna show you how to
sky<00:00:04.500> watch<00:00:04.710> for<00:00:05.009> UFOs<00:00:05.490> during<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.240> day<00:00:06.470> that

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
sky watch for UFOs during the day that

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.669 
sky watch for UFOs during the day that
are<00:00:07.589> cloaked<00:00:07.859> under<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.370> infrared<00:00:08.970> spectrum

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:09.679 
are cloaked under the infrared spectrum

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.230 
are cloaked under the infrared spectrum
what<00:00:10.679> you<00:00:10.800> want<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.010> do<00:00:11.099> first<00:00:11.309> of<00:00:11.550> all<00:00:11.670> if<00:00:11.910> your

what you want to do first of all if your

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.220 
what you want to do first of all if your
camcorder<00:00:12.509> has<00:00:13.320> infrared<00:00:14.309> night<00:00:14.700> vision<00:00:15.230> you

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
camcorder has infrared night vision you

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.929 
camcorder has infrared night vision you
need<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.859> have<00:00:17.699> an<00:00:18.439> adapter<00:00:19.439> filter<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.760> put

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
need to have an adapter filter to put

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.880 
need to have an adapter filter to put
over<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.810> lens<00:00:22.279> while<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.580> are<00:00:23.730> filming<00:00:24.150> in

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
over the lens while you are filming in

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.349 
over the lens while you are filming in
daylight<00:00:25.890> with<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.580> infrared<00:00:27.119> night<00:00:27.330> vision

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
daylight with the infrared night vision

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.229 
daylight with the infrared night vision
on<00:00:28.130> Sony<00:00:29.130> stopped<00:00:29.820> making<00:00:31.520> their<00:00:32.520> camcorders

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
on Sony stopped making their camcorders

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.170 
on Sony stopped making their camcorders
with<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:34.079> ability<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.710> film<00:00:35.250> during<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.000> day

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
with the ability to film during the day

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.110 
with the ability to film during the day
with<00:00:36.600> infrared<00:00:37.020> night<00:00:37.320> vision<00:00:37.380> on<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:38.640> will

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
with infrared night vision on it will

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.790 
with infrared night vision on it will
white<00:00:39.390> washout<00:00:39.899> if<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.140> don't<00:00:40.320> have<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> filter

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
white washout if you don't have a filter

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
white washout if you don't have a filter
and<00:00:42.050> they<00:00:43.050> had<00:00:43.290> some<00:00:44.070> interesting<00:00:44.280> reasons

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
and they had some interesting reasons

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.790 
and they had some interesting reasons
for<00:00:44.969> doing<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.690> go<00:00:45.870> google<00:00:46.379> bat<00:00:46.530> check

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
for doing that so go google bat check

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.060 
for doing that so go google bat check
that<00:00:46.980> out<00:00:47.210> you<00:00:48.210> can<00:00:48.239> go<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.600> eBay<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.860> can

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
that out you can go on eBay and you can

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.420 
that out you can go on eBay and you can
find<00:00:51.199> what<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.320> want<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> real

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
find what you want to have is a real

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.520 
find what you want to have is a real
dark<00:00:53.670> filter<00:00:54.180> like<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.719> where<00:00:55.260> it's<00:00:55.379> almost

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
dark filter like this where it's almost

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.569 
dark filter like this where it's almost
completely<00:00:56.160> black<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:57.050> I<00:00:58.050> think<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:01.350> nm<00:01:02.309> on

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
completely black and I think the nm on

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.219 
completely black and I think the nm on
this<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:03.000> nine<00:01:03.180> hundred<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.719> can<00:01:03.750> get<00:01:04.019> ones

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
this is nine hundred you can get ones

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.490 
this is nine hundred you can get ones
that<00:01:04.530> go<00:01:04.680> up<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> thousand<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.670> think<00:01:06.380> but<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
that go up to a thousand I think but the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.330 
that go up to a thousand I think but the
higher<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.070> number<00:01:08.369> on<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.760> nm<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:10.340> better

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
higher the number on the nm is better

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.030 
higher the number on the nm is better
because<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.970> will<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:13.140> will<00:01:13.260> block<00:01:13.590> out<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
because it will it will block out the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.530 
because it will it will block out the
daylight<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.610> you'll<00:01:14.790> just<00:01:15.000> see<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
daylight and you'll just see the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.990 
daylight and you'll just see the
infrared<00:01:16.049> spectrum<00:01:16.640> when<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.729> have<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
infrared spectrum when you have the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.850 
infrared spectrum when you have the
filter<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.509> with<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.049> infrared<00:01:19.650> night<00:01:19.799> vision

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
filter on with the infrared night vision

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.190 
filter on with the infrared night vision
so<00:01:20.250> let's<00:01:21.000> put<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.299> filter<00:01:21.600> on<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.930> do<00:01:22.020> some

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
so let's put the filter on and do some

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.289 
so let's put the filter on and do some
sky<00:01:22.409> watching<00:01:22.650> as<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.400> can<00:01:23.580> see<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.119> what

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
sky watching as you can see this is what

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.550 
sky watching as you can see this is what
it<00:01:24.420> looks<00:01:24.659> like<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:25.310> scan<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.520> skies<00:01:26.549> with

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
it looks like to scan the skies with

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.069 
it looks like to scan the skies with
infrared<00:01:28.560> night<00:01:28.770> vision<00:01:28.799> on<00:01:29.310> during<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.850> day

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
infrared night vision on during the day

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:36.130 
infrared night vision on during the day
and<00:01:32.659> you<00:01:33.659> will<00:01:33.780> find<00:01:34.079> videos<00:01:34.290> on<00:01:35.070> YouTube<00:01:35.640> that

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
and you will find videos on YouTube that

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:44.240 
and you will find videos on YouTube that
say<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:38.270> UFOs<00:01:39.680> hide<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.189> clouds<00:01:42.740> so<00:01:43.740> let's

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
say the UFOs hide in the clouds so let's

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.609 
say the UFOs hide in the clouds so let's
scan<00:01:44.579> some<00:01:44.850> clouds<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.750> see<00:01:45.960> if<00:01:46.049> we<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.350> see

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
scan some clouds to see if we can see

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.450 
scan some clouds to see if we can see
anything

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
anything

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.340 
anything
shining<00:01:48.030> reflecting<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:50.899> sunlight<00:01:51.899> or

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
shining reflecting the sunlight or

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:03.750 
shining reflecting the sunlight or
anything<00:01:53.009> going

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.320 

it's<00:02:04.300> really<00:02:04.690> hard<00:02:04.900> to<00:02:05.110> do<00:02:05.890> this<00:02:06.100> because<00:02:06.490> it

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
it's really hard to do this because it

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.770 
it's really hard to do this because it
still<00:02:07.750> is<00:02:07.780> very<00:02:08.020> bright<00:02:08.590> out<00:02:09.310> here<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:09.940> hard

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
still is very bright out here and hard

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.530 
still is very bright out here and hard
to<00:02:10.930> see<00:02:10.960> through<00:02:11.320> the<00:02:11.470> viewfinder<00:02:12.540> if

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
to see through the viewfinder if

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.710 
to see through the viewfinder if
anything<00:02:14.020> is<00:02:14.400> reflecting<00:02:15.400> or<00:02:16.020> or<00:02:17.020> shining
