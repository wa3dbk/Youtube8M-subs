hey guys today will be explained to you
how<00:00:11.350> we<00:00:11.620> did<00:00:12.010> the

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:14.590 
how we did the

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.940 
how we did the
nerve<00:00:15.160> titan<00:00:15.910> clip<00:00:16.270> mod<00:00:16.510> so<00:00:17.350> that<00:00:17.530> it<00:00:17.740> has<00:00:17.920> the

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950 
nerve titan clip mod so that it has the

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.750 
nerve titan clip mod so that it has the
ability<00:00:18.520> to<00:00:18.550> use<00:00:18.910> these<00:00:19.810> kind<00:00:20.110> of<00:00:20.170> clips<00:00:20.440> that

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
ability to use these kind of clips that

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.550 
ability to use these kind of clips that
come<00:00:21.760> with<00:00:21.970> the<00:00:22.150> three<00:00:22.540> times<00:00:22.810> and<00:00:23.140> AH<00:00:23.350> long

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
come with the three times and AH long

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.730 
come with the three times and AH long
shot<00:00:25.950> basically<00:00:26.950> what<00:00:27.130> it<00:00:27.160> is<00:00:27.340> it's<00:00:27.640> would

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
shot basically what it is it's would

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.330 
shot basically what it is it's would
like<00:00:29.740> that<00:00:29.950> and<00:00:31.050> then<00:00:32.050> we<00:00:32.349> draw<00:00:32.619> the<00:00:32.650> good<00:00:32.980> side

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
like that and then we draw the good side

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.270 
like that and then we draw the good side
to<00:00:34.000> make<00:00:34.150> it<00:00:34.210> a<00:00:34.390> barrel<00:00:34.750> then<00:00:35.350> we<00:00:35.559> just<00:00:35.710> cut<00:00:36.250> a

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
to make it a barrel then we just cut a

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.570 
to make it a barrel then we just cut a
rectangle<00:00:36.970> so<00:00:37.150> that<00:00:37.530> dark<00:00:38.530> get<00:00:38.770> fit<00:00:39.010> perfectly

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
rectangle so that dark get fit perfectly

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.450 
rectangle so that dark get fit perfectly
then<00:00:40.030> slide<00:00:40.360> back<00:00:40.629> or<00:00:41.199> you<00:00:41.650> guys<00:00:41.800> can<00:00:42.040> just<00:00:42.190> to

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
then slide back or you guys can just to

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.270 
then slide back or you guys can just to
the<00:00:42.670> CPVC<00:00:43.360> barrels<00:00:43.989> but<00:00:44.710> we<00:00:44.890> didn't<00:00:45.129> had<00:00:45.250> any

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
the CPVC barrels but we didn't had any

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.799 
the CPVC barrels but we didn't had any
so<00:00:46.260> yeah<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:48.340> now<00:00:48.760> I'll<00:00:48.910> just<00:00:48.940> show<00:00:49.329> you<00:00:49.360> how

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
so yeah so now I'll just show you how

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.260 
so yeah so now I'll just show you how

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
the way it works like that we push the

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.469 
the way it works like that we push the
button<00:02:07.720> walk<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.950> dye<00:02:09.280> stain

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
button walk the the dye stain

now there's still another one here so I

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.920 
now there's still another one here so I
don't<00:02:32.110> go<00:02:32.500> all<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.799> way<00:02:32.830> but<00:02:33.690> sometimes<00:02:34.690> you

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
don't go all the way but sometimes you

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.360 
don't go all the way but sometimes you
can<00:02:35.110> put<00:02:35.290> up<00:02:35.319> to<00:02:36.269> three<00:02:37.269> darts<00:02:37.540> in<00:02:38.260> here<00:02:38.560> but<00:02:39.190> us

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
can put up to three darts in here but us

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.860 
can put up to three darts in here but us
we<00:02:39.519> can<00:02:39.670> only<00:02:39.819> put<00:02:40.090> two<00:02:40.120> because<00:02:40.569> there's<00:02:40.810> a

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
we can only put two because there's a

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.550 
we can only put two because there's a
little<00:02:41.110> bit<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.319> hot<00:02:41.620> glue<00:02:41.650> inside<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:44.410> yeah
