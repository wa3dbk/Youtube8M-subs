MMA<00:04:09.470> no<00:04:10.340> but<00:04:10.759> for<00:04:11.120> some<00:04:11.269> reason<00:04:11.569> I<00:04:11.659> have<00:04:11.840> a

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
MMA no but for some reason I have a

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.360 
MMA no but for some reason I have a
feeling<00:04:12.199> that<00:04:12.229> he<00:04:12.439> might<00:04:12.620> do<00:04:12.769> one<00:04:12.919> fight<00:04:13.159> just

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
feeling that he might do one fight just

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.029 
feeling that he might do one fight just
like<00:04:13.459> mateesah<00:04:13.970> if<00:04:14.720> he's<00:04:15.139> really<00:04:15.319> adamant<00:04:15.799> on

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
like mateesah if he's really adamant on

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.520 
like mateesah if he's really adamant on
doing<00:04:16.159> it<00:04:16.549> which<00:04:16.849> I<00:04:17.060> think<00:04:17.329> he<00:04:17.449> is<00:04:17.599> after

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
doing it which I think he is after

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.199

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
he seems like he just wants to try it

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.560 
he seems like he just wants to try it
out<00:04:21.889> just<00:04:22.400> one<00:04:22.550> time<00:04:22.729> win<00:04:23.060> or<00:04:23.090> lose<00:04:23.210> draw
