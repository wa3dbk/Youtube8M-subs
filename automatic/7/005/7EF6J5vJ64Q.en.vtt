together we've even had mothers and

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.580 
together we've even had mothers and
daughters<00:04:56.800> doing<00:04:57.280> it<00:04:57.400> together<00:04:57.750> and<00:04:58.750> I<00:04:59.380> think

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
daughters doing it together and I think

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.890 
daughters doing it together and I think
the<00:04:59.920> reason<00:05:00.220> is<00:05:00.310> because<00:05:00.490> it<00:05:00.940> is<00:05:00.970> perceived<00:05:01.660> to

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
the reason is because it is perceived to

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.930 
the reason is because it is perceived to
be<00:05:01.930> less<00:05:02.230> invasive<00:05:02.590> than<00:05:03.220> people<00:05:03.520> say<00:05:03.670> why

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
be less invasive than people say why

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.430 
be less invasive than people say why
don't<00:05:04.000> we<00:05:04.090> do<00:05:04.240> it<00:05:04.270> together<00:05:04.450> and<00:05:04.930> get<00:05:05.320> on

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
don't we do it together and get on

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.780 
don't we do it together and get on
together<00:05:05.830> and<00:05:06.040> see<00:05:06.220> how<00:05:06.250> we<00:05:06.370> both<00:05:06.580> look

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
together and see how we both look

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.250 
together and see how we both look
together<00:05:06.940> and<00:05:07.210> we'll<00:05:07.330> look<00:05:07.450> after<00:05:07.630> each<00:05:07.810> other

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
together and we'll look after each other

the laser surgery around the eyes the

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.870 
the laser surgery around the eyes the
main<00:05:51.170> advantage<00:05:51.650> of<00:05:51.770> using<00:05:51.830> the<00:05:52.370> laser<00:05:52.640> in

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
main advantage of using the laser in

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.700 
main advantage of using the laser in
this<00:05:53.030> area<00:05:53.450> is<00:05:53.600> that<00:05:53.630> whilst<00:05:54.020> we're<00:05:54.320> cutting

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
this area is that whilst we're cutting

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.440 
this area is that whilst we're cutting
the<00:05:54.800> skin<00:05:55.130> the<00:05:55.610> blood<00:05:55.850> vessels<00:05:56.270> will<00:05:56.420> be

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
the skin the blood vessels will be

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.870 
the skin the blood vessels will be
sealed<00:05:56.900> at<00:05:57.080> the<00:05:57.140> same<00:05:57.410> time<00:05:57.710> that'll<00:05:58.670> mean

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
sealed at the same time that'll mean

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.460 
sealed at the same time that'll mean
that<00:05:59.210> they'll<00:05:59.420> be<00:05:59.540> less<00:05:59.750> bruising<00:06:00.380> and

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
that they'll be less bruising and

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.050 
that they'll be less bruising and
swelling<00:06:00.680> for<00:06:01.070> the<00:06:01.160> patient<00:06:01.640> and<00:06:01.730> a<00:06:01.820> quicker

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
swelling for the patient and a quicker

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.120 
swelling for the patient and a quicker
recovery<00:06:02.350> we're<00:06:03.350> now<00:06:03.470> going<00:06:03.650> to<00:06:03.740> start<00:06:03.830> the

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
recovery we're now going to start the

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.730 
recovery we're now going to start the
resurfacing<00:06:04.520> of<00:06:05.000> Sandy's<00:06:05.420> face<00:06:05.740> we've

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
resurfacing of Sandy's face we've

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.260 
resurfacing of Sandy's face we've
attached<00:06:07.100> this<00:06:07.370> end<00:06:07.640> piece<00:06:07.910> that's<00:06:08.180> called

attached this end piece that's called

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.650 
attached this end piece that's called
the<00:06:08.600> computer<00:06:09.080> pattern<00:06:09.500> generator<00:06:10.480> this<00:06:11.480> is<00:06:11.540> a

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660 
the computer pattern generator this is a

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.010 
the computer pattern generator this is a
new<00:06:11.930> addition<00:06:12.530> and<00:06:12.710> it<00:06:13.550> is<00:06:14.270> generated<00:06:14.870> by<00:06:14.990> a

new addition and it is generated by a

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.350 
new addition and it is generated by a
computer<00:06:15.230> that<00:06:15.770> allows<00:06:16.070> us<00:06:16.280> to<00:06:16.460> print<00:06:16.730> out<00:06:17.030> a

hundred small pulses evenly on the skin

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.900 
hundred small pulses evenly on the skin
this<00:06:20.960> has<00:06:21.110> made<00:06:21.350> a<00:06:21.380> major<00:06:22.190> breakthrough<00:06:22.580> as

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:22.910 
this has made a major breakthrough as

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.060 
this has made a major breakthrough as
far<00:06:23.120> as<00:06:23.240> the<00:06:23.390> resurfacing<00:06:24.200> goes<00:06:24.470> because

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.070 
far as the resurfacing goes because

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.540 
far as the resurfacing goes because
we're<00:06:25.370> able<00:06:25.520> to<00:06:25.700> give<00:06:25.970> patients<00:06:26.330> a<00:06:26.660> consistent

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
we're able to give patients a consistent

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.250 
we're able to give patients a consistent
resurfacing<00:06:28.550> the<00:06:28.810> computer<00:06:29.810> basically

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
resurfacing the computer basically

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.420 
resurfacing the computer basically
decides<00:06:30.860> how<00:06:31.490> deep<00:06:32.240> we<00:06:32.390> want<00:06:32.570> to<00:06:32.660> go<00:06:32.810> and<00:06:33.430> we

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
decides how deep we want to go and we

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.610 
decides how deep we want to go and we
don't<00:06:34.580> have<00:06:34.790> to<00:06:34.970> trace<00:06:35.360> it<00:06:35.600> in<00:06:35.750> each<00:06:36.020> spot<00:06:36.380> one

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
don't have to trace it in each spot one

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.300 
don't have to trace it in each spot one
by<00:06:36.770> one
