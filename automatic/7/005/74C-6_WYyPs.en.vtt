helpful here's my 1979 ford f-150 now I
was<00:00:15.960> contemplating<00:00:16.320> on<00:00:16.920> whether<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.720> buy<00:00:18.720> a

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
was contemplating on whether to buy a

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.560 
was contemplating on whether to buy a
whole<00:00:19.020> new<00:00:19.050> truck<00:00:19.470> holding<00:00:20.039> shell<00:00:20.539> what<00:00:21.539> I

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
whole new truck holding shell what I

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.840 
whole new truck holding shell what I
figured<00:00:22.050> with<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.350> body<00:00:22.590> working<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
figured with the body working the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.310 
figured with the body working the
condition<00:00:24.300> it's<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:24.930> could<00:00:25.109> probably

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
condition it's in that I could probably

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.349 
condition it's in that I could probably
learn<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.650> lot<00:00:25.890> just<00:00:26.250> experimenting<00:00:27.240> and

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
learn a lot just experimenting and

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.089 
learn a lot just experimenting and
cutting<00:00:27.660> my<00:00:27.750> own<00:00:27.779> stuff<00:00:28.170> out<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.560> welding<00:00:28.920> and

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
cutting my own stuff out and welding and

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.550 
cutting my own stuff out and welding and
it's<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.849> lot<00:00:30.000> cheaper<00:00:30.060> i<00:00:30.510> think<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.990> by<00:00:31.109> parts

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
it's a lot cheaper i think the by parts

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.290 
it's a lot cheaper i think the by parts
and<00:00:31.740> just<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.009> make<00:00:32.189> my<00:00:32.369> own<00:00:32.399> stuff<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.210> just

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
and just to make my own stuff and just

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.530 
and just to make my own stuff and just
to<00:00:33.450> learn<00:00:33.660> those<00:00:34.140> up<00:00:34.940> let's<00:00:35.940> check<00:00:36.270> out<00:00:36.420> the
