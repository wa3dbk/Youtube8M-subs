we<00:01:38.660> have<00:01:39.200> been<00:01:39.290> started<00:01:39.560> I<00:01:39.770> knew<00:01:39.920> this<00:01:40.190> guy<00:01:40.370> was

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
we have been started I knew this guy was

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.970 
we have been started I knew this guy was
going<00:01:40.610> to<00:01:40.700> throw<00:01:40.820> some<00:01:41.180> insane<00:01:41.660> angles<00:01:42.110> so<00:01:42.350> I

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
going to throw some insane angles so I

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:57.130 
going to throw some insane angles so I
kind<00:01:43.760> of<00:01:43.820> anticipated<00:01:44.480> but

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.870 

it<00:01:58.140> was<00:01:58.320> able<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.800> mirror<00:01:58.980> me<00:01:59.160> pretty<00:01:59.370> well<00:01:59.400> and

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
it was able to mirror me pretty well and

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.620 
it was able to mirror me pretty well and
then<00:02:00.390> whenever<00:02:00.570> we<00:02:00.780> swap<00:02:01.050> places<00:02:01.230> and<00:02:01.860> he<00:02:02.370> led

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
then whenever we swap places and he led

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.700 
then whenever we swap places and he led
he<00:02:03.630> ended<00:02:03.750> up<00:02:03.900> going<00:02:04.080> really<00:02:04.260> wide<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.650> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
he ended up going really wide in the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.070 
he ended up going really wide in the
first<00:02:04.950> turn<00:02:05.190> I<00:02:05.550> took<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.240> really<00:02:06.570> wide<00:02:06.810> line

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
first turn I took the really wide line

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.219 
first turn I took the really wide line
from<00:02:07.290> outside<00:02:07.620> cooking<00:02:07.920> zone<00:02:08.100> 1<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.550> 2<00:02:08.729> and

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
from outside cooking zone 1 and 2 and

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.330 
from outside cooking zone 1 and 2 and
when<00:02:10.229> he<00:02:10.350> was<00:02:10.470> behind<00:02:10.619> me<00:02:10.950> he<00:02:11.100> didn't<00:02:11.250> really

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
when he was behind me he didn't really

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.920 
when he was behind me he didn't really
have<00:02:11.490> anywhere<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.880> go<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.060> he<00:02:12.450> pretty<00:02:12.810> much

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
have anywhere to go so he pretty much

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.260 
have anywhere to go so he pretty much
passed<00:02:13.620> me<00:02:13.950> on<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.160> first<00:02:14.700> clipping<00:02:15.090> point

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
passed me on the first clipping point

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.810 
passed me on the first clipping point
for<00:02:15.660> since<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:15.959> cooking<00:02:16.290> points

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.100 

I'm<00:02:20.820> assuming<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.390> judges<00:02:21.600> took<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.020> up

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
I'm assuming that the judges took it up

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.870 
I'm assuming that the judges took it up
an<00:02:22.230> illegal<00:02:22.530> pass<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.950> pretty<00:02:23.550> much<00:02:23.670> gave<00:02:23.820> me

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
an illegal pass and pretty much gave me

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:33.650 
an illegal pass and pretty much gave me
the<00:02:23.970> win

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.930 

and<00:02:33.990> I<00:02:34.320> decided<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:34.980> pass<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.430> was<00:02:35.550> kind<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.790> a

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
and I decided to pass it was kind of a

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.720 
and I decided to pass it was kind of a
spur<00:02:36.270> of<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.390> moment<00:02:36.540> move<00:02:36.890> he<00:02:37.890> left<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.250> little

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
spur of the moment move he left a little

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.550 
spur of the moment move he left a little
more<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.000> car<00:02:39.240> with<00:02:39.450> at<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.720> apex<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:40.410> just

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
more to car with at the apex and I just

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.310 
more to car with at the apex and I just
went<00:02:40.710> for<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.690> unfortunately<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.810> judges

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
went for it unfortunately the judges

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.590 
went for it unfortunately the judges
didn't<00:02:43.830> think<00:02:44.010> he<00:02:44.130> was<00:02:44.190> born<00:02:44.430> uh<00:02:44.550> offline<00:02:45.330> for
