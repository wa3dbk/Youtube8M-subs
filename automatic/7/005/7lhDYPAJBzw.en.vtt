00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
other here there's a tip really a pointy

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.670 
other here there's a tip really a pointy
pointy<00:00:24.119> tip<00:00:24.539> on<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.750> which<00:00:25.019> I'm<00:00:25.230> gonna<00:00:25.380> cut<00:00:25.650> off

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
pointy tip on it which I'm gonna cut off

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.640 
pointy tip on it which I'm gonna cut off
here<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.220> couple<00:00:26.430> seconds<00:00:27.529> because<00:00:28.529> that

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
makes it easier to make that the palm

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.650 
makes it easier to make that the palm
frond<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.399> goes<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.910> very<00:00:33.090> wide<00:00:33.360> end

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
frond and it goes to the very wide end

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.979 
frond and it goes to the very wide end
at<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> other<00:00:34.140> end<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:35.450> first<00:00:36.450> thing<00:00:36.630> we'll<00:00:36.780> do

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
nice and clean and what you do is you go

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.130 
nice and clean and what you do is you go
about<00:01:07.049> two-thirds<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.040> way<00:01:08.100> down<00:01:09.140> so

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
about two-thirds of the way down so

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.710 
about two-thirds of the way down so
that's<00:01:10.290> two<00:01:10.560> thirds<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:12.270> know<00:01:12.360> from<00:01:12.570> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
that's two thirds of you know from the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.550 
that's two thirds of you know from the
tip<00:01:12.960> torso<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.010> then<00:01:15.000> what<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.540> do<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:16.229> you

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
tip torso and then what you do is you

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.859 
tip torso and then what you do is you
take<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.430> take<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.909> palm<00:01:21.119> frond<00:01:21.540> and

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
take the take the the the palm frond and

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.219 
take the take the the the palm frond and
you<00:01:22.860> turn<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.720> 90<00:01:24.720> degrees<00:01:25.610> upwards<00:01:26.990> so<00:01:27.990> like

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
you turn it 90 degrees upwards so like

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.870 
you turn it 90 degrees upwards so like
it's<00:01:28.470> thick<00:01:29.250> like<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:31.250> so<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.400> looks<00:01:32.640> like<00:01:32.729> a

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
it's thick like this so it looks like a

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.469 
it's thick like this so it looks like a
right<00:01:33.299> angle<00:01:33.780> there<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.820> then<00:01:35.820> what<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.240> do

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
right angle there and then what you do

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.249 
right angle there and then what you do
is<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.960> bend<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.500> top<00:01:37.799> over<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:42.079> make<00:01:43.079> it

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
is you bend the top over and make it

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.289 
is you bend the top over and make it
like<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:45.560> so<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:46.799> it's<00:01:47.280> basically<00:01:47.880> you're

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
like that so it's it's basically you're

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.289 
like that so it's it's basically you're
just<00:01:48.810> bending<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.229> over<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.619> top<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.340> then

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
just bending it over the top and then

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.550 
just bending it over the top and then
what<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.750> next<00:01:52.049> step<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:53.780> take<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.079> palm

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
what the next step is to take the palm

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.740 
what the next step is to take the palm
frond<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.460> Bend<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:58.229> way<00:01:58.579> and<00:01:59.750> we're

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
frond and Bend that this way and we're

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.600 
frond and Bend that this way and we're
all<00:02:00.840> still<00:02:01.110> on<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.409> same<00:02:01.619> orientation<00:02:01.860> as<00:02:02.460> we

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
all still on the same orientation as we

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.740 
all still on the same orientation as we
were<00:02:02.790> before<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:04.969> so<00:02:05.969> now<00:02:06.119> that's<00:02:06.329> that's

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
were before and so now that's that's

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.589 
were before and so now that's that's
where<00:02:07.049> we<00:02:07.170> are<00:02:07.740> right<00:02:07.979> now<00:02:08.090> we've<00:02:09.090> wrapped<00:02:09.360> it

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
where we are right now we've wrapped it

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.110 
where we are right now we've wrapped it
around<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:10.170> now<00:02:10.530> what<00:02:10.800> we<00:02:10.920> do<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.280> we<00:02:11.459> take

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
around that now what we do is we take

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.630 
around that now what we do is we take
the<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.690> pointed<00:02:16.200> end<00:02:16.440> which<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.340> over

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
the the the pointed end which is over

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.780 
the the the pointed end which is over
here<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:19.230> what<00:02:20.220> we<00:02:20.370> do<00:02:20.550> is<00:02:20.760> we<00:02:20.910> put<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.330> in<00:02:22.790> see

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.830 
the the the palm frond and take the
pointed<00:02:40.860> end<00:02:41.100> if<00:02:41.670> I<00:02:41.850> can<00:02:42.000> get<00:02:42.210> it<00:02:42.360> here

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
pointed end if I can get it here

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:51.950 
pointed end if I can get it here
and<00:02:45.590> put<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.620> in<00:02:47.250> here<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:51.060> try<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.660> put<00:02:51.930> it

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
and put that in here and try to put it

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.720 
and put that in here and try to put it
at<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.260> top<00:02:52.880> top<00:02:53.880> of<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.360> atom<00:02:55.430> see<00:02:56.430> so<00:02:56.610> it

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
at the top top of the atom see so it

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.870 
at the top top of the atom see so it
comes<00:02:56.940> out<00:02:57.120> like<00:02:57.180> here<00:02:58.280> so<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.340> comes<00:02:59.520> out<00:02:59.700> on

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
comes out like here so it comes out on

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.800 
comes out like here so it comes out on
the<00:03:00.030> top<00:03:00.320> and<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:02.760> can<00:03:02.820> see<00:03:03.210> your<00:03:03.420> Alex

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
the top and you can see your Alex

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.380 
the top and you can see your Alex
creating<00:03:04.350> like<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.530> circle<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:06.060> kind<00:03:06.300> of

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
creating like a circle and you kind of

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.800 
creating like a circle and you kind of
pull<00:03:06.600> it<00:03:06.780> through<00:03:07.110> until<00:03:08.630> it

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
pull it through until it

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.580 
pull it through until it
I<00:03:09.840> call<00:03:10.410> it<00:03:10.530> locks<00:03:10.970> it<00:03:11.970> creates<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:13.020> nice

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
I call it locks it creates a a nice

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.930 
I call it locks it creates a a nice
little<00:03:13.830> square<00:03:14.400> of<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:18.680> palm<00:03:19.680> frond<00:03:19.950> there<00:03:20.370> and

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
little square of a palm frond there and

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.060 
little square of a palm frond there and
now<00:03:21.360> what<00:03:21.630> we're<00:03:21.870> gonna<00:03:21.960> do<00:03:22.290> is<00:03:22.650> we're<00:03:22.950> gonna

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
now what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.380 
now what we're gonna do is we're gonna
take<00:03:23.630> this<00:03:24.630> this<00:03:25.140> this<00:03:25.500> part<00:03:25.830> here<00:03:26.490> which<00:03:27.180> is

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
take this this this part here which is

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.410 
take this this this part here which is
the<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:28.590> shorter<00:03:29.070> part<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.880> this<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:30.180> where

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
the the shorter part and this is where

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.780 
the the shorter part and this is where
you<00:03:30.510> have<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:31.020> kind<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:31.800> it's<00:03:32.730> basically<00:03:33.300> some

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
you have to kind of it's basically some

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.730 
you have to kind of it's basically some
some<00:03:35.790> practice<00:03:36.360> in<00:03:36.570> terms<00:03:36.840> of<00:03:37.080> whether<00:03:37.530> you

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
some practice in terms of whether you

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.190 
some practice in terms of whether you
how<00:03:38.490> far<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:38.880> go<00:03:39.060> down<00:03:39.270> the<00:03:39.510> palm<00:03:39.720> frond<00:03:40.080> that

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
how far you go down the palm frond that

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.010 
how far you go down the palm frond that
depends<00:03:40.770> how<00:03:40.890> big<00:03:41.280> these<00:03:41.550> sides<00:03:42.510> beside

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
depends how big these sides beside

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.230 
depends how big these sides beside
pieces<00:03:43.590> or<00:03:43.740> horizontal<00:03:44.310> pieces<00:03:44.520> are<00:03:44.760> gonna<00:03:44.910> be

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
pieces or horizontal pieces are gonna be

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.900 
pieces or horizontal pieces are gonna be
but<00:03:45.900> you<00:03:45.990> take<00:03:46.200> it<00:03:46.260> first<00:03:46.650> of<00:03:46.860> all<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.490> push<00:03:47.700> it

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
but you take it first of all and push it

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.540 
but you take it first of all and push it
in<00:03:48.950> this<00:03:49.950> end<00:03:50.510> in<00:03:51.590> through<00:03:52.590> this<00:03:52.740> hole<00:03:53.040> cuz

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
in this end in through this hole cuz

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.190 
in this end in through this hole cuz
this<00:03:53.640> is<00:03:54.060> like<00:03:54.270> a<00:03:54.300> hole<00:03:54.570> that<00:03:54.750> goes<00:03:54.780> all<00:03:55.170> the

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
this is like a hole that goes all the

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.820 
this is like a hole that goes all the
way<00:03:55.320> through<00:03:55.680> here<00:03:55.950> see<00:03:56.510> and<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:58.140> can<00:03:58.410> push<00:03:58.620> it

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
way through here see and you can push it

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.110 
way through here see and you can push it
through<00:03:59.160> here<00:04:01.250> and<00:04:02.250> this<00:04:02.400> is<00:04:02.580> that<00:04:02.730> looks<00:04:02.970> like

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
through here and this is that looks like

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.400 
through here and this is that looks like
this<00:04:03.300> is<00:04:03.450> probably<00:04:03.630> gonna<00:04:03.900> be<00:04:03.990> a<00:04:04.110> short

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
this is probably gonna be a short

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.810 
this is probably gonna be a short
shorter<00:04:05.250> one

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:15.650 

and

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.800 
here and then pull it through till you
get<00:05:33.810> a<00:05:34.850> relatively<00:05:35.930> symmetrical<00:05:36.930> cross<00:05:38.810> and

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
get a relatively symmetrical cross and

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.990 
get a relatively symmetrical cross and
that<00:05:40.620> looks<00:05:40.860> pretty<00:05:40.950> symmetrical<00:05:41.790> there

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
that looks pretty symmetrical there

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:54.490 
that looks pretty symmetrical there
right<00:05:42.240> right<00:05:42.750> now<00:05:49.130> we<00:05:50.130> got<00:05:50.370> a<00:05:50.400> focus<00:05:50.850> there<00:05:51.150> and

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.880 

there<00:05:56.330> then<00:05:57.330> we're<00:05:57.570> basically<00:05:57.780> done<00:05:58.410> except

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
there then we're basically done except

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.830 
there then we're basically done except
this<00:05:59.070> piece<00:05:59.310> is<00:05:59.550> really<00:05:59.730> long<00:06:00.060> here<00:06:00.420> down<00:06:00.690> at
