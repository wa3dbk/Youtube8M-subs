00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
development for obito where he finally

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.219 
development for obito where he finally
got<00:01:53.009> pushed<00:01:53.310> beyond<00:01:54.119> all<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.600> bullshit<00:01:55.079> and

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
got pushed beyond all this bullshit and

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.749 
got pushed beyond all this bullshit and
finally<00:01:55.560> saw<00:01:55.740> modeler<00:01:56.280> for<00:01:56.520> what<00:01:56.640> he<00:01:56.729> really

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
finally saw modeler for what he really

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
is and everything that he stood for for

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.280 
is and everything that he stood for for
what<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.430> really<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.630> sense<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:01.079> was

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
what it really is so in a sense this was

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.719 
what it really is so in a sense this was
mainly<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.920> guess<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.399> could<00:02:02.430> say<00:02:02.700> a

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
mainly I guess you could say a

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.300 
mainly I guess you could say a
character-driven<00:02:03.390> chapter<00:02:04.079> for<00:02:04.320> obito<00:02:04.590> but

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
aside from that you can't deny that this

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.660 
aside from that you can't deny that this
chapter<00:02:07.409> almost<00:02:07.829> felt<00:02:08.039> as<00:02:08.160> though<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.550> was

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670

not gonna happen like that so in order

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.220 
not gonna happen like that so in order
for<00:05:24.240> anything<00:05:24.540> to<00:05:24.720> make<00:05:24.840> sense<00:05:25.050> i<00:05:25.200> mean

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
for anything to make sense i mean

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.230 
for anything to make sense i mean
they're<00:05:25.650> not<00:05:25.800> gonna<00:05:25.920> put<00:05:26.160> him<00:05:26.250> in<00:05:26.340> a<00:05:26.400> prison<00:05:26.670> he

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
they're not gonna put him in a prison he

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.700 
they're not gonna put him in a prison he
could<00:05:27.390> just<00:05:27.570> keep<00:05:27.720> on<00:05:27.870> teleporting<00:05:28.410> out<00:05:28.560> of

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
could just keep on teleporting out of

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.950 
could just keep on teleporting out of
there<00:05:28.860> he<00:05:29.310> has<00:05:29.550> to<00:05:29.850> die<00:05:30.060> in<00:05:30.120> this<00:05:30.390> battle<00:05:30.630> in

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
there he has to die in this battle in

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.110 
there he has to die in this battle in
order<00:05:31.500> for<00:05:31.740> there<00:05:32.130> to<00:05:32.160> be<00:05:32.310> any<00:05:32.580> sort<00:05:33.030> of

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
order for there to be any sort of

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.700 
order for there to be any sort of
resolution<00:05:33.540> for<00:05:33.960> the<00:05:34.020> character<00:05:34.440> because

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
resolution for the character because

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.020 
resolution for the character because
that<00:05:35.010> would<00:05:35.130> make<00:05:35.280> sense<00:05:35.310> for<00:05:35.610> that<00:05:35.820> matter

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
that would make sense for that matter

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.430 
that would make sense for that matter
because<00:05:36.390> you<00:05:36.780> can't<00:05:36.990> put<00:05:37.140> him<00:05:37.230> in<00:05:37.320> prison

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
because you can't put him in prison

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.320 
because you can't put him in prison
because<00:05:37.680> you<00:05:37.830> can<00:05:37.950> just<00:05:37.980> warp<00:05:38.310> out<00:05:38.490> you<00:05:39.030> can't

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
because you can just warp out you can't

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.510 
because you can just warp out you can't
necessarily<00:05:39.990> have<00:05:40.560> him<00:05:40.740> come<00:05:40.950> 20<00:05:41.250> buildings

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
necessarily have him come 20 buildings

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.280 
necessarily have him come 20 buildings
and<00:05:41.730> say<00:05:41.850> yeah<00:05:42.030> man<00:05:42.300> he's<00:05:42.510> totally<00:05:42.870> a<00:05:42.900> good<00:05:43.140> guy

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
and say yeah man he's totally a good guy

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.020 
and say yeah man he's totally a good guy
now<00:05:43.500> after<00:05:44.010> everything<00:05:44.070> is<00:05:44.400> done<00:05:44.460> that<00:05:44.820> that's

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
now after everything is done that that's

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.210 
now after everything is done that that's
that<00:05:45.270> would<00:05:45.540> just<00:05:45.720> be<00:05:45.750> like<00:05:45.870> absolutely<00:05:46.530> my

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
that would just be like absolutely my

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.950 
that would just be like absolutely my
fuckery<00:05:47.730> like<00:05:47.910> yeah<00:05:48.120> you<00:05:48.419> committed<00:05:48.840> all

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
fuckery like yeah you committed all

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.900 
fuckery like yeah you committed all
these<00:05:49.140> atrocities<00:05:49.470> but<00:05:50.010> we're<00:05:50.370> gonna<00:05:50.490> forgive

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910

these atrocities but we're gonna forgive
you<00:05:51.120> bro<00:05:51.419> so<00:05:52.020> he<00:05:52.290> has<00:05:52.500> to<00:05:52.710> die<00:05:52.860> and<00:05:52.919> I<00:05:53.100> think

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
you bro so he has to die and I think

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.170 
you bro so he has to die and I think
right<00:05:53.460> now<00:05:53.610> will<00:05:53.760> be<00:05:53.850> the<00:05:53.970> perfect

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
right now will be the perfect

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.240 
right now will be the perfect
opportunity<00:05:54.419> even<00:05:55.020> though<00:05:55.320> necessarily<00:05:55.740> it's

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
opportunity even though necessarily it's

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.580 
opportunity even though necessarily it's
kinda<00:05:56.400> like<00:05:56.460> okay<00:05:56.730> finally<00:05:57.150> the<00:05:57.210> character

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
kinda like okay finally the character

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.020 
kinda like okay finally the character
pick<00:05:58.590> the<00:05:58.740> result<00:05:59.130> and<00:05:59.310> hopefully<00:05:59.669> he<00:05:59.760> sticks

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
pick the result and hopefully he sticks

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.000 
pick the result and hopefully he sticks
with<00:06:00.090> it<00:06:00.210> this<00:06:00.360> time<00:06:00.440> it's<00:06:01.440> time<00:06:01.680> from<00:06:01.890> the

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
with it this time it's time from the

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.800 
with it this time it's time from the
glass<00:06:02.220> feel<00:06:02.430> as<00:06:02.520> though<00:06:02.669> this<00:06:02.850> point<00:06:03.210> was

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
glass feel as though this point was

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.470 
glass feel as though this point was
reached<00:06:03.840> so<00:06:04.680> that<00:06:04.919> okay<00:06:05.280> he<00:06:05.790> finally<00:06:06.090> had<00:06:06.360> his

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:06.480 
reached so that okay he finally had his

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.720 
reached so that okay he finally had his
cross<00:06:06.780> over<00:06:07.140> from<00:06:07.290> bad<00:06:07.500> guy<00:06:07.680> a<00:06:07.710> good<00:06:07.950> guy<00:06:08.010> this

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:08.730 
cross over from bad guy a good guy this

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.670 
cross over from bad guy a good guy this
is<00:06:08.880> what<00:06:09.030> he<00:06:09.090> picked<00:06:09.390> now<00:06:09.990> maybe<00:06:10.290> he<00:06:10.530> can

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
is what he picked now maybe he can

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.100 
is what he picked now maybe he can
finally<00:06:10.950> die<00:06:11.310> with<00:06:11.880> proper<00:06:12.390> I<00:06:12.570> guess

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
finally die with proper I guess

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.500 
finally die with proper I guess
resolution<00:06:13.680> proper<00:06:14.040> conclusion<00:06:14.669> to<00:06:15.390> the

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510 
resolution proper conclusion to the

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.360
