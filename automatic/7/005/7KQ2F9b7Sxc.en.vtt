in one of these little balls I can grab

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.810 
in one of these little balls I can grab
it<00:03:50.630> they're<00:03:51.630> circular<00:03:52.110> than<00:03:53.870> go<00:03:55.610> just<00:03:56.610> pop

it they're circular than go just pop
that<00:03:56.850> right<00:03:57.090> in<00:03:57.510> there<00:03:58.489> looping<00:03:59.489> like<00:03:59.730> I<00:03:59.880> said

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
that right in there looping like I said

that right in there looping like I said
one<00:04:00.330> of<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.480> antennae<00:04:00.840> do<00:04:01.050> fall<00:04:01.260> out<00:04:01.470> so<00:04:01.650> there

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
one of the antennae do fall out so there

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.460 
one of the antennae do fall out so there
it<00:04:02.340> goes<00:04:02.489> it<00:04:02.760> fits<00:04:03.000> nice<00:04:03.300> and<00:04:03.330> snug<00:04:03.570> so<00:04:04.140> it's

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
it goes it fits nice and snug so it's

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.400 
it goes it fits nice and snug so it's
kind<00:04:04.650> of<00:04:04.680> like<00:04:04.800> a<00:04:04.860> matrix<00:04:05.519> of<00:04:05.640> leadership<00:04:05.760> and

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
kind of like a matrix of leadership and

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.190 
kind of like a matrix of leadership and
man<00:04:07.410> I<00:04:07.680> tell<00:04:08.040> you<00:04:08.130> what<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:08.640> can't<00:04:09.300> go<00:04:09.510> about<00:04:09.840> too

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
man I tell you what I can't go about too

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.570 
man I tell you what I can't go about too
much<00:04:10.380> about<00:04:10.620> that<00:04:10.860> and<00:04:11.100> like<00:04:11.430> I<00:04:11.519> mentioned

much about that and like I mentioned

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.420 
much about that and like I mentioned
before<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:12.720> antenna<00:04:13.049> do<00:04:13.410> pop<00:04:13.769> off<00:04:14.010> so<00:04:14.220> you<00:04:14.310> got

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
before the antenna do pop off so you got

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.699 
before the antenna do pop off so you got
to<00:04:14.549> be<00:04:14.640> careful<00:04:15.030> with<00:04:15.150> that<00:04:15.440> alright<00:04:16.440> let's<00:04:16.470> go

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
to be careful with that alright let's go

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.580 
to be careful with that alright let's go
for<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.040> articulation<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:17.910> head<00:04:18.810> seems<00:04:19.380> to

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
for the articulation the head seems to

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.020 
for the articulation the head seems to
be<00:04:19.739> on<00:04:19.859> a<00:04:19.890> ball<00:04:20.160> joint<00:04:20.340> but<00:04:20.489> doesn't<00:04:20.880> move<00:04:21.000> too

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
be on a ball joint but doesn't move too

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.610 
be on a ball joint but doesn't move too
much<00:04:21.330> and<00:04:21.510> as<00:04:21.570> you<00:04:21.690> can<00:04:21.840> see<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.200> neck<00:04:22.380> does

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
much and as you can see the neck does

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.770 
much and as you can see the neck does
crane<00:04:22.919> a<00:04:22.950> little<00:04:23.280> bit<00:04:23.430> shoulder<00:04:24.300> is<00:04:24.450> on<00:04:24.720> a

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
crane a little bit shoulder is on a

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.180 
crane a little bit shoulder is on a
ball-joint

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
ball-joint

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.740 
ball-joint
and<00:04:27.400> here's<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:27.910> thing<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:28.180> don't<00:04:28.240> like<00:04:28.390> is

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
and here's the thing I don't like is

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.570 
and here's the thing I don't like is
that<00:04:28.780> man<00:04:29.260> the<00:04:29.380> joints<00:04:29.680> do<00:04:29.800> pop<00:04:30.010> off<00:04:30.220> even

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
that man the joints do pop off even

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.820 
that man the joints do pop off even
though<00:04:30.670> they're<00:04:30.850> all<00:04:30.970> are<00:04:31.540> jointed<00:04:32.110> double

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
though they're all are jointed double

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.520 
though they're all are jointed double
jointed<00:04:33.250> elbow<00:04:33.670> no<00:04:34.300> biceps<00:04:34.870> will<00:04:35.110> which<00:04:35.350> is<00:04:35.380> a

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
jointed elbow no biceps will which is a

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.460 
jointed elbow no biceps will which is a
downer<00:04:35.860> and<00:04:36.730> I<00:04:36.910> guess<00:04:37.150> hey<00:04:37.540> you<00:04:37.930> can't<00:04:38.170> have<00:04:38.350> it

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
downer and I guess hey you can't have it

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.660 
downer and I guess hey you can't have it
all<00:04:38.590> you<00:04:39.160> got<00:04:39.280> a<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:39.820> ab<00:04:40.210> crunch<00:04:40.750> as<00:04:41.530> well<00:04:42.130> as<00:04:42.310> a

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
all you got a and ab crunch as well as a

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.300 
all you got a and ab crunch as well as a
waist<00:04:43.090> swivel<00:04:43.360> so<00:04:43.690> you<00:04:43.750> got<00:04:43.990> you<00:04:44.800> got<00:04:44.980> pretty

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
waist swivel so you got you got pretty

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.940 
waist swivel so you got you got pretty
much<00:04:45.520> that<00:04:45.820> pretty<00:04:46.720> good<00:04:46.900> articulation<00:04:47.350> there

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
much that pretty good articulation there

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.780 
much that pretty good articulation there
and<00:04:48.790> at<00:04:48.910> the<00:04:49.060> upper<00:04:49.210> torso<00:04:49.570> a<00:04:50.370> ball<00:04:51.370> jointed

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
and at the upper torso a ball jointed

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.640 
and at the upper torso a ball jointed
hip<00:04:52.060> but<00:04:52.300> man<00:04:52.570> it<00:04:52.810> is<00:04:52.960> stiff<00:04:53.230> and<00:04:53.440> you<00:04:53.500> can

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
hip but man it is stiff and you can

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.580 
hip but man it is stiff and you can
barely<00:04:54.310> move<00:04:54.550> it<00:04:54.790> double<00:04:55.540> jointed<00:04:56.050> knee<00:04:56.320> but

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
barely move it double jointed knee but

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.900 
barely move it double jointed knee but
then<00:04:56.770> again<00:04:57.070> it<00:04:57.820> doesn't<00:04:58.210> Bend<00:04:58.390> too<00:04:58.690> far<00:04:59.910> it's

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
then again it doesn't Bend too far it's

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.300 
then again it doesn't Bend too far it's
not<00:05:01.090> bad<00:05:01.360> for<00:05:01.720> a<00:05:01.930> stiffer<00:05:02.590> so<00:05:02.770> these<00:05:02.860> joints

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
not bad for a stiffer so these joints

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.100 
not bad for a stiffer so these joints
are<00:05:03.430> as<00:05:03.580> you<00:05:03.700> can<00:05:03.820> see<00:05:03.970> the<00:05:04.090> patella<00:05:04.420> it<00:05:04.750> is

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
are as you can see the patella it is

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.900 
are as you can see the patella it is
double<00:05:05.530> jointed<00:05:05.920> ball<00:05:06.550> jointed<00:05:07.350> ball<00:05:08.350> jointed

double jointed ball jointed ball jointed

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.150 
double jointed ball jointed ball jointed
ankle<00:05:09.910> and<00:05:10.060> that's<00:05:10.450> it<00:05:10.720> I<00:05:10.750> wish<00:05:10.990> it<00:05:11.140> had<00:05:11.350> told

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
ankle and that's it I wish it had told

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.060 
ankle and that's it I wish it had told
Filat<00:05:12.580> or<00:05:12.730> toe<00:05:12.940> total<00:05:13.930> articulation<00:05:14.650> but<00:05:14.800> not

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
Filat or toe total articulation but not

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.550 
Filat or toe total articulation but not
not<00:05:15.280> to<00:05:15.490> pass<00:05:15.700> and<00:05:15.970> as<00:05:16.540> as<00:05:16.690> such<00:05:16.930> because<00:05:17.410> of

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
not to pass and as as such because of

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.880 
not to pass and as as such because of
its<00:05:17.770> articulation<00:05:18.610> it<00:05:19.080> it's<00:05:20.080> basically<00:05:20.320> like

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
its articulation it it's basically like

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.760 
its articulation it it's basically like
a<00:05:20.950> hybrid<00:05:21.310> between<00:05:21.550> a<00:05:21.940> PVC<00:05:22.480> figure<00:05:23.050> and<00:05:24.510> an

a hybrid between a PVC figure and an
action<00:05:26.770> figure<00:05:27.010> now<00:05:27.430> as<00:05:27.700> I<00:05:27.970> mentioned<00:05:28.420> for<00:05:28.540> art

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
action figure now as I mentioned for art

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.860 
action figure now as I mentioned for art
size<00:05:29.530> there<00:05:30.220> he<00:05:30.370> is<00:05:30.400> against<00:05:31.060> Megatron<00:05:31.540> there

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
size there he is against Megatron there

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.520 
size there he is against Megatron there
about<00:05:32.740> he's<00:05:33.430> about<00:05:33.640> seven<00:05:34.240> inches<00:05:34.510> tall<00:05:34.570> I'm

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
about he's about seven inches tall I'm

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.020 
about he's about seven inches tall I'm
not<00:05:35.650> a<00:05:35.680> bad<00:05:35.920> looking<00:05:36.250> figure<00:05:36.550> for<00:05:36.760> what<00:05:36.910> you

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030
