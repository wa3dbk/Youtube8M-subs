you're wanting to watch 3d blu-ray discs
however<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.759> player<00:01:36.150> does<00:01:36.450> support<00:01:36.900> full

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
however the player does support full

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.020 
however the player does support full
onboard<00:01:37.710> decoding<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.340> all<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.729> audio

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
onboard decoding of all of the audio

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.569 
onboard decoding of all of the audio
formats<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:40.380> we<00:01:40.799> actually<00:01:40.950> have<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.430> back

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
formats so we actually have on the back

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.410

here<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:42.119> full<00:01:43.070> 7.1<00:01:44.070> multi-channel<00:01:44.939> analog

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
here a full 7.1 multi-channel analog

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.300 
here a full 7.1 multi-channel analog
output<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.439> player<00:01:46.649> will<00:01:46.799> perform<00:01:47.040> full

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
output so the player will perform full

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.999 
output so the player will perform full
onboard<00:01:47.700> decoding<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.329> output<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.200> into<00:01:49.799> an

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
onboard decoding and output this into an

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.670 
onboard decoding and output this into an

and<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:53.490> addition<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.149> we've<00:01:54.360> actually

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
and in addition to that we've actually

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.590 
and in addition to that we've actually
got<00:01:54.810> twin<00:01:55.200> HDMI<00:01:56.040> outputs<00:01:56.729> which<00:01:57.329> can<00:01:57.360> be
