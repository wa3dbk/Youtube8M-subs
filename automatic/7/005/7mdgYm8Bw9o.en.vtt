 differentiated in the channel galera it goes 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.250
 continue depending on the acceptance of 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.580
 You're good or bad, but I was. 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.560

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.020

 car is on everybody has your 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.289
 around what differentiates this car 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.640
 super is because there are few then all 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.160
 The world has the same 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.410
 what differentiates one from the other 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.899
 Paint, people, I fucking said that. 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.750
 make a video by not making them surroundings 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.430
 but painting it so I want to do 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.379
 This way I know about two or three 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.809
 paintings video and I know that I will bring 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.180
 two paintings and if you like this 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.309
 video here, I keep bringing it there 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.289
 week and such and discovering and paintings 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.780
 new beauty so I'm bringing 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.300
 two paintings in this video here for you 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.640
 one is the darkened gold and the other is the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.010
 midnight diamond then first I 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.910
 I will show the darkened beauty gold 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.920
 maneuver resisting and leave entered 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.479
 here in your speeches, it's easy, I'll go 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.900
 write also in the description left 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.360
 written as I said or based on 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.610
 The school is for you to put 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.850
 you can modify and such but bringing 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.040
 here's the right one in my opinion 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.380
 then bora darkened the following must 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.970
 here in correct paint and color 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.040
 principal as principal you have to 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.049
 always put metal because half that 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.060
 You'll have it there then, the only one that 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.439
 it made the metal pearl 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.150
 the bid is you always make a 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.430
 transition between colors then you do not 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.590
 can put a color and try to fit 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.060
 another to be very dissenting so all 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.880
 It'll be cool, then you have to 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.040
 always do not let a tuning 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.290
 between the color you will put the color 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.820
 Pearly anyway let's go there to do 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.939
 the unknown you have to choose 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.520
 here as carbon black 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.380
 pimba put the carbon black you go 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.140
 falling down the side by the side you have to 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.829
 Go and in the yellow area, let's go to 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.140
 yellow chair yellow yellow yellow 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.149
 you can see that they have the 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.920
 colors so love is normal 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.259
 the race yellow became yellow more 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.150
 clear and today serves no urban yellow 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.780
 So you choose when I'm going to paint. 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.959
 among the yellow running 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.850
 normal yellow I prefer not yellow 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.280
 normal I think he looks like this gold 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.319
 more known and more legal, but if 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.440
 Do you want to put the yellow 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:29.170
 the yellow occurred is on its own 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.630
 and the secondary color cap you put a 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.000
 black carbon also in the metallic for not 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.340
 make no one leave it cute but 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.950
 I'm talking about staying way 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.500
 carbon and that's how the wheel is 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.780
 making the darkened I think more game 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.880
 leave her black she's already black then 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.550
 I'd rather leave it and the smoke too 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.330
 black because the shades of yellow smoke 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.040
 orange 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.900
 We are different so we'd better leave the 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.440
 so let's see what it's like out here 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:00.220
 it was just very cool look if the 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:09.940
 unknown here i 'll tell you the sun 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:11.019
 the lawyer him without the back darkened 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.610
 in the block 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.610
 You're looking at it. 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.510
 That's right, I really liked this thing. 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.210
 here I'm almost going to paint a car in the air with 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.540
 by her darkened and although from the 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:33.700
 next is the midnight diamond 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.860
 I'm not leaving, take a peek, it's 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.380
 this really cool then teams not 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.520
 could before midnight I need the 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.190
 comments from you guys gal 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.710
 approving or not in this type of video 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.230
 bringing here of painting 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.150
 Let's go change pro half diamond here 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.190
 night as principal you have to 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.210
 Metallica, like I said it's meant to be. 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.330
 by after 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.950
 There you go and look for the blue area there. 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.420
 You 're going to wear blue at midnight. Let's go. 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.880
 there pro midnight blue and blue 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.040
 blue here in the dark beauty pa 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.810
 placed there you go in the turkey side area 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.400
 in the turkey side area you have to go in the 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.470
 blue diamond 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.270
 up here and come already gave a touch 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.120
 right above Strasse 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.510
 then it's soft you leave it on the graphite 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.980
 huh 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.630
 I do not remember if the other thing was 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.970
 Graphite I think so I think 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.430
 graphite yes but anyway you 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.669
 comes here in the county one of the area only for 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.860
 show is a metallic right did not walk 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.240
 by car you come to graphite you 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.320
 make a transition if you vote in the lawsuit 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.360
 carbon 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.340
 When he gets back there, he gets 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.380
 too dark your graphite vote and 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.450
 that is still going on and that the 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.050
 this is what gives the stop on the side of 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.210
 out 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.640
 I recommend leaving black again 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.770
 in the wheel and also the dark smoke because 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.720
 the smoke is already very clear will not do 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.240
 the transition to the right tuning 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.730
 left the black smoke and left the wheel 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.190
 black was calm and this one was the 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.350
 second color I brought in the video and 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.020
 last is this will only have two colors 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.000
 to see if they will like it and that 's it 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.760
 let's show that this half diamond 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.750
 night and it 's too fucking awesome 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.800
 This season, right? 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.330
 the pac is a black password our black 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.740
 difficult it is more difficult to leave than 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.840
 others 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.560
 I think this postponement of the night 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.560
 very cool 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.820
 you thought his comments out this 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.260
 kind of video making painting is that there 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.940

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.500
