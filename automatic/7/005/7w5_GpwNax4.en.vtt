00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
really a bad thing

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.249 
really a bad thing
and<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.240> lot<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.420> people<00:01:30.659> like<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.930> come<00:01:31.079> down<00:01:31.229> on

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259

and a lot of people like to come down on
these<00:01:31.470> things<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:33.420> by<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.869> mean<00:01:34.079> the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
these things and by that I mean the

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.080 
these things and by that I mean the
robots<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.560> disguise<00:01:34.590> editions<00:01:35.250> but<00:01:35.430> again

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
robots in disguise editions but again

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.280 
robots in disguise editions but again
bumblebee<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.630> one<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.840> those<00:01:36.930> ones<00:01:37.170> that

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
bumblebee is one of those ones that

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.670 
bumblebee is one of those ones that
again<00:01:37.890> he<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.340> much<00:01:38.579> more<00:01:38.880> simple<00:01:39.750> than<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
again he is much more simple than the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.350 
again he is much more simple than the
first<00:01:40.710> edition<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.430> think<00:01:41.729> he's<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> little<00:01:42.180> less

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
first edition I think he's a little less

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.910 
first edition I think he's a little less
screen<00:01:42.689> he's<00:01:43.170> definitely<00:01:43.380> less<00:01:43.649> screen

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
screen he's definitely less screen

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.700 
screen he's definitely less screen
accurate<00:01:44.130> than<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.060> first<00:01:45.299> edition<00:01:45.720> I'll<00:01:46.439> put

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
accurate than the first edition I'll put

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.679 
accurate than the first edition I'll put
that<00:01:46.799> out<00:01:46.950> there<00:01:46.979> but<00:01:47.340> as<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.490> toy<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:48.030> think<00:01:48.600> he's

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
that out there but as a toy I think he's

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.499 
that out there but as a toy I think he's
a<00:01:48.750> lot<00:01:48.930> more<00:01:49.079> fun<00:01:49.820> and<00:01:50.820> will<00:01:51.180> get<00:01:51.299> into<00:01:51.479> that

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
a lot more fun and will get into that

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.569 
a lot more fun and will get into that
you<00:01:51.750> know<00:01:51.869> same<00:01:52.049> with<00:01:52.200> Cliffjumper<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:53.460> all

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
you know same with Cliffjumper and all

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.249 
you know same with Cliffjumper and all
that<00:01:53.670> stuff<00:01:53.880> I'm<00:01:54.299> really<00:01:54.689> looking<00:01:54.869> these

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
that stuff I'm really looking these

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.260 
that stuff I'm really looking these
things<00:01:55.530> as<00:01:55.770> which<00:01:56.640> one<00:01:56.820> would<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.000> like<00:01:57.149> to

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
things as which one would I like to

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.440 
things as which one would I like to
carry<00:01:57.479> around<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.869> play<00:01:57.990> with<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.619> think

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
carry around and play with and I think

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.100 
carry around and play with and I think
again<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.719> first<00:02:00.899> issue<00:02:01.110> as<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.590> collector<00:02:02.070> yes

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
again the first issue as a collector yes

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.990 
again the first issue as a collector yes
this<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.320> nice<00:02:04.530> one<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.860> transform<00:02:05.790> and

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
this is a nice one to transform and

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.550 
this is a nice one to transform and
display<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.689> set<00:02:06.840> up<00:02:06.930> on<00:02:07.049> your<00:02:07.170> shelf<00:02:07.469> and

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
display and set up on your shelf and

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.499 
display and set up on your shelf and
show<00:02:07.799> off<00:02:07.979> display<00:02:08.819> with<00:02:09.000> your<00:02:09.090> other<00:02:09.209> fingers

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
show off display with your other fingers

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.119 
show off display with your other fingers
but<00:02:09.690> just<00:02:09.840> as<00:02:09.989> uh<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.349> want<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.860> play<00:02:10.979> with

but just as uh I want to play with

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.380 
but just as uh I want to play with
something<00:02:11.420> takes<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> cake

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
something takes the cake

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.010 
something takes the cake
anyway<00:02:15.090> there's<00:02:16.090> that<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:16.540> we'll<00:02:16.780> go<00:02:16.900> ahead

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
anyway there's that and we'll go ahead

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.830 
anyway there's that and we'll go ahead
and<00:02:17.140> get<00:02:17.350> on<00:02:17.560> right<00:02:17.920> on<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.550> robot<00:02:19.330> mode<00:02:19.360> trips

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
and get on right on to robot mode trips

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.620 
and get on right on to robot mode trips
to<00:02:19.990> do<00:02:20.140> that<00:02:20.350> we<00:02:20.680> just<00:02:20.860> want<00:02:21.070> to<00:02:21.160> take

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
to do that we just want to take

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.360 
to do that we just want to take
bumblebee<00:02:22.630> right<00:02:22.810> here<00:02:22.960> go<00:02:23.920> ahead<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.130> make

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
bumblebee right here go ahead and make

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.370 
bumblebee right here go ahead and make
show<00:02:24.580> open<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.850> doors<00:02:25.030> first<00:02:25.240> open<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.200> doors

show open the doors first open the doors
right<00:02:26.470> here<00:02:27.480> we<00:02:28.480> can<00:02:28.570> do<00:02:28.720> anything<00:02:28.900> we<00:02:29.020> want<00:02:29.200> to

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
right here we can do anything we want to

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.590 
right here we can do anything we want to
split<00:02:29.470> that<00:02:29.560> out<00:02:29.710> I<00:02:30.160> can<00:02:30.670> see<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:30.970> side<00:02:31.180> panels

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
split that out I can see the side panels

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.390 
split that out I can see the side panels
are<00:02:31.720> part<00:02:31.960> of<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.080> arms<00:02:32.410> let's<00:02:33.070> bring<00:02:33.220> those

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
are part of the arms let's bring those

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.020 
are part of the arms let's bring those
down<00:02:34.270> and<00:02:34.420> out<00:02:34.510> like<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.890> bring<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.070> lower

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
down and out like that bring the lower

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.270 
down and out like that bring the lower
body<00:02:37.300> down<00:02:37.630> I<00:02:37.960> split<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.770> legs

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
body down I split the legs

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.320 
body down I split the legs
these<00:02:40.030> transform<00:02:40.510> very<00:02:40.720> similarly<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.260> the

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
these transform very similarly to the

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.550 
these transform very similarly to the
first<00:02:43.330> addition<00:02:43.690> although<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:44.020> foot<00:02:44.230> is<00:02:44.380> all

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
first addition although the foot is all

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.140 
first addition although the foot is all
one<00:02:44.770> piece<00:02:45.010> it<00:02:45.220> doesn't<00:02:45.340> fold<00:02:45.670> up<00:02:45.820> like<00:02:45.910> the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
one piece it doesn't fold up like the

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.850 
one piece it doesn't fold up like the
first<00:02:46.360> addition<00:02:46.720> did<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.260> then<00:02:47.560> those<00:02:47.710> the

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
first addition did and then those the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.740 
first addition did and then those the
rear<00:02:48.040> windows<00:02:48.430> are<00:02:48.700> not<00:02:48.880> back<00:02:49.360> here<00:02:49.570> on<00:02:49.660> the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
back of the leg but all in all a very

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.580 
back of the leg but all in all a very
similar<00:02:52.090> lower<00:02:52.450> body<00:02:52.810> lower<00:02:53.320> leg

transformation here to the first
addition<00:02:57.280> now<00:02:58.270> where<00:02:58.390> it<00:02:58.450> gets<00:02:58.570> different<00:02:58.750> as

here's<00:03:12.340> where<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:12.820> will<00:03:13.240> automatically

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
here's where it will automatically

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.140 
here's where it will automatically
transform<00:03:14.980> as<00:03:15.700> you<00:03:15.910> flip<00:03:16.090> these<00:03:16.209> back<00:03:18.150> should

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
transform as you flip these back should

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.090 
transform as you flip these back should
at<00:03:19.300> least<00:03:19.480> there's<00:03:19.780> a<00:03:19.840> head<00:03:19.989> got<00:03:20.170> stuck<00:03:20.320> but<00:03:21.040> it

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
at least there's a head got stuck but it

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.370 
at least there's a head got stuck but it
automatically<00:03:21.550> flips<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:21.940> head<00:03:22.090> back<00:03:22.380> into

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
piece remember you had to really

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.550 
piece remember you had to really
manually<00:03:28.030> get<00:03:28.660> under<00:03:28.900> there<00:03:29.050> and<00:03:29.080> pull<00:03:29.380> down

manually get under there and pull down

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.890 
manually get under there and pull down
on<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.950> first<00:03:30.190> addition<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:31.360> shoulders<00:03:31.720> come

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
said you know there's a head mod you can

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.310 
said you know there's a head mod you can
do<00:03:58.180> this<00:03:58.360> the<00:03:58.480> head<00:03:58.630> doesn't<00:03:58.810> sit<00:03:59.050> all<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.230> way

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
do this the head doesn't sit all the way

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.440 
do this the head doesn't sit all the way
down<00:03:59.560> and<00:03:59.860> it<00:04:00.190> actually<00:04:00.340> isn't<00:04:00.610> too<00:04:00.820> bad<00:04:01.060> this

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
down and it actually isn't too bad this

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.420 
down and it actually isn't too bad this
one<00:04:01.600> actually<00:04:01.750> um<00:04:02.170> that<00:04:02.920> i've<00:04:03.130> seen<00:04:03.280> a<00:04:03.340> mod

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
one actually um that i've seen a mod

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.430 
one actually um that i've seen a mod
where<00:04:03.730> you<00:04:03.790> have<00:04:03.940> to<00:04:04.030> go<00:04:04.150> in<00:04:04.330> and<00:04:04.480> cut<00:04:04.720> like<00:04:05.290> the

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
where you have to go in and cut like the

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.410 
where you have to go in and cut like the
last<00:04:05.650> two<00:04:05.950> notches<00:04:06.160> off<00:04:06.550> of<00:04:06.700> this<00:04:06.820> gear<00:04:07.120> thing

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
last two notches off of this gear thing

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.449 
last two notches off of this gear thing
and<00:04:07.690> I<00:04:08.320> found<00:04:08.590> you<00:04:08.709> really<00:04:08.920> don't<00:04:09.070> have<00:04:09.220> to<00:04:09.340> do

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
and I found you really don't have to do

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.430 
and I found you really don't have to do
that<00:04:09.610> his<00:04:10.030> head<00:04:10.269> is<00:04:10.450> on<00:04:10.630> this<00:04:10.810> gear<00:04:11.049> but<00:04:11.260> much

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
that his head is on this gear but much

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.990 
that his head is on this gear but much
like<00:04:11.620> Megatron's<00:04:14.010> fusion<00:04:15.010> cannon<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.790> head

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
like Megatron's fusion cannon the head

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.539 
like Megatron's fusion cannon the head
piece<00:04:16.239> is<00:04:16.419> not<00:04:16.540> actually<00:04:17.549> permanently

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
piece is not actually permanently

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.219 
piece is not actually permanently
attached<00:04:18.880> to<00:04:19.060> that<00:04:19.150> gear<00:04:19.419> it<00:04:19.570> moves<00:04:19.840> freely

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
attached to that gear it moves freely

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.650 
attached to that gear it moves freely
independent<00:04:20.919> of<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.250> gear<00:04:21.430> itself<00:04:21.549> so<00:04:22.539> what

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
independent of the gear itself so what

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.310 
independent of the gear itself so what
you<00:04:22.750> can<00:04:22.900> do<00:04:23.080> is<00:04:24.270> to<00:04:25.270> transform<00:04:25.510> it<00:04:25.930> without

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
you can do is to transform it without

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.060 
you can do is to transform it without
having<00:04:26.650> to

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
having to

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.530 
having to
anything<00:04:27.430> mine<00:04:27.610> work<00:04:27.790> just<00:04:28.000> fine<00:04:28.150> doing<00:04:28.450> this

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
anything mine work just fine doing this

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.120 
anything mine work just fine doing this
will<00:04:28.720> having<00:04:29.020> to<00:04:29.110> actually<00:04:29.230> cut<00:04:29.560> anything<00:04:29.800> on

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
will having to actually cut anything on

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.490 
will having to actually cut anything on
the<00:04:30.580> figure<00:04:30.820> itself<00:04:31.000> just<00:04:31.810> lift<00:04:32.080> it<00:04:32.170> up<00:04:32.290> but

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
the figure itself just lift it up but

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.120 
the figure itself just lift it up but
you're<00:04:32.620> transforming<00:04:33.100> it<00:04:33.160> into<00:04:34.920> robot<00:04:35.920> mode

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
you're transforming it into robot mode

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.440 
you're transforming it into robot mode
just<00:04:36.490> go<00:04:36.610> ahead<00:04:36.850> and<00:04:36.970> start<00:04:37.150> off<00:04:37.240> by<00:04:37.420> just

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
just go ahead and start off by just

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.390 
just go ahead and start off by just
lifting<00:04:37.900> this<00:04:37.990> up<00:04:38.170> but<00:04:38.440> you<00:04:38.710> don't<00:04:39.070> have<00:04:39.160> to<00:04:39.280> be

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
lifting this up but you don't have to be

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.860 
lifting this up but you don't have to be
far<00:04:39.640> at<00:04:39.760> all<00:04:39.880> just<00:04:40.120> just<00:04:40.360> give<00:04:40.630> it<00:04:40.720> a<00:04:40.750> little

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
far at all just just give it a little

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.050 
far at all just just give it a little
push<00:04:41.080> lift<00:04:41.350> it<00:04:41.470> up<00:04:41.560> a<00:04:41.650> little<00:04:41.740> bit<00:04:41.950> and<00:04:42.940> that

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
push lift it up a little bit and that

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.310 
push lift it up a little bit and that
will<00:04:43.150> set<00:04:43.390> it<00:04:43.450> far<00:04:43.630> enough<00:04:43.780> back<00:04:43.990> that<00:04:44.050> when

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
will set it far enough back that when

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.680 
will set it far enough back that when
you<00:04:44.410> snap<00:04:44.680> the<00:04:44.830> arms<00:04:45.070> in<00:04:45.280> it<00:04:45.850> sits<00:04:46.270> all<00:04:46.480> the<00:04:46.510> way

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
you snap the arms in it sits all the way

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.200 
you snap the arms in it sits all the way
down<00:04:46.930> proper<00:04:47.440> in<00:04:47.890> his<00:04:48.430> shoulders<00:04:48.820> it<00:04:48.940> doesn't

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
down proper in his shoulders it doesn't

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.270 
down proper in his shoulders it doesn't
hover<00:04:49.390> up<00:04:49.570> here<00:04:49.810> somewhere<00:04:50.080> and<00:04:50.320> look<00:04:50.470> bad<00:04:50.710> it

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
hover up here somewhere and look bad it

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.470 
hover up here somewhere and look bad it
actually<00:04:51.310> sits<00:04:51.730> all<00:04:51.850> the<00:04:51.880> way<00:04:52.030> down<00:04:52.210> there

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
actually sits all the way down there

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.690 
actually sits all the way down there
without<00:04:53.080> having<00:04:53.350> to<00:04:53.440> modify<00:04:53.560> anything<00:04:54.220> and

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.040 

and<00:04:57.700> again<00:04:57.820> you<00:04:58.060> can<00:04:58.180> push<00:04:58.390> it<00:04:58.540> down<00:04:58.690> after

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
and again you can push it down after

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.180 
and again you can push it down after
you've<00:04:59.170> pulled<00:04:59.410> the<00:04:59.530> shoulders<00:04:59.890> all<00:04:59.980> the<00:05:00.070> way

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
you've pulled the shoulders all the way

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.310 
you've pulled the shoulders all the way
out<00:05:00.310> but<00:05:00.910> just<00:05:01.150> due<00:05:01.330> to<00:05:01.360> how<00:05:01.630> it<00:05:01.780> sits<00:05:02.110> it's

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
out but just due to how it sits it's

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.430 
out but just due to how it sits it's
kind<00:05:02.500> of<00:05:02.560> hard<00:05:02.740> to<00:05:03.540> get<00:05:04.540> get<00:05:04.870> it<00:05:04.990> all<00:05:05.170> the<00:05:05.320> way

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
kind of hard to get get it all the way

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.470 
kind of hard to get get it all the way
down<00:05:05.620> that<00:05:05.830> way<00:05:05.980> if<00:05:06.130> you<00:05:06.250> push<00:05:06.430> it<00:05:06.580> back<00:05:06.760> just<00:05:07.390> a

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
down that way if you push it back just a

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.730 
down that way if you push it back just a
little<00:05:07.510> bit<00:05:07.780> as<00:05:07.990> you're<00:05:08.110> transforming<00:05:08.470> it

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
little bit as you're transforming it

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.140 
little bit as you're transforming it
automatically<00:05:09.280> pushes<00:05:09.520> it<00:05:09.730> a<00:05:09.760> little<00:05:09.880> further

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
automatically pushes it a little further

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.170 
automatically pushes it a little further

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.780 
with two of them and there he can't
really<00:05:29.470> use<00:05:29.770> the<00:05:29.980> first<00:05:30.190> I<00:05:30.340> tried<00:05:30.580> I<00:05:30.730> tried

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
really use the first I tried I tried

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.430

snapping<00:05:31.330> the<00:05:31.390> first<00:05:31.600> edition<00:05:31.930> ones<00:05:32.110> on<00:05:32.260> there

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
snapping the first edition ones on there

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.560 
snapping the first edition ones on there
and<00:05:32.530> then<00:05:32.800> the<00:05:32.980> peg<00:05:33.160> just<00:05:33.370> is<00:05:33.460> too<00:05:33.610> short<00:05:33.850> all

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
and then the peg just is too short all

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.760 
and then the peg just is too short all
the<00:05:34.630> way<00:05:34.780> it's<00:05:34.900> designed<00:05:35.050> it<00:05:35.500> doesn't<00:05:35.680> really

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
the way it's designed it doesn't really

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.640 
the way it's designed it doesn't really
fit<00:05:36.040> on<00:05:36.250> his<00:05:36.400> arm<00:05:36.840> so<00:05:37.840> I<00:05:38.170> also<00:05:38.380> thought<00:05:38.590> about

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
fit on his arm so I also thought about

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.050 
fit on his arm so I also thought about
swapping<00:05:39.040> this<00:05:39.310> head<00:05:39.520> onto<00:05:39.700> the<00:05:39.820> first

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
swapping this head onto the first

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.730 
swapping this head onto the first
edition<00:05:40.450> since<00:05:40.600> it<00:05:40.780> has<00:05:40.900> the<00:05:41.050> proper<00:05:41.380> silver

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
edition since it has the proper silver

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.400 
edition since it has the proper silver
face<00:05:41.920> but<00:05:42.760> this<00:05:43.150> one<00:05:43.330> has<00:05:43.480> a<00:05:43.510> peg<00:05:43.810> on<00:05:44.080> the<00:05:44.260> neck

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
face but this one has a peg on the neck

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.290 
face but this one has a peg on the neck
piece<00:05:44.590> that<00:05:44.800> goes<00:05:44.920> up<00:05:45.160> into<00:05:45.310> the<00:05:45.490> head<00:05:45.700> this

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:47.920 
one has a peg on the head that goes down

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.080 
one has a peg on the head that goes down
into<00:05:48.160> the<00:05:48.250> neck<00:05:48.460> piece<00:05:48.640> so<00:05:48.880> they<00:05:48.970> aren't

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
into the neck piece so they aren't

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.850 
into the neck piece so they aren't

I gotta figure out how it all works yeah

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.260 
I gotta figure out how it all works yeah
and<00:06:24.010> there<00:06:24.130> they<00:06:24.220> are<00:06:24.250> side-by-side<00:06:24.580> now

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
and there they are side-by-side now

and there they are side-by-side now
again<00:06:25.540> I<00:06:25.750> think<00:06:26.640> first<00:06:27.640> edition<00:06:28.000> bumblebee

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
again I think first edition bumblebee

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.790 
again I think first edition bumblebee
really<00:06:28.750> captures<00:06:29.140> the<00:06:29.260> aesthetic<00:06:29.620> of<00:06:29.740> the

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
really captures the aesthetic of the

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.710 
really captures the aesthetic of the
show<00:06:30.010> much<00:06:30.400> better<00:06:30.670> than<00:06:30.940> the<00:06:31.270> robots<00:06:31.600> in

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
show much better than the robots in

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.220 
show much better than the robots in
disguise<00:06:31.750> but<00:06:32.260> movie<00:06:32.820> it<00:06:33.820> does<00:06:34.060> it<00:06:34.750> looks<00:06:34.990> and

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.230 
disguise but movie it does it looks and

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.900 
disguise but movie it does it looks and
neither<00:06:35.800> one<00:06:35.980> of<00:06:36.010> them<00:06:36.190> look<00:06:36.370> exactly<00:06:36.520> like

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
neither one of them look exactly like

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.790 
neither one of them look exactly like
the<00:06:37.150> character<00:06:37.480> on<00:06:37.570> the<00:06:37.600> cartoon<00:06:38.050> first

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
the character on the cartoon first

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.350 
the character on the cartoon first
edition<00:06:39.130> looks<00:06:39.340> a<00:06:39.430> little<00:06:39.520> better<00:06:39.730> I<00:06:40.000> wish<00:06:40.240> he

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
edition looks a little better I wish he

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.010

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:37.700 
this one I don't know why people are so

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.840 
this one I don't know why people are so
down<00:07:37.880> on<00:07:37.910> it<00:07:38.120> it's<00:07:38.240> not<00:07:38.330> perfect<00:07:38.840> but<00:07:39.680> it's<00:07:39.920> far

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:40.850 
down on it it's not perfect but it's far

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.840 
down on it it's not perfect but it's far
from<00:07:40.880> the<00:07:41.150> garbage<00:07:41.450> we<00:07:41.570> have<00:07:41.750> been<00:07:41.960> getting<00:07:42.140> I

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:42.850 
from the garbage we have been getting I

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:46.990 
from the garbage we have been getting I
say<00:07:43.850> garbage<00:07:44.090> we<00:07:44.300> have<00:07:44.420> been<00:07:44.540> getting<00:07:44.780> it<00:07:46.000> but

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.000 
say garbage we have been getting it but

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.090 
say garbage we have been getting it but
I<00:07:47.030> think<00:07:47.450> it's<00:07:47.720> still<00:07:47.870> a<00:07:47.930> far<00:07:48.230> better<00:07:48.800> figure

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:49.100 
I think it's still a far better figure

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.550 
I think it's still a far better figure
than<00:07:49.340> most<00:07:49.580> of<00:07:49.760> the<00:07:49.880> late<00:07:50.780> wave<00:07:51.020> movie<00:07:51.410> line
