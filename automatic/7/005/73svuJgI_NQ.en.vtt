 third musical production with music

 since everything was the phenomenon of 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.309
 salserín tell me about this production 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.350
 we're talking about watching production 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.339
 yours produces the music also the 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.710
 make up 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:55.640
 speak out the box ok it's good to look 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.019
 ok well this topic looks good of the would 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.940
 to be part of what of what is going to 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.429
 be my third solo album 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.390
 my two previous albums in the first 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.150
 he arrived he was involved in what was 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.680
 production and also composition and then 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.940
 what was my second solo album 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.650
 this was a project 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.050
 so totally selfish because what 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.700
 I recorded in my own studio, I produced 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.930
 I composed I recorded many of the 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.760
 instruments and I was stuck told what 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.650
 that was arrangements 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.210
 post production production mix and so on 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.800
 etcetera I like it very much called me a lot 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.830
 the attention what is the how is the 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.860
 music and in this case good I'm going to 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.010
 start with this topic that is supposed to 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.660
 it's the first promotional item but I come 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.190
 with a more acoustic wave people 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.570
 he even sees me and thinks that because of the look 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.110
 I'm doing rock, I'm still doing 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.140
 pop 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.360
 but maybe what I'm going to do so 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.920
 less this song I think you have to 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.240
 be good pop and you have to be good ballad 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.040
 not necessarily that you will count the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.450
 good for many for example I'm going to 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.120
 sing that is a theme that is called look 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.890
 it's a song that I did trying to 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.690
 knock down a bit what is the cliché of 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.240
 light blue principle there is a principle 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.729
 blue that because of disney and because of 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.790
 of July all the girls but that 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.160
 it's not like that I think I strongly believe that 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.710
 the blue principle is more a myth is 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.720
 more a cliché and there are people that I have 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.850
 outside chubby little feito who can 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.440
 be perfectly princes of blues and 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.880
 that while they make you laugh while you 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.100
 make happy, it only matters also of 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.990
 girls like then spoon to networks with 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.990
 the topic looks here in good morning 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:45.310
 I am far from being that prince 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:48.580
 blue who arrives on horseback surrounded by 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.950
 look I do not know 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.819
 i 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:58.450
 and I am very far from being an example to 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:01.290
 follow that everyone criticize and have 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.290
 what to say 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:11.830
 how should I be made or juggler of the 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:15.700
 emotions and I write songs with 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:20.580
 my illusions and I'm imperfect I'm 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.580

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.099
