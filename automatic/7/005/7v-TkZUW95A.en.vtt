00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.440
 around today ahrensburgs as always here and 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.330
 Today we show you in the tutorial like him 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.769
 because I can build the DampffrÃ¶sser 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.719
 We do not believe Germans like that 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.950
 please do not correct the curry 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.960
 in any case, this small steam radiator 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.250
 is relatively practical i must say it 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.600
 I can swing and swing from house to house 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.699
 she can also kill zombies 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.760
 and yes, there are three in the first room 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.070
 possible part of the three possible points 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.689
 By the way, the parts in scream need 4 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.010
 have you just seen left on the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.630
 stairs at one then right at the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.550
 counter and on this chair kemper spawn 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.489
 and if we go through the door on the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.960
 left side under this picture is too 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.090
 a possible porn point on the left 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.180
 and if we go in there right here 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.550
 on the small corner is what and a 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.020
 last point here right there at 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.670
 the escalator in front of the elevator 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.260
 These are all bonus points for the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.190
 altogether four parts and got already that 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.559
 first part 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.239
 I'll take that with me on the way 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.289
 downstairs so in the elevator rhine 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.789
 not necessarily in the elevator but 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.460
 in my opinion that is the best 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.649
 away then we go along here along the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.270
 Carefully go down escalator and 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.640
 Of course we build the whole thing 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.280
 the workbench and already is the first 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.729
 Part offer as a second part I pick 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.960
 blow with these beams bubble on soon 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.760
 every case goes back to that 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.320
 lift in and small tip if 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.030
 you jump on the elevator since then 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.170
 simply often times up then the drives 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.000
 whole example a bit too 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.340
 faster I can still get the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.080
 pwg then carefully down here 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.790
 and before I grow I 'll get it 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.220
 considering how we do that is extremely useful 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.930
 in solo and yes I think about it 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.340
 and then it goes to the next part so 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.369
 next part, I'll get me this way 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.890
 lattice i fitter are also grid 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.299
 then go a relatively risky way 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.920
 I must honestly say that is extreme 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.509
 Hard to walk , therefore , it is pretty 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.340
 easy down and that if we are here 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.110
 we have to get close to the edge 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.689
 try on the next floor too 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.700
 fall so that is always extremely close 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.560
 because if you take me to the last floor 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.360
 Just fall dead on everyone 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.250
 case offered the last penultimate thing yes 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.250
 and then it goes to the last part 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.140
 so and the last part with me was this 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.050
 small flag here next to the escalator 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.660
 and because I had enough points left 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.950
 I am the boiled just 57 time 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.130
 gone back down here all the way 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.740
 very carefully, of course, and have the 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.810
 flag grown on these herbs and 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.830
 so that she is perfect for us 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.240
 masterpiece is done 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.070
 By the way, we can from the position 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.860
 on the roof of the house where the 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.260
 is kite and up there already in 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.450
 the little round quasi our mischief 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.520
 drive and then also claim to catch up with me 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.040
 believe that boni though I think so 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.720
 only accessible with the power is the mp 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.690
 5 come then recover and then what is 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.270
 everything gives and by the way this sling 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.270
 also kills zombies we see here now 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.180
 can fly and also the way 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.410
 the little crawlers kill those too and 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.520
 yes, another point for the 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.890
 We have slingshots here 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.950
 we have to leave this room where we are 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.870
 then have the spotter built as can 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.230
 Just describe it just down 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.880
 of course with the student 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.130
 going into this room and then here 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.010
 the cliff and that are already 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.720
 we in the house over there I find honest 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.459
 The point is that is not quite 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.620
 As good as the first point I tell you 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.870
 have shown but I have one more 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.940
 Another practical point for the 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.160
 sling for you and that is that 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.950
 behind this butter room I call her 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.209
 now butter room year this turn 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.930
 You know what I mean 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:34.420
 this little relative asian red 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.519
 held room and if you like me 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.630
 Jump over to the other house where we are 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.739
 can also activate the electricity 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.590
 we just put people down and 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.090
 at least jump back to this house 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.670
 and there is our drifting down there too 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.920
 By the way, also a good room for this 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.060
 I call them round tactics now 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.370
 and jaspers inform i hope it has 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.380
 you like it and yes it will stay 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.110
 in short I have with chris and one 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.459
 few subscribers a harlem schenk bo 2 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.480
 I made the link in the video 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.790
 the description you can even times 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.680
 look and write like you 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.239
 liked that it was now final 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.290
 from me if it helped you then 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:09.330
 give her video but a thumbs up 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.330
 and we'll see you soon Zschau
