00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
process within mcedit it's a little bit

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.919 
process within mcedit it's a little bit
tricky<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.519> do<00:00:08.790> at<00:00:08.970> first<00:00:09.000> but<00:00:09.450> once<00:00:09.630> you<00:00:09.750> see

things so as you can see here as I'm

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.590 
things so as you can see here as I'm
moving<00:00:17.160> through<00:00:17.340> free<00:00:17.760> space<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:18.270> can<00:00:18.390> see

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
moving through free space you can see

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.109 
moving through free space you can see
that<00:00:18.779> little<00:00:18.990> white<00:00:19.680> outline<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.850> cube

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
that little white outline of a cube

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.670 
that little white outline of a cube
that's<00:00:21.270> being<00:00:21.539> selected<00:00:21.990> in<00:00:22.020> front<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.410> me<00:00:22.500> so

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
that's being selected in front of me so

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.759 
that's being selected in front of me so
well<00:00:23.640> let's<00:00:23.880> find<00:00:24.119> something<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.019> ground

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
well let's find something on the ground

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.700 
well let's find something on the ground
and<00:00:26.430> then<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.939> will<00:00:27.240> be<00:00:27.779> able<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.230> show<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.680> that

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
and then I will be able to show you that

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.130 
and then I will be able to show you that
easier<00:00:29.310> as<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.240> can<00:00:30.359> see<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.689> program<00:00:30.900> is

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
easier as you can see this program is

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.760 
easier as you can see this program is
also<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.470> little<00:00:31.859> bit<00:00:33.079> resource<00:00:34.079> intensive

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
also a little bit resource intensive

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.450 
also a little bit resource intensive
more<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:35.399> than<00:00:35.550> say<00:00:35.969> minecraft<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:38.250> might

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
more so than say minecraft so you might

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.490 
more so than say minecraft so you might
have<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.059> have<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.450> more<00:00:39.840> powerful<00:00:40.110> computer

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
have to have a more powerful computer

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.860 
have to have a more powerful computer
than<00:00:40.980> my<00:00:41.190> crappy<00:00:41.670> little<00:00:41.969> laptop<00:00:42.149> here<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.719> run

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
than my crappy little laptop here to run

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.560 
than my crappy little laptop here to run
it<00:00:42.989> correctly<00:00:43.370> but<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.489> can<00:00:44.760> select<00:00:45.090> blocks

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
it correctly but you can select blocks

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.029 
it correctly but you can select blocks
here<00:00:45.840> by<00:00:46.020> moving<00:00:46.860> around<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:48.770> let's<00:00:49.770> say<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
here by moving around and let's say the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.220 
here by moving around and let's say the
block<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.399> want<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.820> right<00:00:51.090> there<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.989> can

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
block you want is right there you can

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.459 
block you want is right there you can
just<00:00:52.469> click<00:00:53.420> once<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.690> that'll<00:00:54.960> sort<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.289> show

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
just click once and that'll sort of show

just click once and that'll sort of show
you<00:00:55.500> like<00:00:55.860> okay<00:00:56.280> there's<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.850> block<00:00:57.059> you're

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
you like okay there's the block you're

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.389 
you like okay there's the block you're
about<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.719> select<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.410> then<00:00:58.440> if<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.250> click

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
about to select and then if you click

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.580 
about to select and then if you click
again<00:00:59.520> it'll<00:01:00.239> actually<00:01:00.480> select<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.379> then

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
again it'll actually select it and then

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.039 
again it'll actually select it and then
it'll<00:01:01.859> ask<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.370> select<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.969> next<00:01:03.660> block

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
it'll ask you to select the next block

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.850 
it'll ask you to select the next block
you<00:01:04.229> want<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.820> but<00:01:05.820> let's<00:01:06.600> deselect<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.500> for

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
you want to but let's deselect that for

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.340 
you want to but let's deselect that for
a<00:01:07.890> sec<00:01:08.299> let's<00:01:09.299> say<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.570> didn't<00:01:10.110> want<00:01:10.260> to

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
a sec let's say you didn't want to

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.580 
a sec let's say you didn't want to
select<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.570> you<00:01:12.570> kind<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.229> want<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
select that and you kind of want the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.320 
select that and you kind of want the
block<00:01:13.799> that's<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.189> back<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.700> one<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.180> can

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
block that's in back of that one you can

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.480 
block that's in back of that one you can
use<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.479> scroll<00:01:16.049> wheel<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.350> move<00:01:17.280> that

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
use the scroll wheel to move that

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.580 
use the scroll wheel to move that
backwards<00:01:18.150> or<00:01:18.330> forwards<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.320> let's<00:01:19.439> say<00:01:19.530> I

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
backwards or forwards so let's say I

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.450 
backwards or forwards so let's say I
want<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.860> select<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.280> one<00:01:20.460> or<00:01:22.070> just<00:01:23.070> by<00:01:23.250> using

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
want to select that one or just by using

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.789 
want to select that one or just by using
the<00:01:23.640> scroll<00:01:23.850> key<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.210> can<00:01:24.390> go<00:01:24.600> forwards<00:01:25.530> and

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
the scroll key you can go forwards and

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.859 
the scroll key you can go forwards and
backwards<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.670> depth<00:01:27.229> so<00:01:29.479> let's<00:01:30.479> say<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.659> want

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
backwards in depth so let's say I want

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.520 
backwards in depth so let's say I want
to<00:01:30.930> select<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:32.930> then<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.020> want<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.290> select

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
to select that and then I want to select

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.700 
to select that and then I want to select
something<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.780> not<00:01:36.780> quite<00:01:36.960> there<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.590> not

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
something and not quite there and not

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.520 
something and not quite there and not
quite<00:01:37.979> there<00:01:38.250> but<00:01:38.549> there<00:01:39.110> so<00:01:40.110> double<00:01:40.500> click

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
quite there but there so double click

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.190 
quite there but there so double click
that<00:01:40.979> or<00:01:41.189> single<00:01:41.790> click<00:01:42.000> there<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.540> that's<00:01:43.110> my

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
that or single click there and that's my

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.200 
that or single click there and that's my
selection<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.490> two<00:01:44.700> corners

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
selection so you have the two corners

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.899 
selection so you have the two corners
the<00:01:45.810> blue<00:01:46.020> corner<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.070> yellow<00:01:47.490> corner

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
the blue corner and the yellow corner

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.090

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
can press the lead and it would delete

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.109

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
key you can move around that block so

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.870 
key you can move around that block so
let's<00:02:18.760> say<00:02:18.940> I<00:02:18.970> use<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.540> WASD<00:02:20.020> Keys<00:02:20.980> if<00:02:21.460> I<00:02:21.550> press

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
let's say I use the WASD Keys if I press

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.900 
let's say I use the WASD Keys if I press
a<00:02:22.150> it'll<00:02:22.870> move<00:02:23.110> over<00:02:23.440> there<00:02:23.680> d<00:02:24.400> it'll<00:02:24.730> move

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
a it'll move over there d it'll move

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.560 
a it'll move over there d it'll move
back<00:02:25.770> W<00:02:26.770> move<00:02:27.070> forward<00:02:27.640> s<00:02:28.030> move<00:02:28.510> back<00:02:28.810> Q<00:02:29.770> up

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
back W move forward s move back Q up

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.840 
back W move forward s move back Q up
Ziqi<00:02:31.570> down<00:02:32.370> this<00:02:33.370> is<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.730> same<00:02:34.000> for<00:02:34.450> the

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
Ziqi down this is the same for the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.200 
Ziqi down this is the same for the
yellow<00:02:36.850> block<00:02:37.270> here<00:02:37.540> as<00:02:37.660> well<00:02:38.730> WASD<00:02:39.730> all<00:02:40.060> that

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
yellow block here as well WASD all that

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.640 
yellow block here as well WASD all that
stuff<00:02:40.510> but<00:02:40.960> it<00:02:41.080> is<00:02:41.670> context<00:02:42.930> relevant<00:02:43.930> so<00:02:44.560> if

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
stuff but it is context relevant so if

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.420 
stuff but it is context relevant so if
I'm<00:02:44.800> looking<00:02:45.280> this<00:02:45.580> way<00:02:45.850> it's<00:02:46.240> going<00:02:46.360> to<00:02:46.630> mean

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
I'm looking this way it's going to mean

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.940 
I'm looking this way it's going to mean
the<00:02:48.430> W<00:02:48.790> key<00:02:49.000> will<00:02:49.210> move<00:02:49.390> it<00:02:49.510> that<00:02:49.660> way<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:50.260> as<00:02:52.950> d

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
the W key will move it that way a as d

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.740 
the W key will move it that way a as d
that<00:02:54.220> sort<00:02:54.460> of<00:02:54.490> thing

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
that sort of thing

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.010 
that sort of thing
but<00:02:56.140> if<00:02:56.230> I'm<00:02:56.410> looking<00:02:56.770> at<00:02:56.980> it<00:02:57.130> from<00:02:57.750> let's<00:02:58.750> say

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
but if I'm looking at it from let's say

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.020 
but if I'm looking at it from let's say
this<00:02:59.350> angle<00:02:59.860> it<00:03:00.100> can<00:03:00.190> be<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.370> little<00:03:00.610> tricky

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
this angle it can be a little tricky

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.570 
this angle it can be a little tricky
where<00:03:01.990> W<00:03:03.330> might<00:03:04.330> mean<00:03:04.870> something<00:03:05.650> else<00:03:05.830> let<00:03:06.460> me

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
where W might mean something else let me

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.720 
where W might mean something else let me
see<00:03:06.760> if<00:03:06.850> I<00:03:06.940> can<00:03:07.090> get<00:03:07.300> this<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.510> little<00:03:07.900> better<00:03:08.730> so

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
see if I can get this a little better so

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.450 
see if I can get this a little better so
pressing<00:03:10.090> W<00:03:10.390> there<00:03:10.750> we'll<00:03:10.930> move<00:03:11.080> it<00:03:11.260> in<00:03:11.590> that

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
pressing W there we'll move it in that

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.430 
pressing W there we'll move it in that
direction<00:03:12.790> not<00:03:13.360> in<00:03:13.420> that<00:03:13.690> direction<00:03:13.930> so

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
direction not in that direction so

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.840 
direction not in that direction so
that's<00:03:14.980> something<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.490> keep<00:03:15.790> in<00:03:15.910> mind<00:03:17.550> so<00:03:18.550> once

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
that's something to keep in mind so once

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.310 
that's something to keep in mind so once
you're<00:03:19.060> done<00:03:19.360> with<00:03:19.540> this<00:03:19.720> selection<00:03:20.020> let's

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
you're done with this selection let's

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.230 
you're done with this selection let's
say<00:03:20.440> I<00:03:20.470> didn't<00:03:20.740> want<00:03:20.830> to<00:03:20.950> do<00:03:21.040> it<00:03:21.070> at<00:03:21.280> all<00:03:21.430> you

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
say I didn't want to do it at all you

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.840 
say I didn't want to do it at all you
just<00:03:22.540> double-click<00:03:23.410> on<00:03:23.620> there<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.400> it<00:03:24.730> would

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
just double-click on there and it would

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.500 
just double-click on there and it would
deselect<00:03:25.300> it<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:26.880> there<00:03:27.880> you<00:03:28.000> have<00:03:28.030> it<00:03:28.270> a

deselect it and there you have it a

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.320 
deselect it and there you have it a
rather<00:03:29.140> quick<00:03:30.040> explanation<00:03:30.430> of<00:03:30.850> how<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.060> do

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
rather quick explanation of how to do

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.810 
rather quick explanation of how to do
that<00:03:31.480> I'll<00:03:31.960> show<00:03:32.230> you<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.620> other<00:03:32.860> things<00:03:33.580> that

that I'll show you the other things that

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.460 
that I'll show you the other things that
you<00:03:33.910> can<00:03:34.030> do<00:03:34.180> once<00:03:34.420> you<00:03:34.570> do<00:03:34.810> have<00:03:34.840> a<00:03:35.080> selection

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
you can do once you do have a selection

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.650 
you can do once you do have a selection
