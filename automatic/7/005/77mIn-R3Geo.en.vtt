all that much as you know I don't hate
it<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:33.759> it's<00:01:33.939> not<00:01:34.180> as<00:01:34.270> kind<00:01:34.509> of<00:01:34.570> sleek<00:01:34.840> and

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020

it but it's not as kind of sleek and
stylish<00:01:35.200> I<00:01:35.500> guess<00:01:35.710> as<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.280> previous<00:01:36.490> two

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
stylish I guess as the the previous two

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.520 
Playstation 3
it<00:01:39.189> is<00:01:39.340> obviously<00:01:39.850> a<00:01:39.909> lot<00:01:40.060> smaller<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:41.380> still

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
it is obviously a lot smaller you still

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.889 
it is obviously a lot smaller you still
got<00:01:41.649> two<00:01:41.799> USBs<00:01:42.220> on<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:42.490> front<00:01:42.750> unlike<00:01:43.750> the

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
got two USBs on the front unlike the

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.440 
got two USBs on the front unlike the
original<00:01:44.259> fat<00:01:44.860> ps3<00:01:45.369> dad<00:01:45.520> for<00:01:45.819> but<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.090> last

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
original fat ps3 dad for but the last

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.899 
original fat ps3 dad for but the last
limb<00:01:46.690> had<00:01:46.899> two<00:01:47.280> but<00:01:48.280> the<00:01:48.369> big<00:01:48.520> difference<00:01:48.640> I

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
limb had two but the big difference I

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.580 
limb had two but the big difference I
guess<00:01:48.940> is<00:01:49.390> that<00:01:49.659> it's<00:01:49.840> actually<00:01:49.990> a<00:01:50.200> top

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
guess is that it's actually a top

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.649 
guess is that it's actually a top
loading<00:01:50.830> machine<00:01:51.250> now<00:01:51.460> rather<00:01:52.119> than<00:01:52.360> a<00:01:52.420> slot

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
loading machine at the front so we're

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.399

this piece of tape and see what happens
when<00:02:17.140> we<00:02:17.290> do<00:02:17.440> that<00:02:18.570> whoa<00:02:19.600> so<00:02:20.560> as<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:21.010> can<00:02:21.100> see

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
when we do that whoa so as you can see

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.819 
when we do that whoa so as you can see
that's<00:02:21.730> what<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.120> new<00:02:22.299> loading<00:02:23.230> system<00:02:23.650> looks

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
that's what the new loading system looks

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.370 
that's what the new loading system looks
like<00:02:24.040> it's<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:25.810> know<00:02:25.840> obviously<00:02:26.230> it's

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
like it's you know obviously it's

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.009 
like it's you know obviously it's
mechanical<00:02:27.010> rather<00:02:27.250> than<00:02:27.570> you<00:02:28.570> know<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.720> kind

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
mechanical rather than you know the kind

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.289 
mechanical rather than you know the kind
of<00:02:29.109> touch<00:02:29.320> interface<00:02:30.100> that<00:02:30.280> you<00:02:30.400> have<00:02:30.640> with

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
of touch interface that you have with

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.690 
of touch interface that you have with
the<00:02:31.390> previous<00:02:31.750> two<00:02:31.900> PlayStation<00:02:32.470> 3s<00:02:32.799> one

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
the previous two PlayStation 3s one

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.360 
the previous two PlayStation 3s one
thing<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:34.540> actually<00:02:35.109> Sony<00:02:35.739> mentioned<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.250> me

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
thing that actually Sony mentioned to me

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.880 
thing that actually Sony mentioned to me
is<00:02:36.519> that<00:02:36.700> it's<00:02:37.690> potentially<00:02:38.260> slightly<00:02:38.739> louder

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
is that it's potentially slightly louder

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.940 
is that it's potentially slightly louder
than<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.519> old<00:02:39.640> slim<00:02:39.940> or<00:02:40.269> fatter<00:02:41.260> purely

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
than the old slim or fatter purely

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.220 
than the old slim or fatter purely
because<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.940> disc<00:02:43.150> is<00:02:43.299> nearer<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.780> outside

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
because the disc is nearer to outside

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.870 
because the disc is nearer to outside
space<00:02:44.470> it's<00:02:44.680> not<00:02:44.709> buried<00:02:45.220> deep<00:02:45.459> within<00:02:45.489> the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
space it's not buried deep within the

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.699 
space it's not buried deep within the
actual<00:02:46.120> unit<00:02:46.510> it's<00:02:46.660> right<00:02:46.930> on<00:02:47.079> top<00:02:47.350> and<00:02:47.590> you've

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
actual unit it's right on top and you've

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.229 
actual unit it's right on top and you've
only<00:02:47.859> got<00:02:47.980> this<00:02:48.190> thin<00:02:48.459> layer<00:02:48.640> of<00:02:48.670> plastic

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
only got this thin layer of plastic

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.810 
only got this thin layer of plastic
between<00:02:49.989> you<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:51.070> disc<00:02:51.280> so<00:02:51.489> we'll<00:02:51.609> check

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
between you and the disc so we'll check

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.099 
between you and the disc so we'll check
that<00:02:51.850> out<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.269> see<00:02:52.450> if<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.630> sound<00:02:52.870> is<00:02:52.959> any

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
that out and see if the sound is any

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:54.509 
that out and see if the sound is any
louder<00:02:53.380> let's<00:02:53.829> try<00:02:54.010> it<00:02:54.069> with<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.220> game<00:02:54.340> and

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
louder let's try it with the game and

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.670 
louder let's try it with the game and
let's<00:02:54.640> see<00:02:54.910> if<00:02:55.060> it<00:02:55.239> is<00:02:55.660> any<00:02:55.900> louder<00:02:56.170> than<00:02:56.560> the

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
let's see if it is any louder than the

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:08.300 
let's see if it is any louder than the
previous<00:02:57.130> limbs

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.970 

hmm<00:03:09.310> it's<00:03:10.150> probably<00:03:10.600> slightly<00:03:10.840> louder<00:03:11.110> but

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
hmm it's probably slightly louder but

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.800 
hmm it's probably slightly louder but
it's<00:03:12.100> definitely<00:03:12.310> not<00:03:12.550> really<00:03:13.120> is<00:03:13.300> shattering

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
it's definitely not really is shattering

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.540 
it's definitely not really is shattering
oh<00:03:14.020> yeah<00:03:14.230> this<00:03:14.800> is<00:03:14.830> tucked<00:03:15.160> away<00:03:15.250> underneath

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
oh yeah this is tucked away underneath

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.310 
oh yeah this is tucked away underneath
your<00:03:15.820> television<00:03:16.270> I<00:03:16.420> can't<00:03:16.900> imagine<00:03:17.020> that

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
your television I can't imagine that

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.300 
your television I can't imagine that
it's<00:03:17.530> gonna<00:03:17.650> get<00:03:17.830> on<00:03:17.980> your<00:03:18.070> nerves<00:03:20.040> in<00:03:21.040> terms

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
it's gonna get on your nerves in terms

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.030 
it's gonna get on your nerves in terms
of<00:03:21.430> actual<00:03:21.640> size<00:03:21.970> well<00:03:25.410> in<00:03:26.410> terms<00:03:26.650> of<00:03:26.770> actual

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
of actual size well in terms of actual

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.760 
of actual size well in terms of actual
size<00:03:27.600> we've<00:03:28.600> got<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.810> ps3<00:03:29.200> slim<00:03:29.350> here<00:03:29.620> and<00:03:29.710> as

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
size we've got the ps3 slim here and as

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.170 
size we've got the ps3 slim here and as
you<00:03:29.830> can<00:03:29.890> see<00:03:29.980> it's<00:03:30.520> actually<00:03:30.670> quite<00:03:31.000> a<00:03:31.060> lot

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
you can see it's actually quite a lot

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.930 
you can see it's actually quite a lot
smaller<00:03:31.450> it's<00:03:32.170> a<00:03:32.230> lot<00:03:32.380> shallower<00:03:32.650> in<00:03:33.580> terms<00:03:33.820> of

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
smaller it's a lot shallower in terms of

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.670 
smaller it's a lot shallower in terms of
depth<00:03:34.180> it's<00:03:34.360> probably<00:03:34.630> about<00:03:34.690> saying<00:03:35.140> you

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
depth it's probably about saying you

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.710 
depth it's probably about saying you
know<00:03:35.800> try<00:03:36.670> to<00:03:36.700> compare<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.180> two<00:03:37.210> in<00:03:37.390> terms<00:03:37.540> of

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
know try to compare the two in terms of

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.520 
know try to compare the two in terms of
weight<00:03:37.870> yeah<00:03:38.940> it's<00:03:39.940> definitely<00:03:40.210> lighter<00:03:40.570> not

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
weight yeah it's definitely lighter not

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.020 
weight yeah it's definitely lighter not
though<00:03:41.680> that<00:03:41.830> makes<00:03:41.980> a<00:03:42.070> master's<00:03:42.430> in<00:03:42.520> swearing

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
though that makes a master's in swearing

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.910 
though that makes a master's in swearing
I<00:03:43.150> think<00:03:43.810> they've<00:03:44.230> said<00:03:44.500> haven't<00:03:44.710> they<00:03:44.770> that

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
I think they've said haven't they that

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.610 
I think they've said haven't they that
this<00:03:45.100> is<00:03:45.340> that's<00:03:45.970> 25%<00:03:46.570> less<00:03:47.080> in<00:03:47.350> terms<00:03:47.500> of

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
this is that's 25% less in terms of

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.590 
this is that's 25% less in terms of
weight<00:03:47.800> and<00:03:48.040> 20%<00:03:48.610> less<00:03:49.000> in<00:03:49.180> terms<00:03:49.270> of<00:03:49.420> volume

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
weight and 20% less in terms of volume

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.570 
weight and 20% less in terms of volume
right<00:03:49.959> which<00:03:50.500> is<00:03:50.620> how<00:03:50.709> I<00:03:50.740> measure<00:03:51.010> my<00:03:51.160> consoles

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
right which is how I measure my consoles

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.150 
right which is how I measure my consoles
absolutely<00:03:52.709> but<00:03:53.709> the<00:03:53.950> compared<00:03:54.400> to<00:03:54.459> this

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
absolutely but the compared to this

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.710 
absolutely but the compared to this
obviously<00:03:57.160> you<00:03:57.370> know<00:03:57.490> is<00:03:57.670> many<00:03:58.240> many<00:03:58.510> years

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
obviously you know is many many years

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.180 
obviously you know is many many years
old<00:03:58.959> wow<00:03:59.140> that<00:03:59.350> is<00:03:59.380> really<00:03:59.530> any<00:04:00.220> heavy<00:04:00.430> console

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
old wow that is really any heavy console

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.000 
old wow that is really any heavy console
it's<00:04:03.190> a<00:04:03.400> lot<00:04:03.610> lot<00:04:03.820> smaller<00:04:04.180> I<00:04:04.900> guess<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:05.830> big

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
it's a lot lot smaller I guess the big

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.980 
it's a lot lot smaller I guess the big
you<00:04:06.700> know<00:04:06.820> the<00:04:06.970> sad<00:04:07.150> thing<00:04:07.180> here<00:04:07.570> is<00:04:07.690> that<00:04:07.810> it's

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
you know the sad thing here is that it's

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.720 
you know the sad thing here is that it's
still<00:04:08.260> not<00:04:08.290> PlayStation<00:04:09.010> 2<00:04:09.130> compatible<00:04:09.580> this

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
still not PlayStation 2 compatible this

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.699 
still not PlayStation 2 compatible this
one<00:04:09.970> was<00:04:10.180> obviously<00:04:10.540> when<00:04:10.660> it<00:04:10.780> came<00:04:10.900> out<00:04:11.080> all

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
one was obviously when it came out all

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.770 
one was obviously when it came out all
those<00:04:11.890> years<00:04:12.070> ago<00:04:12.370> but<00:04:12.640> you<00:04:13.030> want<00:04:13.180> ps2<00:04:13.480> games

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
those years ago but you want ps2 games

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.360 
those years ago but you want ps2 games
this<00:04:14.050> is<00:04:14.170> not<00:04:14.350> the<00:04:14.440> console<00:04:14.800> for<00:04:14.980> you<00:04:15.100> I'd

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
this is not the console for you I'd

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.300 
this is not the console for you I'd
suggest<00:04:15.610> kind<00:04:15.940> of<00:04:16.000> I'm<00:04:16.180> pissed<00:04:16.570> off<00:04:16.780> eBay<00:04:17.310> but

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
know I mean it's nice it's small it

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.320 
know I mean it's nice it's small it
looks<00:04:50.500> cheaper<00:04:51.280> but<00:04:51.400> I<00:04:51.460> guess<00:04:51.640> it<00:04:51.790> it<00:04:52.000> is

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
looks cheaper but I guess it it is

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.480 
looks cheaper but I guess it it is
cheaper<00:04:52.840> so<00:04:53.530> one<00:04:53.680> thing<00:04:53.830> that's<00:04:53.950> strange<00:04:54.280> is

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
cheaper so one thing that's strange is

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.710 
cheaper so one thing that's strange is
that<00:04:54.669> if<00:04:54.760> you<00:04:54.880> open<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:55.180> console<00:04:55.479> when<00:04:55.600> it's

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
that if you open the console when it's

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.800 
that if you open the console when it's
laid<00:04:55.870> flat<00:04:56.140> the<00:04:57.010> top<00:04:57.220> things<00:04:57.640> open<00:04:58.060> rather

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
laid flat the top things open rather

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.500 
laid flat the top things open rather
like<00:04:59.169> a<00:04:59.200> kind<00:04:59.620> of<00:04:59.710> 80s<00:05:00.340> piece<00:05:00.820> of<00:05:01.000> technology

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
like proper kind of old-school like a

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.140

typewriter
like<00:05:04.900> it's<00:05:05.080> hard<00:05:05.200> Prosser<00:05:05.470> whereas<00:05:06.160> if<00:05:06.280> you

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
like it's hard Prosser whereas if you

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.020 
like it's hard Prosser whereas if you
stand<00:05:06.640> up<00:05:06.820> it<00:05:06.970> on<00:05:07.090> its<00:05:07.270> end<00:05:07.479> and<00:05:07.750> you<00:05:08.050> open<00:05:08.320> it

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
stand up it on its end and you open it

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.659 
stand up it on its end and you open it
it's<00:05:10.030> smooth<00:05:10.979> which<00:05:11.979> it<00:05:12.130> looks<00:05:12.310> a<00:05:12.370> lot<00:05:12.460> better

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669

it's smooth which it looks a lot better
I<00:05:12.729> don't<00:05:12.970> know<00:05:13.060> one<00:05:13.270> is<00:05:13.510> maybe<00:05:14.290> that's<00:05:14.470> gravity

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
I don't know one is maybe that's gravity

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.640 
I don't know one is maybe that's gravity
but<00:05:15.190> no<00:05:16.000> no<00:05:16.150> I<00:05:16.600> guess<00:05:16.810> my<00:05:16.960> main<00:05:17.140> concern<00:05:17.530> about

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
but no no I guess my main concern about

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.710 
but no no I guess my main concern about
this<00:05:17.860> is<00:05:18.039> the<00:05:18.160> actual<00:05:18.460> the<00:05:18.820> lid<00:05:19.000> itself<00:05:19.330> just

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
this is the actual the lid itself just

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.760 
this is the actual the lid itself just
feels<00:05:19.930> pretty<00:05:20.169> cheap

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
feels pretty cheap

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.130 
feels pretty cheap
it<00:05:21.190> literally<00:05:21.550> is<00:05:21.820> just<00:05:22.090> a<00:05:22.750> piece<00:05:22.930> of<00:05:22.960> plastic

that slides along the edge there's

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.670 
that slides along the edge there's
nothing<00:05:25.000> fancy<00:05:25.360> about<00:05:25.390> this<00:05:25.570> very<00:05:26.200> very<00:05:26.500> low

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680
