00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
phone stand and how was this made it's

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.209 
phone stand and how was this made it's
really<00:00:45.870> as<00:00:45.989> simple<00:00:46.020> as<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.860> know<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.100> this

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
really as simple as you know in this

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.279 
really as simple as you know in this
case<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.969> know<00:00:48.090> selecting<00:00:48.510> any<00:00:48.899> sort<00:00:49.200> of

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
case you know selecting any sort of

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.810 
case you know selecting any sort of
shape<00:00:49.590> whether<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.160> heart<00:00:50.489> whatever

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
shape whether it's heart whatever

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.260 
shape whether it's heart whatever
drawing<00:00:51.809> something<00:00:52.410> any<00:00:52.920> vector<00:00:53.789> shape<00:00:54.030> and

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
drawing something any vector shape and

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.450 
drawing something any vector shape and
then<00:00:54.480> extruding<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.440> that's<00:00:55.860> how<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.129> can

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
then extruding it and that's how you can

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.180 
then extruding it and that's how you can
obviously<00:00:56.940> make<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.600> shape<00:00:58.289> just<00:00:58.500> like<00:00:58.859> that

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
obviously make a shape just like that

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.860 
obviously make a shape just like that
I'm<00:00:59.370> gonna<00:00:59.460> delete<00:00:59.850> that<00:00:59.879> layer<00:01:00.239> because

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
I'm gonna delete that layer because

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.150 
I'm gonna delete that layer because
that's<00:01:01.050> already<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.410> place<00:01:01.590> that's<00:01:01.890> what<00:01:02.010> this

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
that's already in place that's what this

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.399 
that's already in place that's what this
stand<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:03.359> just<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.719> shape<00:01:04.140> that's

keep in mind this is actually a solid
shape<00:03:35.380> so<00:03:35.739> there's<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.040> certain<00:03:36.280> amount<00:03:36.430> of

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
shape so there's a certain amount of

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.970 
shape so there's a certain amount of
material<00:03:37.180> that's<00:03:37.209> being<00:03:37.570> used<00:03:37.810> there<00:03:38.290> and<00:03:38.530> we

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
material that's being used there and we

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.520 
material that's being used there and we
need<00:03:39.130> to<00:03:39.250> consider<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.880> size<00:03:40.209> of<00:03:40.600> it<00:03:40.840> because

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
need to consider the size of it because

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.759 
need to consider the size of it because
those<00:03:41.830> two<00:03:42.250> things<00:03:42.750> determine<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:44.470> price

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
those two things determine the price

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.100 
those two things determine the price
which<00:03:45.130> we'll<00:03:45.340> see<00:03:45.489> in<00:03:45.519> a<00:03:45.670> second<00:03:46.090> alright<00:03:46.930> so

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
which we'll see in a second alright so

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.100 
which we'll see in a second alright so
there<00:03:47.380> it<00:03:47.410> is<00:03:47.680> there's<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.640> phone<00:03:49.180> stand<00:03:49.780> you

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
there it is there's the phone stand you

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.020 
there it is there's the phone stand you
can<00:03:50.260> see<00:03:50.500> it<00:03:50.620> right<00:03:50.830> here<00:03:50.860> and<00:03:51.400> we<00:03:51.489> can<00:03:51.610> zoom<00:03:51.640> in

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
can see it right here and we can zoom in

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.360 
can see it right here and we can zoom in
on<00:03:52.180> it<00:03:52.360> a<00:03:52.540> couple<00:03:52.989> things<00:03:53.140> are<00:03:53.410> going<00:03:53.680> on<00:03:53.860> first

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
on it a couple things are going on first

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.370 
on it a couple things are going on first
of<00:03:54.519> all<00:03:54.640> notice<00:03:55.420> that<00:03:55.570> it's<00:03:55.840> mostly<00:03:56.110> green

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
of all notice that it's mostly green

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.080 
of all notice that it's mostly green
which<00:03:56.560> is<00:03:56.680> good<00:03:56.890> but<00:03:57.310> there's<00:03:57.519> some<00:03:57.730> blue<00:03:57.940> in

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
which is good but there's some blue in

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.370 
which is good but there's some blue in
there<00:03:58.269> which<00:03:58.450> means<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:58.900> walls<00:03:59.110> are

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
there which means the walls are

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.620 
there which means the walls are
thickened<00:03:59.830> so<00:04:00.040> if<00:04:00.160> you<00:04:00.310> have<00:04:00.549> parts<00:04:01.330> that<00:04:01.510> are

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
thickened so if you have parts that are

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.110 
thickened so if you have parts that are
really<00:04:01.660> thin<00:04:02.320> then<00:04:03.040> it<00:04:03.190> needs<00:04:03.340> to<00:04:03.459> thicken<00:04:04.000> it

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
really thin then it needs to thicken it

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.910 
really thin then it needs to thicken it
there<00:04:04.360> as<00:04:04.570> you<00:04:04.780> can<00:04:04.810> see<00:04:05.230> but<00:04:05.440> all<00:04:05.620> in<00:04:05.799> all

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
there as you can see but all in all

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.280 
there as you can see but all in all
looks<00:04:06.430> pretty<00:04:06.760> good<00:04:06.880> now<00:04:07.030> this<00:04:07.180> is<00:04:07.390> a<00:04:07.420> solid

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
looks pretty good now this is a solid

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.460 
looks pretty good now this is a solid
shape<00:04:08.709> so<00:04:08.980> it's<00:04:09.130> about<00:04:09.450> 2<00:04:10.450> inches<00:04:10.780> by<00:04:11.049> 3<00:04:11.440> inches

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
shape so it's about 2 inches by 3 inches

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.449 
shape so it's about 2 inches by 3 inches
by<00:04:12.280> maybe<00:04:12.640> another<00:04:12.880> 3<00:04:13.329> inches<00:04:13.360> and<00:04:14.110> it's<00:04:14.709> solid

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
by maybe another 3 inches and it's solid

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.880 
by maybe another 3 inches and it's solid
material<00:04:16.150> so<00:04:16.329> it's<00:04:16.450> quite<00:04:16.810> large<00:04:17.229> and<00:04:17.620> that's

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
material so it's quite large and that's

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.960 
material so it's quite large and that's
why<00:04:18.130> it's<00:04:18.959> $59<00:04:19.959> ok<00:04:20.370> just<00:04:21.370> so<00:04:21.520> you<00:04:21.640> know<00:04:21.669> the

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
why it's $59 ok just so you know the

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.640 
why it's $59 ok just so you know the
iPhone<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.570> stand<00:04:22.840> that<00:04:23.020> I<00:04:23.140> showed<00:04:23.410> earlier

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
iPhone the stand that I showed earlier

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.260 
iPhone the stand that I showed earlier
was<00:04:24.310> only

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
was only

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.770 
was only
about<00:04:25.990> $20<00:04:26.979> but<00:04:27.370> in<00:04:27.490> general<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.240> idea<00:04:28.270> here

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
about $20 but in general the idea here

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.800 
about $20 but in general the idea here
would<00:04:28.900> be<00:04:29.050> to<00:04:29.319> thin<00:04:29.710> this<00:04:30.130> up<00:04:30.400> that<00:04:31.060> extrusion

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
would be to thin this up that extrusion

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.930 
would be to thin this up that extrusion
but<00:04:32.199> you<00:04:32.319> can<00:04:32.470> always<00:04:32.800> do<00:04:33.190> that<00:04:33.370> later<00:04:33.610> either

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
but you can always do that later either

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.379 
but you can always do that later either
way<00:04:34.300> you<00:04:34.780> can<00:04:34.900> export<00:04:35.229> out<00:04:35.440> that<00:04:35.889> particular

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
way you can export out that particular

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.930 
way you can export out that particular
STL<00:04:37.389> file<00:04:37.810> locate<00:04:38.770> it<00:04:38.949> and<00:04:39.130> upload<00:04:39.580> it<00:04:39.610> to

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
STL file locate it and upload it to

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.120 
STL file locate it and upload it to
Shapeways<00:04:40.599> as<00:04:40.810> I'm<00:04:41.110> doing<00:04:41.349> right<00:04:41.530> now<00:04:41.590> while

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
Shapeways as I'm doing right now while

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.499 
Shapeways as I'm doing right now while
that's<00:04:42.400> happening<00:04:42.610> I'm<00:04:42.970> going<00:04:43.060> to<00:04:43.150> click<00:04:43.330> back

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
that's happening I'm going to click back

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.210 
that's happening I'm going to click back
over<00:04:43.930> and<00:04:44.080> I'm<00:04:44.139> just<00:04:44.319> going<00:04:44.470> to<00:04:44.500> show<00:04:44.800> you<00:04:44.860> how

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
over and I'm just going to show you how

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.969 
over and I'm just going to show you how
you<00:04:45.280> can<00:04:45.610> change<00:04:45.849> the<00:04:46.000> extrusion<00:04:46.740> for<00:04:47.740> that

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
you can change the extrusion for that

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.240 
you can change the extrusion for that
particular<00:04:48.250> shape<00:04:49.030> so<00:04:49.509> for<00:04:50.440> the<00:04:50.650> stand

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
particular shape so for the stand

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.520 
particular shape so for the stand
it's<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.759> extrusion<00:04:52.240> depth<00:04:52.750> right<00:04:53.050> over<00:04:53.259> here

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
it's the extrusion depth right over here

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.409 
it's the extrusion depth right over here
instead<00:04:54.099> of<00:04:54.190> it<00:04:54.370> being<00:04:54.400> one<00:04:54.789> inch<00:04:54.970> maybe<00:04:55.330> I

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
instead of it being one inch maybe I

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.839 
instead of it being one inch maybe I
want<00:04:55.599> to<00:04:55.660> go<00:04:55.720> a<00:04:55.750> half<00:04:56.080> of<00:04:56.380> an<00:04:56.500> inch<00:04:56.620> alright<00:04:57.370> so

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
want to go a half of an inch alright so

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.990 
want to go a half of an inch alright so
let's<00:04:58.030> take<00:04:58.210> a<00:04:58.270> look<00:04:58.539> sure<00:04:59.500> enough<00:04:59.800> here<00:05:00.789> is

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
let's take a look sure enough here is

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.930 
let's take a look sure enough here is
the<00:05:01.419> phone<00:05:01.960> stand<00:05:02.560> so<00:05:03.160> really<00:05:03.430> it's<00:05:03.610> just<00:05:03.699> a

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
the phone stand so really it's just a

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.939 
the phone stand so really it's just a
matter<00:05:03.970> of<00:05:04.330> even<00:05:04.479> changing<00:05:05.229> your<00:05:05.259> mind<00:05:05.590> you

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
matter of even changing your mind you

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:07.290 
matter of even changing your mind you
don't<00:05:05.979> have<00:05:06.250> to<00:05:06.310> go<00:05:06.400> with<00:05:06.430> the<00:05:06.669> red<00:05:06.880> color<00:05:07.150> you

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
don't have to go with the red color you

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.510 
don't have to go with the red color you
can<00:05:07.419> go<00:05:07.479> with<00:05:07.630> any<00:05:07.810> color<00:05:07.930> any<00:05:08.680> material<00:05:09.490> you

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
can go with any color any material you

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.810 
can go with any color any material you
select<00:05:10.150> it<00:05:10.270> on<00:05:10.449> the<00:05:10.570> shape<00:05:10.780> way<00:05:10.960> site<00:05:11.289> and<00:05:11.820> then

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
select it on the shape way site and then

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.420 
select it on the shape way site and then
submit<00:05:13.630> it<00:05:13.810> and<00:05:14.169> it<00:05:14.560> will<00:05:14.710> be<00:05:14.830> sent<00:05:15.070> to<00:05:15.190> your

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
submit it and it will be sent to your

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.599 
submit it and it will be sent to your
house<00:05:15.729> when<00:05:16.120> it's<00:05:16.300> ready
