a<00:01:23.369> bit<00:01:23.549> started<00:01:23.939> by<00:01:24.000> considering<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.689> fan

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
a bit started by considering that fan

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.080 
a bit started by considering that fan
from<00:01:25.170> their<00:01:25.350> ways<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.530> 2<00:01:26.250> ounces<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:26.880> one

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
from their ways and 2 ounces this one

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:35.200 
from their ways and 2 ounces this one
weighs<00:01:27.770> 20<00:01:28.770> or<00:01:28.860> 30<00:01:29.159> it's<00:01:29.700> pretty<00:01:29.970> heavy<00:01:33.680> so<00:01:34.680> it

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
weighs 20 or 30 it's pretty heavy so it

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.260 
weighs 20 or 30 it's pretty heavy so it
seems<00:01:36.210> like<00:01:36.329> it's<00:01:36.450> got<00:01:36.600> some<00:01:36.750> still<00:01:37.049> under<00:01:37.500> it

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
seems like it's got some still under it

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.050 
seems like it's got some still under it
it's<00:01:39.270> probably<00:01:39.540> just<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> fan<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:41.310> fans<00:01:41.610> very

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
it's probably just the fan the fans very

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.840 
it's probably just the fan the fans very
heavy<00:01:42.299> duty<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.500> figure<00:01:44.310> it's<00:01:44.430> really

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
heavy duty in it so I figure it's really

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.080 
heavy duty in it so I figure it's really
nice<00:01:45.060> really<00:01:45.689> nice<00:01:45.930> fan<00:01:46.610> so<00:01:47.610> I'm<00:01:47.759> going<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:47.939> go

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
ahead and switch the one out and come

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.580 
ahead and switch the one out and come
with<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.740> case<00:01:50.000> even<00:01:51.000> though<00:01:51.149> I'm<00:01:51.630> guessing

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
with this case even though I'm guessing

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.550 
with this case even though I'm guessing
it's<00:01:52.740> probably<00:01:52.890> very<00:01:53.130> nice<00:01:53.610> too<00:01:53.990> but<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.320> one

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.630 
i'm going to use both hands apparently
they're<00:02:27.239> plastic<00:02:28.049> but<00:02:28.819> they<00:02:29.819> are<00:02:30.030> vented<00:02:30.569> so

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
they're plastic but they are vented so

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.880 
they're plastic but they are vented so
and<00:02:32.640> it'd<00:02:33.120> be<00:02:33.720> nice<00:02:33.900> waste<00:02:34.140> such<00:02:34.319> a<00:02:34.349> drive<00:02:34.680> down

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
and it'd be nice waste such a drive down

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.539 
and it'd be nice waste such a drive down
in<00:02:35.099> here<00:02:35.870> slide<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:37.049> in<00:02:37.170> lock<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.709> it's<00:02:38.040> very

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
in here slide it in lock it it's very

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.879 
in here slide it in lock it it's very
easy<00:02:41.599> but<00:02:42.599> I'm<00:02:42.750> gonna<00:02:42.870> family<00:02:43.230> bed<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.680> switch

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
easy but I'm gonna family bed and switch

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:51.679 
easy but I'm gonna family bed and switch
this<00:02:44.069> out<00:02:44.329> here's<00:02:45.329> the<00:02:49.909> water<00:02:50.909> pump<00:02:51.450> and

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:51.689 
this out here's the water pump and

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:58.099 
this out here's the water pump and
radiator<00:02:52.500> for<00:02:56.599> I'm<00:02:57.599> going<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.780> go<00:02:57.870> ahead<00:02:57.900> and

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
radiator for I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.550 
radiator for I'm going to go ahead and
start<00:02:58.260> trying<00:02:58.439> to<00:02:58.530> put<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.739> motherboard<00:02:59.250> in

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
start trying to put the motherboard in

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.030 
start trying to put the motherboard in
it<00:03:01.560> shows<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:03.139> this<00:03:04.139> whole<00:03:04.349> backing<00:03:04.799> comes

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
it shows that this whole backing comes

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.190 
it shows that this whole backing comes
out<00:03:05.280> but<00:03:05.909> I'm<00:03:06.090> probably<00:03:06.419> not<00:03:06.720> going<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:06.959> mess

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
out but I'm probably not going to mess

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.740 
out but I'm probably not going to mess
with<00:03:07.409> it<00:03:07.579> I'm<00:03:08.579> probably<00:03:09.120> just<00:03:09.269> going<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.569> set

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
with it I'm probably just going to set

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.569 
with it I'm probably just going to set
the<00:03:09.840> motherboard<00:03:10.260> down<00:03:10.439> on<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:10.739> start<00:03:11.430> from

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
the motherboard down on it start from

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.179 
the motherboard down on it start from
there<00:03:11.930> but<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.049> shows<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.319> can<00:03:13.530> take<00:03:13.769> this<00:03:13.919> out

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
there but it shows you can take this out

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.399 
there but it shows you can take this out
and<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:14.909> know<00:03:15.090> hook<00:03:15.299> everything<00:03:15.599> up<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.349> then

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
and you know hook everything up and then

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.960 
and you know hook everything up and then
set<00:03:16.949> it<00:03:16.979> back<00:03:17.159> in<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.430> case<00:03:19.519> but<00:03:20.519> I<00:03:20.579> think<00:03:20.849> I've

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
set it back in the case but I think I've

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.899 
set it back in the case but I think I've
tied<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.239> other<00:03:21.389> side<00:03:21.599> off<00:03:22.549> because<00:03:23.549> I<00:03:23.669> think

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
tied the other side off because I think

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.809 
tied the other side off because I think
it<00:03:24.090> lays<00:03:24.389> back<00:03:24.810> in<00:03:25.049> like<00:03:25.229> this<00:03:25.729> everything<00:03:26.729> is

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
it lays back in like this everything is

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.780 
it lays back in like this everything is
very<00:03:26.849> sturdy<00:03:27.359> in<00:03:27.599> here<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.930> very<00:03:28.919> nice<00:03:29.159> i<00:03:29.430> like
