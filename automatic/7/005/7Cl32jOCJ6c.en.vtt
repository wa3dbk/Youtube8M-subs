possession I was passing it very very
fast<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.430> felt<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.730> he<00:00:50.940> was<00:00:50.969> trying<00:00:51.210> to

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
fast and I felt that he was trying to

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.540 
fast and I felt that he was trying to
mimic<00:00:51.539> my<00:00:52.260> style<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.680> play<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.860> get<00:00:53.160> back<00:00:53.340> into

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
mimic my style of play to get back into

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.610 
mimic my style of play to get back into
it<00:00:53.670> he<00:00:53.940> knew<00:00:54.059> he<00:00:54.180> was<00:00:54.300> under<00:00:54.480> pressure<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.289> he

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
it he knew he was under pressure and he

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.830 
it he knew he was under pressure and he
was<00:00:55.770> rushing<00:00:56.219> his<00:00:56.399> passes<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.210> really<00:00:57.690> that

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
was rushing his passes and really that

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.630 
was rushing his passes and really that
just<00:00:58.020> gave<00:00:58.140> me<00:00:58.199> more<00:00:58.350> sort<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.770> ammunition<00:00:59.160> to

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
just gave me more sort of ammunition to

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.580 
just gave me more sort of ammunition to
attack<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.510> control<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.989> game<00:01:01.140> even<00:01:01.559> more

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
attack and control the game even more

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.470 
attack and control the game even more
and<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.190> kind<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.489> felt<00:01:02.699> bad<00:01:02.760> for<00:01:03.120> him<00:01:03.180> because<00:01:03.300> I

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
and I kind of felt bad for him because I

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.119 
and I kind of felt bad for him because I
don't<00:01:03.960> think<00:01:04.140> he<00:01:04.229> was<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.409> best<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.890> players

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
don't think he was the best of players

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.940 
don't think he was the best of players
but<00:01:05.400> i<00:01:05.700> think<00:01:06.000> he<00:01:06.150> was<00:01:06.299> sort<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.020> i<00:01:07.290> don't<00:01:07.740> know

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
but i think he was sort of i don't know

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.380 
but i think he was sort of i don't know
me<00:01:08.130> he<00:01:08.460> probably<00:01:08.670> didn't<00:01:08.970> play<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.210> game<00:01:09.360> for

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
me he probably didn't play the game for

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.760 
me he probably didn't play the game for
a<00:01:09.630> long<00:01:09.750> time<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.049> he<00:01:10.290> didn't<00:01:10.500> know<00:01:10.560> what<00:01:10.740> he

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
a long time and he didn't know what he

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.070 
a long time and he didn't know what he
was<00:01:10.979> doing<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.520> don't<00:01:12.060> think<00:01:12.119> he<00:01:12.330> was<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.510> noob<00:01:12.810> I

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
how he's seeing more of the ball then

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.000 
how he's seeing more of the ball then

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
but what the hell was that look at this

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.030 
but what the hell was that look at this
it<00:04:18.380> was<00:04:18.950> so<00:04:19.190> AV<00:04:19.580> I<00:04:19.790> felt<00:04:20.239> bad<00:04:20.450> for<00:04:20.720> him<00:04:20.840> he

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
reason behind that is because he tackled

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.780 
reason behind that is because he tackled
me<00:04:24.200> and<00:04:24.230> then<00:04:24.560> your<00:04:24.680> goalkeeper<00:04:24.830> can't<00:04:25.640> pick

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
me and then your goalkeeper can't pick

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.270 
me and then your goalkeeper can't pick
it<00:04:25.880> up<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:26.390> then<00:04:27.890> like<00:04:28.100> that<00:04:28.130> happens

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280
