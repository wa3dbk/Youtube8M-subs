00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.600
 Again and again they were on the stage 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.210
 been called when it was all over 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.250
 and a memorable ballet night 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.250
 so moodily ended 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.080
 had a good two hours before 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.150
 ballet director yankow his 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.990
 dancers one last thing 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.090
 Let's have a look at this extraordinary evening 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.509
 sworn in and then it worked 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.509
 go ahead 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.620
 One and a half years ago, the idea became reality 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.860
 born this rock ballet for a while 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.080
 year worked on the implementation 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.430
 stage design costumes choreography and 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.430
 of course the music 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.260
 all this music selection was too 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.589
 not experienced 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.570
 that means over hundreds of leaders and 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:06.270
 You have to search for and find suitable ones 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.920
 fitness for every scene that the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.070
 geography and dances 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.360
 at the same time feel good and the audience too 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.360
 interesting to see that wise 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.950
 janko has become a big part of 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.950
 music decided by rammstein 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.740
 It is the first dance project ever 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.659
 that the band's music is their musician 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.210
 partly from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.210
 come to this extent uses 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:50.180
 the compaq and mexico line up 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.720
 refrain from time is that you sing 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.720
 can this be here 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.700
 a ballet with such a kind of 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.469
 music has guided god and the 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.649
 experienced over and over again in the past weeks 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:08.280
 must demand for svajlen a whole 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.280
 other work 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.290
 sometimes not sometimes that is so 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.349
 music copes with the one not suitable 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.450
 steps and I also have 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:25.550
 searched some pieces for quite a long time 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.550
 and I hope I found something 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.240
 god jokus paletta strong on magic 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.700
 the pictures is actually one 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.240
 love story better a dear 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.240
 conflict 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:46.769
 a woman between two men and in 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:49.370
 the consequence rivalry jealousy hate murder 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.370
 and mourning 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.239
 it is a collection more human 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.750
 abysses 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.860
 but in the end they are all back 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.549
 dancing against the backdrop of the schweriner 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:04.120
 closed her happily exuberant 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.120
 highway to hell 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.410
 and maybe that's how it tells us 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:24.190
 Anyway, this fairy tale was everything 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.190
 a bad dream
