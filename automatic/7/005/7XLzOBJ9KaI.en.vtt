00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:11.820
 five ideas from the book success with 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.070
 Residential Property by thomas knedel idea 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.740
 number one is a good credit rating 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.359
 headstone as an investor so that we 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.039
 being able to be good at all 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.230
 to make real estate investments 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.260
 do we need a mortgage loan from 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.720
 the bank judged to receive this 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.949
 the bank our personal credit rating 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.900
 among other things, based on ours 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.660
 budget statement and ours 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.790
 asset situation these two factors 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.649
 weights and evaluates the bank and 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.469
 derives the assessment of our 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.079
 Personal credit from our goal must 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.629
 It is therefore a best possible bank 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.700
 rating banks need for 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.360
 According to experience, this process has six 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.430
 months 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.789
 We start with the budget statement 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.890
 on a monthly basis by ours 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.020
 net receipts of our net expenses 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.809
 Opposites are revenue issues 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.609
 greater than zero great now to assets 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.100
 Survey here it is ours 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.240
 our liabilities 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.780
 value assets to face 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.710
 This means all our first 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.049
 to list assets 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.530
 such as cash bank account 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.299
 daily allowances securities 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.520
 precious metals real estate etc 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.140
 on the other side we put ours 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.750
 liabilities at about 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.590
 Credit debts for cars sofa or 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.509
 watch TV 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.189
 the difference is ours 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.590
 net worth this value is 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.880
 hopefully also positive if yes 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.040
 We take the first step in the direction 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.640
 our first property successful 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.240
 done 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.370
 Id number two a good one 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.290
 investment strategy is 10 3 it 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.240
 There are numerous real estate strategies 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.400
 and everyone can find their strategy 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.170
 It makes sense that we should therefore 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.510
 deal with several strategies 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.270
 A very good strategy is the emo 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.220
 Mark pay 10 3 both strategy 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.140
 two periods in years the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.390
 have an impact on our taxes 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.430
 the ten comes about that 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.380
 if we have a property after one 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.509
 sell period of ten years 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.920
 We can provide the full sales revenue 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.050
 collect tax-free 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.850
 the three refers to that when 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.370
 We look after the property for more than three 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.360
 years of intensive renovations , the 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.130
 so-called propensity not in 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.810
 the combination of the facts 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.880
 there is great potential 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.010
 this means for us that we at the 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.750
 Property search best for objects 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.280
 look for those with occasional 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.290
 Repairs for a while 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.420
 work if we have the property 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.610
 then at least ten years our 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.370
 we own from the 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.140
 This strategy has both tax reasons 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.989
 proved very successful because they are easy 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.299
 But it can also be implemented in the long term and 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:50.110
 cash flow oriented is the emo 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:52.329
 Strategy 10 3 is an ideal state 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.150
 Promoted combination of the strategy 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:58.180
 keep in existence and one or 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.849
 several optimization strategies 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.469
 Idea number three at the acquisition exam 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.540
 applies mass instead of class 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:06.609
 We still have a few properties 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.060
 researched and now want more concrete 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.250
 become 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.829
 The purpose of the purchase review 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.569
 is as pragmatic as possible and before 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.389
 all swift review of us so far 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.889
 known real estate data an important 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:20.709
 formula for the value of a property 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:23.170
 easy to determine is the broker form 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.989
 an example a one room apartment 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.010
 was for a purchase price of 74,000 euros 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.689
 offered 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.049
 she was in a reasonable condition 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:33.220
 and just become free so 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.290
 calculatory as possible rent the 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.269
 market rent could be set 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.120
 these were ten euros per square meter 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.340
 living space and 35 euros for the 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.439
 Pitch with the from the exposé 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.689
 known living area of ​​43 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:48.430
 square meters can be quickly the 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:50.040
 annual rent for the apartment and the 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.599
 Determine parking space 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.530
 rental price flat ten euro per 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.980
 square meters 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:00.819
 43 square meters makes 430 euro 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:05.669
 rental price parking space 35 euros total rent 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:08.590
 net cold 465 euros x 12 months 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:10.180
 5580 euros per annum with the 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.220
 net rent we charge the 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.979
 preliminary estimated value of the apartment 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.810
 with the help of a multiplier of the 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:18.760
 Multiplier is the factor on the 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.989
 annual rent with the value of 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.729
 property is calculated 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.139
 in certain regions, this value is 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.300
 in the middle at 15 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.479
 this means net rental income for the year 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:33.599
 times multiplier equals market value in 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:36.940
 concrete case 5580 euro x 15 equals 83 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:39.610
 1700 euro the property has one 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.310
 approximate market value of 84,000 euros 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.740
 The multiplier is a variable in 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.680
 the different circumstances flow in like 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.539
 eg the location and the property itself the 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.740
 multiplier is one of the most important 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:54.169
 pay for each investor 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.030
 Idea number four without finance 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.550
 we will not be able to buy real estate 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.220
 when we enter the phase of the first idea one 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.780
 Acquire the preliminary examination the detailed 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.220
 purchase audit and finally the 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.560
 preliminary decision for a specific one 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.840
 have undergone property now stands 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.490
 the secondary deal on the place because 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.139
 Without financing we will not 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.389
 can buy only real estate 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:17.180
 real estate deal and financing 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:19.220
 canyon is compulsory from each other therefore 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.900
 it is of fundamental importance that we 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.240
 us already in the early stages of the 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.220
 real estate acquisition in detail with 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.349
 to deal with real estate financing 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.330
 besides updating ours 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:31.460
 Convention and assets lineup 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.289
 We have to think about the forums 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.740
 the desired financing structure 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:35.289
 do 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.880
 we take the 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:40.400
 total investment costs so purchase price 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.470
 the property plus ancillary purchase costs plus 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.169
 renovation or renovation 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.060
 and deduct from the amount we pay 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:48.889
 want to invest from their own pocket 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.960
 the remaining amount is that 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:51.800
 debt that we at the bank 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.500
 need to record 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.500
 Now we are sufficiently prepared for 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.610
 the first bank appointment for ours 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.050
 financing projects 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.940
 having already been in the 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.219
 Preparation phase contact to several 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.710
 We must have taken up banks 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:07.909
 this contact with these conversations only 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.009
 to intensify 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:11.860
 the decisive factor is our long-term 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:15.110
 are proportionate to several banks 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.449
 insofar as it is highly advisable that we 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.430
 Our respective bankers always cherish and 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.340
 care for 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.950
 idea number five the indispensable 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.550
 helper in the day-to-day business 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.980
 finally it goes to the actual 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.110
 real estate works because everything we do 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.820
 So far, it has only been about the 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.190
 Procurement of real estate turned 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.750
 after we finally got our property 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.550
 we want to call this one 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.140
 manage it well 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.390
 developed and thrived 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.820
 this is best done with one 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:44.560
 expert team from a property manager 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.110
 an architect and a 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.300
 tax consultant is the property manager 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.100
 indispensable and will henceforth 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.860
 be the most important service providers 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.630
 He is the central contact person and 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.980
 especially the first contact person for 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.380
 all concerning the house 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.370
 matters and this may well 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.350
 be many 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.060
 always when it gets technically tricky 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.710
 we come to an experienced 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.840
 architects do not go around 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.570
 For example, it can happen that 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.410
 major repairs or 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.760
 apartment renovations planned and 

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.100
 must be budgeted 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.790
 Also, a good architect helps one 

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:20.400
 to set up sound maintenance plan 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:22.210
 especially if we have an older one 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.430
 Purchased property in need of repair 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.830
 have in addition to the creation of the 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.480
 we need annual tax returns 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.550
 the tax adviser to us at the 

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.180
 to help correct tax strategy 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:35.410
 as a budding or already active 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.990
 We will be the property investor in the future 

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:40.480
 no longer without proper strategy 

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:42.280
 we have to plan and control and do this 

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.250
 we can only if we understand 

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:47.740
 what we do 

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:49.960
 these were five ideas from the book success 

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.940
 with residential properties by thomas göbel
