00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
it's pretty lightweight but I think it

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.810 
it's pretty lightweight but I think it
could<00:02:28.510> work<00:02:28.570> for<00:02:29.320> like<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.650> fun<00:02:29.920> snack<00:02:30.100> tray<00:02:30.490> or

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.330 
could work for like a fun snack tray or
for<00:02:31.150> breakfast<00:02:31.660> so<00:02:32.650> I'm<00:02:32.740> going<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.040> use<00:02:33.160> this

for breakfast so I'm going to use this
and<00:02:33.610> also<00:02:33.820> could<00:02:34.330> be<00:02:36.120> decorative<00:02:37.120> as<00:02:37.420> well<00:02:37.660> for

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
and also could be decorative as well for

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.440 
and also could be decorative as well for
fruit<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:38.980> stuff<00:02:39.340> like<00:02:39.460> that<00:02:39.610> so<00:02:39.640> I'm<00:02:40.240> gonna

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450
