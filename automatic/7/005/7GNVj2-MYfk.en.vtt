00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.850 

I<00:00:00.060> figured<00:00:00.750> it's<00:00:00.900> been<00:00:01.050> a<00:00:01.079> while<00:00:01.319> since<00:00:01.530> I<00:00:01.680> done

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
I figured it's been a while since I done

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.280 
I figured it's been a while since I done
a<00:00:01.890> list<00:00:02.159> involving<00:00:02.580> something<00:00:02.820> with<00:00:03.030> smash<00:00:03.300> so

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
a list involving something with smash so

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.869 
a list involving something with smash so
I<00:00:04.319> thought<00:00:04.620> why<00:00:04.799> not<00:00:05.009> talk<00:00:05.279> about<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.730> most

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
I thought why not talk about the most

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.030 
I thought why not talk about the most
powerful<00:00:06.150> attack<00:00:06.720> in<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.020> game<00:00:07.200> you<00:00:07.859> know

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
powerful attack in the game you know

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.169 
powerful attack in the game you know
what<00:00:08.069> I'm<00:00:08.280> talking<00:00:08.670> about

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
what I'm talking about

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.959 
what I'm talking about
the<00:00:09.420> final<00:00:09.929> smash<00:00:10.370> now<00:00:11.370> decided<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.820> break

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
the final smash now decided to break

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.669 
the final smash now decided to break
this<00:00:12.150> list<00:00:12.450> down<00:00:12.630> into<00:00:12.929> two<00:00:13.080> separate<00:00:13.410> parts

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
this list down into two separate parts

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.709 
this list down into two separate parts
the<00:00:14.370> first<00:00:14.400> part<00:00:14.730> I'll<00:00:15.000> talk<00:00:15.150> about<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.450> five

the first part I'll talk about the five
final<00:00:16.139> smashes<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.740> thought<00:00:16.980> were<00:00:17.100> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
final smashes that I thought were the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.429 
final smashes that I thought were the
best<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.760> in<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.449> second<00:00:18.810> part<00:00:19.020> I'll<00:00:19.260> talk

best and in the second part I'll talk
about<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.740> five<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.160> thought<00:00:20.340> were<00:00:20.490> the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
about the five that I thought were the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.450 
about the five that I thought were the
worst<00:00:21.090> now<00:00:22.050> even<00:00:22.619> if<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.800> plays<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.220> character

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
worst now even if I plays the character

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.910 
worst now even if I plays the character
or<00:00:23.820> not<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.480> doesn't<00:00:24.840> matter<00:00:24.869> what<00:00:25.380> matters<00:00:25.740> is

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
or not it doesn't matter what matters is

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.070 
or not it doesn't matter what matters is

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
how well designed or horribly made these

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.529

end there's only one word to describe

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.780 
end there's only one word to describe
how<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.120> feel<00:01:03.360> after<00:01:03.630> using<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.260> attack

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.750 

satisfy<00:01:09.650> not<00:01:10.650> only<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.250> it's<00:01:11.400> just<00:01:11.520> so

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
satisfy not only that but it's just so

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.340 
satisfy not only that but it's just so
awesome<00:01:12.030> just<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.480> look<00:01:12.660> in<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.900> mad<00:01:13.020> at<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
awesome just to look in a mad at the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.810 
awesome just to look in a mad at the
opponent<00:01:13.710> while<00:01:13.800> they're<00:01:13.980> trapped<00:01:16.820> yeah

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
opponent while they're trapped yeah

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.550 
opponent while they're trapped yeah
Lincoln<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.660> me<00:01:18.870> kind<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.140> do<00:01:19.230> the<00:01:19.350> same<00:01:19.380> thing

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
Lincoln to me kind of do the same thing

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.219 
Lincoln to me kind of do the same thing
too<00:01:19.920> but<00:01:20.220> mike<00:01:21.180> has<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.570> ability<00:01:21.870> to<00:01:21.990> trap

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
too but mike has the ability to trap

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.840 
too but mike has the ability to trap
three<00:01:22.530> people<00:01:22.920> at<00:01:23.010> once<00:01:25.400> the<00:01:26.400> only<00:01:26.550> reason

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
three people at once the only reason

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.250 
three people at once the only reason
it's<00:01:27.000> not<00:01:27.030> higher<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.570> list<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:27.930> because

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
it's not higher on the list is because

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:36.990 
it's not higher on the list is because
the<00:01:28.380> range<00:01:28.650> could<00:01:28.860> make<00:01:29.010> it<00:01:29.160> work<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:31.700> low

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.180 

when<00:01:37.870> you<00:01:38.020> see<00:01:38.200> someone<00:01:38.410> else<00:01:38.650> get<00:01:38.830> the<00:01:38.950> Smash

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
when you see someone else get the Smash

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.710 
when you see someone else get the Smash
Ball<00:01:39.430> there's<00:01:39.700> only<00:01:39.850> one<00:01:40.120> thought<00:01:40.330> that<00:01:40.390> comes

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
Ball there's only one thought that comes

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.170 
Ball there's only one thought that comes
into<00:01:40.900> your<00:01:40.990> mind<00:01:41.080> immediately<00:01:41.470> get<00:01:42.400> away<00:01:42.940> from

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
into your mind immediately get away from

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.240 
into your mind immediately get away from
the<00:01:43.300> opponent<00:01:43.510> as<00:01:43.810> soon<00:01:44.080> as<00:01:44.230> possible<00:01:44.770> and

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
the opponent as soon as possible and

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.290 
the opponent as soon as possible and
that's<00:01:45.340> exactly<00:01:45.910> what<00:01:46.030> you're<00:01:46.120> going<00:01:46.210> to

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
that's exactly what you're going to

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.390 
that's exactly what you're going to
think<00:01:46.540> of<00:01:46.720> when<00:01:46.990> you<00:01:47.140> see<00:01:47.320> someone<00:01:47.740> get<00:01:48.040> Rob's

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
think of when you see someone get Rob's

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.990 
think of when you see someone get Rob's
final<00:01:48.910> smash<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.960> diffusion<00:01:50.650> being<00:01:51.000> the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
final smash the diffusion being the

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.040 
final smash the diffusion being the
reason<00:01:52.270> why<00:01:52.360> you<00:01:52.420> want<00:01:52.660> to<00:01:52.720> get<00:01:52.780> away<00:01:52.930> is

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
reason why you want to get away is

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.510 
reason why you want to get away is
because<00:01:53.320> it<00:01:53.470> only<00:01:53.560> works<00:01:53.920> in<00:01:54.070> such<00:01:54.250> a<00:01:54.280> short

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
because it only works in such a short

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.200 
because it only works in such a short
