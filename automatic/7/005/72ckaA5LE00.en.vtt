hey<00:00:20.250> got<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> table<00:00:21.000> full<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.210> bearings<00:00:21.869> here<00:00:22.109> at

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
hey got a table full of bearings here at

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.450 
hey got a table full of bearings here at
least<00:00:22.380> that's<00:00:22.590> what<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:22.769> think<00:00:22.890> since<00:00:23.310> we're

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
least that's what I think since we're

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.609 
least that's what I think since we're
talking<00:00:23.609> about<00:00:23.850> bearing<00:00:24.420> failures<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.140> why

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
talking about bearing failures so why

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.380 
talking about bearing failures so why
don't<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.830> explain<00:00:26.400> what<00:00:26.550> we<00:00:26.640> got<00:00:26.789> going<00:00:27.150> well

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
don't you explain what we got going well

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.849 
don't you explain what we got going well
today<00:00:27.539> we're<00:00:27.840> going<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.109> discuss<00:00:28.230> common

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
today we're going to discuss common

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.410 
today we're going to discuss common
bearing<00:00:29.429> failures<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:29.970> how<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.090> avoid<00:00:30.359> them

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
bearing failures and how to avoid them

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.870 
bearing failures and how to avoid them
okay<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.199> where<00:00:31.590> do<00:00:31.679> we<00:00:31.710> start<00:00:32.009> well<00:00:32.369> before<00:00:32.759> we

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
okay so where do we start well before we

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.370 
okay so where do we start well before we
start<00:00:33.120> looking<00:00:33.270> at<00:00:33.510> some<00:00:33.719> specific<00:00:33.989> examples

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
start looking at some specific examples

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.799 
start looking at some specific examples
it's<00:00:35.040> important<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.610> understand<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.360> reasons

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
it's important to understand the reasons

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.170 
it's important to understand the reasons
for<00:00:36.899> bearing<00:00:37.290> failure<00:00:37.620> most<00:00:38.460> bearings<00:00:39.000> fail

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
for bearing failure most bearings fail

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.270 
for bearing failure most bearings fail
for<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.450> variety<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:40.020> reasons<00:00:40.620> before<00:00:40.829> reaching

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
for a variety of reasons before reaching

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.860 
for a variety of reasons before reaching
their<00:00:41.520> potential<00:00:41.850> life<00:00:42.149> but<00:00:42.450> many<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.780> those

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
their potential life but many of those

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.080 
their potential life but many of those
reasons<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.530> be<00:00:43.649> avoided<00:00:43.890> for<00:00:44.610> example

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
reasons can be avoided for example

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.330 
reasons can be avoided for example
something<00:00:45.570> as<00:00:45.750> simple<00:00:45.930> as<00:00:46.200> taking<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.860> bearing

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
something as simple as taking a bearing

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.709 
something as simple as taking a bearing
and<00:00:47.489> setting<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.910> down<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> dirty<00:00:48.480> work

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
and setting it down on a dirty work

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.779 
and setting it down on a dirty work
surface<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.469> greatly<00:00:49.710> reduce<00:00:49.920> its<00:00:50.219> life<00:00:50.370> kind

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
surface can greatly reduce its life kind

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.130 
surface can greatly reduce its life kind
of<00:00:50.879> like<00:00:50.969> your<00:00:51.120> sandwich<00:00:51.510> at<00:00:51.629> lunchtime<00:00:52.020> you

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
of like your sandwich at lunchtime you

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.420 
of like your sandwich at lunchtime you
don't<00:00:52.260> want<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.440> do<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.680> no<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.100> doesn't

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
don't want to do that no it doesn't

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.069 
don't want to do that no it doesn't
usually<00:00:53.640> taste<00:00:53.820> very<00:00:53.969> good<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.420> avoiding

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
usually taste very good and avoiding

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.290 
usually taste very good and avoiding
bearing<00:00:55.410> failure<00:00:55.890> could<00:00:56.280> save<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.670> downtime

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
bearing failure could save you downtime

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.299 
bearing failure could save you downtime
lost<00:00:57.840> production<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.649> affects<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.070> bottom

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
lost production that affects the bottom

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.580 
lost production that affects the bottom
line<00:00:59.460> yeah<00:01:00.059> that's<00:01:00.300> right<00:01:00.420> Tom<00:01:00.690> but<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
line yeah that's right Tom but the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.619 
line yeah that's right Tom but the
majority<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.219> failures<00:01:02.699> have<00:01:02.910> little<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.480> do

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
majority of failures have little to do

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.990 
majority of failures have little to do
with<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.960> bearing<00:01:04.290> itself<00:01:05.000> controllable

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
smearing and the blue overheat ring it

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.780 
smearing and the blue overheat ring it
looks<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.200> it's<00:01:40.380> really<00:01:40.799> burned<00:01:41.070> yeah<00:01:41.400> this

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
looks like it's really burned yeah this

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.179 
looks like it's really burned yeah this
bearing<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.270> done<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:43.290> type<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.530> damage<00:01:43.979> was

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
bearing is done this type of damage was

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.580 
bearing is done this type of damage was
caused<00:01:44.490> when<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.850> wrong<00:01:45.299> oil<00:01:45.540> viscosity<00:01:45.960> was

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
caused when the wrong oil viscosity was

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.030 
caused when the wrong oil viscosity was
chosen

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
chosen

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.280 
chosen
now<00:01:47.520> other<00:01:47.729> types<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.149> damage<00:01:48.509> can<00:01:48.659> also<00:01:48.869> occur

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
now other types of damage can also occur

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.350 
now other types of damage can also occur
from<00:01:49.500> too<00:01:49.770> much<00:01:50.040> or<00:01:50.280> too<00:01:50.310> little<00:01:50.520> lubricants

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
from too much or too little lubricants

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.850 
from too much or too little lubricants
or<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.780> mixing<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.290> different<00:01:52.320> grease

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
or the mixing of different grease

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.679 
or the mixing of different grease
thickeners<00:01:53.280> well<00:01:53.759> what<00:01:54.030> about<00:01:54.119> damage<00:01:54.600> from

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
thickeners well what about damage from

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.330 
thickeners well what about damage from
contamination<00:01:55.470> yeah<00:01:55.590> well<00:01:55.770> contamination<00:01:56.310> a

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
contamination yeah well contamination a

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.830 
contamination yeah well contamination a
little<00:01:56.520> bit<00:01:56.610> different<00:01:56.939> but<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.329> happens

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
little bit different but that happens

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.899 
little bit different but that happens
when<00:01:58.140> foreign<00:01:58.649> materials<00:01:59.219> enter<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.579> bearing

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
when foreign materials enter the bearing

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.179 
when foreign materials enter the bearing
now<00:02:00.450> water<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.990> hard<00:02:01.200> particles<00:02:01.710> are<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
now water and hard particles are the

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.340 
now water and hard particles are the
most<00:02:02.369> common<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.969> damage<00:02:03.630> starts<00:02:04.079> on<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
most common the damage starts on the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.289 
most common the damage starts on the
rolling<00:02:04.680> contact<00:02:05.189> surfaces<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.850> eventually

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
rolling contact surfaces and eventually

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.330 
rolling contact surfaces and eventually
leads<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.750> flaking<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.409> spalling<00:02:07.920> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
leads to flaking and spalling the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.830 
leads to flaking and spalling the
condition<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.819> worse<00:02:09.060> in<00:02:09.450> grease

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
condition is worse in grease

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.300 
condition is worse in grease
applications<00:02:10.440> because<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.709> can't<00:02:10.979> get<00:02:11.160> that

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
applications because you can't get that

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.430 
applications because you can't get that
contamination<00:02:12.030> out<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.450> grease<00:02:12.690> now

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
contamination out of the grease now

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.930 
contamination out of the grease now
look<00:02:13.620> at<00:02:13.770> this<00:02:13.890> large<00:02:14.190> tapered<00:02:14.730> roller

acid at all the metal to metal contacts
in<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.420> bearing<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.230> see<00:02:28.440> all<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:28.890> these

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
in the bearing so you see all of these

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.730 
in the bearing so you see all of these
small<00:02:29.250> lines<00:02:29.700> yeah<00:02:30.240> that's<00:02:30.630> actually<00:02:30.960> acid

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
small lines yeah that's actually acid

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.370 
small lines yeah that's actually acid
etching<00:02:31.920> corrosion<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:33.360> over<00:02:33.810> time<00:02:34.020> what

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
etching corrosion so over time what

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.470 
etching corrosion so over time what
happens<00:02:34.410> is<00:02:34.950> though<00:02:35.670> this<00:02:35.880> may<00:02:36.000> not<00:02:36.120> look<00:02:36.270> like

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
happens is though this may not look like

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.680 
happens is though this may not look like
a<00:02:36.510> lot<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:36.840> damage<00:02:37.020> it<00:02:37.650> eventually<00:02:37.950> turns<00:02:38.430> into

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
a lot of damage it eventually turns into

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.410 
a lot of damage it eventually turns into
this<00:02:39.690> large<00:02:40.290> ball<00:02:40.740> in<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.400> load<00:02:41.580> zone<00:02:41.610> so<00:02:42.270> how

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
this large ball in the load zone so how

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.360 
this large ball in the load zone so how
can<00:02:42.600> this<00:02:42.690> be<00:02:42.900> avoided<00:02:43.350> well<00:02:43.890> this<00:02:44.070> type<00:02:44.220> of

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
can this be avoided well this type of

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.030 
can this be avoided well this type of
failure<00:02:44.550> can<00:02:44.970> often<00:02:45.660> be<00:02:45.750> avoided<00:02:46.200> by<00:02:46.710> using

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
failure can often be avoided by using

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.190 
failure can often be avoided by using
the<00:02:47.640> right<00:02:47.880> seals<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:48.540> sealing<00:02:48.840> techniques

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
the right seals and sealing techniques

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.240 
the right seals and sealing techniques

okay<00:03:22.500> now<00:03:22.770> how<00:03:22.920> can<00:03:23.100> something<00:03:23.310> like<00:03:23.430> fretting

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
okay now how can something like fretting

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.580 
okay now how can something like fretting
be<00:03:24.120> avoided<00:03:24.540> though<00:03:24.690> well<00:03:25.020> the<00:03:25.170> main<00:03:25.290> thing<00:03:25.320> to

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
be avoided though well the main thing to

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.290 
be avoided though well the main thing to
do<00:03:25.739> is<00:03:25.770> to<00:03:26.250> measure<00:03:26.520> the<00:03:26.670> shaft<00:03:27.060> in<00:03:27.270> the

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
do is to measure the shaft in the

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.780 
do is to measure the shaft in the
housing<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:27.900> compare<00:03:28.590> those<00:03:28.739> dimensions<00:03:29.370> to

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
housing and compare those dimensions to

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.729 
housing and compare those dimensions to
either<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.300> original<00:03:30.870> equipment<00:03:31.290> or<00:03:31.680> the

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
either the original equipment or the

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.610 
either the original equipment or the
recommended<00:03:32.700> specifications<00:03:33.510> fits<00:03:34.470> are

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
recommended specifications fits are

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.470 
recommended specifications fits are
critical<00:03:35.130> to<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.370> life<00:03:35.550> of<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:35.790> bearing<00:03:35.970> it's

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
critical to the life of the bearing it's

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.600 
critical to the life of the bearing it's
just<00:03:36.750> like<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:36.900> pair<00:03:37.140> of<00:03:37.170> shoes<00:03:37.440> too<00:03:38.070> tight<00:03:38.100> or

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
just like a pair of shoes too tight or

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.699 
just like a pair of shoes too tight or
too<00:03:38.760> loose<00:03:38.970> can<00:03:39.750> mean<00:03:39.930> an<00:03:40.080> improper<00:03:40.620> and

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
too loose can mean an improper and

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.800 
too loose can mean an improper and
uncomfortable<00:03:41.310> fit<00:03:41.520> great<00:03:42.269> analogy<00:03:42.600> I<00:03:42.780> like

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
uncomfortable fit great analogy I like

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.479 
uncomfortable fit great analogy I like
that<00:03:43.170> now<00:03:43.350> what<00:03:43.530> about<00:03:43.650> installation<00:03:44.070> though

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
that now what about installation though

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.310 
that now what about installation though
what<00:03:44.970> are<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.120> few<00:03:45.180> ways<00:03:45.480> that<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:45.780> bearing<00:03:46.140> can

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
what are a few ways that a bearing can

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.750 
what are a few ways that a bearing can
be<00:03:46.440> damaged<00:03:46.860> during<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.489> actual

is<00:03:50.070> sometimes<00:03:50.430> really<00:03:50.730> easy<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.300> see<00:03:51.510> you

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
is sometimes really easy to see you

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.170 
is sometimes really easy to see you
might<00:03:51.840> have<00:03:52.019> a<00:03:52.050> ring<00:03:52.860> that's<00:03:53.040> chipped<00:03:53.489> or<00:03:53.910> a

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
might have a ring that's chipped or a

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.580 
might have a ring that's chipped or a
seal<00:03:54.570> that's<00:03:54.810> pushed<00:03:55.050> in<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:55.350> it's<00:03:55.440> really

seal that's pushed in and it's really

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.650 
seal that's pushed in and it's really
easy<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:56.010> see<00:03:56.280> sometimes<00:03:57.030> it's<00:03:57.209> inside<00:03:57.510> the

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
easy to see sometimes it's inside the

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.300 
easy to see sometimes it's inside the
barrier<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:57.989> it's<00:03:58.410> very<00:03:58.590> difficult<00:03:58.800> to<00:03:59.130> see

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
barrier and it's very difficult to see

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.610 
barrier and it's very difficult to see
now<00:03:59.790> for<00:04:00.000> example<00:04:00.060> we<00:04:00.630> look<00:04:01.230> at<00:04:01.410> this

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
now for example we look at this

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.560 
now for example we look at this
cylindrical<00:04:02.040> roller<00:04:02.459> bearing<00:04:02.550> ring<00:04:03.000> if<00:04:03.180> you

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
cylindrical roller bearing ring if you

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.229 
cylindrical roller bearing ring if you
look<00:04:03.810> real<00:04:04.050> close<00:04:04.380> you<00:04:04.709> can<00:04:04.890> see<00:04:05.370> these<00:04:05.730> nicks

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
look real close you can see these nicks

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.210 
look real close you can see these nicks
that<00:04:06.900> are<00:04:07.080> on<00:04:07.200> this<00:04:07.440> brand-new<00:04:07.830> Raceway

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
that are on this brand-new Raceway

that are on this brand-new Raceway
surface<00:04:08.610> small<00:04:09.090> but<00:04:09.300> they<00:04:09.390> are<00:04:09.420> noticeable

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
surface small but they are noticeable

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.930 
surface small but they are noticeable
well<00:04:10.140> so<00:04:10.500> were<00:04:10.650> these<00:04:10.920> this<00:04:11.310> actually<00:04:11.640> etching

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
well so were these this actually etching

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.250 
well so were these this actually etching
corrosion<00:04:12.330> that's<00:04:12.450> in<00:04:12.600> this<00:04:12.720> bearing<00:04:13.110> but

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
corrosion that's in this bearing but

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.960 
corrosion that's in this bearing but
look<00:04:13.410> what<00:04:13.560> happened<00:04:13.860> it<00:04:14.040> same<00:04:14.519> things<00:04:14.790> going

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
look what happened it same things going

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.909 
look what happened it same things going
to<00:04:15.030> happen<00:04:15.120> here<00:04:15.540> over<00:04:15.810> time<00:04:15.989> now<00:04:16.590> this<00:04:16.769> was

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
to happen here over time now this was

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.759 
to happen here over time now this was
likely<00:04:17.160> caused<00:04:17.580> by<00:04:17.850> some<00:04:18.810> misalignment<00:04:19.410> of

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
likely caused by some misalignment of

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.560 
likely caused by some misalignment of
the<00:04:20.220> shaft<00:04:20.459> when<00:04:20.700> it<00:04:20.790> was<00:04:20.910> being<00:04:21.090> installed

the shaft when it was being installed

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.360 
the shaft when it was being installed
and<00:04:21.870> perhaps<00:04:22.169> being<00:04:22.979> a<00:04:23.070> little<00:04:23.250> too

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
and perhaps being a little too

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.740 
and perhaps being a little too
aggressive<00:04:23.490> while<00:04:24.000> trying<00:04:24.450> to<00:04:24.510> put<00:04:24.630> the

aggressive while trying to put the

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.240 
aggressive while trying to put the
bearing<00:04:24.990> together<00:04:25.229> now<00:04:25.560> this<00:04:25.740> type<00:04:25.950> of<00:04:25.979> damage

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
bearing together now this type of damage

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.770 
bearing together now this type of damage
can

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780

proper way to replace bearings and that
can<00:04:56.780> mean<00:04:56.900> a<00:04:56.930> great<00:04:57.200> deal<00:04:57.230> for<00:04:57.620> one<00:04:57.830> facility

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
can mean a great deal for one facility

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.590 
can mean a great deal for one facility
we're<00:04:58.550> talking<00:04:58.880> about<00:04:59.000> reduce<00:04:59.390> maintenance

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
we're talking about reduce maintenance

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.600 
we're talking about reduce maintenance
time<00:04:59.990> reduce<00:05:00.410> cost<00:05:00.680> and<00:05:00.860> that<00:05:01.280> affects<00:05:01.550> the

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
time reduce cost and that affects the

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.100 
time reduce cost and that affects the
bottom<00:05:01.880> line<00:05:02.210> of<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.419> company<00:05:02.600> right<00:05:02.930> there

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
bottom line of the company right there

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.050 
bottom line of the company right there
more<00:05:03.320> money<00:05:03.500> in<00:05:03.620> their<00:05:03.740> pocket<00:05:04.100> right<00:05:04.610> now

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
more money in their pocket right now

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.730 
more money in their pocket right now
this<00:05:05.240> is<00:05:05.390> a<00:05:05.419> pretty<00:05:05.660> expensive<00:05:06.020> bearing<00:05:06.560> yeah

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
this is a pretty expensive bearing yeah

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.260 
this is a pretty expensive bearing yeah
but<00:05:06.980> the<00:05:07.070> cost<00:05:07.310> of<00:05:07.460> the<00:05:07.520> bearing<00:05:07.850> is<00:05:08.000> usually

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
but the cost of the bearing is usually

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.909 
but the cost of the bearing is usually
very<00:05:08.300> small<00:05:08.840> compared<00:05:09.440> to<00:05:09.500> the<00:05:09.710> lost

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
very small compared to the lost

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.070 
very small compared to the lost
production<00:05:10.340> downtime<00:05:10.970> costs<00:05:11.180> so<00:05:11.660> getting<00:05:11.990> the

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
production downtime costs so getting the

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.930 
production downtime costs so getting the
job<00:05:12.260> done<00:05:12.290> right<00:05:12.710> the<00:05:12.770> first<00:05:13.100> time<00:05:13.250> is<00:05:13.610> usually

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
job done right the first time is usually

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.400 
job done right the first time is usually
less<00:05:14.150> expensive<00:05:14.600> in<00:05:14.720> the<00:05:14.780> long<00:05:14.930> run<00:05:15.140> now<00:05:15.260> what

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
less expensive in the long run now what

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.560 
less expensive in the long run now what
about<00:05:15.560> total<00:05:15.980> bearing<00:05:16.430> failure<00:05:17.030> well<00:05:17.330> for

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
about total bearing failure well for

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:18.610 
about total bearing failure well for
bearings<00:05:17.960> that<00:05:17.990> have<00:05:18.169> failed

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
bearings that have failed

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.620 
bearings that have failed
what<00:05:18.830> NS<00:05:19.070> kit<00:05:19.250> can<00:05:19.430> do<00:05:19.550> is<00:05:19.760> inspect<00:05:20.330> that

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
what NS kit can do is inspect that

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.560 
what NS kit can do is inspect that
damaged<00:05:21.140> part<00:05:21.440> like<00:05:21.650> this<00:05:21.890> one<00:05:22.100> and<00:05:22.610> then<00:05:23.000> look

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
damaged part like this one and then look

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.480 
damaged part like this one and then look
at<00:05:23.720> the<00:05:23.840> application<00:05:24.560> and<00:05:24.740> come<00:05:24.979> up<00:05:25.190> with

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
at the application and come up with

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.790 
at the application and come up with
countermeasures<00:05:25.790> so<00:05:26.510> that<00:05:27.110> failure<00:05:27.500> doesn't

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
countermeasures so that failure doesn't

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.560 
countermeasures so that failure doesn't
happen<00:05:28.040> again<00:05:28.280> you<00:05:28.580> can<00:05:28.729> increase<00:05:28.970> machine<00:05:29.419> up

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
happen again you can increase machine up

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.510 
happen again you can increase machine up
time<00:05:29.780> and<00:05:29.930> again<00:05:29.990> reduce<00:05:30.470> costs<00:05:30.890> okay<00:05:31.100> well<00:05:31.490> I

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
time and again reduce costs okay well I

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.190 
time and again reduce costs okay well I
know<00:05:31.669> tools<00:05:32.060> are<00:05:32.270> very<00:05:32.419> important<00:05:32.930> are<00:05:33.080> there

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
know tools are very important are there

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.870 
know tools are very important are there
any<00:05:33.380> tools<00:05:33.800> that<00:05:34.100> are<00:05:34.190> beneficial<00:05:34.610> when

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
any tools that are beneficial when

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.190 
any tools that are beneficial when
you're<00:05:35.030> working<00:05:35.450> with<00:05:35.479> the<00:05:35.690> bearings<00:05:35.990> yeah

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
you're working with the bearings yeah

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.240 
you're working with the bearings yeah
there<00:05:36.410> are<00:05:36.470> a<00:05:36.500> lot<00:05:36.620> of<00:05:36.650> different<00:05:37.010> types<00:05:37.130> of

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
there are a lot of different types of

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.560 
there are a lot of different types of
tools<00:05:37.400> out<00:05:37.580> there<00:05:37.790> but<00:05:37.940> let's<00:05:38.090> just<00:05:38.270> look<00:05:38.419> at

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
tools out there but let's just look at

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.390 
tools out there but let's just look at
this<00:05:38.690> nsk<00:05:39.110> hydraulic<00:05:39.560> puller<00:05:39.740> for<00:05:40.010> example

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
this nsk hydraulic puller for example

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.960 
this nsk hydraulic puller for example
okay<00:05:40.750> now<00:05:41.750> it<00:05:41.960> makes<00:05:42.320> bearing<00:05:42.890> removal<00:05:43.370> faster

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
okay now it makes bearing removal faster

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.690 
okay now it makes bearing removal faster
safer<00:05:44.600> and<00:05:44.990> easier<00:05:45.260> it<00:05:45.890> can<00:05:45.950> also<00:05:46.130> be<00:05:46.340> used<00:05:46.550> to

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
safer and easier it can also be used to

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.580 
safer and easier it can also be used to
remove<00:05:46.880> gears<00:05:47.390> couplings<00:05:48.020> and<00:05:48.200> shifts<00:05:48.530> so

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
remove gears couplings and shifts so

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.980 
remove gears couplings and shifts so
it's<00:05:48.710> a<00:05:48.770> multitasking<00:05:49.460> type<00:05:49.700> tool<00:05:49.940> now<00:05:50.690> this

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
it's a multitasking type tool now this

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.080 
it's a multitasking type tool now this
type<00:05:51.200> of<00:05:51.229> tool<00:05:51.530> also<00:05:52.010> greatly<00:05:52.340> reduces<00:05:53.060> the

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
type of tool also greatly reduces the

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.330 
type of tool also greatly reduces the
chances<00:05:53.720> of<00:05:53.750> damaging<00:05:54.620> the<00:05:54.710> bearing<00:05:55.010> Journal

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
chances of damaging the bearing Journal

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.440 
chances of damaging the bearing Journal
when<00:05:55.430> you're<00:05:55.550> trying<00:05:55.760> to<00:05:55.850> pull<00:05:56.060> one<00:05:56.240> of<00:05:56.330> these

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
when you're trying to pull one of these

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.420 
when you're trying to pull one of these
rings<00:05:56.720> off<00:05:56.930> and<00:05:57.470> damaging<00:05:57.979> that<00:05:58.070> journal

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
rings off and damaging that journal

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.520 
rings off and damaging that journal
having<00:05:58.760> to<00:05:58.820> replace<00:05:59.180> the<00:05:59.390> shaft<00:05:59.630> is<00:05:59.870> usually

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
having to replace the shaft is usually

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.409 
having to replace the shaft is usually
far<00:06:00.800> more<00:06:00.830> expensive<00:06:01.310> than<00:06:01.669> buying<00:06:01.970> the<00:06:02.210> right

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 
far more expensive than buying the right

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:04.029 
far more expensive than buying the right
tool<00:06:02.660> to<00:06:02.690> do<00:06:02.990> the<00:06:03.110> job<00:06:03.320> and<00:06:03.500> you<00:06:03.620> can<00:06:03.740> use<00:06:03.890> this

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
tool to do the job and you can use this

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:05.560 
tool to do the job and you can use this
tool<00:06:04.310> again<00:06:04.550> in<00:06:04.669> the<00:06:04.729> future<00:06:04.850> this<00:06:05.240> is<00:06:05.390> also

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
tool again in the future this is also

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.360 
tool again in the future this is also
great<00:06:05.900> for<00:06:05.930> pulling<00:06:06.380> teddy<00:06:06.680> bears<00:06:06.950> out<00:06:07.190> of<00:06:07.280> the

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
great for pulling teddy bears out of the

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.980 
great for pulling teddy bears out of the
carnival<00:06:07.580> box<00:06:08.000> there<00:06:08.360> had<00:06:08.479> to<00:06:08.510> be<00:06:08.630> a<00:06:08.720> pretty

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
carnival box there had to be a pretty

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.080 
carnival box there had to be a pretty
big<00:06:09.200> teddy<00:06:09.410> bear<00:06:09.620> for<00:06:09.770> a<00:06:09.830> 10-ton<00:06:10.220> puller<00:06:10.430> yeah

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
big teddy bear for a 10-ton puller yeah

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.490 
big teddy bear for a 10-ton puller yeah
that's<00:06:11.419> true<00:06:11.690> I<00:06:11.720> never<00:06:11.870> thought<00:06:12.140> about<00:06:12.200> that
