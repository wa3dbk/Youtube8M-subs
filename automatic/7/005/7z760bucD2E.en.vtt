00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.080
 Faculty of veterinary medicine or 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.220
 technique have been made with the a nicolÃ¡s 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.140
 de hidalgo presents santiago los molinos 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.179
 mind- controlled facilities 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.519
 are the ideals to develop the 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.410
 rabbit efficiency this kind of 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.419
 environment is achieved in fully local 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.000
 closed, from which the 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.340
 Dynamic ventilation ventilation by 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.320
 depression that relies on extracting the air 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.449
 hot local and ventilation 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.650
 over pressure and involves introducing 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.200
 air inside the room 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.820
 the simply natural installation is 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.220
 based on in a room with windows 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.050
 diverse opening will respond to the 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.680
 square meters of the surface already 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.030
 the cubic meters of volume needed 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.790
 distributed in such a way that they protect 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.250
 the local prevailing winds 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.140
 which prohibits the entry of any kind 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.210
 of animal or vector 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.210
 and at the same time a renewal of the air 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.630
 Right 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.250
 in the technified production system 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.260
 they use sheds or pavilions of 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.020
 commercial materials with floors 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.280
 Cement or galvanized wire cages 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.400
 with hopper models and with models 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.100
 automatic in their facilities for 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.600
 a home system are not expensive and you 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.350
 they do with materials of their own 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.420
 technique like wood trunks sticks is 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.479
 possible to make small stands for 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.479
 place the tables inside 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.479
 respective 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.870
 the sheds must have roof the floor 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.700
 must have an inclination three degrees 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.430
 to avoid the accumulation of 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.950
 Excrement of leftover food and water 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.229
 when a shed is built 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.570
 consider the optimum temperature for 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.450
 the rabbit is 15 to 20 degrees 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.850
 centigrade and that the temperature by 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.610
 below 5 degrees Celsius and by 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.800
 above 30 degrees centigrade apec 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.370
 have it feed the conversion 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.430
 food and reproduction 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.160
 likewise the animal is very sensitive to 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.500
 air currents therefore must 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.210
 exist good ventilation but without 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.160
 air currents 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.380
 calculate the number of cages needed 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.980
 that the population is considered to be 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.470
 integrated by many players 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.980
 pregnant women of blackberries walls and their 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.980
 female litters empty animals in 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.720
 growth intended for slaughter and 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.380
 growing animals when they stimulate 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.380
 the reproduction 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.049
 in the maternity area is where 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.569
 they install the male reproducers and 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:48.120
 females older than three months, 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.610
 cages will have an area of 40 to 50 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.970
 square centimeters and the nests of 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.829
 12 to 20 square centimeters in this 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.830
 place is advised or has not been done for each 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:03.070
 10 females and an additional one for every 50 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.980
 to hunt they have fat you need 800 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.500
 square centimeters is to say that in 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.110
 a cage of 100 x 50 centimeters can fit 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.690
 six gauze fattening one with one 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.320
 density of 12 per square meter is the 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.320
 advisable 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.980
 the rabbits will spend their whole lives inside 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.769
 of a cage therefore it must be 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.290
 right now they are used 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:31.230
 those of European type of 80 centimeters of 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.780
 long by 50 centimeters wide and 30 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.790
 centimeters tall today 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.690
 There is great variety in designs and 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.690
 cage sizes 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:43.719
 the rustic waves are built with 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:46.989
 local materials of bamboo trees 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:48.939
 wood and mesh among others the regular 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.480
 these are used at a level of 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.480
 backyard 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.690
 wire metal cages 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.330
 Galvanized require spot welding 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.099
 the floor and the lateral parts are 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.230
 wire and the door is in the part 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:06.590
 superior this type of cages are 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.420
 used at a non-intensive level 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.470
 the classrooms that are currently 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:15.500
 in the market are battery cages 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:19.190
 round for the player 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:23.180
 pet cages maternity with six 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.930
 hollows and two of maternity a stud and 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.930
 three fattening 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.160
 in relation to the nests the rabbit 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.320
 you should feel comfortable and calm in the 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.570
 moment of delivery for what is due 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:40.530
 provide a nest that meets certain 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:43.290
 is as the following features 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:47.160
 dry that has thermal material at 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:51.350
 mattress ado and asia chip straw carton 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.350
 newspaper and so on 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:59.540
 the feeders are at a rustic level 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:02.450
 Can you use jars cans jars or 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.610
 disused kitchen utensils in a 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.200
 industrial exploitation is 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.390
 they find in the market like that of the 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:13.690
 that meet the conditions of being 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.690
 practical as we are hopper feeders 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.960
 to save work there are 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.210
 automatic drinkers of pacifier that 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.030
 allow through a large water tank and a 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.940
 pipe network 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:29.150
 supply the water in pacifiers in each 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.130
 cage with a minimum of work and if you 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.180
 requires medicating in this way is very 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.180
 simple and comfortable 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.879
 other material that can be used in 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.879
 the farm curricula are the water tanks 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:43.879
 hoses 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:50.550
 gas tank torch water pump 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:06:02.180
 for thermometer trolleys 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.180
 lamps 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.030
 a scale that is of great importance 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:12.740
 to weigh litters and this test 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:16.900
 besides having the computer to 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.900
 keep the records of the farm
