got my hair trimmed last time about a

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.380 
got my hair trimmed last time about a
week<00:02:49.180> after<00:02:49.390> I<00:02:49.989> did<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.530> 30<00:02:50.769> day<00:02:51.010> update<00:02:51.519> so

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
week after I did the 30 day update so

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.479 
week after I did the 30 day update so
I've<00:02:53.110> been<00:02:53.319> I<00:02:53.380> mean<00:02:53.590> gonna<00:02:53.829> true<00:02:54.010> very<00:02:54.250> much

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
I've been I mean gonna true very much

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:55.830 
I've been I mean gonna true very much
but<00:02:54.700> I<00:02:54.760> would<00:02:54.910> think<00:02:55.030> my<00:02:55.329> hair<00:02:55.540> would<00:02:55.660> grow

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
but I would think my hair would grow

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.319 
but I would think my hair would grow
back<00:02:56.470> so<00:02:56.530> maybe<00:02:56.890> that's<00:02:57.190> why<00:02:57.370> but<00:02:57.640> maybe<00:02:57.790> you

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
back so maybe that's why but maybe you

00:02:58.329 --> 00:02:59.670 
back so maybe that's why but maybe you
don't<00:02:58.420> indeed<00:02:58.690> girl<00:02:58.870> on<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.049> other<00:02:59.079> spot<00:02:59.470> so

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
don't indeed girl on the other spot so

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.170 
don't indeed girl on the other spot so
maybe<00:02:59.890> that's<00:03:00.160> why<00:03:00.310> this<00:03:00.579> the<00:03:00.850> front<00:03:01.090> is

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
maybe that's why this the front is

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.150 
maybe that's why this the front is
shorter<00:03:01.480> it's<00:03:01.630> kind<00:03:01.870> of<00:03:01.959> scary<00:03:03.450> but<00:03:04.450> I<00:03:04.810> do<00:03:05.590> want

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
shorter it's kind of scary but I do want

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.180 
shorter it's kind of scary but I do want
to<00:03:06.220> be<00:03:06.280> honest<00:03:06.670> for<00:03:07.450> me<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:08.170> main<00:03:08.530> choice<00:03:08.739> hair

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
to be honest for me the main choice hair

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.520 
to be honest for me the main choice hair

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.509 
work better but I did not get the
results<00:03:19.209> that<00:03:19.239> I<00:03:19.359> anticipated<00:03:20.319> so<00:03:20.799> for<00:03:21.069> me<00:03:21.220> I

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
results that I anticipated so for me I

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:22.949 
results that I anticipated so for me I
don't<00:03:21.910> feel<00:03:21.970> like<00:03:22.180> I<00:03:22.269> was<00:03:22.450> successful<00:03:22.870> with

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
don't feel like I was successful with

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.539 
don't feel like I was successful with
that<00:03:22.989> vitamin<00:03:23.380> whereas<00:03:24.100> with<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.340> Hairfinity

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
that vitamin whereas with the Hairfinity

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.780 
that vitamin whereas with the Hairfinity
I<00:03:25.209> feel<00:03:26.139> like<00:03:26.290> I<00:03:26.440> did<00:03:26.859> get<00:03:27.100> growth<00:03:27.400> with<00:03:27.700> the

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
I feel like I did get growth with the

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.789 
I feel like I did get growth with the
Hairfinity<00:03:28.000> although<00:03:28.630> I<00:03:28.660> did<00:03:28.989> get<00:03:29.200> I<00:03:29.440> have

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
Hairfinity although I did get I have

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.289 
Hairfinity although I did get I have
more<00:03:29.980> side<00:03:30.160> effects<00:03:30.400> I<00:03:30.489> have<00:03:30.670> two<00:03:30.819> breakouts

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
more side effects I have two breakouts

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.220 
more side effects I have two breakouts
but<00:03:31.829> main<00:03:32.829> choice<00:03:33.069> I<00:03:33.280> did<00:03:33.340> not<00:03:33.639> get<00:03:34.200> really<00:03:35.200> any

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
but main choice I did not get really any

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.319 
but main choice I did not get really any
breakouts<00:03:35.739> I<00:03:35.889> think<00:03:36.100> I<00:03:36.280> had<00:03:36.790> a<00:03:36.819> couple<00:03:37.060> up<00:03:37.180> or

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
breakouts I think I had a couple up or

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.300 
breakouts I think I had a couple up or
two<00:03:37.480> in<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.750> very<00:03:37.959> beginning<00:03:38.380> but<00:03:38.530> since<00:03:39.190> then

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
two in the very beginning but since then

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.750 
two in the very beginning but since then
I<00:03:39.430> hadn't<00:03:39.790> I<00:03:39.970> haven't<00:03:40.420> had<00:03:40.540> any<00:03:40.750> breakouts<00:03:41.760> so

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
I hadn't I haven't had any breakouts so

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.410 
I hadn't I haven't had any breakouts so
for<00:03:43.239> me<00:03:43.410> I<00:03:44.410> would<00:03:44.769> recommend<00:03:45.370> like<00:03:45.970> if<00:03:46.120> I<00:03:46.239> had

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
for me I would recommend like if I had

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.970 
for me I would recommend like if I had
to<00:03:46.450> compare<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:46.959> two<00:03:47.139> and<00:03:47.170> recommend<00:03:47.769> one<00:03:47.950> I

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
to compare the two and recommend one I

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.250 
to compare the two and recommend one I
would<00:03:48.190> recommend<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.639> Hairfinity<00:03:49.260> however

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
would recommend the Hairfinity however

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.629 
would recommend the Hairfinity however
that<00:03:50.560> doesn't<00:03:50.769> mean<00:03:50.950> if<00:03:51.130> the<00:03:51.250> main<00:03:51.430> choice

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
that doesn't mean if the main choice

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:52.800 
that doesn't mean if the main choice
does<00:03:51.910> not<00:03:52.060> work<00:03:52.239> better<00:03:52.420> because<00:03:52.780> my

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
does not work better because my

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.330 
does not work better because my
co-workers<00:03:53.500> she<00:03:53.650> would<00:03:53.769> actually<00:03:54.040> recommend

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
co-workers she would actually recommend

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.220 
co-workers she would actually recommend
the<00:03:54.549> main<00:03:54.700> choice<00:03:54.910> over<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.269> Hairfinity<00:03:55.450> so<00:03:56.170> I

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
the main choice over the Hairfinity so I

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.110 
the main choice over the Hairfinity so I
kind<00:03:56.470> of<00:03:56.500> think<00:03:56.650> it<00:03:56.799> just<00:03:57.010> depends<00:03:57.310> on<00:03:57.489> you

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
kind of think it just depends on you

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.809 
kind of think it just depends on you
which<00:03:59.109> the<00:03:59.260> vitamin

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
which the vitamin

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.300 
which the vitamin
work<00:04:00.060> this<00:04:00.299> so<00:04:00.599> if<00:04:01.439> you're<00:04:01.620> looking<00:04:02.129> at<00:04:02.219> this

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
work this so if you're looking at this

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.619 
work this so if you're looking at this
video<00:04:02.519> I'll<00:04:02.760> try<00:04:02.909> to<00:04:02.999> figure<00:04:03.180> out<00:04:03.299> if<00:04:03.420> you<00:04:03.480> want

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
definitely recommend that you give it a

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.369 
definitely recommend that you give it a
shot<00:04:09.019> but<00:04:10.019> it<00:04:10.590> did<00:04:11.099> not<00:04:11.189> work<00:04:11.400> for<00:04:11.459> me<00:04:12.319> I'm<00:04:13.319> not
