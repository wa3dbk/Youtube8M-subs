Andretti's can-am series race car there

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.320 
Andretti's can-am series race car there
was<00:01:18.840> only<00:01:18.990> ten<00:01:19.350> made<00:01:19.820> problem<00:01:20.820> was<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.210> they

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
was only ten made problem was is they

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.150 
was only ten made problem was is they
actually<00:01:21.509> made<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.110> too<00:01:22.380> big<00:01:22.410> and<00:01:22.979> too

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
actually made it too big and too

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.850 
actually made it too big and too
powerful<00:01:23.450> thing<00:01:24.450> was<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:24.869> crazy<00:01:25.410> horse

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
powerful thing was just crazy horse

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.109 
powerful thing was just crazy horse
power<00:01:27.649> even<00:01:28.649> diehard<00:01:28.890> Mustang<00:01:29.610> fans<00:01:29.880> don't

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
power even diehard Mustang fans don't

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.480 
power even diehard Mustang fans don't
even<00:01:30.360> know<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.660> distances<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.649> that's

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
even know the distances and that's

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.400 
even know the distances and that's
basically<00:01:33.090> why<00:01:33.509> we<00:01:33.660> thought<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.020> engine

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
basically why we thought this engine

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:45.620 
basically why we thought this engine
would<00:01:34.530> be<00:01:34.649> good<00:01:34.800> for<00:01:35.039> our<00:01:35.070> project<00:01:44.539> let<00:01:45.539> me

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
would be good for our project let me

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.170 
would be good for our project let me
start<00:01:45.930> at<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.020> beginning<00:01:46.789> we<00:01:47.789> talked<00:01:48.060> about

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
start at the beginning we talked about

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.290 
start at the beginning we talked about
getting<00:01:48.539> a<00:01:48.720> junker<00:01:49.200> for<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.590> project<00:01:50.300> pretty

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
getting a junker for the project pretty

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.480 
getting a junker for the project pretty
much<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.509> test<00:01:51.869> car<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.350> started<00:01:53.340> doing

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
much a test car I started doing

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.960 
much a test car I started doing
different<00:01:54.000> renderings<00:01:54.479> different<00:01:54.869> drawings

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
different renderings different drawings

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.400 
different renderings different drawings
we<00:01:56.970> started<00:01:57.360> making<00:01:57.509> our<00:01:57.780> measurements<00:01:58.320> and

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
we started making our measurements and

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
we started making our measurements and
our<00:01:58.530> cuts

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
our cuts

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.940 
our cuts
if<00:02:00.910> anybody<00:02:01.630> knows<00:02:01.870> is<00:02:02.290> familiar<00:02:02.740> with<00:02:02.860> the

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
if anybody knows is familiar with the

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.030 
if anybody knows is familiar with the
Mustang<00:02:03.430> it's<00:02:04.000> a<00:02:04.150> unibody<00:02:04.600> we've<00:02:05.560> cut<00:02:05.830> out<00:02:06.010> all

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
Mustang it's a unibody we've cut out all

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.190 
Mustang it's a unibody we've cut out all
the<00:02:06.460> unibody<00:02:06.850> features<00:02:07.330> and<00:02:07.870> we've<00:02:07.990> actually

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
the unibody features and we've actually

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.640 
the unibody features and we've actually
installed<00:02:09.130> a<00:02:09.250> chassis<00:02:09.670> underneath<00:02:09.880> it<00:02:10.650> with

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
installed a chassis underneath it with

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.770 
installed a chassis underneath it with
putting<00:02:12.010> it<00:02:12.130> in<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.220> chassis<00:02:12.790> you've<00:02:13.450> separated

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
putting it in a chassis you've separated

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.949 
putting it in a chassis you've separated
the<00:02:14.230> body<00:02:14.440> so<00:02:15.280> now<00:02:15.430> it's<00:02:15.910> absorbing<00:02:16.720> all<00:02:16.900> the

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
the body so now it's absorbing all the

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.130 
the body so now it's absorbing all the
blows<00:02:17.800> in<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.130> road<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.640> bumps<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.209> it's

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
blows in the road and the bumps and it's

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.720 
blows in the road and the bumps and it's
pretty<00:02:20.410> cool<00:02:20.590> because<00:02:20.650> we<00:02:21.010> put<00:02:21.160> pass-throughs

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
pretty cool because we put pass-throughs

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.840 
pretty cool because we put pass-throughs
in<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:21.970> frame<00:02:22.209> for<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.810> exhaust<00:02:23.110> system<00:02:23.500> and

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
in the frame for the exhaust system and

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.340 
in the frame for the exhaust system and
the<00:02:24.850> way<00:02:25.000> that<00:02:25.180> it<00:02:25.300> moves<00:02:25.540> up<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:25.959> over<00:02:26.230> the

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
the way that it moves up and over the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.290 
the way that it moves up and over the

around<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.690> fuel<00:02:28.900> tank<00:02:29.170> it's<00:02:29.770> pretty<00:02:29.980> wild

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
around the fuel tank it's pretty wild

is wild with all of that power that the
motor<00:02:39.940> is<00:02:40.090> putting<00:02:40.390> out<00:02:40.480> adding<00:02:41.380> that<00:02:41.500> chassis

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
motor is putting out adding that chassis

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.410 
motor is putting out adding that chassis
under<00:02:42.100> there<00:02:42.280> is<00:02:42.370> going<00:02:42.580> to<00:02:42.640> make<00:02:42.820> it<00:02:42.970> handle<00:02:43.390> a

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
under there is going to make it handle a

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.780 
under there is going to make it handle a
lot<00:02:43.720> better<00:02:44.020> than<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.320> stock<00:02:44.650> 69<00:02:45.220> Mustang<00:02:47.790> we

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
lot better than a stock 69 Mustang we

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
lot better than a stock 69 Mustang we
tried<00:02:49.060> to<00:02:49.180> make<00:02:49.330> it<00:02:49.360> look<00:02:49.510> like<00:02:49.750> the

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
tried to make it look like the

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.990 
tried to make it look like the
