00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
berry bouquet and I believe this one it

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.310 
berry bouquet and I believe this one it
doesn't<00:00:26.880> have<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.180> label<00:00:27.539> on<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.720> back<00:00:28.080> but

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
doesn't have the label on the back but

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.960 
doesn't have the label on the back but

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
this is the peach bouquet I believe

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.939 
this is the peach bouquet I believe
there<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.240> one<00:00:30.330> other<00:00:30.750> color<00:00:31.109> option<00:00:31.650> as<00:00:31.769> well

but if you want to water it down so to

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
speak you can go to some of the lighter

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.889 
speak you can go to some of the lighter
shades<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.280> side<00:00:56.520> as<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.850> whole<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.420> find<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
shades on the side as a whole I find the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.830 
shades on the side as a whole I find the
berry<00:00:58.230> one<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.949> more<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.640> take<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> little

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
berry one is more and take it a little

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.810 
berry one is more and take it a little
bit<00:01:01.109> brighter<00:01:01.469> look<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.340> cheeks<00:01:02.579> with

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
bit brighter look on the cheeks with

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.109 
bit brighter look on the cheeks with
this<00:01:03.030> all<00:01:03.270> around<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.920> peach<00:01:05.189> one<00:01:05.549> seems

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
this all around but the peach one seems

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.270 
this all around but the peach one seems
to<00:01:06.210> offer<00:01:06.540> maybe<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.200> little<00:01:07.500> more<00:01:07.680> versatility

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
to offer maybe a little more versatility

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.660 
to offer maybe a little more versatility
because<00:01:09.260> part<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.500> blush<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.400> much

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
because part of this blush is so much

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.330 
because part of this blush is so much
lighter<00:01:12.060> than<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.630> main<00:01:12.840> shades<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:14.159> can

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
lighter than the main shades so this can

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.160 
lighter than the main shades so this can
practically<00:01:14.760> be<00:01:15.060> like<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> highlight<00:01:15.960> and

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
practically be like a highlight and

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.690 
practically be like a highlight and
that's<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.500> way<00:01:16.650> I'm<00:01:16.799> wearing<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.220> today<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.460> am

that's the way I'm wearing it today I am

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.270

are a lot of good low cost blushes out
there<00:02:23.989> I<00:02:24.019> think<00:02:24.379> about<00:02:24.560> Jordana<00:02:25.099> and<00:02:25.519> Nix<00:02:26.209> even

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
there I think about Jordana and Nix even

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.710 
there I think about Jordana and Nix even
the<00:02:27.140> elf<00:02:27.290> studio<00:02:27.829> blushes<00:02:28.549> the<00:02:28.849> flower<00:02:29.120> Beauty

the elf studio blushes the flower Beauty
blush<00:02:30.560> bronzer<00:02:30.829> duo's<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.430> know<00:02:31.519> some<00:02:31.760> really

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.500 
blush bronzer duo's you know some really
nice<00:02:32.450> richly<00:02:33.349> pigmented<00:02:34.510> inexpensive

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
nice richly pigmented inexpensive

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.300 
nice richly pigmented inexpensive
blushes<00:02:35.959> out<00:02:36.109> there<00:02:36.379> so<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:36.650> do<00:02:36.890> think<00:02:37.220> the

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
blushes out there so I do think the

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.250 
blushes out there so I do think the
price<00:02:37.549> is<00:02:37.730> a<00:02:37.760> little<00:02:37.879> high<00:02:38.359> for<00:02:38.390> these<00:02:38.840> I<00:02:39.049> think

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
price is a little high for these I think

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.690 
price is a little high for these I think
the<00:02:39.349> upside<00:02:39.739> of<00:02:39.769> these<00:02:40.040> is<00:02:40.250> that<00:02:40.340> they<00:02:40.489> are

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
the upside of these is that they are

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.729 
the upside of these is that they are
matte<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.420> that's<00:02:41.840> good<00:02:42.109> for<00:02:42.319> people<00:02:42.349> who

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
matte and that's good for people who

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.559 
matte and that's good for people who
don't<00:02:43.010> want<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.430> blush<00:02:43.730> that's<00:02:43.970> going<00:02:44.299> to<00:02:44.420> you

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
don't want a blush that's going to you

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:45.910 
don't want a blush that's going to you

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
know pop on their cheeks and then

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.280
