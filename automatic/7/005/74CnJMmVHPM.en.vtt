00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.179
 in what they choose from the nymex 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:19.560
 jean directly is what comic is the previous step 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.659
 that as a general rule 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:24.919
 but forget about part of what your own comic 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.300
 he also has to see a lot in the old TV stations since in 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.249
 Japan 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:34.580
 percent the tradition is gigantic but if we talk a little bit 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.910
 of what manga is as a general rule 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.190
 for one hundrerd 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.350
 we have to base precisely between what style is and how and how 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.780
 there is the matter 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.910
 the manga is a comic that is drawn there practically every day 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.190
 i 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.230
 and it turns out that 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.320
 is for a kind of audience that reads comics in five minutes 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.750
 that people who go to their work before going back 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.870
 in your fetera house are published in very cheap recycled papers 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.350
 for one hundrerd 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.960
 in our system we wanted to be done simply to make a money 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.570
 because if not precisely but not necessarily 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.550
 it's not a little disney movies 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.210
 it is paradoxical that manga anime will be created a bit based on disney and 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.290
 now byrne copy to manga 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.890
 to the anime in this case 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.740
 osamu tezuka create grow and refine with with three planes a background a second 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.270
 plane for printing arrests 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.360
 and a cheese close-up that move 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.500
 if it seems to me that you have ventured part that the first was the lion king oo 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.369
 till die 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.369
 for now there are just people to flee in the second city 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.310
 and it is not a little the origin a historical one of the anime 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.970
 and the origin of the anime as we know the origin of a series of drawings of the 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.300
 that we see on TV but mind 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.430
 houses to a comic that was very successful 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.490
 what about being an animated version 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.179
 has no greater
