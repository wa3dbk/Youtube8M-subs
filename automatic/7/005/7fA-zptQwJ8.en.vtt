00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.200 
orb now I'm the water orb is kinda
glitchy<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.159> weird<00:01:41.460> but<00:01:41.880> I'm<00:01:41.970> going<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.119> go

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
glitchy and weird but I'm going to go

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.870 
glitchy and weird but I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.479> trout<00:01:42.979> try<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.040> out<00:01:44.159> right<00:01:44.310> here<00:01:44.490> so

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
ahead and trout try it out right here so

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.980 
ahead and trout try it out right here so
we're<00:01:44.970> gonna<00:01:45.060> do<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.570> as<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.750> guys<00:01:45.869> can

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
we're gonna do that and as you guys can

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.330 
we're gonna do that and as you guys can
tell<00:01:46.140> it's<00:01:46.259> kind<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.500> weird<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.829> just<00:01:46.860> spawns

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
tell it's kind of weird it just spawns

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.130 
tell it's kind of weird it just spawns
like<00:01:47.610> little<00:01:47.850> two<00:01:48.060> by<00:01:48.180> two<00:01:48.240> squares<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.899> water

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
like little two by two squares of water

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.350 
like little two by two squares of water
and<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:50.040> guess<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.399> supposed<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.850> like<00:01:51.000> freeze

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
and I guess it's supposed to like freeze

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.179 
and I guess it's supposed to like freeze
the<00:01:51.570> mob<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:52.350> doesn't<00:01:52.680> seem<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.920> really<00:01:53.100> be

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
the mob but doesn't seem to really be

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.260 
the mob but doesn't seem to really be
doing<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.790> don't<00:01:53.939> know<00:01:54.000> what's<00:01:54.149> up

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
doing that so I don't know what's up

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.630 
doing that so I don't know what's up
with<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.420> one<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:55.229> um<00:01:55.470> nevertheless<00:01:56.189> that's

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
with that one but um nevertheless that's

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.609 
with that one but um nevertheless that's
the<00:01:56.850> water<00:01:57.060> orb<00:01:57.299> we've<00:01:57.659> got<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.960> explosion

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
the water orb we've got the explosion

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.010 
the water orb we've got the explosion
orb<00:01:58.829> when<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.310> right-click<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.700> mob<00:02:00.020> explodes

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
orb when you right-click a mob explodes

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.050 
orb when you right-click a mob explodes
and<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.890> makes<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.159> very<00:02:02.280> easy<00:02:02.430> for<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.939> to

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
and that makes it very easy for you to

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.819 
and that makes it very easy for you to
kill<00:02:03.240> mobs<00:02:03.450> but<00:02:03.719> it's<00:02:04.200> kind<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.560> difficult

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
kill mobs but it's kind of difficult

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.319 
kill mobs but it's kind of difficult
because<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.430> might<00:02:05.579> kill<00:02:05.790> yourself<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.240> the

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
because you might kill yourself in the

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.940 
because you might kill yourself in the
process<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.899> exploding<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.409> mob<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.860> got

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
process of exploding the mob so you got

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.979 
process of exploding the mob so you got
to<00:02:08.039> be<00:02:08.129> careful<00:02:08.250> with<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.690> we've<00:02:09.690> got<00:02:09.869> the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
to be careful with that we've got the

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.839 
to be careful with that we've got the
animal<00:02:10.410> orb<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.800> when<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.340> guys<00:02:11.459> right-click

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849

to freeze your water it doesn't like to

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.250 
to freeze your water it doesn't like to
do<00:03:08.370> stuff<00:03:08.640> when<00:03:08.760> I'm<00:03:08.880> recording<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.570> minecraft

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
do stuff when I'm recording I minecraft

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.930 
do stuff when I'm recording I minecraft
it's<00:03:10.380> just<00:03:10.500> like<00:03:10.620> no<00:03:10.830> I<00:03:10.860> won't<00:03:11.130> do<00:03:11.400> it<00:03:11.580> when

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
it's just like no I won't do it when

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.699 
it's just like no I won't do it when
you're<00:03:12.060> recording<00:03:12.360> so<00:03:12.959> that's<00:03:13.530> what's

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
you're recording so that's what's

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.050 
you're recording so that's what's
happening<00:03:14.010> right<00:03:14.100> here<00:03:14.220> but<00:03:14.580> as<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:14.910> can<00:03:15.000> tell

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
happening right here but as you can tell

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.970 
happening right here but as you can tell
it's<00:03:15.420> somewhat<00:03:15.780> working<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.350> I<00:03:16.709> think<00:03:16.769> the

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
it's somewhat working and I think the

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.199 
it's somewhat working and I think the
lily<00:03:17.160> pads<00:03:17.430> are<00:03:17.550> kind<00:03:17.700> of<00:03:17.790> giving<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.090> some

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
lily pads are kind of giving it some

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.020 
lily pads are kind of giving it some
trouble<00:03:18.600> but<00:03:19.260> that's<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.950> ice<00:03:20.100> orb<00:03:20.430> like<00:03:20.910> I

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
trouble but that's the ice orb like I

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.759 
trouble but that's the ice orb like I
said<00:03:21.239> you<00:03:21.360> guys<00:03:21.480> can<00:03:21.750> also<00:03:21.870> freeze<00:03:22.200> mobs<00:03:22.590> in

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
said you guys can also freeze mobs in

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.380 
said you guys can also freeze mobs in
their<00:03:22.890> tracks<00:03:23.160> like<00:03:23.430> so<00:03:23.670> which<00:03:23.850> is<00:03:23.880> really<00:03:24.239> fun

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
their tracks like so which is really fun

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.190 
their tracks like so which is really fun
to<00:03:24.570> do<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.610> yeah<00:03:26.610> we've<00:03:27.090> got<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.420> ender<00:03:27.870> orb

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
to do and yeah we've got the ender orb

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.520 
to do and yeah we've got the ender orb
and<00:03:29.330> what<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.420> ender<00:03:30.630> orb<00:03:30.810> does<00:03:31.050> is<00:03:31.230> just

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
and what the ender orb does is just

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.990 
and what the ender orb does is just
teleports<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.220> mob<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.580> a<00:03:32.640> different<00:03:32.910> place

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
teleports the mob to a different place

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.300 
teleports the mob to a different place
like<00:03:33.300> so<00:03:33.600> you<00:03:34.320> can<00:03:34.440> do<00:03:34.590> with<00:03:34.800> all<00:03:34.920> your<00:03:35.130> mobs

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.070 
like so you can do with all your mobs

which is really fun if you want to kind

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.509 
which is really fun if you want to kind
of<00:03:37.110> teleport<00:03:37.530> them<00:03:37.680> away<00:03:37.860> like<00:03:37.890> an<00:03:38.190> Endermen

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
of teleport them away like an Endermen

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
we've got the lightning norm which

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.870 
we've got the lightning norm which
obviously<00:03:40.800> is<00:03:41.040> pretty<00:03:41.280> pretty

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
obviously is pretty pretty

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.340 
obviously is pretty pretty
self-explanatory<00:03:42.239> when<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:42.989> right-click<00:03:43.170> a

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
self-explanatory when you right-click a

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.710 
self-explanatory when you right-click a
mob<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.890> big<00:03:44.430> lightning<00:03:44.700> bolt<00:03:45.030> comes<00:03:45.239> down<00:03:45.480> and

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
mob a big lightning bolt comes down and

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.780 
mob a big lightning bolt comes down and
strikes<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.709> mob<00:03:46.950> which<00:03:47.130> is<00:03:47.250> really<00:03:47.430> fun<00:03:47.519> and

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
strikes the mob which is really fun and

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.890 
strikes the mob which is really fun and
what's<00:03:47.940> really<00:03:48.150> weird<00:03:48.269> about<00:03:48.420> this<00:03:48.660> mod<00:03:48.870> is

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
what's really weird about this mod is

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.270 
what's really weird about this mod is
that<00:03:49.140> there's<00:03:49.320> somewhat<00:03:49.620> of<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.800> glitch<00:03:50.040> where

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
that there's somewhat of a glitch where

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.790 
that there's somewhat of a glitch where
when<00:03:50.430> you<00:03:50.519> spawn<00:03:50.880> stuff<00:03:51.560> kind<00:03:52.560> of<00:03:52.590> just

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
when you spawn stuff kind of just

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.979 
when you spawn stuff kind of just
statues<00:03:53.100> get<00:03:53.519> made<00:03:53.790> of<00:03:54.030> those<00:03:54.239> of<00:03:54.570> those<00:03:54.750> mobs

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
statues get made of those of those mobs

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.540 
statues get made of those of those mobs
even<00:03:55.260> though<00:03:55.350> these<00:03:55.530> aren't<00:03:55.950> real<00:03:56.190> mobs

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
even though these aren't real mobs

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.160 
even though these aren't real mobs
they're<00:03:57.150> still<00:03:57.390> here<00:03:57.660> for<00:03:57.810> some<00:03:57.989> odd<00:03:58.140> reason

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
they're still here for some odd reason

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.900 
they're still here for some odd reason
but<00:03:58.620> if<00:03:58.709> I<00:03:58.769> was<00:03:58.860> to<00:03:58.980> close<00:03:59.130> out<00:03:59.310> my<00:03:59.340> minecraft

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
but if I was to close out my minecraft

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.270 
but if I was to close out my minecraft
and<00:04:00.090> rejoin<00:04:00.900> they<00:04:01.350> would<00:04:01.500> all<00:04:01.590> be<00:04:01.709> gone<00:04:01.890> so<00:04:02.250> I

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
and rejoin they would all be gone so I

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.680 
and rejoin they would all be gone so I
don't<00:04:02.459> know<00:04:02.580> what's<00:04:02.700> up<00:04:02.820> with<00:04:02.910> that<00:04:02.970> but<00:04:03.420> it's

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
don't know what's up with that but it's

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:04.940 
don't know what's up with that but it's
somewhat<00:04:04.019> of<00:04:04.110> a<00:04:04.170> glitch<00:04:04.350> that<00:04:04.380> needs<00:04:04.739> to<00:04:04.860> be

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
somewhat of a glitch that needs to be

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.190 
somewhat of a glitch that needs to be
fixed<00:04:05.220> and<00:04:05.489> last<00:04:06.269> but<00:04:06.390> not<00:04:06.570> least<00:04:06.630> we've<00:04:07.019> got

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
fixed and last but not least we've got

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.990 
fixed and last but not least we've got
the<00:04:07.320> nature<00:04:07.709> or<00:04:07.739> which<00:04:08.100> obviously<00:04:08.370> adds<00:04:08.700> and

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
the nature or which obviously adds and

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.210 
the nature or which obviously adds and
tons<00:04:09.570> of<00:04:09.720> stuff<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:10.440> make<00:04:10.530> your<00:04:10.739> world<00:04:10.950> look<00:04:11.160> a

right<00:04:23.970> here<00:04:24.090> which<00:04:24.180> are<00:04:24.270> just<00:04:24.450> called<00:04:24.660> Omega

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
right here which are just called Omega

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.000 
right here which are just called Omega
orbs

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
orbs

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.500 
orbs
so<00:04:26.100> the<00:04:26.310> exact<00:04:26.610> same<00:04:26.790> thing<00:04:27.000> I<00:04:27.090> just<00:04:27.120> showed

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
so the exact same thing I just showed

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.600 
so the exact same thing I just showed
you<00:04:27.540> they're<00:04:28.530> pretty<00:04:28.710> much<00:04:28.830> just<00:04:29.100> larger

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
you they're pretty much just larger

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.910 
you they're pretty much just larger
versions<00:04:30.060> of<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.450> regular<00:04:31.110> orbs<00:04:31.410> so<00:04:31.590> if<00:04:31.710> I<00:04:31.800> was

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
versions of the regular orbs so if I was

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.070 
versions of the regular orbs so if I was
to<00:04:31.950> go<00:04:32.100> ahead<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:32.430> place<00:04:32.640> down<00:04:32.910> and<00:04:33.120> Omega

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
to go ahead and place down and Omega

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.730 
to go ahead and place down and Omega
nether<00:04:34.890> orb<00:04:35.160> here<00:04:36.020> if<00:04:37.020> I<00:04:37.110> can<00:04:37.260> go<00:04:37.530> ahead<00:04:37.620> and

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
nether orb here if I can go ahead and

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.410 
nether orb here if I can go ahead and
put<00:04:37.980> one<00:04:38.070> in<00:04:38.130> my<00:04:38.220> inventory<00:04:38.430> we've<00:04:39.150> set<00:04:39.330> it

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
put one in my inventory we've set it

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.000 
put one in my inventory we've set it
today<00:04:39.600> real<00:04:39.780> quickly<00:04:40.020> if<00:04:40.440> I<00:04:40.590> was<00:04:40.650> to<00:04:40.770> go<00:04:40.860> ahead

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
today real quickly if I was to go ahead

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.030 
today real quickly if I was to go ahead
and<00:04:41.130> put<00:04:41.250> down<00:04:41.400> an<00:04:41.520> Omega<00:04:42.020> nether<00:04:43.020> orb<00:04:43.290> it<00:04:43.560> puts

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
and put down an Omega nether orb it puts

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.890 
and put down an Omega nether orb it puts
just<00:04:44.280> a<00:04:44.370> larger<00:04:44.760> radius<00:04:45.120> of<00:04:45.390> the<00:04:45.690> nether

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
just a larger radius of the nether

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.330 
just a larger radius of the nether
around<00:04:46.350> rather<00:04:46.560> than<00:04:46.770> just<00:04:46.980> having<00:04:47.160> the

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
around rather than just having the

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.890 
around rather than just having the
smaller<00:04:47.670> nether<00:04:47.970> or<00:04:48.180> because<00:04:48.390> that<00:04:48.510> just<00:04:48.540> has

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
smaller nether or because that just has

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.080 
smaller nether or because that just has
a<00:04:48.930> little<00:04:49.140> smaller<00:04:50.040> radius<00:04:50.400> rather<00:04:50.760> than<00:04:50.940> the

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
a little smaller radius rather than the

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.580 
a little smaller radius rather than the
omega<00:04:51.450> 1<00:04:51.690> so<00:04:51.840> that's<00:04:51.960> really<00:04:52.080> all<00:04:52.290> the<00:04:52.470> old

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
omega 1 so that's really all the old

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.740 
omega 1 so that's really all the old
mega<00:04:52.770> ones<00:04:53.040> do<00:04:53.310> but<00:04:54.000> yeah<00:04:54.270> I<00:04:54.300> think<00:04:54.450> that's

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
mega ones do but yeah I think that's

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.210 
mega ones do but yeah I think that's
pretty<00:04:54.900> much<00:04:55.080> it<00:04:55.140> the<00:04:55.650> only<00:04:55.830> thing<00:04:55.980> that<00:04:56.130> we

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
pretty much it the only thing that we

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.130 
pretty much it the only thing that we
have<00:04:56.370> left<00:04:56.640> is<00:04:56.820> the<00:04:56.970> defender<00:04:57.390> orbs<00:04:57.720> the

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
have left is the defender orbs the

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.080 
have left is the defender orbs the
regular<00:04:58.470> defender<00:04:58.830> orbs<00:04:59.100> put<00:04:59.310> down<00:04:59.520> wolves

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
regular defender orbs put down wolves

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.810 
regular defender orbs put down wolves
and<00:05:00.240> the<00:05:01.080> omega<00:05:01.590> defender<00:05:02.100> orbs<00:05:02.400> put<00:05:02.640> down

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
and the omega defender orbs put down

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.370 
and the omega defender orbs put down
iron<00:05:03.150> golems<00:05:03.510> so<00:05:03.660> you<00:05:03.720> guys<00:05:03.900> can<00:05:04.050> have<00:05:04.230> some

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
obviously the omega up greater just

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.000 
obviously the omega up greater just
creates<00:05:11.850> the<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:12.510> regular<00:05:12.870> orbs<00:05:13.200> to<00:05:13.440> omega

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
creates the the regular orbs to omega

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.800 
creates the the regular orbs to omega
and<00:05:14.340> like<00:05:14.670> i<00:05:14.790> said<00:05:14.850> all<00:05:15.060> the<00:05:15.150> crafting<00:05:15.450> recipes
