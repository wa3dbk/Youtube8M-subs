beating the Ultimate Warrior the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.450 
beating the Ultimate Warrior the
ultimate<00:01:44.850> puke<00:01:45.390> had<00:01:45.930> rested<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.560> he'd<00:01:47.430> be

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
ultimate puke had rested so he'd be

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.360 
ultimate puke had rested so he'd be
chuckling<00:01:48.299> down<00:01:48.509> at<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.780> one<00:01:48.990> but

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
I guess to have a match to two matches

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.980 
I guess to have a match to two matches
