00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
done and I am 98.7 right now so it there

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.770 
done and I am 98.7 right now so it there
is<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> little<00:01:11.760> bit<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.060> learning<00:01:12.210> curve<00:01:12.420> to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
is a little bit of a learning curve to

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.160 
is a little bit of a learning curve to
it<00:01:12.930> uh<00:01:13.729> it<00:01:14.729> took<00:01:15.000> me<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> couple<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.659> times<00:01:15.869> to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
it uh it took me a couple of times to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.530 
it uh it took me a couple of times to
figure<00:01:16.619> out<00:01:16.830> exactly<00:01:17.060> where<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.090> needed<00:01:18.360> to

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
figure out exactly where I needed to

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.240 
figure out exactly where I needed to
place<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.110> how<00:01:19.200> fast<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.680> needed<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.100> move

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
place it and how fast I needed to move

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.700 
place it and how fast I needed to move
it<00:01:20.430> um<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.990> would<00:01:22.110> say<00:01:22.350> when<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.560> first

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
it um so I would say when you first

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.810 
it um so I would say when you first
start<00:01:22.950> using<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.369> also<00:01:23.610> use<00:01:24.210> an<00:01:24.570> additional

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
start using it also use an additional

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.520 
start using it also use an additional
thermometer<00:01:26.820> under<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.119> arm<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.689> until<00:01:28.470> you

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
thermometer under the arm just until you

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.130 
thermometer under the arm just until you
figure<00:01:28.650> out<00:01:28.799> exactly<00:01:29.540> what<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.630> best<00:01:30.780> way<00:01:30.960> is

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
figure out exactly what the best way is

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.620 
figure out exactly what the best way is
for<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.740> use<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.040> personally<00:01:32.610> but<00:01:33.479> one

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
for you to use it personally but one

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.609 
for you to use it personally but one
other<00:01:33.780> thing<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.170> really<00:01:34.200> like<00:01:34.590> about

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
other thing that I really like about

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.819 
other thing that I really like about
this<00:01:35.070> thermometer<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.140> it<00:01:37.140> grades<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
this thermometer is that it grades the

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.370 
this thermometer is that it grades the
temperature<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.610> color<00:01:39.240> scale<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.960> green

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
temperature on a color scale so green

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.010 
temperature on a color scale so green
means<00:01:40.619> you're<00:01:40.740> fine<00:01:40.979> yellow<00:01:41.790> means<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.750> have

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
means you're fine yellow means you have

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.950 
means you're fine yellow means you have
a<00:01:43.250> heightened<00:01:44.250> temperature<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.390> red<00:01:45.750> means

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
a heightened temperature and red means

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.840 
a heightened temperature and red means
there<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> fever<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.490> middle<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.759> the
