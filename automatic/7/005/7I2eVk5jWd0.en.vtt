okay<00:00:01.530> so<00:00:02.040> uh<00:00:02.600> here<00:00:03.600> we<00:00:03.629> are<00:00:03.720> with<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.730> 95

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
okay so uh here we are with the 95

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.839 
okay so uh here we are with the 95
Polaris<00:00:06.600> SLX<00:00:07.319> 780<00:00:08.150> got<00:00:09.150> it<00:00:09.269> none<00:00:09.450> non-running

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:10.849 
Polaris SLX 780 got it none non-running

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.669 
Polaris SLX 780 got it none non-running
but<00:00:11.849> I've<00:00:11.940> hoped<00:00:12.210> for<00:00:12.420> this<00:00:12.509> thing<00:00:12.719> yet<00:00:12.929> so<00:00:13.320> I'm

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
but I've hoped for this thing yet so I'm

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.700 
but I've hoped for this thing yet so I'm
still<00:00:13.950> having<00:00:14.190> trouble<00:00:14.639> getting<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.990> turn

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
still having trouble getting it to turn

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.480 
still having trouble getting it to turn
over<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.640> run<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.570> basically<00:00:19.490> suck

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
over and to run and to basically suck

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.470 
over and to run and to basically suck
fuel<00:00:21.650> changed<00:00:22.650> all<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.830> fuel<00:00:23.039> lines<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.970> for

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
fuel changed all the fuel lines and for

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.890 
fuel changed all the fuel lines and for
testing<00:00:24.810> purposes<00:00:25.320> I've<00:00:25.710> bypassed<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.900> fuel

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
testing purposes I've bypassed the fuel

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.390 
testing purposes I've bypassed the fuel
shutoff<00:00:28.170> valve<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.890> gas<00:00:29.099> water

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
shutoff valve and the gas water

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.510 
shutoff valve and the gas water
separator<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.300> am<00:00:30.599> hooked<00:00:31.369> directly<00:00:32.369> from

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
separator so I am hooked directly from

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.979 
separator so I am hooked directly from
the<00:00:32.669> tank<00:00:33.770> right<00:00:34.770> into<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.219> fuel<00:00:35.460> pump<00:00:35.700> and

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
the tank right into the fuel pump and

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.200 
the tank right into the fuel pump and
fuel<00:00:36.989> pump<00:00:37.290> goes<00:00:37.739> out<00:00:38.100> into<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.430> carbs<00:00:38.910> and

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
fuel pump goes out into the carbs and

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.080 
fuel pump goes out into the carbs and
there's<00:00:40.110> an<00:00:40.200> impulse<00:00:40.500> line<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> back<00:00:41.250> I've

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
there's an impulse line in the back I've

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.229 
there's an impulse line in the back I've
disassembled<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.809> fuel<00:00:43.020> pump<00:00:43.820> I've<00:00:44.820> cleaned

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
disassembled the fuel pump I've cleaned

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.139 
disassembled the fuel pump I've cleaned
it<00:00:46.039> verified<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.219> all<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.489> diaphragms<00:00:47.969> are

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
it verified that all the diaphragms are

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.529 
it verified that all the diaphragms are
still<00:00:48.360> intact<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.960> they<00:00:49.050> are<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.850> know<00:00:51.239> for

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
still intact and they are and I know for

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.240 
still intact and they are and I know for
a<00:00:51.570> fact<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.780> all<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> fuel<00:00:52.260> lines<00:00:52.500> are

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
a fact that all the fuel lines are

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.130 
a fact that all the fuel lines are
functional<00:00:53.820> as<00:00:53.940> well<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.390> did<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> blow<00:00:54.870> through

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
functional as well I did a blow through

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.770 
functional as well I did a blow through
test<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.340> know<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.360> fuel<00:00:57.570> lines

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
test and I know that the the fuel lines

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.959 
test and I know that the the fuel lines
are<00:00:57.960> clear<00:00:59.059> new<00:01:00.059> plugs<00:01:00.359> new<00:01:00.719> battery<00:01:01.730> new<00:01:02.730> oil

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
are clear new plugs new battery new oil

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.440 
are clear new plugs new battery new oil
fresh<00:01:03.660> gas<00:01:04.309> had<00:01:05.309> some<00:01:05.489> liquid<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.060> impulse

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
fresh gas had some liquid in the impulse

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.950 
fresh gas had some liquid in the impulse
line<00:01:06.770> that<00:01:07.770> pulses<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.610> fuel<00:01:08.850> pump<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.420> I

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
line that pulses the fuel pump and I

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.100 
line that pulses the fuel pump and I
sucked<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.619> out<00:01:11.210> with<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> shot<00:01:12.299> back<00:01:12.750> I

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
sucked that out with a shot back I

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.200 
sucked that out with a shot back I
verified<00:01:13.920> pressure<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.520> fuel<00:01:14.729> pump<00:01:14.760> I

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
verified pressure on the fuel pump I

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.260 
verified pressure on the fuel pump I
know<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.570> fuel<00:01:15.750> pump<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.170> functional<00:01:17.270> it's

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
know the fuel pump is functional it's

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.109 
know the fuel pump is functional it's
not<00:01:18.390> obstructed<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:20.100> also<00:01:20.520> took<00:01:20.759> out<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
not obstructed and I also took out the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.390 
not obstructed and I also took out the
carbs<00:01:22.280> clean<00:01:23.280> them<00:01:23.540> put<00:01:24.540> everything<00:01:24.750> back<00:01:25.020> in

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
carbs clean them put everything back in

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.210 
carbs clean them put everything back in
the<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:27.390> needles<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.470> inlet<00:01:28.860> screens

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
the the needles in the inlet screens

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.670 
the the needles in the inlet screens
look<00:01:29.909> fine<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.840> reads<00:01:31.020> look<00:01:31.229> fine<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:32.600> know<00:01:33.600> I

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
look fine the reads look fine you know I

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.600 
look fine the reads look fine you know I
didn't<00:01:34.680> see<00:01:34.740> any<00:01:34.890> problem<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.400> there

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
didn't see any problem in there

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.590 
didn't see any problem in there
basically<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.630> issue<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.560> I'm<00:01:37.680> having<00:01:37.710> is

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
basically the issue that I'm having is

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.590 
basically the issue that I'm having is
the<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.590> ski<00:01:40.829> will<00:01:41.009> not<00:01:41.250> suck<00:01:41.700> fuel<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.360> start

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
the the ski will not suck fuel and start

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.240 
the the ski will not suck fuel and start
on<00:01:42.720> its<00:01:42.869> own<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.229> can<00:01:43.380> get<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.590> started<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.100> can

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
on its own I can get it started I can

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.789 
on its own I can get it started I can
get<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.460> engine<00:01:44.579> running<00:01:45.500> but<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.590> needs<00:01:46.740> a

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
get the engine running but it needs a

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.620 
get the engine running but it needs a
little<00:01:46.890> bit<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.159> starter<00:01:47.369> fluid<00:01:47.579> or<00:01:48.090> premix

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
little bit of starter fluid or premix

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.469 
little bit of starter fluid or premix
and<00:01:48.750> carbs<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:50.000> after<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.090> burns<00:01:51.329> through

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
and carbs and after it burns through

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.469 
and carbs and after it burns through
whatever<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.960> put<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.320> carbs<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:53.159> dies<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:54.119> I

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
whatever I put the carbs it dies so I

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.490 
whatever I put the carbs it dies so I
think<00:01:54.540> it's<00:01:55.140> not<00:01:56.000> pulling<00:01:57.000> fuel<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.719> I'm<00:01:58.380> gonna

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
think it's not pulling fuel so I'm gonna

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.760 
think it's not pulling fuel so I'm gonna
start<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.299> I<00:02:00.299> was<00:02:01.020> hoping<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.350> anybody

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
start it and I was hoping that anybody

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.469 
start it and I was hoping that anybody
out<00:02:01.890> there<00:02:01.920> with<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.250> good<00:02:02.399> ear<00:02:02.579> might<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.329> able

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
out there with a good ear might be able

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.679 
out there with a good ear might be able
to<00:02:03.869> offer<00:02:04.649> any<00:02:04.979> suggestions<00:02:05.520> as<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.240> what

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
to offer any suggestions as to what

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.809 
to offer any suggestions as to what
might<00:02:07.469> be<00:02:07.500> going<00:02:07.710> on<00:02:07.890> with<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.190> thing<00:02:08.250> so

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
might be going on with this thing so

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:35.229 
might be going on with this thing so
here<00:02:09.420> we<00:02:09.479> go

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.899 

okay<00:02:36.239> so<00:02:36.870> once<00:02:37.139> it<00:02:37.260> burns<00:02:37.469> through<00:02:37.909> whatever's

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
okay so once it burns through whatever's

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.289 
okay so once it burns through whatever's
in<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.150> carbs<00:02:39.599> it<00:02:40.230> dies<00:02:40.650> out<00:02:41.060> don't<00:02:42.060> think

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
in the carbs it dies out don't think
