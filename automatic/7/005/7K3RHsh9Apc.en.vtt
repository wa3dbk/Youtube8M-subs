 hello today we are going to talk about a guitar 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:09.940
 of concert the guitar that I have between 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:13.300
 my hands is the alpujarra brand and it's a 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.880
 great guitar has the sound very 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.949
 balanced and also responds well 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.759
 like the previous one we talked about the clinic 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:24.730
 passed very well in all parts of the 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:27.999
 fingerboard this guitar has a handle 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.519
 cedar the fretboard is ebony one of the 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:31.989
 better woods for what is the 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:36.370
 fingerboard manufacture 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:39.789
 is the lid is pine and the box is 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.070
 Rosewood, notice that ebony is a 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.769
 dark wood and it also remains very 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.809
 aesthetic and very beautiful on the guitar 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:50.140
 thanks to the rosewood box the 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.980
 sound is very powerful to play on 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:57.870
 places where you do not have 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.870

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.110
