the reasons we got into this business
with<00:02:18.080> electric<00:02:18.470> motors<00:02:18.830> it's<00:02:19.459> because<00:02:19.940> of<00:02:20.180> our

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
with electric motors it's because of our

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.840 
with electric motors it's because of our
lump<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:20.750> water<00:02:21.019> and<00:02:21.260> what<00:02:22.160> we<00:02:22.340> see<00:02:22.610> happening

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
lump and water and what we see happening

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.180 
lump and water and what we see happening
every<00:02:23.450> day<00:02:23.480> here<00:02:24.019> in<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.230> bay<00:02:24.440> as<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.890> bay<00:02:25.040> is

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
every day here in the bay as the bay is

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.910 
every day here in the bay as the bay is
getting<00:02:25.459> dirtier<00:02:25.850> and<00:02:25.970> dirtier<00:02:26.739> this<00:02:27.739> is<00:02:27.890> a

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
getting dirtier and dirtier this is a

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.370 
getting dirtier and dirtier this is a
very<00:02:28.040> dog<00:02:28.640> oriented<00:02:29.239> community<00:02:29.810> journeys

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
very dog oriented community journeys

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.819 
very dog oriented community journeys
port<00:02:30.739> and<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.730> problem<00:02:32.269> is<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.720> can't<00:02:32.780> let<00:02:33.650> your

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
port and the problem is I can't let your

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.370 
port and the problem is I can't let your
dogs<00:02:34.130> and<00:02:34.430> water<00:02:34.730> here<00:02:35.060> very<00:02:35.329> very<00:02:35.630> often

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
dogs and water here very very often

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.490 
dogs and water here very very often
because<00:02:37.130> they'll<00:02:37.579> get<00:02:37.700> sick<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.390> water<00:02:38.660> is<00:02:39.019> so

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
because they'll get sick the water is so

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.460 
because they'll get sick the water is so
polluted<00:02:39.530> that<00:02:40.870> they<00:02:41.870> can<00:02:42.049> get<00:02:42.140> skin

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
polluted that they can get skin

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.009 
polluted that they can get skin
irritations<00:02:43.190> that<00:02:43.430> just<00:02:44.120> amazed<00:02:44.480> me<00:02:44.750> here<00:02:44.900> we

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
irritations that just amazed me here we

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.400 
irritations that just amazed me here we
are<00:02:45.110> in<00:02:45.290> a<00:02:45.320> beautiful<00:02:46.070> body<00:02:46.370> of<00:02:46.519> water<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:47.410> we

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
are in a beautiful body of water and we

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.160 
are in a beautiful body of water and we
can't<00:02:48.680> use<00:02:48.890> it<00:02:49.269> people<00:02:50.269> can't<00:02:50.510> swim<00:02:50.750> in<00:02:50.930> it

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
can't use it people can't swim in it

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.430 
can't use it people can't swim in it
they<00:02:51.980> can't<00:02:52.220> go<00:02:52.340> waiting<00:02:52.610> and<00:02:53.290> then<00:02:54.290> we

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
they can't go waiting and then we

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.050 
they can't go waiting and then we
started<00:02:54.500> you<00:02:55.250> know<00:02:55.340> researching<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.030> history

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
started you know researching the history

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.229 
started you know researching the history
of<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.540> bay<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:56.930> finding<00:02:57.350> out<00:02:57.470> that<00:02:57.940> it<00:02:58.940> used

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
of the bay and finding out that it used

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.000 
of the bay and finding out that it used
to<00:02:59.360> be<00:02:59.480> so<00:02:59.780> Christine

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
to be so Christine

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.929 
to be so Christine
when<00:03:01.790> people<00:03:02.450> first<00:03:02.599> started<00:03:03.459> inhabiting<00:03:04.459> the

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939 
when people first started inhabiting the

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:06.759 
when people first started inhabiting the
bay<00:03:05.120> when<00:03:05.450> we<00:03:05.540> put<00:03:05.750> when<00:03:06.049> they<00:03:06.170> first<00:03:06.439> started

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
bay when we put when they first started

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.130 
bay when we put when they first started
settling<00:03:07.159> here<00:03:07.430> you<00:03:08.060> can<00:03:08.180> see<00:03:08.329> 20<00:03:08.720> feet<00:03:08.750> down

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
settling here you can see 20 feet down

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.110 
settling here you can see 20 feet down
the<00:03:09.439> water<00:03:09.650> was<00:03:09.860> so<00:03:10.040> clear<00:03:10.220> now<00:03:10.340> you're<00:03:10.819> lucky

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
the water was so clear now you're lucky

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.670 
the water was so clear now you're lucky
if<00:03:11.180> you<00:03:11.239> can<00:03:11.329> see<00:03:11.599> it<00:03:11.689> put<00:03:11.930> down<00:03:12.140> into<00:03:12.590> the

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
if you can see it put down into the

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.780 
if you can see it put down into the
water<00:03:12.860> and<00:03:13.280> that's<00:03:14.150> all<00:03:14.329> because<00:03:14.360> of<00:03:15.790> what

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
water and that's all because of what

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.259 
water and that's all because of what
what<00:03:17.269> we're<00:03:17.420> doing<00:03:17.840> as<00:03:18.049> a<00:03:18.560> community<00:03:19.099> all<00:03:19.790> over

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
what we're doing as a community all over

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.680 
what we're doing as a community all over
it's<00:03:21.019> runoff<00:03:21.920> from<00:03:22.870> people<00:03:23.870> building<00:03:24.379> and<00:03:24.590> not

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
it's runoff from people building and not

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.119 
it's runoff from people building and not
paying<00:03:26.690> attention<00:03:26.840> to<00:03:27.290> how<00:03:27.470> they're<00:03:27.709> building

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
paying attention to how they're building

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:29.979 
paying attention to how they're building
they're<00:03:28.519> paving<00:03:28.790> everything<00:03:29.420> so<00:03:29.599> everything

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
they're paving everything so everything

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.580 
they're paving everything so everything
runs<00:03:30.379> off<00:03:30.590> into<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:31.010> bay<00:03:31.689> we<00:03:32.689> no<00:03:32.900> longer<00:03:32.930> have

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
runs off into the bay we no longer have

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.830 
runs off into the bay we no longer have
a<00:03:33.620> huge<00:03:34.190> canopy<00:03:34.640> of<00:03:34.849> trees<00:03:34.879> that<00:03:35.420> filters

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
a huge canopy of trees that filters

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.280 
a huge canopy of trees that filters
everything<00:03:36.379> so<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:37.640> salinity<00:03:38.030> in<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.750> bay<00:03:38.930> is

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
everything so the salinity in the bay is

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.129 
everything so the salinity in the bay is
much<00:03:39.739> less<00:03:40.069> than<00:03:40.280> it<00:03:40.340> used<00:03:40.609> to<00:03:40.700> be<00:03:40.790> and<00:03:41.180> that's

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
much less than it used to be and that's

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.339 
much less than it used to be and that's
caused<00:03:42.709> a<00:03:42.950> lot<00:03:43.190> of<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:44.120> species<00:03:44.420> to<00:03:44.930> leave<00:03:45.139> the

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
caused a lot of the species to leave the

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.649 
caused a lot of the species to leave the
bay<00:03:45.530> or<00:03:45.980> to<00:03:46.220> die<00:03:46.400> off<00:03:46.639> that<00:03:47.150> used<00:03:47.359> to<00:03:47.510> be<00:03:47.629> here

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:47.659 
bay or to die off that used to be here

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.420 
bay or to die off that used to be here
because<00:03:48.260> of<00:03:48.409> the<00:03:48.440> salinity<00:03:48.829> in<00:03:49.129> the<00:03:49.220> water

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
because of the salinity in the water

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.410 
because of the salinity in the water
it's<00:03:50.000> not<00:03:50.180> nearly<00:03:50.659> as<00:03:50.780> salty<00:03:51.290> as<00:03:51.319> it<00:03:51.530> used<00:03:51.709> and

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
it's not nearly as salty as it used and

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.720 
it's not nearly as salty as it used and
of<00:03:53.420> course<00:03:53.659> the<00:03:53.840> farms<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:54.549> everything<00:03:55.549> that

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
of course the farms and everything that

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.300 
of course the farms and everything that
they<00:03:55.819> put<00:03:56.060> on<00:03:56.180> those<00:03:56.420> crops<00:03:56.750> just<00:03:57.290> so<00:03:57.500> that<00:03:57.530> we

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
they put on those crops just so that we

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.759 
they put on those crops just so that we
can<00:03:58.519> have<00:03:58.549> vegetables<00:03:59.540> that<00:03:59.810> don't<00:04:00.049> go<00:04:00.230> bad<00:04:00.470> in

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
can have vegetables that don't go bad in

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.180 
can have vegetables that don't go bad in
the<00:04:00.889> day<00:04:01.930> not<00:04:02.930> only<00:04:03.109> is<00:04:03.290> it<00:04:03.349> bad<00:04:03.590> for<00:04:03.769> fatties

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
the day not only is it bad for fatties

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.220 
the day not only is it bad for fatties
but<00:04:04.459> it's<00:04:04.639> dad<00:04:04.879> for<00:04:05.180> what<00:04:05.329> runs<00:04:05.569> off<00:04:05.780> into<00:04:05.810> the

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
but it's dad for what runs off into the

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.089 
but it's dad for what runs off into the
bay<00:04:06.379> so<00:04:07.370> all<00:04:08.000> of<00:04:08.060> this<00:04:08.569> is<00:04:08.840> part<00:04:09.530> of<00:04:09.709> what<00:04:09.919> we

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
bay so all of this is part of what we

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.330 
bay so all of this is part of what we
see<00:04:10.370> day<00:04:11.090> in<00:04:11.299> and<00:04:11.480> day<00:04:11.510> out<00:04:11.799> and<00:04:12.799> we<00:04:13.099> see<00:04:13.310> this

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
see day in and day out and we see this

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.029 
see day in and day out and we see this
dirty<00:04:13.790> water<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:14.540> and<00:04:14.870> then<00:04:15.620> we<00:04:15.739> look<00:04:15.889> across

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
dirty water and and then we look across

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.190 
dirty water and and then we look across
and<00:04:16.459> see<00:04:16.519> how<00:04:16.699> beautiful<00:04:17.269> it<00:04:17.389> really<00:04:17.599> could<00:04:18.049> be

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
and see how beautiful it really could be
