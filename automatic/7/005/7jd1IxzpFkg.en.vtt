all<00:00:01.620> right<00:00:01.800> well<00:00:01.949> I<00:00:01.979> have<00:00:02.100> here<00:00:02.399> galvanic<00:00:03.300> skin

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
all right well I have here galvanic skin

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.670 
all right well I have here galvanic skin
response<00:00:03.859> monitor<00:00:05.330> it's<00:00:06.330> from<00:00:06.540> RadioShack<00:00:06.930> 20

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
response monitor it's from RadioShack 20

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.400 
response monitor it's from RadioShack 20
years<00:00:07.859> ago<00:00:08.010> 15<00:00:08.519> bucks<00:00:09.059> they<00:00:09.750> don't<00:00:09.960> sell<00:00:10.320> them

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
years ago 15 bucks they don't sell them

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.940 
years ago 15 bucks they don't sell them
anymore<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:11.750> that's<00:00:12.750> two<00:00:13.080> velcro<00:00:13.320> straps

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
anymore and that's two velcro straps

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.220 
anymore and that's two velcro straps
hooked<00:00:14.370> up<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.820> my<00:00:15.000> fingers<00:00:15.570> picking<00:00:15.870> up<00:00:16.109> the

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
hooked up to my fingers picking up the

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.099 
hooked up to my fingers picking up the
changes<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.830> skin<00:00:17.160> impedance<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.960> hear

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
changes in skin impedance and you hear

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.279 
changes in skin impedance and you hear
it<00:00:19.230> going<00:00:19.380> up<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.770> down<00:00:19.920> with<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:21.289> also

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
it going up and down with that also

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.439 
it going up and down with that also
we're<00:00:22.769> picking<00:00:23.070> up<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.340> voltage<00:00:23.730> changes<00:00:24.210> on

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
we're picking up the voltage changes on

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.009 
we're picking up the voltage changes on
the<00:00:24.660> almond<00:00:25.730> back<00:00:26.730> surface<00:00:27.300> there<00:00:27.599> with<00:00:27.869> the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
the almond back surface there with the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.560 
the almond back surface there with the
g1<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.560> g2<00:00:28.710> electrode<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.609> Alan<00:00:29.910> put<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:30.300> and

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
g1 and g2 electrode that Alan put on and

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.240 
g1 and g2 electrode that Alan put on and
we're<00:00:30.689> stimulating<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.410> median<00:00:31.769> nerve<00:00:31.949> right

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
we're stimulating the median nerve right

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.790 
we're stimulating the median nerve right
here<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.910> we<00:00:33.480> got<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> ground<00:00:33.899> electrode<00:00:34.530> back

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
here and we got a ground electrode back

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.540 
here and we got a ground electrode back
there<00:00:35.149> and<00:00:36.469> we're<00:00:37.469> ready<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.250> look<00:00:38.370> at<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
there and we're ready to look at the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.330 
there and we're ready to look at the
traces<00:00:39.180> now<00:00:40.820> listen<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.059> audio<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:43.340> watch

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
traces now listen to the audio and watch

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:55.479 
traces now listen to the audio and watch
the<00:00:45.200> voltage<00:00:46.200> changes<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.719> trace<00:00:48.719> goes<00:00:48.989> by

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.459 

the<00:00:56.360> screen<00:00:56.629> again<00:00:56.870> I'm<00:00:56.989> just<00:00:57.079> getting<00:00:57.350> ready

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
the screen again I'm just getting ready

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.080 
the screen again I'm just getting ready
to<00:00:57.590> stimulate<00:00:58.129> you<00:00:58.480> anticipated<00:00:59.480> I<00:01:00.879> get<00:01:01.879> that

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
to stimulate you anticipated I get that

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.270 
to stimulate you anticipated I get that
sixth<00:01:02.449> sense<00:01:02.480> now<00:01:05.890> alright<00:01:06.890> I<00:01:06.920> have<00:01:07.130> two

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
sixth sense now alright I have two

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:34.780 
sixth sense now alright I have two
breathing

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.170 

in<00:01:34.880> simulators

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.730 

a little<00:01:40.900> bit<00:01:41.020> of<00:01:41.140> a<00:01:41.200> notch<00:01:41.380> right<00:01:41.680> there

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
a little bit of a notch right there

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.440 
a little bit of a notch right there
shows<00:01:42.190> at<00:01:42.430> the<00:01:42.460> point<00:01:42.850> where<00:01:43.090> I<00:01:43.120> shouldn't

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
shows at the point where I shouldn't

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.470 
shows at the point where I shouldn't
really<00:01:43.570> do<00:01:43.780> that<00:01:44.050> I<00:01:44.290> guess

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
really do that I guess

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.980 
really do that I guess
so<00:01:46.480> there<00:01:46.630> is<00:01:46.750> a<00:01:46.780> little<00:01:47.140> bit<00:01:47.260> of

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
so there is a little bit of

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.929 
so there is a little bit of
now<00:01:48.890> let's<00:01:49.190> go<00:01:49.340> look<00:01:49.370> at<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.850> store

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.030 

ah<00:01:53.969> here<00:01:54.810> we<00:01:54.840> go

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.960 

and<00:01:58.250> turn<00:01:58.610> this<00:01:58.760> sensitivity

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
and turn this sensitivity

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:15.140 
and turn this sensitivity
in<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.150> hallway

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.320 

latency<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.470> baseline

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.390 

one<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:20.870> half<00:02:21.520> awakening<00:02:22.520> for<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.760> peak

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
one and a half awakening for the peak

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.620 
one and a half awakening for the peak
about<00:02:25.060> 2.1

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
about 2.1

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.070 
about 2.1
okay<00:02:28.240> that's<00:02:29.240> pretty<00:02:29.480> much<00:02:29.630> what<00:02:29.840> you<00:02:29.960> were

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
okay that's pretty much what you were

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.380 
okay that's pretty much what you were
saying<00:02:30.350> you<00:02:30.440> get<00:02:30.620> through<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:30.950> Porterie<00:02:31.340> yeah

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.570 

all<00:02:35.390> right<00:02:35.569> I<00:02:35.900> think<00:02:36.590> I<00:02:36.860> think<00:02:37.220> that's<00:02:37.400> good

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
all right I think I think that's good

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.839 
all right I think I think that's good
enough

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
enough

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.250 
enough
all<00:02:38.840> right<00:02:39.230> call<00:02:39.830> it<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:40.010> wrap
