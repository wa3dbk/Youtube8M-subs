00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.790
 try to keep your shoulders even 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.530

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.080
 and a little about the place and make your way to the 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.470

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:40.220
 exercises do as always 8 to 16 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:46.040
 just to not do a thread you can 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:48.950
 make a simple book fold all those 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:53.650
 the same exercises can be done on 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:56.930
 language is already using desire 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.750
 stop on the knees is practically 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.770
 kitty only without warming up the neck 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:06.229
 if you have a crush on your back and you at least 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.750

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:12.250
 another exercise this jumping does not go and 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:15.290
 on the back on the legs on the neck and generally on 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:19.490
 muscles you 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:23.590
 we can do with the nose can do 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:28.880
 did without a nose and do at the same time and at home 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:32.450
 delay and and get your result 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:35.870
 the muscles will hurt like no good and 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:40.360
 think do 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:43.400
 you can go straight to mine with a ring then 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.729
 raising up trying to understand with 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:51.500
 ring then mail do understanding and 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:54.700
 spray dropping do with understanding there 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.700
 a coup forward 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:01.449
 for this there is still a balance after 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:04.389
 how do we size back what's the matter quietly 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:10.210
 looted on all this already refers to 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:11.919
 name is a question to the driver where is it after 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.620
 how do you learn to do 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:18.069
 will die phase there will not tell in others 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.819
 video and also there may be a balance path 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:25.840
 a miracle to start turning 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:30.189
 balance English swallow and others 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:32.589
 I probably have this all and so we 

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:34.419
 warm up in childhood is a warm-up 

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:36.819
 suitable for beginners 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:41.819
 which is sorry reasonable successful 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:41.819
