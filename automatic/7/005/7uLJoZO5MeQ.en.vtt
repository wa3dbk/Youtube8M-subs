00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:07.060
 Hello, today I want 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:11.740
 tell about what we continue 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:16.059
 work with tomato exactly tomato at 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.039
 we now can see more grown already here 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.529
 2 brush 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.869
 in some places and 3 brush well I wanted to tell 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.720
 not about this that tomato as it should 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:29.019
 growing rises about what came 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:32.169
 very hot weather is very hot 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:35.230
 and the ground began to crack because 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:39.550
 start and here you are not very much 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:42.070
 powerful and we have a land here in the sun 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:46.059
 instantly dries out here fired pali 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.989
 in this watering literally three or four 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:53.199
 hours and the plant dries out because of this 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:57.489
 there is a shortage of water so new 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:59.379
 the cat that we produce for this we 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:05.710
 we produce soil mulching 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:08.649
 I have to husk the seeds we have this husk 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.920
 scatter and so with daughters and then 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:14.909
 neat and leveling we cover and 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:19.119
 drip irrigation and root system 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.299
 the thickness of the coating somewhere 2 3 centimeters 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.119
 because over time all the same . 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:28.990
 will settle down and not even be 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:31.869
 seen on hypnosis already crushed so 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.789
 we have a closed root system 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.600
 which will feel comfortable 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:41.280
 and covered drip irrigation drip 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:45.640
 irrigation will not be under our action 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.409
 tremeina temperature but on yourself then 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.520
 taken to increase it will decrease 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.899
 in size and constantly accounted for her 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.640
 correct and thus correct 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.829
 don't need anything 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.850
 Moisture will be stored 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:04.719
 Mulching can be done not 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.840
 I only have someone to produce zhanna 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:12.349
 instant straw can be eaten 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:18.590
 black film and cover so as not to 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:21.230
 we have weathered the benefit of all that 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.599
 wanted to roll out mulching today 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.200
 soil in our tomato which 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:29.299
 continue to grow normally I grow 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.239
 I think that in the near future we will start 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.579
