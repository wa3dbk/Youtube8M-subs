to<00:03:58.390> your<00:03:58.480> defense<00:03:58.900> you<00:03:59.350> get<00:03:59.500> stunned<00:03:59.830> you<00:04:00.370> take

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
to your defense you get stunned you take

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.760 
to your defense you get stunned you take
a<00:04:00.610> moment

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
a moment

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.790 
a moment
if<00:04:03.160> a<00:04:03.340> character<00:04:03.520> only<00:04:03.730> has<00:04:04.000> one<00:04:04.330> health<00:04:04.810> that

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
if a character only has one health that

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.400 
if a character only has one health that
wound<00:04:05.980> would<00:04:06.130> just<00:04:06.280> kale<00:04:06.540> if<00:04:07.540> you<00:04:07.930> take<00:04:08.140> if

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
wound would just kale if you take if

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.290 
wound would just kale if you take if
Thor<00:04:09.160> for<00:04:09.280> example<00:04:09.550> if<00:04:09.610> he<00:04:09.700> takes<00:04:09.880> the<00:04:09.970> second

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
Thor for example if he takes the second

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.070 
Thor for example if he takes the second
wound<00:04:10.420> he's<00:04:10.630> kale

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.839 

so<00:04:14.080> the<00:04:14.319> results<00:04:14.680> of<00:04:14.709> a<00:04:14.800> combat<00:04:15.099> is<00:04:15.310> either<00:04:15.459> we

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
so the results of a combat is either we

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.370 
so the results of a combat is either we
bounce<00:04:16.060> like<00:04:16.510> neither<00:04:16.750> one<00:04:16.870> of<00:04:16.900> us<00:04:17.019> has<00:04:17.169> enough

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
bounce like neither one of us has enough

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.020 
bounce like neither one of us has enough
attack<00:04:17.620> we<00:04:18.010> both<00:04:18.160> get<00:04:18.370> stunned<00:04:18.579> you<00:04:18.880> know<00:04:18.940> we

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
attack we both get stunned you know we

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.310 
attack we both get stunned you know we
both<00:04:19.120> have<00:04:19.269> a<00:04:19.299> ton<00:04:19.450> of<00:04:19.480> attack<00:04:19.780> versus<00:04:20.139> defense

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
both have a ton of attack versus defense

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.950 
both have a ton of attack versus defense
or<00:04:20.560> only<00:04:20.739> one<00:04:20.919> of<00:04:20.950> us<00:04:21.070> gets<00:04:21.250> tough<00:04:21.630> so<00:04:22.630> normally

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960
