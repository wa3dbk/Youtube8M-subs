gets in um but yeah this is a really
awesome<00:00:51.899> little<00:00:52.530> tank<00:00:53.070> for<00:00:53.340> planet<00:00:53.730> nanos<00:00:54.090> it

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
awesome little tank for planet nanos it

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.170 
awesome little tank for planet nanos it
really<00:00:55.199> really<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.530> think<00:00:55.699> works<00:00:56.699> out<00:00:56.940> well

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
really really I think works out well

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.779 
really really I think works out well
it's<00:00:57.660> got<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.989> overflow<00:00:58.350> back<00:00:58.859> there<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.460> no

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
it's got the overflow back there so no

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.569 
it's got the overflow back there so no
surface<00:01:00.239> scum<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.949> like<00:01:01.949> I've<00:01:02.100> said<00:01:02.129> before<00:01:02.370> I

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
surface scum and like I've said before I

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.160 
surface scum and like I've said before I
like<00:01:02.760> overflows<00:01:03.270> because<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.780> keeps<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
like overflows because it keeps the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.020 
like overflows because it keeps the
water<00:01:04.320> level<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> tank<00:01:05.129> constant<00:01:05.790> and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
water level in the tank constant and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.670 
water level in the tank constant and
whenever<00:01:06.600> water<00:01:06.900> levels<00:01:07.260> getting<00:01:07.439> low<00:01:07.530> it

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
whenever water levels getting low it

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.020 
whenever water levels getting low it
gets<00:01:07.830> low<00:01:07.979> back<00:01:08.189> here<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.760> just<00:01:08.790> have<00:01:08.970> to

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
gets low back here so you just have to

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.969 
gets low back here so you just have to
top<00:01:09.210> off<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.600> part<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.320> display<00:01:10.680> looks

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
top off that part and the display looks

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.429 
top off that part and the display looks
the<00:01:11.130> same<00:01:11.510> it's<00:01:12.510> always<00:01:12.630> thought<00:01:12.810> that's<00:01:12.900> cool

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
the same it's always thought that's cool

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.780 
the same it's always thought that's cool
gives<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.070> good<00:01:14.189> water<00:01:14.400> flow<00:01:14.580> at<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> surface

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
gives you good water flow at the surface

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.789 
gives you good water flow at the surface
but<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:15.570> not<00:01:15.689> too<00:01:15.930> turbulent<00:01:16.140> down<00:01:16.619> at<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
but it's not too turbulent down at the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.940 
but it's not too turbulent down at the
bottom<00:01:16.950> where<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.250> plants<00:01:17.580> are<00:01:18.710> lighting<00:01:19.710> is

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
still the 213 watt power compacts and

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.060 
still the 213 watt power compacts and
these<00:01:24.150> lights<00:01:24.330> are<00:01:24.450> awesome<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.990> really<00:01:25.229> really

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
probably I don't know trim this little

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.270 
probably I don't know trim this little
Wiggy<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> three<00:01:43.200> or<00:01:43.290> four<00:01:43.500> times<00:01:43.649> now<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.220> it

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
Wiggy a three or four times now and it

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.719 
Wiggy a three or four times now and it
always<00:01:44.430> bounces<00:01:44.700> back<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.420> fast<00:01:46.220> and<00:01:47.220> actually

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
always bounces back so fast and actually

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.280 
always bounces back so fast and actually
it<00:01:48.149> doesn't<00:01:48.390> really<00:01:48.509> grow<00:01:48.720> up<00:01:48.899> any<00:01:49.110> more<00:01:49.200> it

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
it doesn't really grow up any more it

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.539 
it doesn't really grow up any more it
grows<00:01:49.439> out<00:01:49.560> towards<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.100> front<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.430> tank

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
grows out towards the front of the tank

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.730 
grows out towards the front of the tank
just<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.850> get<00:01:50.970> as<00:01:51.060> much<00:01:51.240> light<00:01:51.570> all<00:01:52.110> over<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
just to get as much light all over the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.319 
just to get as much light all over the
leaves<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.100> can<00:01:53.189> see<00:01:53.490> how<00:01:53.670> thick<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.180> at

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
leaves you can see how thick it is at

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.530 
leaves you can see how thick it is at
the<00:01:54.420> top<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:56.060> unfortunately<00:01:57.060> one<00:01:57.180> side<00:01:57.420> effect

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
the top so unfortunately one side effect

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.020 
the top so unfortunately one side effect
of<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.619> does<00:01:58.770> tend<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.340> shade<00:01:59.759> this

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
of that is it does tend to shade this

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.990 
of that is it does tend to shade this
crypt<00:02:00.360> parva<00:02:00.420> down<00:02:01.049> here<00:02:01.290> at<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.439> bottom<00:02:01.560> so

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
crypt parva down here at the bottom so

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.580 
crypt parva down here at the bottom so
this<00:02:03.000> really<00:02:03.270> never<00:02:03.509> took<00:02:03.719> off<00:02:03.899> like<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.290> wanted

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
this really never took off like I wanted

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.520 
this really never took off like I wanted
it<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:05.719> somebody<00:02:06.719> mentioned<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.170> me<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.439> it

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
it to somebody mentioned to me that it

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.499 
it to somebody mentioned to me that it
actually<00:02:07.759> carpets<00:02:08.759> much<00:02:08.940> faster<00:02:09.300> if<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.420> have

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
actually carpets much faster if you have

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.960 
actually carpets much faster if you have
like<00:02:09.629> co2<00:02:09.959> which<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:10.920> don't<00:02:11.069> run<00:02:11.190> co2<00:02:11.580> on<00:02:11.730> any<00:02:11.879> of

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
like co2 which I don't run co2 on any of

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.670 
like co2 which I don't run co2 on any of
my<00:02:12.030> tanks<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:12.629> that<00:02:13.020> could<00:02:13.200> be<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.319> limiting

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
my tanks so that could be a limiting

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.970 
my tanks so that could be a limiting
fact

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
fact

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.720 
fact
during<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.550> growth<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.360> I<00:02:16.159> don't<00:02:17.159> know<00:02:17.250> um

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
during the growth and I don't know um

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.610 
during the growth and I don't know um
it's<00:02:18.090> it's<00:02:18.299> doing<00:02:18.450> outright<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:19.110> mean<00:02:19.440> it's

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
it's it's doing outright I mean it's

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.220 
it's it's doing outright I mean it's
just<00:02:19.709> growing<00:02:20.099> really<00:02:20.430> really<00:02:20.790> slowly<00:02:21.239> so<00:02:21.629> I

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
just growing really really slowly so I

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.199 
just growing really really slowly so I
guess<00:02:23.069> I'm<00:02:23.190> used<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.549> crip<00:02:23.700> twenty<00:02:24.060> which

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
guess I'm used to the crip twenty which

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.640 
guess I'm used to the crip twenty which
you<00:02:24.510> know<00:02:24.599> grows<00:02:24.840> really<00:02:25.019> fast<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.590> this

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
you know grows really fast and this

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.330 
you know grows really fast and this
grows<00:02:26.610> much<00:02:26.879> lower<00:02:27.290> but<00:02:28.290> yeah<00:02:28.950> I've<00:02:29.099> seen<00:02:29.220> my

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
grows much lower but yeah I've seen my

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.860 
grows much lower but yeah I've seen my
lonely<00:02:29.730> white<00:02:29.849> cloud<00:02:30.150> in<00:02:30.180> there<00:02:30.420> he's<00:02:30.569> been<00:02:30.720> in

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
lonely white cloud in there he's been in

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.300 
lonely white cloud in there he's been in
pretty<00:02:31.170> much<00:02:31.260> all<00:02:31.470> my<00:02:31.620> tank<00:02:31.890> since<00:02:32.040> I've<00:02:32.160> had

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
pretty much all my tank since I've had

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.150 
pretty much all my tank since I've had
him<00:02:32.810> still<00:02:33.810> all<00:02:34.200> by<00:02:34.410> himself<00:02:34.590> no<00:02:34.920> other<00:02:35.040> white

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
him still all by himself no other white

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.449 
him still all by himself no other white
clouds<00:02:35.430> but<00:02:35.879> I<00:02:36.120> might<00:02:36.660> get<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.840> few<00:02:37.049> more

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
clouds but I might get a few more

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.130 
clouds but I might get a few more
there's<00:02:38.459> a<00:02:38.489> little<00:02:38.640> ohto<00:02:38.970> chillin<00:02:39.599> he's<00:02:39.959> there

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
there's a little ohto chillin he's there

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.009 
there's a little ohto chillin he's there
for<00:02:40.290> algae<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.980> got<00:02:41.790> one<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.060> these<00:02:42.150> cool<00:02:42.420> snails

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
for algae I got one of these cool snails

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.559 
for algae I got one of these cool snails
back<00:02:43.379> here<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.650> like<00:02:43.860> snails<00:02:44.220> he<00:02:45.120> takes<00:02:45.360> care

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
back here I like snails he takes care

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.089 
back here I like snails he takes care
algae<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.319> betas<00:02:46.709> back<00:02:46.890> there<00:02:47.099> chillin<00:02:47.549> and

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
algae and betas back there chillin and

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.289 
algae and betas back there chillin and
yeah<00:02:50.099> that's<00:02:50.370> that<00:02:50.459> this<00:02:50.819> is<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:50.970> really<00:02:51.269> easy

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
yeah that's that this is a really easy

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.349 
yeah that's that this is a really easy
tank<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.930> run<00:02:52.109> I<00:02:52.349> don't<00:02:53.340> actually<00:02:53.640> even<00:02:53.849> really

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
tank to run I don't actually even really

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:58.009 
tank to run I don't actually even really
do<00:02:54.510> water<00:02:54.780> changes<00:02:54.900> anymore<00:02:56.390> because<00:02:57.390> my<00:02:57.629> bio

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
do water changes anymore because my bio

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.960 
do water changes anymore because my bio
load<00:02:58.319> is<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:58.680> low<00:02:58.859> there's<00:02:59.129> just<00:02:59.310> like<00:02:59.700> three

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
load is so low there's just like three

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.030 
load is so low there's just like three
or<00:03:00.060> four<00:03:00.090> fish<00:03:00.450> in<00:03:00.480> here<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.079> the<00:03:01.560> plant<00:03:01.829> mass

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
or four fish in here and the plant mass

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.990 
or four fish in here and the plant mass
is<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:02.459> high

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
is so high

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.580 
is so high
whatever<00:03:03.420> nitrate<00:03:03.840> that<00:03:03.959> does<00:03:04.109> build<00:03:04.410> up

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
whatever nitrate that does build up

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.860 
whatever nitrate that does build up
pretty<00:03:05.370> much<00:03:05.459> gets<00:03:05.910> used<00:03:06.209> immediately<00:03:06.690> by<00:03:06.840> the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
pretty much gets used immediately by the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.800 
pretty much gets used immediately by the
plants<00:03:07.410> so<00:03:07.650> on<00:03:08.400> my<00:03:08.549> level<00:03:08.760> stay<00:03:09.060> really<00:03:09.599> good

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
plants so on my level stay really good

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.119 
plants so on my level stay really good
and<00:03:10.109> all<00:03:10.349> you<00:03:10.440> really<00:03:10.470> have<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.709> do<00:03:10.829> is<00:03:10.920> top<00:03:11.099> it

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
and all you really have to do is top it

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.430 
and all you really have to do is top it
off<00:03:11.430> so<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.359> usually<00:03:12.569> do<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:12.930> water<00:03:13.109> change<00:03:13.170> like

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
off so I usually do a water change like

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.789 
off so I usually do a water change like
once<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.709> month<00:03:13.859> on<00:03:14.040> this<00:03:14.160> tank<00:03:14.870> but<00:03:15.870> um<00:03:16.079> the

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
once a month on this tank but um the

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.979 
once a month on this tank but um the
plan<00:03:17.069> is<00:03:17.340> once<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.359> 20<00:03:18.660> gallon<00:03:18.750> gets

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
plan is once the the 20 gallon gets

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.199 
plan is once the the 20 gallon gets
broken<00:03:19.290> down<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.669> German<00:03:21.030> blue<00:03:21.180> Rams

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
broken down the the German blue Rams
