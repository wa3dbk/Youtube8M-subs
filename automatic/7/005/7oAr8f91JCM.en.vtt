00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.069
 hello and welcome to this hen 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:08.760
 is the recipe of the day is drooling in 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.690
 salt crust 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.599
 we need a bar of 1 kg 5 3 kg of 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.869
 coarse salt a white egg 2 spoons to 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.880
 thin soup of fennel seeds 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.910
 let's talk a bit about my bar the little bard 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.470
 finally the big bar yes bah bah I 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.519
 decided to give him a little name because 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.590
 he has a nice head is not everything 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.630
 but babar me I asked the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.790
 fishmonger to empty them by yes 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.160
 because otherwise I would have a 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.829
 big big big incision here 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.309
 second precision especially we let the 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.930
 scales 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.190
 we do not ask to try the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.629
 cays and we must keep the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.550
 scales because that's fine 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.539
 allow to put a protection between 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.520
 him and the salt 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.570
 go to the water we will make him take a 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.780
 little bath and then we go 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:59.940
 carefully dry it war on deals 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.989
 now salt was worth adding the 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.479
 fennel seeds and egg white that 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.340
 allow to amalgamate salt and blood 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.750
 but a nice crust when cooking 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.409
 now have a layer of salt 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.409
 on the snow done 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.170
 we cover with salt to form a 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.630
 real crust we could well everything 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.049
 just to form a salt bank 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.740
 very homogeneous by the way speaking of 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.119
 salt crust 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.520
 do you like this mode of 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.020
 cooking if it's the case tell me in 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.770
 comments and tell me what you have 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.750
 already cooked in a salt crust 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.429
 little trick if you want to be sure of 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.609
 ability to remove salt very easily 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:47.310
 and avoid that full of small crystals 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:48.780
 nice salt on your fish especially if 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.890
 this is the first time you do a 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.270
 fish in salt crust 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.610
 the best is to put a paper 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.130
 greaseproof between fish and salt 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:08.489
 it's gone for 30 to 35 minutes 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:08.879
 cooking at 210 Â° port menu and that's the 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.289
 job 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.329
 now we still have to 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:18.950
 wait ten minutes before breaking the 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:21.000
 crust the only small risk 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.150
 it's still all over with salt 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.150
 rank 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.430
 we will cut the fish especially 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.530
 holds all the salt well and we also go 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.860
 remove the skin that is too salty we're going 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:36.430
 remove the head here we hold well the 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.940
 skin pathos or hide the attacks are 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.940
 on the side 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.600
 good then there I hope my clumsiness 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.490
 legendary is not going to manifest itself 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.570
 I have to show you how well 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.690
 present a good fish can better 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.690
 make 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.460
 here is my plate and prepare his mother 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.580
 I will show you how 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.710
 remove the two nets from the tsoup 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.700
 I catch the art is simply and 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.440
 the head comes with 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:15.610
 and then we only have to 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:18.330
 clean up, add a little pepper and 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.330
 a drizzle of olive oil 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:26.270
 a little parsley and the turn is 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:28.250
 played the smell not to serve it serves 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.480
 hot if you like fish 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.930
