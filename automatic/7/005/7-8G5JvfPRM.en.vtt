here<00:05:59.610> even<00:05:59.850> though<00:05:59.940> the<00:06:00.090> piece<00:06:00.240> can<00:06:00.390> really

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
here even though the piece can really

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.160 
here even though the piece can really
change<00:06:00.780> much<00:06:01.020> it<00:06:01.950> is<00:06:02.130> still<00:06:02.460> really<00:06:02.760> cool

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.170 
change much it is still really cool

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.690 
change much it is still really cool
comparison<00:06:04.170> here<00:06:04.350> so<00:06:05.190> they<00:06:05.280> get<00:06:05.400> a<00:06:05.460> little<00:06:05.520> bit

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700

each<00:06:29.940> year<00:06:30.000> unless<00:06:30.450> they<00:06:30.660> really<00:06:30.990> screw<00:06:31.410> it<00:06:31.500> up

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850
