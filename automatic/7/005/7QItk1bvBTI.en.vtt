00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.180
 they are new questions and answers I wanted 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.530
 first of all thank all the 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.120
 world that subscribes this new win 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.040
 The truth is that so many people do not 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.930
 I was waiting but I know that you are 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.400
 wonderful and good you can expect 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.320
 many things to you because they are 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.390
 great and they know that I love them 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.310
 very much I will start and answer 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.380
 the questions since I had many 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.270
 unanswered questions from the last 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.279
 time and good I'll start now with Miguel 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.680
 Hernandez asks me what is it that 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.430
 do when you do not upload videos 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.560
 Usually when I'm not climbing 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.120
 videos or I'm not recording videos or 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.220
 playing that I think is what it is 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.649
 refer here with the question I'm 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.480
 listening to music or maybe I'm going to 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.290
 my parents' bakery and I'm by 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.670
 there a while except for there whatever the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.140
 truth there are many things that can be 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.610
 do maybe I start to see a 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.200
 movie if I wanted to see a 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.719
 movie of some series I do not know 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.910
 He tried to distract me a bit I put 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.670
 do a little exercises meons the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.370
 exercise I get distracted let's go if I'm not 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.289
 uploading videos henry ortiz asks me 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.740
 your parents know that you upload videos and 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.900
 come and they supported you to do 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.970
 My parents and I told them a while ago 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.740
 and once this was done 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.000
 bigger at the beginning I did not tell them anything 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.880
 but good as later it was doing 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.980
 bigger and such I told them and 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.630
 they really supported me my father 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.180
 always says that internet and those 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.040
 things I'll have technological are the future 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.320
 and I think he's right so good if 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.600
 he supports me and my family in general I 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.390
 supports in all this that I do is a my 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.820
 family I love her very much 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.340
 Edgar martínez gómez asks me why 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.140
 it is so difficult to enter a good clear 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.540
 this question is quite difficult to 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.510
 answer since you have to see what 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.770
 there are plans that you want to join or is it 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.869
 there are many keys many clans that 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.520
 do different things for example if you 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.650
 you want to join that is you're going to need a 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.410
 youtube channel and have a the 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.120
 capturing and being mounted that if not and 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.400
 kill and send you the clips 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.950
 to the corresponding person so that you 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.810
 I can put the clan there are people who 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.480
 says how to join the rival and you but 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.180
 rival and for the moment that I know is not 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.510
 looking for people because neither in 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.340
 rival and you may have 15 20 people in 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.650
 the clan because those who play challenges are 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.520
 only four people and those four 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.960
 people have to be very 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.660
 interpenetrated and have to play what 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.460
 maximum possible that's why it's not if you do not have 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.170
 sense to put more people but to 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.810
 get into the opponent and well if you do not need 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.640
 have a youtube channel nothing for the 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.910
 style but at this time they are not 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.830
 looking for people to join great guanes 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.530
 suddenly played alice madness 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.780
 returns is not played and I do not have 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.670
 idea of what it is whether he believes me by the 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.290
 comment to see what wow something then 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.880
 yes, happy about life 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.300
 marine deryck asks me if you could 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.670
 have a one weapon in real life from 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.970
 gears of war what to choose aunts 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.690
 I think I would choose the nights 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.790
 I really like it, it's normal that I love it 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.530
 in real life, well, I would get very close 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.470
 the people there are inside the case and they 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:06.480
 I say hello I play josu word 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.850
 derek edwin contreras asks me you 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.620
 I'd like you to invite me to some tacos and I 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.960
 I would be happy with the life that I 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.550
 invite tacos the truth that you 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.300
 I would really appreciate it since to me the 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.160
 Mexican food 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.990
 There is a lot of Mexican food that I like 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.140
 much and especially the burritos the 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.590
 chicken burritos for me are and are what 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.400
 better than I can get to spend 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.750
 juan sand and ask me if you let me 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.239
 I do not want to jump out of a question 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.810
 Ask how sanluisino think fame 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.970
 in God 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.680
 this is a question that there may be a lot 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.050
 controversy not on the subject of religions 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.680
 and such I have to say that I believe in 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:45.379
 God but I do not believe in the church and each 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.330
 one make your opinions that are going to say 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:49.580
 to your system with what you want there are people 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.379
 who believes in the church today respect 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.019
 and I hope you respect my opinion too 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.540
 I believe in God and do not feel gods 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.099
 I know there's something up there that had 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.780
 that having created all this not but I in 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:03.140
 the church in all those things I do not think 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.209
 the truth but good although of small 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.549
 I went to church and everything but good not 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.970
 I did not believe and well I was going forcibly 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.920
 could I say damián herrejón mail me 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.660
 ask if you could visit mexico that 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.220
 it would be the first thing you would do first 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.720
 what would you do is basically what 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.660
 I said before I would make a good restaurant 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.490
 that you recommend me and you would make me or 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.260
 the house any of you look at I 'm going to 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.250
 say to and let your house if I go 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.560
 to eat some Mexican food 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.479
 because I know that many Mexicans tell me 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.980
 no Mexican food from outside the country 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.810
 It is not the same though 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.640
 Mexican food the other time was a 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.370
 restaurant is rich and good was the 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.020
 food but it was not as rich as 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.180
 when food in the US that the US 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.680
 in Mexico but there are many Mexicans there 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.720
 to make food and such and it looks and 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.610
 is much richer than when the 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.500
 kiko food that's why I'd like to go to 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.300
 mexico there to try the food a bit 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.920
 a burrito from there in Mexico has to 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:56.780
 be the bomb ask me the question bay 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.640
 pinguito Villa asked me diaz 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.680
 way when you have a bad streak that 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.090
 do I do not have a bad run in 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.740
 the ies playing in the feed that 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.350
 any game in both the fifa and in 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.540
 the cut and whatever it is I scream a lot 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.460
 not at first he received only to remove 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.470
 a lot because until what moment I say 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.270
 Well I have to calm down because if not 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.820
 this is going to get worse and what I do 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.200
 generally that calms me down and if I see that 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.020
 I'm not calming down 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.370
 I turn off the xbox so it's easy for the 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.200
 team and I will do something else gave me 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.900
 a lot of music I'm going to do a little bit of 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.210
 Relaxation could be said and it is the best 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.770
 I can answer what I do about you 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.050
 I usually do what I do 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.700
 I see that I'm not reassuring it 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.260
 first is to try to calm down if 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.260
 I see that it did not reassure me when I do 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.919
 because if not here I will be exploited 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.479
 veins edu gogoan and I was wondering the 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.419
 way you have been in your life about 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:51.080
 death not me basically I have not touched 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:53.930
 hospitals more than to get vaccines 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.750
 and things like that the general thing that sometimes 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.800
 you feel a frame a little fever 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.180
 lately the most can yes yes that me 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.070
 happened that in itself it was nothing is that I 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.530
 there was a spot on the right side of 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.570
 the face in the right cheek of the face 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.490
 You could say that I get a spot 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.229
 black but in the end it is the age of the sun and 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.030
 well I put on a cream and it is no longer 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:13.340
 nothing had happened I had scared 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:17.300
 I say I have cancer or some of this and I do not 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.560
 I had nothing then for thanks to diosito and 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.600
 well I'm going to move to the last 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.860
 ask me what is valley stampede and 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.840
 I was wondering what you would do if 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.220
 you were in an earthquake I have to 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.830
 say that I was already in several earthquakes 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.960
 in my life in about five I would say more or 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.340
 less approximately when he lived in 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.289
 california if there are people who live in 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.090
 california examining this video is going to me 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:37.550
 understand and here in california there are many 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.160
 earthquakes I generally lived five 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.949
 years in the USA and you will have been in a few 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.280
 five or four earthquakes a thing like that and 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:46.160
 the truth 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.780
 it's kind of pretty weird is not it 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.520
 can explain is something like that that 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.050
 move everything and you can not control it 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.550
 you are moving the moment of the 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.080
 earth everything you 're next to you 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.550
 It seemed firm in a moment you start to 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.470
 move to one side and to the other and 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.550
 well it's kind of weird I hope that 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.840
 you liked this episode of 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.800
 questions and answers and see you in 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.800
 another video see you later
