00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 i 

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:09.250
 the nation of people is a technique that 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.830
 introduce a gene extracted from a 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.610
 any organism in another organism 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.500
 different 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.240
 usually a bacterium something that you 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.539
 is the origin of a set of 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.130
 identical cells called clone 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.669
 each containing one or more 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.519
 copies of that particular gene the 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:33.160
 result of gene cloning 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.710
 first produce a certain gene in 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.560
 enough quantity to characterize it 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.190
 from the structural point of view and 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.129
 functional 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.539
 also when this strange transit and 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.969
 translated in English 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.469
 where it has been tried to produce 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.600
 an organism an encoded protein 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:53.870
 they pronounce derivative of an organism 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.879
 logical cloning of genes is part 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.760
 of a technology called engineering 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.860
 Genetics allows to build genotypes 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.890
 new and therefore organisms with 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.190
 new genetic characteristics 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.109
 derived from 10 different or DNA 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.850
 recombined badly 

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:12.679
 to carry out the DNA method 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.659
 recombinant are numerous 

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:17.210
 proper to a really specific 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.429
 This is obtained thanks to the 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.079
 genetic cloning the vector of 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:23.569
 cloning is a DNA molecule 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:25.729
 replicating and stable to which you can 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:27.909
 adhere to a foreign DNA treatment for 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.520
 introduce it into some cells 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.950
 inserting a sector plan 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.420
 involves cutting the bird into strangers and the 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.359
 platinum with the same on top of 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.490
 restriction the DNA and the placÃ©me do not 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:41.859
 they mix together so it generates a 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:46.049
 recombinant plasmid containing the 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:46.049
 fragment of alien DNA 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.270
 you need a vector statement that 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.460
 must contain an origin of replication 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.310
 recognized in the host cell so 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.910
 that is replicated together with the DNA that 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.230
 second portal must carry markers 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.020
 selectable 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.420
 that is, features that allow 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.400
 cells that contain the vector are 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.849
 selected or identified 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.730
 the 0 a planning vector requires a 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:20.180
 individual cutting site for each 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.030
 over restriction 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.510
 there are unique sites of death of the 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:30.420
 restriction enzyme these are 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:34.150
 pst 1 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.420
 has h 1 s 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:42.190
 the one in estoril 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:45.190
 yhyn of 3 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.510
 an ideal statement vector have a 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.580
 origin of replication 1 more bookmarks 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.990
 selectable and one or more sites of 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.990
 political restriction 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.550
 In short, gene cloning is a 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.360
 technique that selects a gene of interest 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.580
 producing vaccine antibiotics 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.200
 therapeutic proteins hormones 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.200
 xstrata for any term
