00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:09.040
 how are they today I bring you a plate 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:12.389
 rhythmic audio for led that captures the 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.389
 sound environment 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.240
 It was done because they asked me 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.580
 and they asked me for the controlling beach 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.640
 that I do 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.920
 one that one that has uptake of 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.840
 sound that is rhythmic audio type like that 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.920
 that I started doing it there came out that 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.020
 I'm showing 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.290
 is made with operational children to 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.210
 amplify a microphone and a tip 42 to the 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.070
 output to handle leds strips or 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.500
 whatever is 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.790
 I'm going to show you can see that when 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.790
 I speak the light is undertaken 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:49.640
 and demonstrate with a little music or a 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.540
 radio that I have here that when we talk 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.880
 of knowing 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.510
 turn on the lights but let's put a 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.510
 little music 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.320
 They are taking a little while 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.670
 a photo to find a video on 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.670
 different businesses that will travel 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.630
 your house 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.700
 more than two hundred pages 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.750
 d 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:43.780
 good today they could see how it works 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.940
 the light and rhythmic audio so I encourage you 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.750
 make their own version 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.300
 you just have to experiment and try a 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.030
 little until you find the point 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.910
 is the prototype and it works so 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.300
 after a definitive plate but that 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.300
 they like it
