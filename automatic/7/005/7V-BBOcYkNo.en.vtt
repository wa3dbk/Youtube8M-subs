00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello good the hour is my name is solid in 72 and this is my first 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.800
 video in the end I hope you like them 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.970
 so bored I did not know what to put but in search of sangoÃ³ what I 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.309
 I found a blog if one blog of the millions that exist on the internet 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.390
 and I saw that he had information of interest 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.960
 common and frikadas in short its high link in more information the pad is called 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.949
 'the corner of dragon trainer and the topic to be discussed is the history of windows 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.759
 I hope you like it for better or for worse 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.620
 the history of windows 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.410
 the first times 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.270
 pac expansion for ms 2 in the year 1979 or something like that xerox created a system 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.260
 of graphic environment for your xerox system high a non-commercial PC that 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.540
 It was available in several universities 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.650
 of this system the screen draws attention 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.990
 that has a tall figure instead of a boat that we are used to seeing 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.350
 on the wide screen or even on normal PCs today 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.520
 pestis jobs was a day to be ocs park 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.620
 stick high research center 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.120
 and saw what the graphic system was like 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.130
 he realized that wounded computing over there 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.750
 so after a disbursement close to one million dollars in 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.250
 computational systems that e-poll sold to xerox 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.110
 the engineers had free chipe for three days in the center of 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.660
 investigation of the company of the soon to be put to work in a 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.360
 pc that would be called smooth 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.360
 in honor of the daughter of jobs 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.710
 when this pc went on the market 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.860
 it cost almost 10 thousand dollars 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.040
 in current dollars would be almost 21 thousand 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.670
 had a 5 megahertz processor courtesy of Motorola and 1 megabit 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.570
 RAM 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.010
 independent of the rest of the jaguar 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.580
 the important is that 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.320
 they brought a graphical interface 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.580
 this was what would mark the e-poll trend for the rest of his life 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.270
 until now 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.880
 microsoft saw this 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.369
 and realizing that the text console would soon be in the past 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.369
 They rushed in to get a competition version 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.009
 the windows 1 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.480
 went on sale in the year 1985 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.969
 but it has been developing since 1983 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:20.429
 it was an expansion payment for the system that was in vogue in that 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:21.079
 moment 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.639
 ms 2 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:26.529
 demanded a graphic card was scratched hercules 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:27.840
 ms 2 2 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.510
 0 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.380
 As minimum 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.220
 256 kilobits of ram 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.639
 and two floppies or hard disk 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:35.780
 the users have 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.860
 tive is ms2 they looked askance at the newcomer 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:45.039
 the exclusive programs of ms2 ran with less speed when running under 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:46.499
 the new system 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:47.470
 and in reality 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.669
 it was not worth the investment 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:50.810
 later 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.090
 in 1987 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.229
 microsoft pulled a cute us2 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:57.889
 it was a fiasco 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:01.349
 it was an improved version of windows 1 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.939
 but the jaguar he demanded was too much and he was even slower than the system 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.149
 previous 

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:09.719
 besides the legal messes with the cabbage 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:13.950
 who sued them and their friends from hp were a blot 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.009
 a wound with mud on the reputation of the system at that time 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:19.749
 If you wonder why 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:24.019
 It is because at that time those who used PC were almost all business people 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.819
 not like today when a program is forbidden or has messes 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.569
 everyone wants to try it 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.119
 a pc was too expensive to risk in a product with failures or 

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:37.749
 prone to being unusable 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:40.040
 there were good ideas in the concept 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.180
 but the problems literally ate the system 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:44.809
 but nevertheless 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:47.639
 in 1990 everything changed 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.709
 the arrival of windows 3 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.109
 0 allowed the old users of ms 2 to have access to good functions of 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:55.900
 multitask 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.069
 thanks to the creation of the now known virtual memory 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.030
 its interface 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.199
 pretty refined and retouched 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:08.259
 made the PCs based on ms 2 finally be a competition would be for the 

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:09.869
 ecobol systems 

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:14.759
 this did the apple company quite badly which always placed 

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:15.590
 for the 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.569
 two to be a totally closed system 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:20.720
 now compatible PCs 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.199
 much cheaper and simpler they had 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.199
 an interface worthy of competing worth fighting 

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:28.169
 windows 3 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:33.210
 0 made use of the latest technology in graphics thanks to the irruption of 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.199
 life cards 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.750
 and the protected and extended modes that allowed applications 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:42.149
 will use more memory much more easily than from 2 

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:46.039
 being compatible with any intel processor 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:49.479
 from 8 thousand 86 onwards 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.789
 not only this but because it is retrocompatible 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:53.879
 windows 3 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:05:00.219
 0 was to be compiled in a 16 bit environment without even using the 32 bits 

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:03.559
 capacity of processors 386 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.639
 months later a park would leave 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.539
 p integrated windows 3 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:11.199
 0 with multimedia extensions 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.729
 these were packaged with the multimedia update kits that came 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.479
 when buying sound cards from expensive brands or cd drives 

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:24.589
 this version was part of the specifications for a multimedia pc 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.999
 all this caused that the market for windows will increase 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.259
 the software developers made windows 3 0 a jit a smash 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:39.360
 that sold almost 10 million copies in two years before it came out 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.909
 windows 3 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:43.360
 parallel to all this 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.379
 during the second half of the 80th s 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:51.999
 microsoft and ive m had been developing os / 2 as successor the ms 2 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:58.440
 os barbados took full advantage of the protected mode of the 286 ti processor 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:01.490
 used up to 16 megabits of memory 

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:03.759
 it was a united development 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:08.150
 an alliance that could have generated huge profits if it had been known 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.139
 make good use of 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:11.280
 but nevertheless 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.940
 in the year 90 to see the success of windows microsoft I wanted to continue 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.990
 developing a hindu 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.050
 and bm I wanted to continue with some barbados 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.169
 after several requests 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.099
 microsoft made their alliance with ibm n 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:30.990
 leaving them hanging and with a half system that would soon be worked by 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.539
 soft masters to create the first true business operating system 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:38.279
 from microsoft windows nt 

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:42.569
 To understand this, you have to keep in mind that both bm and maicon 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:42.970
 suns 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.120
 being a joint development 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.270
 they had access to the total code of the system 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.660
 when Microsoft retired he was left with a copy of the OSH source code 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.610
 barbados 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:54.349
 in fact 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:59.080
 many of the osh / two graphical interface add-ons were copied and 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.080
 placed later in windows 95 

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:04.080
 Finally 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.090
 a desktop war war desktop was generated 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.110
 between windows 3ie bars 2d and bm 

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:14.369
 there was not a decision on which one was better at that time 

00:07:14.369 --> 00:07:16.560
 as well as today we have 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.740
 topo ars between the graphic environments of linux and windows xp 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.290
 or the graphic environments of windows vista and mac os leopard at that time the 

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:28.559
 battle was between barbados and windows 3 x 

00:07:29.529 --> 00:07:30.740
 windows 3 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.740
 1 would be an improved version of windows 3 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.449
 that would take advantage of new memory and processing functions 

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:40.569
 plus several bugs fixed 

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:46.419
 and very industrial is 11 is essentially a windows 3 1 but with many functions of 

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:47.990
 network and connectivity 

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:52.580
 however it was not with the tcp / ip protocol as now 

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.749
 windows 3 

00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:57.289
 11 used the de facto standards of the nobel era 

00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:02.819
 and I would use them until the arrival of windows 95 that would bring its own 

00:08:02.819 --> 00:08:05.449
 attempt to compete against the internet 

00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:07.249
 from microsoft network 

00:08:07.249 --> 00:08:09.460
 this is the end of the first video 

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.750
 although safe with much more data in the following video
