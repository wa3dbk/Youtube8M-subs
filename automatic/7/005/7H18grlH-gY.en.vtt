00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.379
 and well this all here smells 

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:06.740
 recommended and I bring you the first 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:09.289
 episode of a robot that the truth is 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.110
 that I went into the reflux yesterday 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:15.619
 and I started recording a couple of episodes 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.810
 of this this nuclear error so 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.010
 say it then well the truth is that 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.870
 they explain to me what it is you know 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.700
 that a little medal that when you're done in 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.250
 plan I think it 's a bird it's a medal and 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.050
 it's kind of a title if I do not 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.050
 mistake in which you want a streak of 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.390
 30 you get the 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.950
 the medal is nuclear you have 30 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.570
 low with the weapon nothing more that is not 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.250
 you can make use of gusts and all that 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.840
 then good as never again the 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.760
 proposed neither good and in addition always 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.620
 game alone that is much more let's say 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.239
 complicated to make a harrow of 30 with the 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.610
 weapon because it has to be when you 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.530
 you just do not have people who scrub to give is 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.540
 a desk without having anything of 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.400
 nothing because in fact it is that I never 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.170
 proposal that you really already appreciate me and 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.489
 I like to kill in the middle of any with the 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.500
 Weapon with the stripes I want to get out 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.360
 the gusts and kill more than just with 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.399
 the weapon but the good thing is that it has 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.649
 seemed pretty entertaining to do 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.089
 to be able to do a series like that and what 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.550
 I've done it, it's been good to put on 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.429
 is this class I have put the gusts 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.160
 which are as you are seeing from those of 

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:15.020
 counterespionage lugo those to know 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.330
 where are the enemies and not have the 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.280
 temptation to get to kill with some 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.410
 gusts and good this series is going to be in 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.130
 direct or live and the only bad thing is that 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:27.440
 the capturer file was 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.720
 broke the circle sm looks like this is not 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.130
 there is file go then I had catch it 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.690
 in cinema mode the audio had it but 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.369
 let's say that at the beginning when I was 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.890
 creating the class explaining what 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.320
 the series consisted 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.700
 is not recorded thing that would be something 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.510
 quite complicated is to say that it has 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.520
 a live 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.190
 it's a fudge so I'd rather 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.659
 commenting on the best and explaining in 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.090
 what will it consist and explain everything with 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.159
 much more calm did not imply me you are 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.479
 well it's a low departure confirmed and 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.940
 it seemed to me that it would be easier 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.380
 take out the gusts and also I was going to 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.390
 be one of the purposes where I was going to 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.270
 See enough time to get you out 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.280
 to get you out on a roll and tell us 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.780
 that maybe in domain that was more 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.640
 simple because the games must last 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.920
 quite and you can have locked 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.950
 the enemies but well I do not know why 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.989
 because it is low confirmed and I already that 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.670
 I put as cited here and more or less 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.170
 I got it pretty good I do not know how much 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.330
 service should last because afternoons 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.610
 carmelo but good age is that I 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.709
 I put in this class which has 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.670
 silencer has the peephole is that 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.070
 it's boiling 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.180
 the laser also has the handle and 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.819
 like writing here for example 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:35.060
 I already had a streak of 15 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.129
 oysters the truth is to put you say 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.829
 maybe a guy who he was 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.269
 championing a sniper the slogan a 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.969
 Once they get would be the second time you 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.579
 I saw the background between my partner dies 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:48.260
 say in a c4 of the head I shot 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.670
 but why is it there is there what 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.810
 we wanted and he starts killing people and he 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.099
 it remains alone then let's say that my 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.040
 goal was more or less to get a 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:01.099
 pretty long streak and calmly get me out 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.230
 of sats obviously comes in super good for 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.510
 put back here gusts and good so 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.719
 less I take off the say the spine of 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.129
 your grandfather and take off the nuclear one and 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:12.260
 others that as I tell you I had never 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.329
 since he had put there so 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.129
 well here also let's say you can 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.329
 serve a bit like to get 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.459
 try to see how much time you spend 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.199
 carmelo and others and it can be quite 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.329
 quite entertaining but as I say 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:24.709
 sincerely be the only thing I want and 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.000
 when I get to play it is to kill 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.400
 slopes with asthma with a thing with 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.769
 another and that's why I say that I never 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.359
 I had proposed some of your emesa 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.699
 so that it televises and 300 million 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:37.280
 nuclear problems and I really do not have 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:38.650
 none but not like I tell you 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.269
 I took off 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.519
 here you see I was on a streak 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:46.599
 quite powerful I think I got 20 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:49.659
 and peak was wrong 23-24 leads would lead 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.819
 we arrived with her at this time 22 and 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.620
 well let's say it gives a lot of rage 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.480
 How it kills you does not improve a few of 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.129
 take it out and more when you go to see how 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.430
 they're going to kill now that it really is 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:02.590
 quite frustrating enough you start 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.790
 to give an enemy I think in fact that 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.870
 I was dead and at the moment in the 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.959
 that stopped firing there are you see I 'm going 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.370
 22-0 and I would simply have eight 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.730
 then problem deals 22 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.100
 you have 8 that really are not that many 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.530
 it is expected that point of let's say that of 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.229
 dying a little stuck in servers that 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.350
 just do not make me fall and here 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.540
 It's when it comes the cool moment 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.760
 metro for this area pim pam that if not 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.680
 there is no one so suddenly I see here man 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.080
 that was watering the plants has 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.550
 equal clouds ok let's go to another side 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.960
 calmly and time you know I did not have 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.770
 no hurry the truth is that I have 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.979
 here and 24 I'm 24 I take the badge and 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.470
 eye to the moment because the uncle is here 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:48.410
 it starts to shoot and it's just me 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.760
 I had moved the weapon and I started to believe 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.750
 that had killed her from Choco Movistar 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.729
 for a while because he was watching the 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.199
 repetition and I really had 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.630
 started firing the weapons I was 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:58.250
 had moved a little bit up but 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.530
 yesterday is everything all you all have in 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.419
 the head in cinema mode is not seen let's say 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.430
 that really looks like it happened but 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.530
 in my camera obviously did not happen the 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.240
 cinema mode is just like that but it has its 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.070
 connection and so on there is also another 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.780
 way in my camera was shooting from 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.090
 three or four strips of the head and I said 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.440
 even to shoot so imagine 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.630
 say that when seen repetition 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.880
 so you have to comment on the video 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.920
 I have hallucinated uncle said, but if I 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.260
 I really told him I gave him and now he goes out 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.020
 there like kernel two bullets and then there was 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.120
 failed but a run of 24 if I did not 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.430
 wrong for a first episode is 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.350
 pretty well seen well at best 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.350
 the first not really super 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:46.310
 as I will comment on a video and you will see no 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:49.640
 that is to say that allows me this nuclear and 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.720
 then really eye and I start to get it out 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.510
 in the first episode and has been which 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.280
 as to see or see if it is clear what 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.230
 I liked better that you have touched on commenting 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.470
 video as now above explaining 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.660
 simply what to do then 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.420
 explain a bit to finish what is 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.370
 my goal in this series and how to do it 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.890
 to take off gusts of this style of 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.870
 a pretty pretty fast way in 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.850
 first place always have you going to have 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.410
 that killing with the weapon has the weapon what 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.360
 best possible then in this case the 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.880
 three accessories as I said took the 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.140
 grip was wearing the muffler for 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.080
 they do not say where I am because they kill 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.260
 30 let's say you have to enemies and 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.050
 do not 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.430
 that people come for you and then the 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.260
 peephole approach it as its possible then 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.540
 it's super good to shoot from the 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.510
 hip and well this was more or less my 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.440
 target carried stun grenades 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.670
 obviously fragmentation grenades 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.130
 to know where well the enemies and that 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.930
 like and especially scavenger because 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:45.490
 so you're going to always need a lot of 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:47.570
 bullets and if you need bullets 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:50.720
 normally to take to kill eight or 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:52.250
 seven or more and oysters you need 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.070
 have a lot of knowledge by 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.900
 here to catch frozen balls coges 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.820
 most of all and comes to you really well so 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.500
 how good that would be basically my class 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.490
 I do not carry practically good I carry weapons 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.650
 secondary I simply carry the 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.630
 knife there and nothing if you liked the 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.100
 video and you like the series vote the video 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:11.889
 and subscribe to not lose any 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.889
 episode all the next goodbye
