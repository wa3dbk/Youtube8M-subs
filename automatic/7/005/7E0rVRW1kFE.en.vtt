00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.530
 Today is what is now again euro jobs 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.450
 and we are here again a hotel lobby 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.130
 made a video last night 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.350
 because we are still invited to the FC 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.270
 were and still have a bit with us 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.830
 those targeted to the event now always 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.040
 our winner already has here today 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.510
 bracket final match had against 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.830
 unleashed stars team name many of 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.350
 you certainly have in stream 10 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.850
 we have become so with 3 1 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.860
 a winner bracket final drafted 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.020
 and thus have a safe top 2 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.650
 Placement were able to get our prize money from 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.570
 1000 Euro 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:48.400
 so please say grand final story until 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.040
 have now moved into the grand final 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.170
 thus have a safe top 2 placement 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.290
 our profit from 1000 euro to 1500 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.670
 euro already medium high set now 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.440
 then take in the grand final then play 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.379
 either unleashed against bonds 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.449
 again or against y is ossi game 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.610
 now in loose bracket final and short 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:11.440
 also maps form winner bracket finals 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:15.729
 The guys started off well 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.320
 equal bkg captures took the first 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.060
 two minutes equal to the kings give up 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.530
 you even know 30 points in front 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.250
 and then gave a bit 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.070
 maybe once had a short break 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.259
 at the end still under nine points 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.159
 difference won 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.680
 ok and second half was dominant though 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:42.899
 also equal to b and c 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.899
 we have everything around the time 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.469
 the second map was in the hawks 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.710
 our first map we met 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:55.390
 In the whole event we just say 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.039
 I actually think so 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.749
 one or maybe none 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.039
 defender round cult it was easy 

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:01.539
 because that was always gone are the 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.369
 we just do not manage to 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.840
 So defend where I was right 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.329
 i think i liked a class 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.520
 I had no anti star and it 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:11.170
 was I think 26 about the out 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.860
 just say we're playing badly 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.360
 every time better and that is the 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.410
 mac was flash octane in the beginning we have 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.819
 pretty much a few points 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.920
 only then 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.450
 I say the opponents and we were 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.700
 pretty defensive in there so it is 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.049
 none of us somehow great on 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.879
 points we went somehow 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.290
 trying to stop the people 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.629
 wanted to come in our pace 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.090
 in the end I think 10 10 and 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.469
 at that time still let me lie 30 20 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.269
 seconds to play or so then 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:42.790
 I still somehow managed with luck 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.709
 let's just say goodbye to that by luck 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.239
 nod and make the last point 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.769
 the last ten seconds and so on 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:54.819
 that we have won the victory of 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:57.010
 then the web and then nomination strikes 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.310
 the fourth map we were all the way to 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.049
 pretty hype night with lightning and there 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.959
 You can do everything from the first minute 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:07.180
 we had a direct cap and fit 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.769
 Perfect location always getting this on 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.409
 the title stain we went then 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.609
 every yard lay back and there 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:18.099
 everything fit, everyone has a good time 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:19.269
 played and the people are themselves 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.079
 Why have not I wondered this time 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.669
 it was at the back 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.620
 I was not allowed to go to the stage because 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:25.419
 the coach in the previous match of 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.069
 somehow takes over coupled 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:29.069
 so do not be surprised at the an screen 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.699
 so the boys yes as I said already 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.280
 the grand final 

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:38.319
 they play either against y or at 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.849
 So that's what's going to happen now 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.040
 through the loose bracket final 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.919
 and if you should play against y 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.359
 there will be two best 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:49.290
 the guys just have to win one of them 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:51.459
 and would then also fce winner 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:56.019
 and when they play against others 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:58.479
 it should be better in continuous 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.019
 I think the live will be 3 1 in life 

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:01.239
 guide 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.659
 from the user basin of the mini 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.310
 I would have to break it fine 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:09.340
 better we have to live then only 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.049
 Win four maps and yes I guess 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.909
 the guys are definitely top 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.759
 It should definitely be on it today 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.019
 be feasible 

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:18.310
 exactly so we will contact you later 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.049
 again when we know when we are about 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.639
 Bidding games is around to post it again 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.870
 thank you already now for your
