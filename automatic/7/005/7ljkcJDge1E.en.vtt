00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
the bacon in half I think I might have

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.639 
the bacon in half I think I might have
it<00:00:59.760> there<00:00:59.940> we<00:01:00.059> go<00:01:00.210> we<00:01:00.390> got<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.690> bacon<00:01:01.410> cut<00:01:01.590> in

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
half right now and the reason we do that

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.670 
half right now and the reason we do that
is<00:01:02.969> again<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.600> scallops<00:01:04.290> are<00:01:04.409> now<00:01:04.500> small

enough that we want small strips of

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.740 
enough that we want small strips of
bacon<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.689> wrap<00:01:06.810> around<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.350> spots<00:01:08.750> alright
