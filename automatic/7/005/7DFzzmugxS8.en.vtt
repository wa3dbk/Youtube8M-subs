00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.450 
you got this like vehicle there we got
this<00:01:38.329> metallic<00:01:39.380> Blue<00:01:40.380> Ranger<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.100> think<00:01:41.340> this

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
this metallic Blue Ranger I think this

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.039 
this metallic Blue Ranger I think this
one<00:01:41.610> morphs<00:01:41.909> into<00:01:42.000> Billy<00:01:42.360> if<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.689> put<00:01:42.899> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
one morphs into Billy if you put the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.319 
one morphs into Billy if you put the
head<00:01:43.259> back<00:01:43.290> yeah<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:43.950> does<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.880> can<00:01:44.939> see<00:01:45.060> right
