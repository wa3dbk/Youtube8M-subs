00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.530
 Look, you only know what happens when God 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:56.040
 created our world our body our 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.050
 life our mind was start the leaf 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.440

 clean and limpinha branca with nothing 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.840
 of stain but because of sin as 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.010
 I said at the beginning sin entered the 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.950
 world and began to tarnish our lives 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.080
 often by choices we make 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.110
 this all represents here represents 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:24.810
 our mind our body what we 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:27.959
 God created the pencil by scratching the sheet 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.660
 I can take risks and more risk is the 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:34.230
 sin coming into our lives 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.030
 Only Jesus, I'm going to say Jesus. 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.370

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.110
 A little dirty hand, my little tire, right? 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.730

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.959
 Bible to you that speaks the following 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.030
 It's in the book of John chapter 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.230
 Let me see the chapter here right. 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.730
 Chapter 11 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:32.020
 verse 29 that says so the next day 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:35.500
 John saw Jesus towards him and said 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:39.190
 jesus was looking for direction and john 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:42.639
 he said so there is the lamb of 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:45.850
 god who takes away the sin of the world 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:48.760
 jesus is the lamb of god who takes the 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.400
 sin of the world, I thank him 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.460
 because if you do something about it 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.110
 wrong can you ask for forgiveness that he 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.110
 will forgive your sins 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.139
 Okay, God bless you and give you a Saturday.
