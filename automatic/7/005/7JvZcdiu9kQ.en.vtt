there ok so but there are a few
differences<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.189> look<00:01:35.340> at<00:01:35.520> here<00:01:35.700> let's<00:01:36.119> start

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
differences to look at here let's start

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.830 
differences to look at here let's start
with<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.600> big<00:01:36.810> one<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.650> antenna<00:01:38.070> ok<00:01:38.840> ATT

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
with the big one is the antenna ok ATT

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.200 
with the big one is the antenna ok ATT
is<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.950> gsm<00:01:41.610> network<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:43.340> verizon<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> CDMA

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
is a gsm network and verizon is a CDMA

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.149 
is a gsm network and verizon is a CDMA
networks<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.079> why<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.320> phone<00:01:46.920> hasn't

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
networks this is why the phone hasn't

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.410 
networks this is why the phone hasn't
come<00:01:47.430> sooner<00:01:47.790> because<00:01:47.939> it's<00:01:48.210> different

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
come sooner because it's different

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.350 
come sooner because it's different
antenna<00:01:49.020> technology<00:01:49.229> inside<00:01:50.189> now<00:01:51.000> one<00:01:51.329> thing

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
antenna technology inside now one thing

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.810 
antenna technology inside now one thing
to<00:01:51.509> keep<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:51.810> mind<00:01:51.869> here<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.820> there

with<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.120> TMP<00:02:12.600> it's<00:02:12.720> not<00:02:12.930> too<00:02:13.080> big<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.290> an<00:02:13.500> issue

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
with a TMP it's not too big of an issue

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.660 
with a TMP it's not too big of an issue
anymore<00:02:13.890> as<00:02:15.440> Apple<00:02:16.440> did<00:02:16.680> kind<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.070> quietly<00:02:17.460> add

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
showing that verizon's actually it's

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.890 
showing that verizon's actually it's
faster<00:04:01.080> because<00:04:01.830> their<00:04:02.340> network<00:04:02.730> is<00:04:02.970> isn't<00:04:03.570> so

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
faster because their network is isn't so

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530

on<00:04:11.040> their<00:04:11.250> phone<00:04:11.430> is<00:04:11.640> that<00:04:11.820> you<00:04:11.910> can<00:04:12.060> still<00:04:12.450> do

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
on their phone is that you can still do

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.410 
on their phone is that you can still do
simultaneous<00:04:13.530> data<00:04:13.830> and<00:04:14.220> calls<00:04:14.850> so<00:04:15.269> if<00:04:15.330> you

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
simultaneous data and calls so if you

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.729 
simultaneous data and calls so if you

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:18.960 
while you're on a phone call you can do

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.539 
while you're on a phone call you can do
that<00:04:19.140> if<00:04:19.470> you<00:04:19.560> need<00:04:19.739> to<00:04:19.799> go<00:04:19.919> online<00:04:20.100> while

you're on the phone

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.490 
you're on the phone
you<00:04:21.519> can<00:04:21.699> still<00:04:21.940> do<00:04:22.150> that<00:04:22.300> with<00:04:22.840> verizon<00:04:23.380> you

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
you can still do that with verizon you

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.250 
you can still do that with verizon you
would<00:04:23.620> have<00:04:23.740> to<00:04:23.919> you<00:04:24.460> can<00:04:24.610> only<00:04:24.729> do<00:04:24.970> data<00:04:25.690> like

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
would have to you can only do data like

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.129 
would have to you can only do data like
internet<00:04:26.710> or<00:04:27.610> phone<00:04:28.120> calls<00:04:28.389> you<00:04:28.720> can<00:04:28.840> only<00:04:28.990> do

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
internet or phone calls you can only do

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.570 
internet or phone calls you can only do
one<00:04:29.290> or<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.470> other<00:04:29.560> not<00:04:29.889> both<00:04:30.070> at<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.370> same
