studio musicians playing guitar on most
of<00:01:29.289> the<00:01:29.410> album<00:01:29.740> so<00:01:30.520> um<00:01:31.270> as<00:01:31.539> I<00:01:31.600> thought<00:01:31.840> about

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
of the album so um as I thought about

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.029 
of the album so um as I thought about
doing<00:01:32.140> a<00:01:32.259> lesson<00:01:32.380> on<00:01:32.590> this<00:01:32.740> I<00:01:32.860> thought<00:01:33.009> ah

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
doing a lesson on this I thought ah

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.400 
doing a lesson on this I thought ah
maybe<00:01:33.310> we<00:01:33.369> should<00:01:33.550> just<00:01:33.640> do<00:01:33.850> one<00:01:34.690> of<00:01:35.050> Bob's

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
maybe we should just do one of Bob's

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.830 
maybe we should just do one of Bob's
many<00:01:35.830> live<00:01:36.130> versions<00:01:36.729> and<00:01:37.420> I<00:01:37.479> might<00:01:37.660> get<00:01:37.780> to

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
many live versions and I might get to

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.900 
many live versions and I might get to
that<00:01:38.110> but<00:01:38.619> that's<00:01:38.800> all<00:01:39.009> of<00:01:39.250> that<00:01:39.399> has<00:01:39.610> sort<00:01:39.789> of

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
that but that's all of that has sort of

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.520 
that but that's all of that has sort of
delayed<00:01:40.330> me<00:01:40.539> getting<00:01:40.810> to<00:01:40.960> it<00:01:41.050> at<00:01:41.170> all

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
delayed me getting to it at all

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.020 
delayed me getting to it at all
so<00:01:41.649> I<00:01:41.710> finally<00:01:41.920> thought<00:01:42.100> no<00:01:42.280> let's<00:01:42.490> just<00:01:42.550> do<00:01:42.820> it

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
so I finally thought no let's just do it

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.359 
so I finally thought no let's just do it
the<00:01:43.539> way<00:01:43.660> it<00:01:43.810> is<00:01:43.929> on<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.530> studio<00:01:44.830> album<00:01:45.160> with

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
the way it is on the studio album with

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.819 
the way it is on the studio album with
these<00:01:45.490> arpeggios<00:01:45.640> in<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.570> key<00:01:46.750> of<00:01:46.840> E<00:01:46.990> so<00:01:47.619> I<00:01:47.650> put

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
these arpeggios in the key of E so I put

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.440 
these arpeggios in the key of E so I put
together<00:01:47.950> tab<00:01:48.400> for<00:01:48.729> i<00:01:48.759> down<00:01:48.939> a<00:01:48.970> chord<00:01:49.210> chart

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
together tab for i down a chord chart

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.240 
together tab for i down a chord chart
and<00:01:49.840> everything<00:01:50.530> that<00:01:50.680> talks<00:01:50.860> about<00:01:50.950> all<00:01:51.100> the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
and everything that talks about all the

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.710 
and everything that talks about all the
parts<00:01:51.520> there<00:01:51.759> are<00:01:51.820> just<00:01:52.000> a<00:01:52.090> couple<00:01:52.119> of<00:01:52.390> parts

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
parts there are just a couple of parts

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.130 
parts there are just a couple of parts
there's<00:01:53.140> a<00:01:53.229> short<00:01:53.470> little<00:01:53.590> introduction<00:01:54.159> I

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
there's a short little introduction I

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.270 
there's a short little introduction I
think<00:01:56.140> I<00:01:56.200> just<00:01:56.229> pretty<00:01:56.770> much<00:01:56.860> played<00:01:57.159> the

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
think I just pretty much played the

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.920 
think I just pretty much played the
intro<00:01:57.520> and<00:01:57.579> then<00:01:57.670> kind<00:01:58.060> of<00:01:58.150> it's<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.329> first

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
intro and then kind of it's the first

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.569 
intro and then kind of it's the first
couple<00:01:59.170> lines<00:01:59.259> of<00:01:59.439> the<00:01:59.500> verse<00:01:59.649> and<00:01:59.890> there's<00:02:00.520> a

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
couple lines of the verse and there's a

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:05.550 
couple lines of the verse and there's a
classic<00:02:00.850> fill

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.770 

that<00:02:06.560> happens<00:02:06.890> at<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:07.520> end<00:02:07.549> of<00:02:07.700> each<00:02:07.850> verse<00:02:08.030> so

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
that happens at the end of each verse so

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.240 
that happens at the end of each verse so
we<00:02:09.140> will<00:02:09.259> of<00:02:09.500> course<00:02:09.619> take<00:02:09.800> a<00:02:09.860> look<00:02:10.039> at<00:02:10.130> that

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
we will of course take a look at that

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.900 
we will of course take a look at that
it's<00:02:11.120> in<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:11.360> tab<00:02:11.540> 2<00:02:12.160> anyway<00:02:13.160> coming<00:02:13.610> up<00:02:13.760> a

back to the middle and back to the first

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.470 
back to the middle and back to the first
sometimes<00:02:37.680> we'll<00:02:37.890> just<00:02:37.920> have<00:02:38.129> half<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.459> it

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.809 

sometimes<00:02:43.230> you'll<00:02:43.379> move<00:02:44.040> up<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.310> here<00:02:44.580> for

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
sometimes you'll move up to here for

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.250 
sometimes you'll move up to here for
like<00:02:44.940> little<00:02:45.150> sus4<00:02:45.390> thing<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:45.930> happens<00:02:46.170> on

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
like little sus4 thing that happens on

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.089 
like little sus4 thing that happens on
the<00:02:46.349> E<00:02:46.379> chord

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.630 

and<00:02:50.110> when<00:02:51.110> we<00:02:51.200> get<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.349> like<00:02:51.799> the<00:02:52.129> bar<00:02:52.310> chords

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
and when we get to like the bar chords

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.530 
and when we get to like the bar chords
and<00:02:52.760> stuff<00:02:52.879> like<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.150> bees

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.970 

same<00:02:56.080> thing<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:56.319> just<00:02:56.349> going<00:02:56.560> to<00:02:56.620> keep<00:02:56.740> keep

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
same thing you just going to keep keep

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.479 
same thing you just going to keep keep
that<00:02:57.130> going<00:02:57.430> now<00:02:57.459> I<00:02:58.110> as<00:02:59.110> I<00:02:59.860> mentioned<00:03:00.370> in<00:03:00.430> the

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
that going now I as I mentioned in the

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.820 
that going now I as I mentioned in the
last<00:03:00.520> segment<00:03:00.849> we<00:03:01.599> have<00:03:01.750> this<00:03:02.319> is<00:03:02.470> kind<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.709> a

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
last segment we have this is kind of a

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.250 
last segment we have this is kind of a
combination<00:03:03.400> of<00:03:03.640> different<00:03:03.790> parts<00:03:04.270> so<00:03:04.450> there

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
combination of different parts so there

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.479 
combination of different parts so there
are<00:03:05.380> times<00:03:05.560> you<00:03:05.739> would<00:03:05.890> break<00:03:06.040> that<00:03:06.280> pattern

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
are times you would break that pattern

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.550 
are times you would break that pattern
up<00:03:09.330> and<00:03:10.330> I'm<00:03:10.690> right<00:03:10.989> there<00:03:11.140> I<00:03:11.170> was<00:03:11.290> going<00:03:11.470> with

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
up and I'm right there I was going with

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.680 
up and I'm right there I was going with
pinches<00:03:12.100> and<00:03:12.310> individual<00:03:13.150> notes<00:03:13.330> kind<00:03:13.540> of

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
pinches and individual notes kind of

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.690 
pinches and individual notes kind of
rolling<00:03:13.870> back<00:03:14.230> towards<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.770> thumb<00:03:15.010> rather

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
rolling back towards the thumb rather

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.940 
rolling back towards the thumb rather
than<00:03:15.910> forwards<00:03:16.470> meaning<00:03:17.470> from<00:03:17.620> high<00:03:17.770> to<00:03:17.830> low

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
than forwards meaning from high to low

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.820 
than forwards meaning from high to low
rather<00:03:18.340> than<00:03:18.489> low<00:03:18.610> to<00:03:18.670> high<00:03:19.410> most<00:03:20.410> of<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.680> we

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
rather than low to high most of it we

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.800 
rather than low to high most of it we
have<00:03:21.040> would<00:03:21.220> be<00:03:21.340> low<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:21.850> high<00:03:22.090> or<00:03:22.300> Pesci<00:03:22.540> owes

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.420 

but<00:03:27.810> on<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.050> be<00:03:28.170> 7sus4<00:03:28.680> we're<00:03:29.160> going<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.340> have

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
but on the be 7sus4 we're going to have

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.530 
but on the be 7sus4 we're going to have
the<00:03:29.550> pinches

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.600 

and<00:03:34.049> these<00:03:34.230> three<00:03:34.530> fingers<00:03:34.709> will<00:03:35.040> move<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.489> the

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
and these three fingers will move to the

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.309 
and these three fingers will move to the
2nd<00:03:35.909> 3rd<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.090> 4th<00:03:36.239> strings<00:03:36.659> this<00:03:36.900> shifted

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
2nd 3rd and 4th strings this shifted

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.699 
2nd 3rd and 4th strings this shifted
position<00:03:37.739> that<00:03:37.860> we<00:03:37.950> sometimes<00:03:38.310> use<00:03:38.579> on<00:03:38.989> in<00:03:39.989> now

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
position that we sometimes use on in now

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.710 
position that we sometimes use on in now
the<00:03:40.769> other<00:03:41.010> thing<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:41.250> you<00:03:42.030> could<00:03:42.209> really<00:03:42.390> play

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
the other thing is you could really play

00:03:42.720 --> 00:04:16.610 
the other thing is you could really play
this<00:03:42.930> just<00:03:43.579> with<00:03:44.579> any<00:03:44.849> random<00:03:45.180> arpeggio

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.650 

so<00:04:17.430> I'll<00:04:17.850> talk<00:04:18.030> about<00:04:18.060> that<00:04:18.299> a<00:04:18.359> little<00:04:18.480> bit

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
so I'll talk about that a little bit

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.680 
so I'll talk about that a little bit
more<00:04:18.840> as<00:04:19.109> the<00:04:19.859> lesson<00:04:20.250> develops<00:04:20.910> but<00:04:21.120> but<00:04:21.600> you

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
more as the lesson develops but but you

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.390 
more as the lesson develops but but you
really<00:04:21.900> can<00:04:22.019> do<00:04:22.169> anything<00:04:22.470> you<00:04:22.980> want<00:04:23.190> down

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
really can do anything you want down

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.210 
really can do anything you want down
here<00:04:23.820> but<00:04:24.630> using<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.199> tablature<00:04:25.800> has<00:04:26.010> kind<00:04:26.160> of

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
here but using the tablature has kind of

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.680 
here but using the tablature has kind of
a<00:04:26.280> guide<00:04:26.430> to<00:04:26.610> get<00:04:26.760> at<00:04:26.880> least<00:04:26.910> rolling<00:04:27.389> would<00:04:27.570> be

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
a guide to get at least rolling would be

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.250 
a guide to get at least rolling would be
a<00:04:27.930> good<00:04:28.320> idea

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.290 

with<00:04:33.040> this<00:04:33.190> one<00:04:33.340> I<00:04:33.370> just<00:04:33.640> assumed<00:04:33.910> start<00:04:34.180> with

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
with this one I just assumed start with

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.730 
with this one I just assumed start with
the<00:04:34.390> tablature<00:04:34.750> rather<00:04:35.110> than<00:04:35.230> the<00:04:35.320> chart<00:04:35.560> or

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
the tablature rather than the chart or

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.200 
the tablature rather than the chart or
the<00:04:35.770> words<00:04:36.010> or<00:04:36.220> anything<00:04:36.400> else<00:04:36.610> the<00:04:36.820> chart<00:04:37.060> is

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
the words or anything else the chart is

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.300 
the words or anything else the chart is
uh<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:38.050> tablature<00:04:38.380> has<00:04:38.950> got<00:04:39.100> all<00:04:39.220> the

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
uh the the tablature has got all the

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.940 
uh the the tablature has got all the
chord<00:04:39.550> names<00:04:39.700> and<00:04:40.060> how<00:04:41.050> to<00:04:41.110> play<00:04:41.350> them<00:04:41.500> so

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
chord names and how to play them so

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.770 
chord names and how to play them so
let's<00:04:42.100> just<00:04:42.280> take<00:04:42.820> a<00:04:42.850> look<00:04:43.000> at<00:04:43.150> that<00:04:43.300> the

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
let's just take a look at that the

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.970 
let's just take a look at that the
introduction<00:04:44.290> I<00:04:44.410> already<00:04:44.590> talked<00:04:44.770> a<00:04:44.860> little

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980

bit about the intro we've got the small
arpeggios<00:04:47.200> meaning<00:04:47.590> in<00:04:47.650> the<00:04:47.740> intro<00:04:48.040> all<00:04:48.280> we<00:04:48.400> do

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580

we've got a little six beat arpeggio on
the<00:04:54.340> E<00:04:54.370> chord

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.170 

millions<00:04:57.860> of<00:04:57.949> songs<00:04:58.159> go<00:04:58.460> like<00:04:58.639> that<00:04:58.819> hopefully

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
millions of songs go like that hopefully

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.460 
millions of songs go like that hopefully
you've<00:04:59.360> already<00:04:59.479> been<00:04:59.870> able<00:05:00.020> you've<00:05:00.319> done
