00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
interchangeable right how many different

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.649 
interchangeable right how many different
devices<00:01:12.770> of<00:01:13.770> course<00:01:14.040> at<00:01:14.850> one<00:01:15.030> time<00:01:15.240> we<00:01:15.420> can<00:01:15.570> do

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
devices of course at one time we can do

Andres is now showing here's one that's
got<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:22.619> can<00:01:23.189> handle<00:01:23.490> two<00:01:23.520> things<00:01:23.939> at<00:01:24.060> once<00:01:24.299> and

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
got to can handle two things at once and

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.170 
got to can handle two things at once and
another<00:01:24.869> device<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.560> handle<00:01:25.740> three<00:01:26.280> how

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
another device that can handle three how

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.429 
another device that can handle three how
interchangeable<00:01:27.960> are<00:01:28.080> they<00:01:28.229> how<00:01:28.409> many

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
interchangeable are they how many

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.380 
interchangeable are they how many
different<00:01:28.829> kinds<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.520> devices<00:01:29.729> can<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.210> use

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
different kinds of devices can we use

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.600 
different kinds of devices can we use
the<00:01:30.720> idea<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.140> plug<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:31.680> any<00:01:31.979> kind<00:01:32.520> of

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
the idea is to plug in any kind of

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.140 
the idea is to plug in any kind of
portable<00:01:32.939> device<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.869> really<00:01:34.110> we<00:01:34.320> can<00:01:34.470> work<00:01:34.740> on

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
portable device so really we can work on

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.719 
portable device so really we can work on
developing<00:01:36.150> new<00:01:36.840> tips<00:01:37.220> so<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.250> can<00:01:38.549> get<00:01:38.700> a

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
developing new tips so you can get a

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.210 
developing new tips so you can get a
never-ending<00:01:39.439> compatibility<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.740> any<00:01:40.920> kind

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
never-ending compatibility to any kind

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.039 
never-ending compatibility to any kind
of<00:01:41.340> portable<00:01:41.640> TVs<00:01:41.939> no<00:01:42.210> matter<00:01:42.479> which<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.960> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
of portable TVs no matter which is the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.649 
of portable TVs no matter which is the
power<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.860> we<00:01:44.009> have<00:01:44.159> like<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:44.939> case<00:01:45.000> mini

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
power so we have like in this case mini

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.899 
power so we have like in this case mini
USB<00:01:45.899> even<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.009> look<00:01:47.369> how<00:01:47.460> many<00:01:47.640> devices

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
USB even so that look how many devices

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.060 
USB even so that look how many devices
that<00:01:48.329> can<00:01:48.570> power<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.960> incredible<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.590> amazing

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
that can power it incredible is amazing

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.819 
that can power it incredible is amazing
and<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.460> just<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.820> little<00:01:51.360> module<00:01:52.020> with<00:01:52.799> a

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
and this is just a little module with a

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.980
