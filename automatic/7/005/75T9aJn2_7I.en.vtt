charger the AC adapter actually is a

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.859 
charger the AC adapter actually is a
different<00:01:32.479> output<00:01:33.479> then<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.070> other

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
different output then it is on the other

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.260 
different output then it is on the other
DF<00:01:36.869> models<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:38.250> can<00:01:38.369> see<00:01:38.579> how<00:01:38.790> it's<00:01:39.119> a

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
DF models you can see how it's a

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.420 
DF models you can see how it's a
different<00:01:39.600> shape<00:01:39.840> than<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.500> original<00:01:41.009> DS<00:01:41.130> has
