Advanced Settings button is here in the
bottom<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:08.649> something<00:02:08.890> I'd<00:02:08.979> like<00:02:09.130> to<00:02:09.220> note<00:02:09.429> is

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
bottom and something I'd like to note is

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.490 
bottom and something I'd like to note is
that<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.759> game<00:02:09.940> was<00:02:10.060> almost<00:02:10.360> unplayable<00:02:11.020> with

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
that the game was almost unplayable with

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.050 
that the game was almost unplayable with
vertical<00:02:11.770> sync<00:02:12.100> left<00:02:12.400> on<00:02:12.580> its<00:02:12.730> default

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
vertical sync left on its default

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.330 
vertical sync left on its default
setting<00:02:13.420> which<00:02:13.450> was<00:02:13.870> chippa<00:02:14.290> buffer<00:02:14.620> this<00:02:15.190> may

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
setting which was chippa buffer this may

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.530 
setting which was chippa buffer this may
be<00:02:15.370> change<00:02:15.640> in<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.819> final<00:02:16.150> version<00:02:16.180> of<00:02:16.480> the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
be change in the final version of the

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.760 
be change in the final version of the
game<00:02:16.750> but<00:02:17.050> I<00:02:17.110> think<00:02:17.350> if<00:02:17.410> you're<00:02:17.530> going<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.709> be

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
game but I think if you're going to be

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.260 
game but I think if you're going to be
playing<00:02:17.860> this<00:02:18.040> game<00:02:18.190> competitively<00:02:18.850> anyway

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
playing this game competitively anyway

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.740 
playing this game competitively anyway
you<00:02:19.330> should<00:02:19.660> disable<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:20.080> setting<00:02:21.630> last<00:02:22.630> one

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
you should disable the setting last one

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.059 
you should disable the setting last one
we<00:02:22.840> have<00:02:22.959> to<00:02:23.050> go<00:02:23.140> over<00:02:23.170> as<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.560> settings<00:02:23.890> in

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
we have to go over as the settings in

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.920 
we have to go over as the settings in
the<00:02:24.100> audio<00:02:24.489> settings<00:02:24.880> tab<00:02:25.120> only<00:02:25.660> thing<00:02:25.810> really

the audio settings tab only thing really

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.870 
the audio settings tab only thing really
notable<00:02:26.290> here<00:02:26.590> is<00:02:26.650> that<00:02:26.739> 5.1<00:02:27.370> is<00:02:27.550> something

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
notable here is that 5.1 is something

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.010 
notable here is that 5.1 is something
that<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.030> can<00:02:28.150> choose<00:02:28.330> from<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:28.720> speaker

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
to go to the play button and go over how

to join games what's really interesting

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.680 
to join games what's really interesting
here<00:02:35.110> are<00:02:35.319> two<00:02:35.650> buttons<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.940> build<00:02:37.390> your<00:02:37.510> team

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
here are two buttons the build your team

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.449 
here are two buttons the build your team
button<00:02:37.930> which<00:02:38.200> I<00:02:38.319> think<00:02:38.530> may<00:02:38.680> be<00:02:38.709> for<00:02:39.010> creating

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
button which I think may be for creating

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.640 
button which I think may be for creating
grand<00:02:40.000> matches<00:02:40.450> or<00:02:40.930> it<00:02:41.200> might<00:02:41.319> be<00:02:41.440> for

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
grand matches or it might be for

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.070 
grand matches or it might be for
creating<00:02:41.950> our<00:02:42.040> right<00:02:42.250> team<00:02:42.550> and<00:02:42.819> the<00:02:43.080> training

creating our right team and the training

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.449 
creating our right team and the training
course<00:02:44.440> button<00:02:44.709> which<00:02:44.980> seems<00:02:45.280> like<00:02:45.430> a

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459
