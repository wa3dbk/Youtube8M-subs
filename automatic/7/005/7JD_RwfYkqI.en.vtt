00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.160
 yes we had a lot in possession many 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.560
 Mittelfeld has played 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.060
 Now you do not see the gates as in the 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.310
 Another play with us is already 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.400
 right but I think in the second 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.460
 There was more going on in the sixteenth and half 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.020
 then it was a little better game that 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.030
 everything okay now it must be determined 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.460
 and we have a lot of fun too 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.050
 played until then and therefore must 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.879
 keep doing this and maybe 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.590
 increase the pressure on the opponent's goal 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.030
 I think it must be very neat 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.159
 and you have to think about it too 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.140
 we have been third against tables or 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:48.589
 so and there must not in counter 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.229
 to run 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.220
 and that is always such a wire act 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:53.570
 and I think so well 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.610
 So if you are in the 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.710
 replay time holds an eleven meter and 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.420
 thereby taking a point and play 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.040
 it does not lose, of course it is against 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.110
 Feel that she comes I believe it 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.810
 justifies that the result of his 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.159
 Opportunities on both sides and good 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.830
 of course in Bielefeld please that is on 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.150
 the end one but have a clear chance that 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.920
 ding not win but on the 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.470
 All had had both teams 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.270
 good chance top game so great 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.530
 great performance so I am very 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.860
 Satisfied we can do better football 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.500
 but we also have to play the whole thing 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.210
 circumstances see place who the opponent the 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.360
 have us beckham already have 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.400
 at the front of so wanted to play against the 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.930
 have said three more defensive 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.760
 midfielder in the center 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.100
 they have more or less only three 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.230
 offensive people with it just with it 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.510
 and with many everything else was just 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.490
 defensive people in the square and 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.950
 almost even with this tactic today 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.950
 maybe also because and
