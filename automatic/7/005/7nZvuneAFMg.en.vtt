bringing you halo video but something I
like<00:01:11.729> about<00:01:11.760> halo<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:14.130> story

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
like about halo is that the story

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.820 
like about halo is that the story
basically<00:01:14.880> encompass<00:01:15.689> encompasses<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
basically encompass encompasses the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.330 
basically encompass encompasses the
entire<00:01:17.070> galaxy<00:01:17.670> right<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:19.340> forerunners

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
entire galaxy right the forerunners

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.550 
entire galaxy right the forerunners
built<00:01:20.610> these<00:01:20.790> things<00:01:21.119> called<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.720> halo<00:01:22.320> rings

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
built these things called the halo rings

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.999 
built these things called the halo rings
in<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.979> halo<00:01:23.189> array<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.880> once<00:01:24.450> they<00:01:24.659> fire

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
in the halo array and once they fire

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.100 
in the halo array and once they fire
they<00:01:26.009> would<00:01:26.220> wipe<00:01:26.850> out<00:01:27.030> all<00:01:27.270> sentient<00:01:27.780> life

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
they would wipe out all sentient life

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.399 
they would wipe out all sentient life
too<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> flood<00:01:30.270> was<00:01:30.299> starvin<00:01:30.990> chily

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
too so that the flood was starvin chily

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.490 
too so that the flood was starvin chily
right<00:01:31.590> well<00:01:32.549> I'm<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.820> universal<00:01:33.360> thinker<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.900> I

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
right well I'm a universal thinker and I

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.460 
right well I'm a universal thinker and I
tend<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.159> think<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.430> Earth<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.290> mote

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
tend to think that Earth is just a mote

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.740 
tend to think that Earth is just a mote
of<00:01:37.500> dust<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.430> grand<00:01:39.119> scheme<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.540> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
of dust in the grand scheme of the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.230 
of dust in the grand scheme of the
universe<00:01:39.780> right<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.650> if<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.490> saw<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.790> venus

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
universe right and if you saw the venus

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.940 
universe right and if you saw the venus
transit<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.810> couple<00:01:43.140> days<00:01:43.320> ago<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.619> would

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
transit a couple days ago you would

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.690 
transit a couple days ago you would
realize<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.729> Earth<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.829> Venus<00:01:47.579> are

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
realize that Earth is in Venus are

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.880 
realize that Earth is in Venus are
pretty<00:01:47.880> much<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.060> same<00:01:48.180> size<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.960> Venus<00:01:49.710> was

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
pretty much the same size and Venus was

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.710 
pretty much the same size and Venus was
so<00:01:50.310> small<00:01:50.610> compared<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.270> Sun<00:01:51.979> yeah<00:01:53.720> we

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
so small compared to the Sun yeah we

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.260 
so small compared to the Sun yeah we
think<00:01:54.960> we<00:01:55.079> have<00:01:55.110> like<00:01:55.590> like<00:01:56.399> Carl<00:01:56.729> Sagan<00:01:57.119> would

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
think we have like like Carl Sagan would

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.319 
think we have like like Carl Sagan would
say<00:01:57.479> we<00:01:57.810> have<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:58.280> well<00:01:59.280> it's<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.820> pair<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.149> brace

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
say we have a well it's a pair of brace

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.870 
say we have a well it's a pair of brace
so<00:02:00.540> excuse<00:02:00.960> me<00:02:01.079> but<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.500> self<00:02:02.189> delusion<00:02:02.579> of

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
so excuse me but a self delusion of

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.780 
so excuse me but a self delusion of

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
that important and that that's why I

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.480 
that important and that that's why I
sort<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.420> don't<00:02:09.539> do<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.899> blogs<00:02:10.619> anymore<00:02:10.979> at

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
bit of blood so that seems ok I'm the

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.290 
bit of blood so that seems ok I'm the
story<00:02:56.730> seems<00:02:57.560> decent<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:59.130> then<00:02:59.940> I<00:02:59.970> believe

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
story seems decent and then I believe

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.110 
story seems decent and then I believe
spec<00:03:00.630> ops<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.080> line<00:03:01.110> comes<00:03:01.770> on<00:03:02.040> out<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.730> week

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
spec ops the line comes on out the week

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.530 
spec ops the line comes on out the week
after<00:03:03.330> that<00:03:03.540> so<00:03:04.970> I'm<00:03:05.970> looking<00:03:06.150> forward<00:03:06.450> to

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.080 
after that so I'm looking forward to
that<00:03:06.720> I<00:03:06.750> played<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.260> demo<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:08.580> looked<00:03:08.850> hot

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
that I played the demo and it looked hot

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.840 
that I played the demo and it looked hot
and<00:03:09.330> I<00:03:09.980> recorded<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.100> for<00:03:11.250> uh<00:03:11.460> what<00:03:12.180> is<00:03:12.270> it<00:03:12.300> a

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
and I recorded it for uh what is it a

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.220 
and I recorded it for uh what is it a
practice<00:03:14.850> footage<00:03:15.180> right<00:03:15.360> practice<00:03:15.930> footage

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
practice footage right practice footage

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.340 
practice footage right practice footage
I<00:03:16.350> recorded<00:03:16.740> it<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.240> it<00:03:18.240> looked<00:03:18.510> awesome<00:03:18.750> and

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.230 

it's<00:03:22.350> much<00:03:22.620> like<00:03:22.860> a<00:03:22.890> more<00:03:23.250> realistic<00:03:23.670> Gears<00:03:24.150> of

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
it's much like a more realistic Gears of

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.510 
it's much like a more realistic Gears of
War<00:03:24.360> if<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:24.900> obviously<00:03:25.680> they<00:03:25.800> use<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.160> Unreal

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
War if you obviously they use the Unreal

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.810 
War if you obviously they use the Unreal
Engine<00:03:26.730> 4<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.300> 2k<00:03:27.660> use<00:03:28.020> the<00:03:28.170> Unreal<00:03:28.500> Engine

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
Engine 4 that 2k use the Unreal Engine

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.960 
Engine 4 that 2k use the Unreal Engine
but<00:03:29.820> um<00:03:30.740> it's<00:03:31.740> like<00:03:31.830> a<00:03:31.950> realistic<00:03:32.610> gears<00:03:32.820> of

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
but um it's like a realistic gears of

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.000 
but um it's like a realistic gears of
war<00:03:33.090> they<00:03:33.120> actually<00:03:33.720> have<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:33.930> bone<00:03:34.290> structure

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
war they actually have a bone structure

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.780 
war they actually have a bone structure
in<00:03:35.490> spec<00:03:36.480> off<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.900> spec<00:03:37.320> ops<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.680> line<00:03:37.790> you

in spec off the spec ops the line you

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.630 
in spec off the spec ops the line you
don't<00:03:38.880> just<00:03:39.180> slice<00:03:39.780> through<00:03:40.080> them

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
don't just slice through them

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.740 
don't just slice through them
automatically<00:03:41.640> liking<00:03:42.030> Gears<00:03:42.240> of<00:03:42.300> War<00:03:42.360> where

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
they're probably hearing my voice which

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.840 
they're probably hearing my voice which
is<00:03:59.400> sort<00:03:59.700> of<00:03:59.760> cool<00:04:00.110> but<00:04:01.110> um

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
is sort of cool but um

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
thing and this is sort of hard to come

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.390 
overcomplicate things as humanity oh by
the<00:04:43.960> way<00:04:44.080> something<00:04:44.620> else<00:04:44.770> about<00:04:44.890> that<00:04:45.160> I<00:04:45.310> know

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
the way something else about that I know

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.900 
the way something else about that I know
I'm<00:04:45.640> rambling<00:04:46.240> on<00:04:46.390> but<00:04:46.830> how<00:04:47.830> I<00:04:47.860> said<00:04:48.250> Venus<00:04:48.670> and

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
I'm rambling on but how I said Venus and

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.670 
I'm rambling on but how I said Venus and
Earth<00:04:49.030> are<00:04:49.180> similar<00:04:49.540> size<00:04:49.720> and<00:04:49.750> they're

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
Earth are similar size and they're

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.190 
Earth are similar size and they're
barely<00:04:50.980> anything<00:04:51.790> compared<00:04:52.390> to<00:04:52.480> the<00:04:52.570> Sun<00:04:52.780> the

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
barely anything compared to the Sun the

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.710 
barely anything compared to the Sun the
size<00:04:53.440> of<00:04:53.590> the<00:04:53.650> Sun<00:04:54.210> when<00:04:55.210> you<00:04:55.300> think<00:04:55.480> about<00:04:55.540> it

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
size of the Sun when you think about it

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.020 
size of the Sun when you think about it
the<00:04:55.990> Sun<00:04:56.290> isn't<00:04:56.830> even<00:04:57.220> that<00:04:57.250> big<00:04:57.580> of<00:04:57.700> a<00:04:57.790> star

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
the Sun isn't even that big of a star

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.080 
the Sun isn't even that big of a star
right<00:04:58.770> what<00:04:59.770> was<00:04:59.980> the<00:05:00.190> biggest<00:05:00.550> star<00:05:00.820> I<00:05:00.850> could

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
right what was the biggest star I could

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.490 
right what was the biggest star I could
think<00:05:01.210> of<00:05:01.860> dy<00:05:02.860> Canis<00:05:03.340> Majoris<00:05:03.730> makes<00:05:04.420> this<00:05:04.600> it

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
think of dy Canis Majoris makes this it

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.070 
think of dy Canis Majoris makes this it
basically<00:05:05.830> uh<00:05:07.380> some<00:05:08.380> eight<00:05:08.650> billion

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
basically uh some eight billion

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.520 
basically uh some eight billion
kilometers<00:05:11.080> across<00:05:11.620> or<00:05:12.250> some<00:05:13.060> eight<00:05:13.210> billion

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
kilometers across or some eight billion

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.120 
kilometers across or some eight billion
kilometers<00:05:14.850> diameter<00:05:15.850> and<00:05:16.470> the<00:05:17.470> Sun<00:05:17.830> is<00:05:17.860> only

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
kilometers diameter and the Sun is only

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.860 
kilometers diameter and the Sun is only
what<00:05:18.370> 4.79<00:05:19.410> million<00:05:20.410> kilometers<00:05:21.270> and<00:05:22.270> this

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
what 4.79 million kilometers and this

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.990 
what 4.79 million kilometers and this
and<00:05:23.110> this<00:05:23.140> is<00:05:23.260> going<00:05:23.650> in<00:05:23.770> a<00:05:23.800> long<00:05:24.430> the<00:05:24.580> equator

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
and this is going in a long the equator

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.900 
and this is going in a long the equator
of<00:05:25.210> each<00:05:25.360> star<00:05:25.750> but<00:05:26.250> so<00:05:27.250> when<00:05:27.550> you<00:05:27.640> think<00:05:27.820> about

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
of each star but so when you think about

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.110 
of each star but so when you think about
it<00:05:28.060> we're<00:05:28.300> really<00:05:28.480> nothing<00:05:29.610> but<00:05:30.610> another

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
it we're really nothing but another

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.940 
it we're really nothing but another
reason<00:05:31.510> why<00:05:31.600> I'm<00:05:31.810> doing<00:05:31.960> this<00:05:32.080> is<00:05:32.320> I<00:05:32.350> started

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
reason why I'm doing this is I started

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.580 
reason why I'm doing this is I started
working<00:05:33.130> at<00:05:33.400> a<00:05:33.430> the<00:05:34.390> walgreens<00:05:34.930> right<00:05:35.200> the
