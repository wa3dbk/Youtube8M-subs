00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 the bass you have to choose between narda 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.550
 lepes y maru botana with who you stay 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.200
 and why and why in Cicca I would say 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.059
 a little identified with her is the 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.519
 way of how it is expressed goes from not 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.949
 complicate when it comes to cooking so 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.660
 I would choose her to give me a question 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.199
 complicated between the three juries 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.369
 christo donato and germÃ¡n with which you 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.380
 you stay and with the three I stay 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.910
 because to see with also because you 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.470
 you get along well with the three and because each 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.440
 one has according to particularity 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:39.510
 will improve more you can see that for example 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.700
 German was very to seek the prolixity 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.620
 to be a person who likes the 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.530
 perfection and those things are very nice 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.440
 it is necessary christs have lists 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.440
 they have like that touch of I do not know a 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.570
 little to be demonstrative at the time of 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.180
 giving advice is very, very expressive and 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.120
 I know that it moves the wave and I value a lot and 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.530
 I think it is important and good and what 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.210
 What is in front of you is that you are a 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.790
 the pastas and that I love the 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.790
 cycle I would like to be with him also e 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.979
 go it the two finalists Pablo and natalie 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.680
 that accompany you in the final if you have 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.229
 to choose one of them two with whom 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.070
 you stay and I would stay with natalie 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.750
 because natalie because it's a girl that 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.180
 he never agrees with what he does 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.160
 always seeks to improve improvement for more 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.650
 quality that her dish is perfect she 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.170
 always seeks to excel and is a mine 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.390
 that is a quality that stands out 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.830
 and in it is between the two divas 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.030
 susana and mirtha which one would you like 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.630
 cook it 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.360
 susana gimÃ©nez a thousand times because to see and 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.090
 yes because I love watching it on TV 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.970
 has a class a particular style and 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.360
 that delicacy that elegance has 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.570
 fascinates me and above all that maintains that 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.720
 simplicity is not that it is enlarge or anything 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.940
 is a worldwide diva and that 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.040
 transmits that it looks like this is the truth not 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.240
 few people are seen in their room is 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.240
 present I admire her
