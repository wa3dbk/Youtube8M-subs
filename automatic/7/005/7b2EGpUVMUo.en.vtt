00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.810 
of thicknesses and it's especially
important<00:01:53.619> to<00:01:53.710> watch<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.250> thickness<00:01:54.610> of

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
important to watch the thickness of

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.850 
important to watch the thickness of
these<00:01:55.030> because<00:01:55.690> if<00:01:55.810> you<00:01:55.840> go<00:01:56.080> too<00:01:56.140> thick<00:01:56.650> you

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
these because if you go too thick you

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.800 
these because if you go too thick you
might<00:01:57.040> have<00:01:57.220> to<00:01:57.460> go<00:01:57.759> up<00:01:57.940> a<00:01:58.150> half<00:01:58.330> size<00:01:58.600> our

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
might have to go up a half size our

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.810 
might have to go up a half size our
whole<00:01:58.990> size<00:01:59.200> with<00:01:59.380> your<00:01:59.500> pointe<00:01:59.770> shoe<00:02:00.070> just<00:02:00.610> to

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
whole size with your pointe shoe just to

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.609 
whole size with your pointe shoe just to
accommodate<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.420> pad<00:02:01.659> and<00:02:02.350> that's<00:02:02.470> not

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
accommodate the pad and that's not

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.170 
accommodate the pad and that's not
always<00:02:02.830> a<00:02:02.920> great<00:02:03.130> idea<00:02:03.220> because<00:02:03.880> you<00:02:04.030> want

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
always a great idea because you want

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.340 
always a great idea because you want
your<00:02:04.330> shoe<00:02:04.479> to<00:02:04.570> be<00:02:04.690> able<00:02:04.840> to<00:02:04.930> fit<00:02:05.110> nice<00:02:05.320> and

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
your shoe to be able to fit nice and

your shoe to be able to fit nice and
snug<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:07.240> then<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:09.310> is<00:02:09.610> a<00:02:10.030> variation<00:02:10.420> of<00:02:11.080> the

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
snug and then this is a variation of the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.340 
snug and then this is a variation of the
gel<00:02:11.770> pad<00:02:12.040> this<00:02:12.760> is<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.090> ouch<00:02:13.270> ouch<00:02:13.660> it<00:02:14.020> looks

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
gel pad this is the ouch ouch it looks

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.810 
gel pad this is the ouch ouch it looks
like<00:02:14.590> it's<00:02:14.770> all<00:02:14.920> fabric<00:02:15.430> but<00:02:15.640> there's

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
like it's all fabric but there's

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.699 
like it's all fabric but there's
actually<00:02:16.239> a<00:02:16.270> thin<00:02:16.600> layer<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:17.050> gel<00:02:17.350> on<00:02:17.650> the

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
actually a thin layer of gel on the

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.960 
actually a thin layer of gel on the
inside<00:02:19.230> these<00:02:20.230> are<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.980> nice<00:02:21.250> balance<00:02:21.730> of

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
inside these are a nice balance of

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.210 
inside these are a nice balance of
providing<00:02:22.470> protection<00:02:23.470> of<00:02:23.650> your<00:02:23.830> knuckles

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220

traditional silicone gel pads and then

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.250 
traditional silicone gel pads and then
there's<00:02:31.870> also<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.410> ouch<00:02:32.530> pouch<00:02:32.890> jr.<00:02:33.930> which<00:02:34.930> is

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
cut just a little differently than the

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.840 
cut just a little differently than the
ouch<00:02:37.390> pouch<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.950> can<00:02:38.980> see<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.550> doesn't

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
ouch pouch you can see that it doesn't

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.080 
ouch pouch you can see that it doesn't
have<00:02:39.970> fabric<00:02:40.480> on<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.930> bottom<00:02:41.790> like<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.940> algae

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
have fabric on the bottom like the algae

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.460 
have fabric on the bottom like the algae
ouch<00:02:43.390> does

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.800 

and<00:02:46.560> then<00:02:47.220> finally<00:02:47.790> we<00:02:47.940> have<00:02:48.150> here<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.570> pro

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
and then finally we have here the pro

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.850 
and then finally we have here the pro
pad<00:02:49.670> which<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:51.140> similar<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.380> ouch<00:02:52.530> pouch

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
pad which is similar to the ouch pouch

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.610

but<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.310> only<00:02:53.460> has<00:02:53.820> gel<00:02:54.270> on<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.600> top<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.470> the

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
but it only has gel on the top of the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.040 
but it only has gel on the top of the
pad<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.280> then<00:02:56.430> underneath<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:57.180> only<00:02:57.750> fabric

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
pad and then underneath is only fabric

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.750 
pad and then underneath is only fabric
