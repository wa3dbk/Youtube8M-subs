00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:13.980
 bad day to fish and I 'm not good I 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.980
 I will teach to touch live 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:22.390
 and good first thing we're going to do 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.460
 we arrive with the orders 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.930
 elmer of or because this first went up the 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:31.110
 0 when the first day we are going to 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.320
 put in the 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:38.180
 in the second single in the second and 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.180
 third string we are going to see 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.379
 they are going to do this what they do not have 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.440
 I have I do not have a diet because the 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.360
 life was lost even more but 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.469
 now be these the ones who do not have the 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.469
 that easily 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.640
 it goes up 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.940
 because if I start the songs and 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.940
 you start 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.310
 Y 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.479
 I eat it like that because it's so 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.479
 can try more 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.050
 I hope we put it in the third single 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.720

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.120
 in the fifth followed fifth string and 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:39.980
 this we put in the fifth single and in 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.980
 the fourth string would already be 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.310
 above all above 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.570
 ta ta ta ta ta ta 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.340

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.370

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.370

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.750
 this finger is where we started 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.970

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:05.000
