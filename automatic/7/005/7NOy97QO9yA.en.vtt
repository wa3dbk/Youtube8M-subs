 feel beautiful 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.550
 first question it appears that the 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.420
 men prefer women's women and 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.460
 makeup and had this opinion I'll I 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.060
 will evolve and imagine tim hager a 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.070
 little more his question 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.890
 the issue prefers it to natural or 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.239
 make up both are men and 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.820
 a woman can be feminine probably 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.770
 make up very nice agreement very stiff 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.980
 we will not answer any further we will 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.809
 stay on the second question she 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.460
 do not need makeup is crippling 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.300
 for you at a woman's house 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.610
 significant income 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.210

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:59.670
 do you find attractive so if they do not 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.620
 not understand and therefore proposing 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.989
 so a rather natural makeup a 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.110
 smoky of which something dark enough 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:13.409
 smoky eye liner comma 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:19.290
 dark lips of blue under makeup 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:23.040
 colored up to which something quite 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.340
 natural yeah but with red to 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.570
 lips so we have expensive led lips 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.759
 dark with a natural make-up 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.460
 yeah thank you 4 what products of 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.420
 makeup will not bear not wear 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.420
 if you were a young woman 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.740
 I made very little of the 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.049
 ice cream 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.579
 what make-up gestures impresses you 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.759
 earth you think it's difficult to 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.759
 achieve 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.229
 yeah I can just fail first time 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.979
 yeah okay 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:07.020
 good so just laid a color on them 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.630
 eyelids I find it hard no is 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.040
 certainly impressive very good 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:15.290
 all women say michael will be 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:17.480
 not easy to understand no but in fact 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.380
 I do not know a lot of techniques 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:28.160
 makeup but with something you 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:30.790
 look at the town hall we take the bottom of 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.790
 dyed salary no 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:46.270
 so the magnitude eyes the answer 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.810
 is yes or no 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.800
 good the answer is so no no 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.380
 would you consider wearing makeup 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.170
 exceptionally button to 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:00.370
 hide heals blue concealer for 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:03.160
 your wedding or what for the scars 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.360
 for everyone yes but not 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.820
 indefinitely just at the beginning for the 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.260
 marriage possibly could do 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.620
 photos what 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.430
 here is a button really too bright 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.020
 so something you really need 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.960
 hidden for another land 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.250
 klose why a tattoo to hide that 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.250
 do you think souls who make up 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.610
 it was for the amount of makeup 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.060
 it's a little bit to hide 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.910
 Something 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.700
 it can be understood after really fan 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.850
 makeup as a woman that the 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.620
 look do not know too where you got 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.980
 no makeup advice that will allow 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.410
 more for women than paul and 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.430

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.360

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:10.000

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:19.620

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.040

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.210
 video was not going too long 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.210
 especially if I find all the hands the 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.509
