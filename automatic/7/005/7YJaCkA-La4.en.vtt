00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
notifications all the time just because

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.980 
notifications all the time just because
I<00:01:19.860> already<00:01:20.280> had<00:01:20.549> developed<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.060> habit<00:01:21.689> with

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
experiment I was starting to notice the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.160 
experiment I was starting to notice the
benefits<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:27.150> not<00:01:27.360> having<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.810> smartphone

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170

first of all the basic phone I was using

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.870 
first of all the basic phone I was using
was<00:01:30.900> not<00:01:31.110> bothering<00:01:31.650> me<00:01:31.860> every<00:01:32.340> five<00:01:32.549> minutes

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
was not bothering me every five minutes

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.630 
was not bothering me every five minutes
with<00:01:33.030> notifications<00:01:33.390> messages<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.590> whatnot

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
with notifications messages and whatnot

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.850 
with notifications messages and whatnot
it<00:01:35.880> was<00:01:36.090> definitely<00:01:36.479> not<00:01:36.780> as<00:01:36.990> distracting<00:01:37.650> as

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
it was definitely not as distracting as

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.270 
it was definitely not as distracting as
my<00:01:38.189> Galaxy<00:01:38.759> s5<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.420> couldn't<00:01:40.380> waste<00:01:40.619> time<00:01:41.009> with

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
my Galaxy s5 I couldn't waste time with

my Galaxy s5 I couldn't waste time with
pointless<00:01:41.820> applications<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.780> addicting

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
pointless applications and addicting

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.670 
pointless applications and addicting
games<00:01:44.070> like<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.119> could<00:01:45.420> with<00:01:45.689> my<00:01:45.869> smart<00:01:46.439> phone

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
besides I don't have to worry about

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.240 
besides I don't have to worry about
things<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:48.869> charging<00:01:49.590> my<00:01:49.740> smart<00:01:50.070> phone
