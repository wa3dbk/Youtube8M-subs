00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
read the little it's a little it down

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:04.460 
read the little it's a little it down
that's<00:01:56.060> it<00:01:56.180> was

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.650 

I<00:02:04.700> took<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.850> little<00:02:06.060> bit<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.300> time<00:02:06.510> to

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
I took a little bit of time to

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.150 
I took a little bit of time to
understand<00:02:07.080> that<00:02:07.260> I<00:02:07.350> was<00:02:07.500> up<00:02:07.650> there<00:02:07.680> Kentucky

understand that I was up there Kentucky
and<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.750> think<00:02:09.990> now<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.259> she's<00:02:10.649> kind<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:10.950> used

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
and I think now that she's kind of used

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.390 
and I think now that she's kind of used
to<00:02:11.280> me<00:02:11.430> she<00:02:12.390> knows<00:02:12.630> what<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:13.020> like<00:02:13.320> in<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:14.250> way

to me she knows what I like in the way
of<00:02:14.550> sound<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.560> when<00:02:16.560> I<00:02:16.590> make<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.890> pause<00:02:17.250> she

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
of sound and when I make a pause she

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.070 
of sound and when I make a pause she
knows<00:02:17.970> when<00:02:18.300> we're<00:02:18.510> going<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.720> come<00:02:18.870> back<00:02:19.020> and
