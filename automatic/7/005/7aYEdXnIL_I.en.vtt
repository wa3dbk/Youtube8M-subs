generations<00:00:52.810> passed<00:00:53.050> down<00:00:53.290> the<00:00:53.440> knowledge

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
generations passed down the knowledge

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.460 
generations passed down the knowledge
from<00:00:53.829> cultivating<00:00:54.340> the<00:00:54.579> soil<00:00:54.820> to<00:00:55.809> picking

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
from cultivating the soil to picking

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.110 
from cultivating the soil to picking
only<00:00:56.559> the<00:00:56.739> ripeness<00:00:56.950> cherries<00:00:57.579> and<00:00:58.030> then

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
only the ripeness cherries and then

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.000 
only the ripeness cherries and then
processing<00:00:58.510> it<00:00:58.690> again<00:00:58.870> in<00:00:58.989> a<00:00:59.050> very<00:00:59.079> individual

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
I think this is the culmination of so

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.860 
I think this is the culmination of so
much<00:01:07.950> hard<00:01:08.010> work<00:01:08.370> by<00:01:08.820> all<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.420> partners
