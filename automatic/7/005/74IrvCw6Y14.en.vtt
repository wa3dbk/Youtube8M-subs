00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:10.670
 Yes today are these three barrels 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:16.660
 Nde was selling at 98 yen at Toys R Us 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:22.670
 Also is against Apart from this one to have something here I'm was Kicha' bought all 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:26.800
 It's not a guy, so I've been through until now, but all say 98 yen 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:30.940
 It was a pretty bargain and I bought it 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.860
 I would like to introduce this 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:37.490
 At first it is a straight barrel 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.270
 It is a standard with nothing 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.270
 What also Rena 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.270
 It is a barrel 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:55.140
 The contents are a runner and a seal , so I think that the number of parts is small and maybe it will be overcome 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.140
 It is such a feeling that it has risen love 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:03.890
 It is an ordinary barrel 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.890
 There is no mechanism like this in particular 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.720
 It's like this when you put it on 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.020
 Next is this lock on Barrel 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:29.510
 I would like to see this 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.510
 Contents are runner and seal and clear parts 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.069
 Yes it looks like this 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.119
 Here it has become to move 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.300
 It's like this if you follow the anime and attach it to the snake 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.820
 This is normal parallel mode 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.230
 If you stretch this 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.230
 It is long barrel mode 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.310
 When this happens 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.310
 It is site barrel mode 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.520
 Finally I would like to introduce this grip barrel 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.340
 Yes the contents are this 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.750
 Almost finished barrel and 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.590
 Seal N 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.459
 After a little parts and 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.459
 It's a grip 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.340
 Yes it looks like this 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:04.650
 In Hey is do this grip is disengaged 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:12.150
 Right-handed and left-handed people can be used by swapping the left and right 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:15.060
 This is a grip already taken, and by putting this on top of this 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.190
 The horn of Dragren 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:23.710
 Oh serve as the same kind of site and 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.710
 There is also an aim mode 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:32.880
 It is such a feeling when imitating animation and attaching to shax 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:39.840
 I want to build a one-handed Sharks , so while holding it here 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:43.040
 It will be possible to hold this grip with the left hand and stabilize it as well. 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.040
 It is a combination 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:51.990
 Well, when parts increase like this 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:56.060
 I used the machine and the part that matched the color 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:59.870
 You can now customize anything you like 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.960
 It's a little red and some blue 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:08.170
 I'd tried to identical orange 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.170
 I think this is fun too and I think 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:16.020
 How barrels and Mr. 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.139
 Play a role as a barrel 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:23.110
 Great 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:27.260
 Control performance is better, but power is diminished 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:30.760
 Well, this kind of customization is also interesting water 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.070
 People who are not good at control 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.370
 now 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.920
 I'm selling it for sale 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.190
 How about buying it? 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.190
 Well then
