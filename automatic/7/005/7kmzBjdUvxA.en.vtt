 [Music] 

00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:06.020
 the arrival gates 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.169
 [Music] 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.160
 each embrace of those keep history 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.849
 different 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:22.660
 each of these meetings reveals another 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:26.230
 world another life of our diverse 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.340
 in yours if you never had the opportunity 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.739
 to observe for more than five seconds 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.860
 all those people unknown in 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.320
 a crowd waiting for their friends 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.899
 family and their loves 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.649
 do not be afraid to realize the next 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.780
 turn 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:48.519
 the magic of a moment of a place 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.050
 We talked about the arrival gates of a 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.300
 airport 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.969
 one of those places in the world where we can 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:00.249
 clearly notice the great presence of the 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:03.479
 invisible love almost imperceptible 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:06.310
 there he is with all his superiority 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:09.190
 in the silent declarations of a 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.610
 shy in the warmth of a hug 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.890
 tight in the brief constraint on the 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.970
 try to find words to explain 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.960
 prayer in three seconds and taken 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.120
 to the top 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.180
 thanking God for taking care of 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.040
 your loved one who returns to the elite 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.390
 records that signs the production 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.560
 cinematographic by the name of love Ã©toile 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.220
 translated into brazil as simply 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:40.330
 love brings these scenes with a vision 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:43.110
 very poetic inspired the author offers 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.000
 in the first and last scenes of the movie 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.550
 exactly the contemplation of the gates of 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.620
 arrival of an airport and its 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.600
 beautiful spectacle representing the 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.950
 essence as 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.730
 a narrator is heard in the first 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.800
 seconds 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.970
 confessing that every time life 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.650
 he showed sad humorless cruel he 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.530
 was driving to the airport to 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.880
 observe those gates and there 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:14.000
 I found love everywhere 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.090
 your heart reached peace is a relief 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.380
 and to note that love still existed and that 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.480
 there was still hope for the world 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.380
 this may all seem rather poetic 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.990
 too much for the more practical and certain 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:33.550
 thus the best way of understanding the 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:36.260
 The proposed situation is the 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.760
 we suggest you experiment with 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.850
 few minutes 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.489
 to contemplate these scenes by yourself be 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.270
 waiting for airplanes or other means of 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.270
 collective transportation 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.080
 we propose that you start from a more 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.620
 analytical of beginning with some pinches 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:59.120
 of curiosity what degree of kinship 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:02.709
 have not seen each other for a long time . 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.709
 where they arrive or who knows about others 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:09.680
 what stories do they have to tell what they will 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.470
 narrate first or leave from there on the 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.600
 family on the trip over the waiting in 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.030
 another airport 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.810
 when I noticed tears in some oils 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.940
 question where they come from there as 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.340
 time are not met 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.920
 what happiness does not exist inside the soul 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.070
 that moment 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:34.640
 tape for how long that 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:38.050
 moment will be stored in memory 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.050
 instant of meeting 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.710
 [Music] 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.970
 all this can lead us to a 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:50.060
 final analogy to a new question does not 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.420
 would be to have a lot and in the port a place 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.080
 non-stop arrivals and departures 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:59.320
 inevitable constants 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.850
 thinking of the arrival gates on earth 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.820
 we remember the babies that we 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:08.560
 born with the same love of those 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:11.450
 waiting at the airport for their loved ones 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.420
 we cry with joy contemplating the 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.459
 beauty of a new life and often 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.299
 This cry is of gratitude for the 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.670
 opportunity of the meeting is an old 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:26.930
 love that sometimes returns our home 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:29.110
 through reincarnation thinking now 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.090
 at the departure gates 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:35.600
 inevitably remind us of the death of 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:38.810
 farewell but this sense can be 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.930
 also happy as the feeling that 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.360
 invades a mother or father who says goodbye to 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.450
 a son who soon will embark toward 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:51.850
 another country in order to make a 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:54.700
 study or professional learning 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:57.160
 cry yes, I miss you 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.520
 but the feeling that prevails in the good 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.850
 parents heart is happiness 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.910
 opportunity they are receiving because 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.780
 is aware that this is the best 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.780
 for him at the moment 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:23.210
 we live at her airport 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:26.510
 every day thousands depart thousands 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.400
 arrivals and departures arrive 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.180
 inevitable 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.420
 What we can change is how we look 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.420
 the 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:57.740
