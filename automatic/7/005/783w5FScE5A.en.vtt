believe this is based off of the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.970 
believe this is based off of the
multiplayer<00:00:59.480> skin<00:01:00.410> that<00:01:00.829> he<00:01:00.950> has<00:01:01.540> and<00:01:02.980> comes

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
usually you just get this rotation which

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.830 
usually you just get this rotation which
is<00:02:59.849> the<00:03:00.120> peg<00:03:00.450> that's<00:03:02.120> that's<00:03:03.120> attached<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.480> the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
is the peg that's that's attached to the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.840 
is the peg that's that's attached to the
shoulder<00:03:04.200> but<00:03:04.890> for<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.640> biceps<00:03:06.420> section

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
shoulder but for the biceps section

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.720 
shoulder but for the biceps section
usually<00:03:08.850> this<00:03:09.359> join<00:03:09.750> it's<00:03:10.019> sticking<00:03:10.799> to<00:03:11.160> the

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
usually this join it's sticking to the

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.059 
usually this join it's sticking to the
bicep<00:03:12.120> so<00:03:12.569> you<00:03:13.109> can't<00:03:13.380> really<00:03:13.530> move<00:03:13.739> it<00:03:13.920> and

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
bicep so you can't really move it and

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.180 
bicep so you can't really move it and
they're<00:03:15.060> in<00:03:15.359> this<00:03:15.750> part<00:03:16.109> right<00:03:16.230> here<00:03:16.290> it's

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
they're in this part right here it's

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.890 
they're in this part right here it's
supposed<00:03:17.640> to<00:03:17.760> swivel<00:03:18.510> as<00:03:18.870> well<00:03:19.170> this<00:03:19.739> section

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
supposed to swivel as well this section

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.720 
supposed to swivel as well this section
because<00:03:21.900> if<00:03:22.709> you<00:03:22.980> want<00:03:23.220> your<00:03:23.780> figure<00:03:25.400> to<00:03:26.400> haul

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
because if you want your figure to haul

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.400 
because if you want your figure to haul
a<00:03:26.760> Lancer<00:03:27.389> with<00:03:27.569> two<00:03:27.780> hands

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
a Lancer with two hands

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.490 
a Lancer with two hands
naturally<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.700> would<00:03:29.850> have<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.350> loosen<00:03:31.350> up

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
naturally you would have to loosen up

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.210 
naturally you would have to loosen up
this<00:03:31.680> joint<00:03:32.069> right<00:03:32.579> here<00:03:32.639> and<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:34.799> trick<00:03:35.190> to

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
this joint right here and the trick to

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.819 
this joint right here and the trick to
this<00:03:35.609> you<00:03:36.269> will<00:03:36.389> have<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.690> use<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.900> hairdryer<00:03:37.260> to

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
this you will have to use a hairdryer to

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.520 
this you will have to use a hairdryer to
soften<00:03:38.250> up<00:03:38.459> this<00:03:38.639> bicep<00:03:38.910> section<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.780> then<00:03:40.350> I

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
soften up this bicep section and then I

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.009 
soften up this bicep section and then I
use<00:03:40.889> a<00:03:40.920> screwdriver<00:03:41.489> to<00:03:41.850> kind<00:03:42.120> of<00:03:42.239> pry<00:03:42.299> it<00:03:42.750> in

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
use a screwdriver to kind of pry it in

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.449 
use a screwdriver to kind of pry it in
there<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.440> little<00:03:43.769> bit<00:03:43.950> too<00:03:45.019> to<00:03:46.019> fatten<00:03:46.410> up<00:03:46.530> this

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
there a little bit too to fatten up this

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.920 
there a little bit too to fatten up this
peg<00:03:48.180> hole<00:03:48.420> right<00:03:48.690> here<00:03:49.370> so<00:03:50.480> so<00:03:51.480> he'll<00:03:51.720> be<00:03:51.870> able

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
peg hole right here so so he'll be able

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.099 
peg hole right here so so he'll be able
to<00:03:52.079> move<00:03:52.350> this<00:03:53.340> swivel<00:03:54.030> joint<00:03:54.359> right<00:03:54.540> here

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:59.569 

currently<00:03:58.109> without<00:03:58.440> loosening<00:03:59.250> up<00:03:59.430> that

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
currently without loosening up that

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.660 
currently without loosening up that
joint<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.450> bicep<00:04:00.840> joint<00:04:01.079> the<00:04:02.010> best<00:04:02.250> you<00:04:02.489> could

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
joint the bicep joint the best you could

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.710

while<00:04:06.720> holding<00:04:06.930> a<00:04:07.170> Lancer<00:04:07.530> would<00:04:07.769> be<00:04:07.920> this

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
while holding a Lancer would be this

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.220 
while holding a Lancer would be this
because<00:04:10.590> his<00:04:11.370> shoulders<00:04:12.030> aren't<00:04:12.690> fully

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
because his shoulders aren't fully

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.490 
because his shoulders aren't fully
forward<00:04:14.120> due<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.180> that<00:04:15.420> joint<00:04:15.720> not<00:04:16.199> being

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
forward due to that joint not being

loosened up all right and here he is

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:26.150 
loosened up all right and here he is
after<00:04:21.000> loosen<00:04:21.959> up<00:04:22.079> that<00:04:22.109> bicep<00:04:22.740> joint<00:04:25.160> here's

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
after loosen up that bicep joint here's

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.200 
after loosen up that bicep joint here's
how<00:04:26.460> he<00:04:26.520> looks

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
how he looks

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.950 
how he looks

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
while holding the retro Lancer as you

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.210 
while holding the retro Lancer as you
can<00:04:31.110> see<00:04:31.229> it's<00:04:31.699> much<00:04:32.699> more<00:04:32.850> natural<00:04:33.919> because<00:04:34.919> I

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
can see it's much more natural because I

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.760 
can see it's much more natural because I
was<00:04:35.610> able<00:04:35.699> to<00:04:35.850> swing<00:04:36.360> his<00:04:36.630> arm

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770

Ford even more than what I was able to
previously<00:04:45.650> so<00:04:46.650> now<00:04:46.860> you<00:04:46.919> can<00:04:47.250> see<00:04:47.460> he's

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
previously so now you can see he's

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.890
