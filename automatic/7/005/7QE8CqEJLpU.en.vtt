parts<00:02:09.679> that<00:02:09.860> need<00:02:10.039> lubricating<00:02:11.140> spaced<00:02:12.140> space

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
parts that need lubricating spaced space

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.140 
parts that need lubricating spaced space
things<00:02:13.489> in<00:02:13.760> there<00:02:13.940> so<00:02:14.180> they<00:02:14.300> work<00:02:14.450> properly

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
things in there so they work properly

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.640

these<00:02:17.150> pedals<00:02:17.600> that<00:02:17.720> buff<00:02:18.049> these<00:02:18.230> pedals

these pedals that buff these pedals

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.590 
these pedals that buff these pedals
that's<00:02:18.980> why<00:02:19.220> they<00:02:19.370> look<00:02:19.519> like<00:02:20.150> they're<00:02:20.420> brand

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
that's why they look like they're brand

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.900 
that's why they look like they're brand
new<00:02:21.880> you<00:02:22.880> can<00:02:23.090> see<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:24.110> lubricated<00:02:24.860> all<00:02:25.670> of

new you can see and lubricated all of

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.259 
new you can see and lubricated all of

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
that's something I'm certain that this

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.870 
that's something I'm certain that this
piano<00:05:21.590> hasn't<00:05:22.070> seen<00:05:22.280> since<00:05:22.580> it<00:05:22.729> was

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
piano hasn't seen since it was

piano hasn't seen since it was
manufactured<00:05:23.630> and<00:05:23.780> I<00:05:23.900> would<00:05:24.080> say<00:05:24.290> that<00:05:24.560> that

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
manufactured and I would say that that

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.939 
manufactured and I would say that that
that<00:05:27.410> well<00:05:27.770> over<00:05:28.160> 99%<00:05:28.729> probably<00:05:29.720> 99.9%<00:05:30.410> of

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
that well over 99% probably 99.9% of

everything<00:05:42.200> so<00:05:43.100> this<00:05:43.220> piano<00:05:43.430> is<00:05:43.580> basically<00:05:44.210> in

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
everything so this piano is basically in

everything so this piano is basically in
perfect<00:05:44.960> condition<00:05:45.560> actually<00:05:46.400> let's<00:05:46.550> look<00:05:46.790> at

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
perfect condition actually let's look at

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.700 
perfect condition actually let's look at
it<00:05:47.090> before<00:05:47.419> we<00:05:47.690> end<00:05:47.900> the<00:05:48.020> video<00:05:48.110> let's<00:05:48.470> look<00:05:48.620> at

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
it before we end the video let's look at

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.219 
it before we end the video let's look at
the<00:05:48.800> inside<00:05:49.190> you<00:05:49.940> can<00:05:50.090> see<00:05:50.330> how<00:05:50.600> clean

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
the inside you can see how clean

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:53.680 
the inside you can see how clean
everything<00:05:51.740> is<00:05:51.919> and<00:05:52.190> how<00:05:52.220> it<00:05:52.520> how<00:05:53.210> it<00:05:53.330> looks

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.310 

and<00:06:01.470> then<00:06:01.740> we'll<00:06:01.949> finish<00:06:02.729> up<00:06:03.120> so<00:06:03.930> anyway<00:06:04.290> I

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
and then we'll finish up so anyway I

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.390 
and then we'll finish up so anyway I

other pianos in its price range the
piano<00:06:10.919> is<00:06:11.100> is<00:06:11.580> just<00:06:12.150> in<00:06:12.479> perfect<00:06:13.169> condition

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:14.009 
piano is is just in perfect condition

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:19.249 
piano is is just in perfect condition
and<00:06:14.190> and<00:06:14.639> far<00:06:15.120> superior<00:06:15.360> to<00:06:16.039> to<00:06:17.930> any<00:06:18.930> of<00:06:19.110> those

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 
and and far superior to to any of those
