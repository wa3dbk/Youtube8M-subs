00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:07.240
 very good to all welcome to a 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:11.169
 new questions and answers this time 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.639
 we are with you that your sympathy and 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:15.660
 let's go as always with the question 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:21.550
 what's going to make it interesting sophisticated 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:24.339
 unborn line they joined a no longer I do not know if 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.750
 questions of my sport mind when you 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:28.179
 they will sing happy birthday in the 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.070
 you direct first killings because I do not 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.689
 they like those things since it gives me a lot 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.219
 embarrassed and I did not expect it because I 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.350
 they were cheating then it was like a 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.450
 some fear in plan and do not know me and 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.180
 if nobody sings but they know me 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.190
 fortunately and they sang like a little 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.750
 relief that I was very very nervous and 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.520
 I think you see in the video I did not know 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.520
 what to say or what to do because I never 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.019
 question record them and play the game of 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.210
 weapons and I 'll have the next call 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.570
 of duty I basically think that I buy 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.340
 game why with or weapons 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.110
 to be able to make the characters talk with 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.700
 you in planes of French navigator 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.159
 and take those things because what is for 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.020
 play normal in game no longer calls me 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.020
 a lot but I like to do 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.750
 I do not think shit anymore moron I do not know why 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.750
 you feel sisters two names 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.760
 in the second channel called general 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.910
 rewinding 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.770
 in the video that is going to be a channel that 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.300
 I went to things that have nothing to do 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.920
 with the main one and with the time when 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.680
 I'm watching this video and having uploaded 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.270
 gesture marked secondary then yes 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.010
 to continue through the channel you live that I have not 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.480
 come back up gesture basically because 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.970
 in the video I ask if they have to 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.470
 go up more than say it to the comment 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.910
 it feels nothing so if that series 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.190
 it works and at the same time the secondary face 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.750
 basically funny gesture less basically 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.750
 because the idea has been liked and everything is going well 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.610
 so there will be something for each secondary 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.050
 but if you see that there is nothing because 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.280
 he liked to go and really channels 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.140

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.209
 one hour and then they took us a minute to 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.150
