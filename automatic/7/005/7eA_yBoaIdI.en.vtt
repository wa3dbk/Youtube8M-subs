00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.779
 I have been looking forward for years to the successor to the brit in the post a period 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:08.679
 comment 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:12.349
 but two years he plays on this welcome both tests yes I have not 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:16.749
 if i think was played against siena 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.349
 and that was 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.520
 now too expensive and the ten places efficient yes 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.030
 it was the first 45 minutes with a contribution seriously 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.070
 because I started a fact 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.250
 of started cards crazy everything and that is 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.820
 that is anyway even the most extensive katy perry's i have seen it lasted 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.770
 not so there is twenty minutes to say that was actually a silence help well 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.100
 yes i think i'll take fifteen minutes 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.710
 already the word comes 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.140
 this his father who had been on the Sint Maarten Guild Wood Owl for so long 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.190
 absent 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.620
 usually you have too 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.700
 unbelievable choice all my kids as irritating though dark els ports everything from 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.340
 linked that they extensively with you 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.640
 that could also be seen in a different meaning 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.390
 her 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.390
 all structures in the project 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.260
 according to make 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
 and that was more fun 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.300
 nearby chose a park eventually 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.800
 a little bit in the air 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.050
 finally all major out of the day 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.020
 without a painful with you a snowy landscape really 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.020
 north sea htc htc is going scandinavian then merks 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.470
 sp chooses and the tree cover sketch 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.000
 some flowers 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.720
 we do not know what to do with old more bicycles actually produce 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.720
 There you saw what is a trade that is not so bad 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.930
 they grab 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.420
 what a strange place 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.030
 horseshoe body painting 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.040
 they are catching up 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.040
 it just looks 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.930
 she would jump above the water 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:17.459
 Ron Vlaar is sitting above the water and goodbye 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.120
 In fact, you can also catch it again for any military coup in all that total 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.049
 kind of shit you can actually if you play this game I can follow the memoirs 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.309
 jamie dixon 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:30.539
 or promotions the cities where you squeeze everything 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:31.599
 the eastern one under your bed that 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.389
 ahold hours lost minimum minimum 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.389
 will be ready 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.489
 we also have none with a tip 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.489
 Arnhem is going very politically anyway 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:50.449
 NSI fireballs shoot everything 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:55.900
 indeed the well-known game pre you expect this also for this game so it is not 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.819
 very special 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.069
 yes the possibilities are endless 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.229
 for example, before you have one in the young can do many and with it 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.849
 also the first place became forging and with that a lot of inhabitants create too 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.849
 but some materials I continued my attack 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:15.759
 learn when needed 

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:19.209
 yes you have that you need at scylla so much and way too little they learn 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.209
 man pill the veghelse weather 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.619
 that all you combine starts with a certain country, the mac plays all 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.009
 you get better there 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:34.039
 I like that too 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:36.229
 can see 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:37.569
 very easy specialty 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.809
 Sunday is satisfied with putting on thorn textile 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:44.639
 the magyar is set up popping workgroup the judge can do better is none 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.629
 easy to switch connection 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.870
 Hulshout short combination as bond an entry level that had before and the 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.679
 men hand a taxi 

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:56.679
 that combination also chips from intel and texas was raped 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.279
 at the same time here 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:01.879
 they are both the power 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.359
 to do something about it in the judgment, but 5 euros 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.179
 extra power 

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:09.179
 6 brabant for 45 minutes 

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:12.989
 I am going to be a little bit as long as I think 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.989
 it's just very nice and nice 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.049
 only 2 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.609
 miss it a few times 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.800
 soccer out 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.800
 it is also a little bit gone 

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:29.409
 the big games there are always for sale 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:32.110
 well stayed there too 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.110
 members of the council also think 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.469
 aso you get that you just have at such a game 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:45.469
 is there what you are going to do that you also need to make 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.120
 the pressure is on discovering and 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:12.090
 it's for me and I often think all frge enthusiasts were playing played eleven 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:15.150
 still looking forward to it and I know I look I am not going to join 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.150
 freely take lively and play 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.250
 what touched 20 percent
