00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:17.699
 good guys are lucky that you 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:19.710
 I give some objects tell you the truth 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.810
 they are so heavy with dollars too much 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.359
 the island life in layman let's put a little 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.589
 to put it a little wave 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.750
 then I said let's see how 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:30.599
 it turned out that I like 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.270
 we have buds and clear on one hand the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.370
 buds we assemble them with the two friends of 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.340
 rows I have to say that the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.289
 amount of sugar but with half of 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.520
 the calories we make the goat 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:48.070
 I was totally looking at a club after 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.700
 we are going to place him like this mounts that the 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:55.920
 spectacular has been amazing tape and 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:59.160
 now we are going to add good the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.160
 vanilla 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07.860
 rich because you have to give it all the flavor 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.860
 possible I would already be with this 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.490
 30 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:34.680
 it's good that it's either with a few grams 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.680
 so you have two extra pounds of red 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.130
 so they know why a lot of people 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.130
 I'm complaining 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.810
 but that comes well people a 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:55.170
 once a week so that people who are 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:57.800
 is also taking care of many local 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.800
 they ask me that 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.180
 well we have here all the cheese 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.190
 integrated with the yolks and once you 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.160
 we have a pretty cream 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.510
 couple and quite malleable if to this 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.150
 tiramisu can also give you a bit of 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.230
 cold if you want to counter and 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.150
 another thing that we are going to do as usual 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.060
 to put half the cheese fattening 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.430
 half of cheese life now well for 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.080
 finish this we are going to put some 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.150
 clear well beaten to snow well beaten 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.709
 to snow well beaten they went well 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.720
 firm that is to say that everything goes with us 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.489
 if you want it to be very firm that 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.959
 you want to make a layden cake through and 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:42.880
 you put some jelly on it 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:46.310
 proportion of 14 grams of gelatin 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.870
 dissolved the jelly powder that jan 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.790
 these times we are going to make some pills 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.530
 of how hydrated gelatin that so much 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.290
 people that we do not know look with the clear 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.560
 how is the preparation doing type 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.550
 mus goes wrapping in containing 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.550
 centuries or 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.900
 on the other hand
