deck<00:00:43.550> is<00:00:44.550> proactive<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.809> playing<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.230> lot<00:00:46.379> of

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
deck is proactive it's playing a lot of

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.500 
deck is proactive it's playing a lot of
the<00:00:46.500> most<00:00:46.710> powerful<00:00:47.129> cards<00:00:47.519> in<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:48.089> modern<00:00:48.299> I

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
the most powerful cards in in modern I

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.390 
the most powerful cards in in modern I
think<00:00:48.690> like<00:00:48.960> by<00:00:49.140> my<00:00:49.350> estimation<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.190> playing

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
think like by my estimation it's playing

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.950 
think like by my estimation it's playing
five<00:00:50.729> of<00:00:51.089> the<00:00:51.600> 10<00:00:51.780> best<00:00:52.140> cards<00:00:52.470> in<00:00:52.559> modern<00:00:52.860> and

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
five of the 10 best cards in modern and

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.570 
five of the 10 best cards in modern and
it<00:00:54.960> doesn't<00:00:55.440> need<00:00:55.589> anything<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.100> go<00:00:56.309> right

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
it doesn't need anything to go right

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.250 
it doesn't need anything to go right
like<00:00:56.909> if<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.120> just<00:00:57.269> watched<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.750> just<00:00:58.110> played<00:00:58.229> a

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
like if you just watched I just played a

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.500 
like if you just watched I just played a
matching<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.650> Samsung<00:00:59.129> Mook<00:00:59.400> and<00:00:59.640> in<00:01:00.330> both

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
matching in Samsung Mook and in both

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.359 
matching in Samsung Mook and in both
matches<00:01:01.049> he<00:01:01.229> had<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.440> turn<00:01:01.530> one<00:01:01.739> discard<00:01:02.129> spell

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:02.369 
matches he had to turn one discard spell

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:04.340 
matches he had to turn one discard spell
in<00:01:02.549> my<00:01:02.580> hand<00:01:02.670> just<00:01:03.089> doesn't<00:01:03.839> doesn't<00:01:04.080> matter

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
in my hand just doesn't doesn't matter

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.990 
in my hand just doesn't doesn't matter
okay<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.190> doesn't<00:01:05.309> need<00:01:05.460> anything<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.820> go

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
okay it doesn't need anything to go

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.760 
okay it doesn't need anything to go
right<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:06.420> needs<00:01:06.750> creatures<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.409> lands

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
right it just needs creatures and lands

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.200 
right it just needs creatures and lands
and<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:07.979> only<00:01:08.159> plays<00:01:08.460> creatures<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.060> lands

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
and it only plays creatures and lands

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.640 
and it only plays creatures and lands
basically<00:01:09.950> collected<00:01:10.950> company<00:01:12.350> in<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> deck

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
basically collected company in the deck

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.649 
basically collected company in the deck
just<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.760> gives<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.000> another<00:01:15.150> angle<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.540> attack

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
just it gives it another angle of attack

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.630 
just it gives it another angle of attack
and<00:01:16.080> allows<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.619> compete<00:01:17.040> against<00:01:17.460> decks

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
and allows it to compete against decks

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.340 
and allows it to compete against decks
that<00:01:17.790> would<00:01:17.909> otherwise<00:01:18.240> be<00:01:18.510> able<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.869> grind

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
that would otherwise be able to grind

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.680 
that would otherwise be able to grind
out<00:01:19.650> or<00:01:19.920> attrition<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.790> traditional<00:01:21.390> zoo<00:01:21.510> deck

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
out or attrition a traditional zoo deck

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.600 
out or attrition a traditional zoo deck
so<00:01:22.470> it's<00:01:22.620> very<00:01:22.740> much<00:01:22.950> like<00:01:22.980> the<00:01:23.250> zoo<00:01:23.400> decks

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
so it's very much like the zoo decks

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.010 
so it's very much like the zoo decks
because<00:01:23.910> collective<00:01:24.330> company<00:01:24.600> seems<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.900> be

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
because collective company seems to be

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.020 
because collective company seems to be
your<00:01:25.380> topper<00:01:25.860> here<00:01:26.070> at<00:01:26.160> four<00:01:26.340> bonus<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:26.880> we'll

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
run through the mana cost of each of

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.340 
run through the mana cost of each of
your<00:01:28.800> creatures<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.400> got<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:30.080> believe<00:01:31.080> nine

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
your creatures so you got I believe nine

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.710

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
one drops in for while in the cutoff for

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.240 
one drops in for while in the cutoff for
noble<00:01:34.050> hierarch<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.530> one<00:01:34.740> birds-of-paradise

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
noble hierarch and one birds-of-paradise

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.790 
noble hierarch and one birds-of-paradise
yep<00:01:35.910> so<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.540> don't<00:01:36.960> see<00:01:37.140> traditional<00:01:37.620> zoo

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
yep so you don't see traditional zoo

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.490 
yep so you don't see traditional zoo
decks<00:01:38.010> anymore<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:39.090> wild<00:01:39.390> Mikado<00:01:39.720> poised<00:01:40.470> for

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
decks anymore is wild Mikado poised for

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.800 
decks anymore is wild Mikado poised for
a<00:01:40.800> comeback<00:01:41.130> yeah<00:01:41.910> I<00:01:41.970> mean<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.180> think<00:01:42.240> it's<00:01:42.480> a<00:01:42.630> I

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
a comeback yeah I mean I think it's a I

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.260 
a comeback yeah I mean I think it's a I
think<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.440> good<00:01:43.590> card<00:01:43.830> I<00:01:44.010> think<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.520> you

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
think it's a good card I think that you

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.270 
think it's a good card I think that you
know<00:01:45.360> obviously<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.440> its<00:01:46.650> biggest<00:01:46.860> weakness

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
know obviously the its biggest weakness

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.860 
know obviously the its biggest weakness
is<00:01:47.430> its<00:01:47.610> vulnerability<00:01:47.730> to<00:01:48.330> lightning<00:01:48.690> bolt

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
is its vulnerability to lightning bolt

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.270 
is its vulnerability to lightning bolt
but<00:01:49.080> against<00:01:49.290> all<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.620> the<00:01:49.710> non<00:01:49.860> lightning

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
but against all of the non lightning

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.250 
but against all of the non lightning
bolt<00:01:50.490> decks<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:50.940> just<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.630> know<00:01:51.750> providing

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
bolt decks it's just you know providing

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.170 
bolt decks it's just you know providing
probably<00:01:53.010> the<00:01:53.100> second<00:01:53.430> best<00:01:53.640> rate<00:01:53.909> for<00:01:54.150> a

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
probably the second best rate for a

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.640 
probably the second best rate for a
