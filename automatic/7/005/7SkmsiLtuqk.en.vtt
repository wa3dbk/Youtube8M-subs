00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.620
 hello such friends welcome to a 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.750
 new video tutorial of electronics in 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.619
 this occasion talking a little about 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.809
 the repair of lcd-type monitors in 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:17.950
 what is the part of the source 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:19.960
 commuted here we have this image of the 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.420
 part of the source around here we can 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.900
 observe the power connector 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.960
 alternate over here we see the fuse this 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.320
 round here a term 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.910
 we see the entire filtering cap of 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.310
 protection 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.520
 we see here the bridge rectifier that in 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:42.520
 this case is a single package 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.420
 and here we see the capacitor that is going to 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.239
 help filter better that voltage that 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.390
 will leave the rectifier bridge like this 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.489
 that sometimes as we know 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.250
 well, what are these? 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.520
 capacitors especially at the output of 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.710
 this transformer is inflated and this 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.379
 causes different failures in the monitor 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.260
 as the screen may darken a 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.869
 little vertical lines can appear 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.450
 horizontal ready but I wanted 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:17.229
 tell them that we must be aware 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.690
 of some god in here we can 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.399
 observe these two in this case can 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.560
 vary depending on the source 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:27.760
 switched that we are reviewing can 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.070
 be three four or more god 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.050
 and we should check the because in some 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.909
 occasions these god in his work then 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.179
 they come in short 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:45.130
 and this causes the monitor not to turn on 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:48.460
 so we must if it is necessary to remove them 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.819
 of the plate to have one more reading 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.250
 precise in terms of measuring these 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:57.810
 god sener that may be the cause 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.069
 of the failure of the lcd monitor 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.229
 generally we will find ourselves near 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:08.049
 of the largest capacitor of filtering in 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:12.340
 the switched source so I'll leave you there 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:13.989
 that guy review these god sen not 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.030
 being more I say goodbye do not forget 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.290
 subscribe you share the video and we 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.290
 we see in the next
