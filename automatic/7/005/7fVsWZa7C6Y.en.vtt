00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.029
 24 hours to go before this expires 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.630
 race for forgiveness and redemption types of 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:26.789
 as long as it costs I leave blood stanzas 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:30.929
 of the move in life you want to watch me 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.899
 inside I'm just a dead monster 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.239
 I hardly remember it as a universal vice 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.190
 like the one faced every day not 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.030
 I can mirror myself but I am mirrored 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.940
 on a sheet 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.670
 I have always given too much weight to mine 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.170
 course positions always given little weight 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.750
 to your opinions 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.390
 they say you don't have the time anymore take those 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.530
 spotlight but I don't spend if I don't sell 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.440
 four balls 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.780
 i'm a count you fitch off is 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.480
 stuff the proof that I gave the maximum in 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.239
 this fucking story I put hatred and 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.000
 little if it does not kill me from us to have 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.180
 believed in my name will be my only one 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.180
 glory 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.350
 reason days in this place only 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.350
 damage 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.670
 It was my job to never do everything 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:23.670
 how much 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.600
 so 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.600
 added 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.580
 24 hours are few 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.250
 now it's too late to leave the 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.229
 summer only one day of this life 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.890
 give me a piece of paper that I do in the East 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.190
 over 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.920
 the first said point is to think about it 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.049
 least at least done under the secure inter 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.750
 not turn back the sheet a cap in the ass 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:56.330
 I know every hunger I already know 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.479
 wishes he goes down the drain says he will miss you but 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.180
 even no then to you how many times I have you 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.520
 waited but you seemed to pass alone 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.960
 when I turned a kiss to my mother 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.390
 an arrival to my father the love in 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.160
 family and bullshit for couples 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.260
 wrong I hope you understand I hope 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.230
 understand that you are not separating legal votes 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.340
 markers without changing them like pens 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.230
 notebook and I'm soon stuffed early 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.680
 quiet no problem but let me 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.170
 leave a true memory of me that I think 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.900
 in the end it was worth it too 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.900
 start and finish only with my king 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.370
 the last day in this place only one 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.370
 like so many if 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.170
 was in my place 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.080
 the things 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.100
 but come to school 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.100
 its time 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.890
 you run too late for a chance
