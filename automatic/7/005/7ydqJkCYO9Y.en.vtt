00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
about this branch and the rain but it is

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.660 
about this branch and the rain but it is
so<00:01:09.960> beautifully<00:01:10.680> rendered<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.130> mean<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.369> wasn't

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
so beautifully rendered I mean I wasn't

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.399 
so beautifully rendered I mean I wasn't
even<00:01:11.790> sure<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.000> was<00:01:12.150> looking<00:01:12.420> at<00:01:12.510> CGI<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.049> begin

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
even sure I was looking at CGI to begin

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.200 
even sure I was looking at CGI to begin
with<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.860> as<00:01:14.130> much<00:01:14.280> as<00:01:14.340> I'm<00:01:14.610> sure<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:15.060> is

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
with and as much as I'm sure this is

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.390 
with and as much as I'm sure this is
just<00:01:15.240> Pixar<00:01:16.020> showing<00:01:16.409> off<00:01:16.560> their<00:01:16.799> software's

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
just Pixar showing off their software's

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.300 
just Pixar showing off their software's
capabilities<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:18.240> also<00:01:18.750> think<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.680> realistic

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
capabilities I also think the realistic

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.789 
capabilities I also think the realistic
scenery<00:01:20.759> plays<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.390> role<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.200> plot<00:01:22.409> but

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
scenery plays a role in the plot but

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.380 
scenery plays a role in the plot but
I'll<00:01:23.189> come<00:01:23.340> back<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.610> later<00:01:23.729> next<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.270> see

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
I'll come back to that later next we see

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.840 
I'll come back to that later next we see
a<00:01:24.420> screen<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.930> text<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.650> single<00:01:26.340> moment<00:01:26.790> can

a screen of text a single moment can

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.700 
a screen of text a single moment can
change<00:01:27.060> history<00:01:27.659> it's<00:01:28.380> an<00:01:28.470> interesting

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
change history it's an interesting

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.039 
change history it's an interesting
tagline<00:01:29.430> since<00:01:29.759> apparently<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.540> premise<00:01:30.900> of

this<00:01:31.140> movie<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> single<00:01:32.280> moment<00:01:32.579> that

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
this movie is a single moment that

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.660

crashing into Earth and killing all the
dinosaurs<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.799> trailer<00:01:41.159> seems<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.579> suggest

dinosaurs the trailer seems to suggest

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.940 
dinosaurs the trailer seems to suggest
that<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:43.049> moment<00:01:43.229> because<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.649> very

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
that this is the moment because the very

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.010 
that this is the moment because the very
next<00:01:44.130> thing<00:01:44.340> we<00:01:44.430> see<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:44.970> meteor<00:01:45.450> missing

earth<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.090> sky<00:01:48.270> will<00:01:48.450> notice<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
earth and the sky will notice that the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.389 
earth and the sky will notice that the

close<00:01:51.149> together<00:01:51.360> kind<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:51.990> suggesting<00:01:52.470> that

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
close together kind of suggesting that

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.880 
close together kind of suggesting that
Pangaea<00:01:53.399> only<00:01:53.820> recently<00:01:54.689> split<00:01:55.290> as<00:01:55.680> touch

boy spot hoping a dinosaur Arlo get a
branch<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.350> food<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:08.280> think<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.569> the

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
branch of food and I think this is the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.780 
branch of food and I think this is the
moment<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.470> text<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:10.890> referring<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.370> because

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
moment the text is referring to because

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.520 
moment the text is referring to because
honestly<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.930> meteor

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
honestly a meteor

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.890 
honestly a meteor
missing<00:02:13.920> earth<00:02:14.130> isn't<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.910> moment<00:02:15.180> at<00:02:15.450> all<00:02:15.569> it's

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
missing earth isn't a moment at all it's

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.500 
missing earth isn't a moment at all it's
just<00:02:16.520> nothing<00:02:17.550> next<00:02:17.880> week<00:02:18.000> you're<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.209> lone

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
just nothing next week you're the lone

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.620 
just nothing next week you're the lone
word<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.230> entire<00:02:19.620> trailer<00:02:20.330> I'm<00:02:21.330> not<00:02:21.480> sure

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
word and the entire trailer I'm not sure

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.809 
word and the entire trailer I'm not sure
whether<00:02:21.780> it's<00:02:21.959> Arlo<00:02:22.410> or<00:02:22.620> spot<00:02:23.100> who<00:02:23.310> says<00:02:23.550> this

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
whether it's Arlo or spot who says this

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.180 
whether it's Arlo or spot who says this
but<00:02:24.000> I'm<00:02:24.209> guessing<00:02:24.420> it's<00:02:24.750> Arlo<00:02:25.319> if<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:25.830> had<00:02:26.069> to

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
but I'm guessing it's Arlo if I had to

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.910 
but I'm guessing it's Arlo if I had to
guess<00:02:26.459> I<00:02:26.670> would<00:02:26.910> say<00:02:27.120> spot<00:02:27.690> probably<00:02:28.080> won't<00:02:28.740> be

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
guess I would say spot probably won't be

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.860 
guess I would say spot probably won't be
able<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.160> speak<00:02:29.400> at<00:02:29.550> all<00:02:29.760> or<00:02:30.030> maybe<00:02:30.239> just<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.600> few

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
able to speak at all or maybe just a few

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.229 
able to speak at all or maybe just a few
small<00:02:31.080> words<00:02:31.560> moving<00:02:32.040> on<00:02:32.310> we<00:02:32.520> next<00:02:32.850> sees<00:02:33.030> some

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
small words moving on we next sees some

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.449 
small words moving on we next sees some
Buffalo<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.260> campfire<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:35.190> sitting

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
Buffalo and a campfire and sitting

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.580 
Buffalo and a campfire and sitting
around<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:36.090> campfire<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.930> initially<00:02:37.560> thought

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
around that campfire I initially thought

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.070 
around that campfire I initially thought
were<00:02:38.100> humans<00:02:38.940> but<00:02:39.209> upon<00:02:39.540> further<00:02:39.569> inspection

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
were humans but upon further inspection

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.670 
were humans but upon further inspection
it<00:02:40.830> is<00:02:41.040> definitely<00:02:41.610> some<00:02:41.850> t-rex<00:02:42.600> s<00:02:42.930> looking

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
it is definitely some t-rex s looking

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.280 
it is definitely some t-rex s looking
dinosaurs<00:02:44.280> using<00:02:45.209> that<00:02:45.480> campfire

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
dinosaurs using that campfire

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.630 
dinosaurs using that campfire
that's<00:02:46.410> pretty<00:02:46.650> intelligent<00:02:46.950> much<00:02:47.400> more

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
that's pretty intelligent much more

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.220 
that's pretty intelligent much more
intelligent<00:02:48.269> than<00:02:48.330> I<00:02:48.420> was<00:02:48.600> thinking<00:02:48.870> this

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
intelligent than I was thinking this

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.530 
intelligent than I was thinking this
movie<00:02:49.680> was<00:02:49.860> going<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.340> make<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.730> dinosaurs<00:02:51.330> so

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
movie was going to make the dinosaurs so

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.300 
movie was going to make the dinosaurs so
I'm<00:02:51.690> interested<00:02:52.019> to<00:02:52.290> see<00:02:52.380> how<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.709> plays<00:02:53.100> out

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
I'm interested to see how that plays out

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.910 
I'm interested to see how that plays out
I<00:02:53.370> mean<00:02:53.610> using<00:02:54.090> fire<00:02:54.510> is<00:02:54.840> typically<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.320> very

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
I mean using fire is typically a very

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.340 
I mean using fire is typically a very
human<00:02:56.670> thing<00:02:56.700> next<00:02:57.180> week<00:02:57.390> you<00:02:57.450> see<00:02:57.660> an<00:02:57.810> amazing

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
human thing next week you see an amazing

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.250 
human thing next week you see an amazing
shot<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.160> a<00:02:59.280> giant<00:02:59.790> dinosaur<00:03:00.300> emerging<00:03:01.080> from

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
shot of a giant dinosaur emerging from

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.050 
shot of a giant dinosaur emerging from
the<00:03:01.380> forest<00:03:01.410> from<00:03:02.040> which<00:03:02.190> he<00:03:02.340> is<00:03:02.489> very<00:03:02.519> well

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
the forest from which he is very well

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.420 
the forest from which he is very well
camouflaged<00:03:03.660> into<00:03:04.319> there's<00:03:04.739> a<00:03:04.800> small<00:03:05.069> detail

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
camouflaged into there's a small detail

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.340 
camouflaged into there's a small detail
you<00:03:05.550> might<00:03:05.819> have<00:03:06.030> missed<00:03:06.300> his<00:03:06.630> eyes<00:03:06.959> are<00:03:07.319> a

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
you might have missed his eyes are a

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.710 
you might have missed his eyes are a
little<00:03:07.830> offset<00:03:08.069> and<00:03:08.610> it's<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:09.030> small<00:03:09.330> detail

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
little offset and it's a small detail

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.930 
little offset and it's a small detail
but<00:03:10.019> I<00:03:10.170> think<00:03:10.440> it<00:03:10.590> says<00:03:10.769> a<00:03:10.830> lot<00:03:11.130> about<00:03:11.190> what<00:03:11.760> the

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
but I think it says a lot about what the

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.780 
but I think it says a lot about what the
character<00:03:12.480> of<00:03:12.690> this<00:03:12.930> dino<00:03:13.200> might<00:03:13.769> be<00:03:14.040> one<00:03:14.430> he

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
character of this dino might be one he

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.759 
character of this dino might be one he
could<00:03:14.970> be<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.090> little<00:03:15.390> kooky<00:03:16.019> and<00:03:16.230> yet<00:03:16.440> wise

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
could be a little kooky and yet wise

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.390 
could be a little kooky and yet wise
advisor<00:03:17.610> not<00:03:18.299> unlike<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.049> witch<00:03:19.290> in<00:03:19.590> brave<00:03:19.950> or

around the red fire these three are

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.059 
around the red fire these three are
likely<00:04:34.720> to<00:04:34.840> pose<00:04:34.960> a<00:04:35.020> threat<00:04:35.169> to<00:04:35.590> our<00:04:35.620> Lord's

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:38.040 
likely to pose a threat to our Lord's

wraps<00:05:29.139> up<00:05:29.380> the<00:05:29.529> trailer<00:05:29.919> I<00:05:30.099> mean<00:05:30.310> it's<00:05:30.550> hard<00:05:30.729> to

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:30.789 
wraps up the trailer I mean it's hard to

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.670 
wraps up the trailer I mean it's hard to
get<00:05:30.940> a<00:05:30.969> good<00:05:31.300> grasp<00:05:31.630> of<00:05:31.930> what<00:05:32.080> the<00:05:32.199> movie<00:05:32.500> will

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
get a good grasp of what the movie will

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.309 
get a good grasp of what the movie will
be<00:05:32.830> about<00:05:33.340> just<00:05:33.819> from<00:05:34.000> this<00:05:34.150> trailer<00:05:34.419> but<00:05:34.750> I

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 
be about just from this trailer but I

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:37.529 
be about just from this trailer but I
think<00:05:35.680> it<00:05:35.800> looks<00:05:35.830> really<00:05:36.310> good<00:05:36.699> people<00:05:37.270> keep

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:37.539 
think it looks really good people keep

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:39.629 
think it looks really good people keep
describing<00:05:37.810> it<00:05:38.169> to<00:05:38.289> me<00:05:38.409> as<00:05:38.590> a<00:05:38.620> boy<00:05:39.219> and<00:05:39.490> his<00:05:39.580> dog

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
describing it to me as a boy and his dog

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.149 
describing it to me as a boy and his dog
movie<00:05:40.389> except<00:05:40.690> it's<00:05:40.840> a<00:05:40.990> boy<00:05:41.380> in<00:05:41.560> his<00:05:41.680> dinosaur

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:42.159 
movie except it's a boy in his dinosaur

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:44.430 
movie except it's a boy in his dinosaur
movie<00:05:42.490> but<00:05:42.759> I<00:05:42.940> think<00:05:43.449> that's<00:05:43.630> inaccurate<00:05:43.930> to

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
movie but I think that's inaccurate to

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.249 
movie but I think that's inaccurate to
me<00:05:44.529> it<00:05:44.740> looks<00:05:44.889> more<00:05:45.039> like<00:05:45.219> a<00:05:45.569> dinosaur<00:05:46.569> and<00:05:46.810> his

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:47.259 
me it looks more like a dinosaur and his

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:49.200 
me it looks more like a dinosaur and his
boy<00:05:47.560> movie<00:05:48.279> that<00:05:48.610> also<00:05:48.699> don't<00:05:48.940> show<00:05:49.029> us<00:05:49.120> a

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
boy movie that also don't show us a

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.760 
boy movie that also don't show us a
definitive<00:05:49.509> villain<00:05:50.050> I<00:05:50.169> mean<00:05:50.349> they<00:05:50.500> might<00:05:50.620> be

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
definitive villain I mean they might be

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.100 
definitive villain I mean they might be
hiding<00:05:50.979> that<00:05:51.340> on<00:05:51.610> purpose<00:05:51.880> but<00:05:52.419> it<00:05:52.599> also<00:05:52.750> might

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
hiding that on purpose but it also might

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.110 
hiding that on purpose but it also might
be<00:05:53.139> because<00:05:53.560> there<00:05:53.830> isn't<00:05:54.219> a<00:05:54.610> definitive

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
be because there isn't a definitive

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.140 
be because there isn't a definitive
villain<00:05:55.690> there's<00:05:56.169> threats<00:05:56.830> and<00:05:57.250> lots<00:05:57.729> of<00:05:57.879> fire

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
villain there's threats and lots of fire

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.300 
villain there's threats and lots of fire
and<00:05:58.509> heavy<00:05:58.870> rain<00:05:59.229> and<00:05:59.590> he's<00:05:59.680> cascading

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
and heavy rain and he's cascading

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.619 
and heavy rain and he's cascading
through<00:06:00.430> a<00:06:00.520> river<00:06:00.699> at<00:06:00.909> one<00:06:01.060> point<00:06:01.270> I<00:06:01.449> mean

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:01.629 
through a river at one point I mean

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:04.019 
through a river at one point I mean
nature<00:06:02.259> itself<00:06:02.919> might<00:06:03.250> be<00:06:03.400> the<00:06:03.580> villain<00:06:03.909> the

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:04.029 
nature itself might be the villain the

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:05.879 
nature itself might be the villain the
elements<00:06:04.599> will<00:06:04.719> certainly<00:06:05.050> play<00:06:05.259> a<00:06:05.289> role<00:06:05.620> in

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:05.889 
elements will certainly play a role in

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:07.589 
elements will certainly play a role in
this<00:06:06.069> adventure<00:06:06.490> I<00:06:06.610> also<00:06:06.789> mentioned<00:06:07.240> earlier

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 
this adventure I also mentioned earlier

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:09.480 
this adventure I also mentioned earlier
how<00:06:07.810> I<00:06:07.840> thought<00:06:08.139> the<00:06:08.289> animation<00:06:08.830> itself<00:06:09.159> might

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
how I thought the animation itself might

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.459 
how I thought the animation itself might
lend<00:06:09.669> itself<00:06:10.000> to<00:06:10.180> the<00:06:10.270> plot<00:06:10.539> here's<00:06:11.259> what<00:06:11.409> I

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:11.469 
lend itself to the plot here's what I

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:13.529 
lend itself to the plot here's what I
mean<00:06:11.500> by<00:06:11.740> that<00:06:11.919> all<00:06:12.279> the<00:06:12.610> environments<00:06:13.330> like

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:13.539 
mean by that all the environments like

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:15.119 
mean by that all the environments like
that<00:06:13.779> branch<00:06:14.110> in<00:06:14.319> the<00:06:14.409> rain<00:06:14.560> at<00:06:14.680> the<00:06:14.740> beginning

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:15.129 
that branch in the rain at the beginning

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:17.610 
that branch in the rain at the beginning
look<00:06:15.580> freakin<00:06:16.240> beautiful<00:06:16.629> in<00:06:17.199> this<00:06:17.349> trailer

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
look freakin beautiful in this trailer

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.089 
look freakin beautiful in this trailer
what<00:06:18.279> doesn't<00:06:18.669> look<00:06:18.699> so<00:06:19.029> good<00:06:19.330> weirdly<00:06:19.930> is<00:06:20.650> the

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:21.099 
what doesn't look so good weirdly is the

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:23.519 
what doesn't look so good weirdly is the
dinosaurs<00:06:21.729> they<00:06:22.120> look<00:06:22.360> super<00:06:22.599> cartoony<00:06:23.379> and

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:23.529 
dinosaurs they look super cartoony and

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:25.589 
dinosaurs they look super cartoony and
Arlo<00:06:24.099> especially<00:06:24.819> it's<00:06:25.120> like<00:06:25.270> they<00:06:25.569> just

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:25.599 
Arlo especially it's like they just

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:28.469 
Arlo especially it's like they just
don't<00:06:26.020> fit<00:06:26.259> in<00:06:26.319> but<00:06:26.860> I<00:06:27.099> think<00:06:27.639> that<00:06:27.940> might<00:06:28.300> be

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 
don't fit in but I think that might be

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:29.040 
don't fit in but I think that might be
the<00:06:28.659> point

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
the point

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.080 
the point
Harlow<00:06:29.409> doesn't<00:06:29.830> fit<00:06:30.069> in<00:06:30.279> he<00:06:30.580> appears<00:06:30.940> to<00:06:31.000> be

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
Harlow doesn't fit in he appears to be

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.450 
Harlow doesn't fit in he appears to be
afraid<00:06:31.479> of<00:06:31.750> everything<00:06:32.289> we<00:06:32.800> don't<00:06:33.069> see<00:06:33.279> his

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
afraid of everything we don't see his

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.399 
afraid of everything we don't see his
family<00:06:33.729> at<00:06:34.089> all<00:06:34.120> he<00:06:34.690> is<00:06:34.750> consorting<00:06:35.380> with

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:35.409 
family at all he is consorting with

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:36.439 
family at all he is consorting with
humans

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:36.449 
humans

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:38.510 
humans
I<00:06:36.479> think<00:06:36.779> his<00:06:36.930> weird<00:06:37.199> animation<00:06:37.889> just<00:06:38.129> draws

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
I think his weird animation just draws

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.580 
I think his weird animation just draws
that<00:06:39.120> attention<00:06:39.809> to<00:06:39.990> the<00:06:40.110> fact<00:06:40.289> that<00:06:40.379> his

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590 
that attention to the fact that his

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.980 
that attention to the fact that his
character<00:06:41.099> is<00:06:41.249> an<00:06:41.699> outcast<00:06:42.240> but<00:06:42.569> it's<00:06:42.809> not

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
character is an outcast but it's not

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.140 
character is an outcast but it's not
just<00:06:43.169> him<00:06:43.409> it's<00:06:43.439> all<00:06:43.919> the<00:06:44.219> dinosaurs<00:06:44.789> I<00:06:44.999> mean

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
just him it's all the dinosaurs I mean

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.850 
just him it's all the dinosaurs I mean
they<00:06:45.240> all<00:06:45.419> look<00:06:45.449> weird<00:06:45.900> I<00:06:46.050> mean<00:06:46.169> not<00:06:46.319> as<00:06:46.439> weird

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
they all look weird I mean not as weird

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.640 
they all look weird I mean not as weird
but<00:06:47.279> weird<00:06:47.969> but<00:06:48.599> I<00:06:48.779> think<00:06:48.839> that's<00:06:49.319> again

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:49.650 
but weird but I think that's again

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.129 
but weird but I think that's again
intentional<00:06:50.490> this<00:06:50.819> is<00:06:51.029> the<00:06:51.180> story<00:06:51.419> of<00:06:51.509> what<00:06:51.930> if

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:52.139 
intentional this is the story of what if

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:54.499 
intentional this is the story of what if
the<00:06:52.319> meteor<00:06:52.710> didn't<00:06:53.430> hit<00:06:53.759> the<00:06:53.939> earth

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:54.509 
the meteor didn't hit the earth

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:57.860 
the meteor didn't hit the earth
so<00:06:54.809> yeah<00:06:55.740> the<00:06:56.159> dinosaurs<00:06:56.729> shouldn't<00:06:57.419> be<00:06:57.629> there

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
so yeah the dinosaurs shouldn't be there

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.929 
so yeah the dinosaurs shouldn't be there
right<00:06:58.169> now<00:06:58.379> this<00:06:58.650> is<00:06:58.889> a<00:06:58.919> time<00:06:59.219> past<00:06:59.580> which<00:06:59.909> they

00:06:59.929 --> 00:06:59.939 
right now this is a time past which they

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:02.239 
right now this is a time past which they
should<00:07:00.389> exist<00:07:00.839> and<00:07:01.050> the<00:07:01.439> juxtaposition<00:07:02.219> of

00:07:02.239 --> 00:07:02.249 
should exist and the juxtaposition of

00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:04.399 
should exist and the juxtaposition of
their<00:07:02.789> goofiness<00:07:03.240> versus<00:07:03.719> the<00:07:03.870> awesome

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:04.409 
their goofiness versus the awesome

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:06.079 
their goofiness versus the awesome
landscape<00:07:04.949> I<00:07:05.069> think<00:07:05.099> really<00:07:05.520> just<00:07:05.610> drives

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:06.089 
landscape I think really just drives

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:08.059 
landscape I think really just drives
