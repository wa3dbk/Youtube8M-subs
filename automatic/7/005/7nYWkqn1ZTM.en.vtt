semi-transparent white kind of looks

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.889 
semi-transparent white kind of looks
cheap<00:00:38.910> um<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.920> previous<00:00:41.129> video<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.940> did<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
cheap um in the previous video I did the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.260 
cheap um in the previous video I did the
articulation<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.950> inner<00:00:44.160> frame<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.910> I'm

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
articulation of the inner frame so I'm

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.819 
articulation of the inner frame so I'm
just<00:00:45.570> going<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.780> focus<00:00:46.020> on<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.500> difference

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
just going to focus on the difference

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.720 
just going to focus on the difference
between<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.280> one<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.789> regular<00:00:48.300> edition

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
between this one and the regular edition

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.569 
between this one and the regular edition
so<00:00:50.730> right<00:00:51.149> off<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.329> bat<00:00:52.160> you'll<00:00:53.160> notice<00:00:53.550> that

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
so right off the bat you'll notice that

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.270 
so right off the bat you'll notice that
the<00:00:54.120> wings<00:00:54.390> there's<00:00:54.870> two<00:00:55.140> different<00:00:55.410> tones<00:00:56.039> of

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
the wings there's two different tones of

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.950 
the wings there's two different tones of
white<00:00:56.489> that's<00:00:57.090> because<00:00:57.510> it's<00:00:57.719> different

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
white that's because it's different

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.270 
white that's because it's different
material<00:00:58.530> and<00:01:00.140> looks<00:01:01.140> like<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.469> dropped<00:01:01.770> one<00:01:02.100> of

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
material and looks like I dropped one of

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.760 
material and looks like I dropped one of
the<00:01:02.550> feathers<00:01:04.250> I'll<00:01:05.250> find<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.700> later<00:01:05.850> um<00:01:06.770> but

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.179 

can't<00:01:23.350> really<00:01:23.530> tell<00:01:23.860> in<00:01:24.009> the<00:01:24.100> camera<00:01:24.460> but<00:01:26.189> it's

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
can't really tell in the camera but it's

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:33.209 
can't really tell in the camera but it's
a<00:01:27.399> semi-transparent<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:31.350> one<00:01:32.350> issue<00:01:32.619> I<00:01:32.829> have

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:33.219 
a semi-transparent and one issue I have

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:35.429 
a semi-transparent and one issue I have
with<00:01:33.250> this<00:01:33.579> model<00:01:34.240> is<00:01:34.450> this<00:01:34.810> backpack<00:01:35.079> right

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
with this model is this backpack right

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.340 
with this model is this backpack right
here<00:01:35.679> that<00:01:36.100> connects<00:01:36.429> the<00:01:36.579> wings<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:38.020> kind

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
here that connects the wings it's kind

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.520 
here that connects the wings it's kind
of<00:01:38.500> loose<00:01:38.799> so<00:01:39.670> it's<00:01:39.850> really<00:01:40.000> hard<00:01:40.360> to<00:01:40.569> kind<00:01:41.470> of

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
of loose so it's really hard to kind of

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.319 
of loose so it's really hard to kind of
pose<00:01:41.770> these<00:01:42.390> little<00:01:43.649> wing<00:01:44.649> things<00:01:45.130> or<00:01:46.060> the

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.139 
wing feathers and then let's see what
else<00:01:52.770> out<00:01:53.770> this<00:01:54.069> one<00:01:54.280> actually<00:01:54.490> comes<00:01:54.849> with<00:01:55.030> a

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
else out this one actually comes with a

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.660 
else out this one actually comes with a
clear<00:01:57.030> clear<00:01:58.030> stand<00:01:58.649> which<00:01:59.649> I<00:01:59.860> put<00:02:00.280> over<00:02:00.429> the

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
clear clear stand which I put over the

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:08.219 
clear clear stand which I put over the
blue<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.659> it's<00:02:04.840> pretty<00:02:05.049> cool<00:02:06.780> that's<00:02:07.780> one<00:02:08.019> cool

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
blue so it's pretty cool that's one cool

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.859 
blue so it's pretty cool that's one cool
thing<00:02:08.289> about<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.799> stand<00:02:09.069> and<00:02:09.369> this<00:02:10.119> kit<00:02:10.539> the

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
thing about the stand and this kit the

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.759 
thing about the stand and this kit the
Pearl<00:02:11.079> edition<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:12.480> actually<00:02:13.480> broke<00:02:14.079> my<00:02:14.440> beef

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
Pearl edition I actually broke my beef

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.380 
Pearl edition I actually broke my beef
in<00:02:15.930> which<00:02:16.930> I<00:02:17.079> had<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.349> cement<00:02:17.709> it<00:02:17.860> back<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:19.060> be

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
in which I had to cement it back so be

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.800 
in which I had to cement it back so be
very<00:02:19.510> careful<00:02:19.870> when<00:02:20.230> you<00:02:20.380> build<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:20.769> um<00:02:21.810> or

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
very careful when you build it um or

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.660 
very careful when you build it um or
maybe<00:02:23.799> it's<00:02:23.980> because<00:02:24.099> it's<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.430> Pearl

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
maybe it's because it's the Pearl

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.830 
maybe it's because it's the Pearl
edition<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:25.150> it's<00:02:25.299> a<00:02:25.420> little<00:02:25.540> bit<00:02:25.630> more

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
edition so it's a little bit more

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.729 
edition so it's a little bit more
brittle<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:27.850> comes<00:02:28.150> with<00:02:28.359> the<00:02:28.389> beam<00:02:29.049> saber<00:02:29.560> a

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
brittle it comes with the beam saber a

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.120 
brittle it comes with the beam saber a
green<00:02:30.250> one<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:30.760> then<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:30.970> comes<00:02:31.120> with<00:02:31.359> the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
green one and then it comes with the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.340 
green one and then it comes with the
beam<00:02:33.130> rifle<00:02:33.639> but<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:34.660> didn't<00:02:34.930> build<00:02:35.079> it<00:02:35.170> because

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
beam rifle but I didn't build it because

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.120 
beam rifle but I didn't build it because
i'm<00:02:36.069> too<00:02:36.430> lazy<00:02:36.639> and<00:02:37.290> i'll<00:02:38.290> save<00:02:38.739> all<00:02:38.950> my

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
see what else this stand I guess very

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.940 
see what else this stand I guess very
similar<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.790> when<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.120> comes<00:03:12.360> with<00:03:12.950> original

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
similar to when that comes with original

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.560 
similar to when that comes with original
one<00:03:14.520> where<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:14.850> can<00:03:15.620> kind<00:03:16.620> of<00:03:16.710> lift<00:03:16.890> it<00:03:17.070> up<00:03:17.160> and

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
one where you can kind of lift it up and

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.060 
one where you can kind of lift it up and
change<00:03:18.570> it<00:03:18.720> into<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:19.020> different<00:03:19.590> position

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
change it into a different position

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.230 
change it into a different position
can't<00:03:20.850> really<00:03:21.030> see<00:03:21.210> it<00:03:21.300> right<00:03:21.510> here

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.490 

um<00:03:26.730> overall<00:03:27.730> this<00:03:28.000> model<00:03:28.480> is<00:03:28.630> a<00:03:28.750> little<00:03:29.380> bit

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
um overall this model is a little bit

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.310 
um overall this model is a little bit
smaller<00:03:29.770> than<00:03:29.890> a<00:03:30.990> regular<00:03:33.030> gun<00:03:34.030> down<00:03:34.240> I<00:03:34.510> only

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
smaller than a regular gun down I only

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:42.230 
smaller than a regular gun down I only
have<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.620> legs<00:03:35.830> here<00:03:36.040> this<00:03:36.970> is<00:03:37.120> a<00:03:37.150> Zeta<00:03:39.060> so

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.250 

yeah<00:03:43.240> actually<00:03:43.570> I<00:03:43.750> don't<00:03:43.840> know<00:03:43.960> what<00:03:44.140> to<00:03:44.230> say

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260

at this for this review um let's see

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.040 
at this for this review um let's see
what<00:03:48.370> else<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:51.790> hand<00:03:52.090> actually<00:03:52.630> have<00:03:52.780> pretty

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
what else the hand actually have pretty

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.880 
what else the hand actually have pretty
good<00:03:53.200> trip<00:03:54.150> so<00:03:55.150> far<00:03:55.180> I<00:03:55.690> haven't<00:03:55.930> test<00:03:56.320> the<00:03:56.500> beam

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
good trip so far I haven't test the beam

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:04.800 
good trip so far I haven't test the beam
rifle<00:03:57.370> yet<00:03:57.550> I<00:03:58.050> heard<00:03:59.050> it<00:03:59.260> has<00:03:59.440> issues<00:04:00.010> I<00:04:03.810> guess

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
rifle yet I heard it has issues I guess

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.750 
rifle yet I heard it has issues I guess
that's<00:04:05.020> it<00:04:05.140> for<00:04:05.200> now<00:04:05.530> since<00:04:05.980> I<00:04:06.310> don't<00:04:06.580> really

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
that's it for now since I don't really

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.990 
that's it for now since I don't really
know<00:04:06.970> what<00:04:07.180> else<00:04:07.330> to<00:04:07.450> say<00:04:07.950> so<00:04:08.950> here's<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.430> 360

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
know what else to say so here's the 360

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.430 
know what else to say so here's the 360
view

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.440 

so<00:04:18.040> you'll<00:04:18.190> notice<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.700> color<00:04:19.000> is<00:04:19.269> actually

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
so you'll notice the color is actually

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:29.090 
so you'll notice the color is actually
very<00:04:19.690> obvious

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.810 

that's<00:04:29.760> it<00:04:30.000> and<00:04:30.030> thanks<00:04:30.270> for<00:04:30.780> watching
