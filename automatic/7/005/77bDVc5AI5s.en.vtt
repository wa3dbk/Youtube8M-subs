softness<00:01:55.619> just<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.190> little<00:01:56.399> bit<00:01:56.489> I<00:01:56.520> don't<00:01:56.640> want

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
softness just a little bit I don't want

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.249 
softness just a little bit I don't want
it<00:01:56.940> too<00:01:57.149> soft<00:01:57.420> because<00:01:57.750> then<00:01:57.899> I'll<00:01:57.989> get<00:01:58.080> some

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
it too soft because then I'll get some

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.620 
it too soft because then I'll get some
haloing<00:01:58.709> around<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.160> and<00:01:59.399> I<00:02:00.000> can<00:02:00.209> go<00:02:00.330> in<00:02:00.479> and

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
haloing around it and I can go in and

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.710 
haloing around it and I can go in and
add<00:02:00.840> more<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:02.099> effect<00:02:02.429> as<00:02:02.580> well<00:02:02.819> however

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
add more to the effect as well however

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.410 
add more to the effect as well however
notice<00:02:04.410> if<00:02:04.619> I'm<00:02:04.800> adding<00:02:05.039> more<00:02:05.489> to<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.209> mat

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
then I end up getting these white spots

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.729 
then I end up getting these white spots
out<00:02:08.940> here<00:02:08.970> which<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.390> not<00:02:09.869> what<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.200> really<00:02:10.410> want

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
now if you get too far away from the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.860 
now if you get too far away from the
original<00:02:35.530> red<00:02:36.370> you're<00:02:37.000> gonna<00:02:37.120> see<00:02:37.360> some<00:02:37.569> red

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
inside the shirt let me zoom in a bit

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.899 
inside the shirt let me zoom in a bit
and<00:02:40.420> I'll<00:02:40.510> show<00:02:40.720> you<00:02:40.780> it's<00:02:41.049> not<00:02:41.140> quite<00:02:41.440> perfect

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
and I'll show you it's not quite perfect

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.100 
and I'll show you it's not quite perfect

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.300 
you can see that there's red around
there<00:02:44.200> although<00:02:44.470> it<00:02:44.590> doesn't<00:02:44.739> look<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:45.099> bad

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
there although it doesn't look so bad

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.890 
there although it doesn't look so bad
another<00:02:45.940> little<00:02:46.209> trick<00:02:46.360> here<00:02:46.540> is<00:02:46.569> I<00:02:46.659> can<00:02:46.780> turn

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
another little trick here is I can turn

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.660 
another little trick here is I can turn
up<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.170> top<00:02:47.379> a<00:02:47.409> little<00:02:47.680> bit<00:02:47.799> and<00:02:48.129> that<00:02:48.519> will

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
up the top a little bit and that will

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.050 
up the top a little bit and that will
soften<00:02:48.909> up<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.870> area<00:02:50.230> so<00:02:50.980> let<00:02:51.549> me<00:02:51.579> go<00:02:51.819> back

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
soften up the the area so let me go back

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.330 
soften up the the area so let me go back
so<00:02:52.269> I'm<00:02:52.390> not<00:02:52.569> so<00:02:52.780> much<00:02:52.810> of<00:02:53.019> a<00:02:53.290> distance<00:02:54.010> away

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
so I'm not so much of a distance away

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.680 
so I'm not so much of a distance away
from<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.670> original<00:02:55.120> color<00:02:55.329> and<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:55.660> looks

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
from the original color and it looks

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.300 
from the original color and it looks
more<00:02:56.019> natural<00:02:57.870> there's<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:58.930> nice<00:02:59.109> pink<00:02:59.410> so

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
that video again no tracking involved

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.670 
that video again no tracking involved
just<00:03:09.849> color<00:03:10.180> east<00:03:10.390> of<00:03:10.540> pulling<00:03:10.750> 18<00:03:13.379> all<00:03:14.379> right

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.619 
just color east of pulling 18 all right
the<00:03:14.829> next<00:03:15.040> trick<00:03:15.459> I<00:03:15.609> want<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.819> show<00:03:15.909> you<00:03:16.060> is<00:03:16.390> how

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
the next trick I want to show you is how

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.009 
the next trick I want to show you is how
you<00:03:17.230> can<00:03:17.349> isolate<00:03:17.560> that<00:03:18.099> red<00:03:18.340> shirt<00:03:18.640> and<00:03:19.030> make

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
you can isolate that red shirt and make

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.409 
you can isolate that red shirt and make
everything<00:03:20.319> else<00:03:20.590> just<00:03:20.980> black<00:03:21.459> and<00:03:21.669> white<00:03:21.790> so

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:22.419 
everything else just black and white so

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.390 
everything else just black and white so
what<00:03:22.840> I'm<00:03:22.930> gonna<00:03:23.019> do<00:03:23.200> is<00:03:23.380> keep<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.859> effect<00:03:24.160> as

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
what I'm gonna do is keep the effect as

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.000 
what I'm gonna do is keep the effect as
I<00:03:24.549> have<00:03:24.700> it<00:03:24.819> here<00:03:25.150> but<00:03:25.660> instead<00:03:26.290> of<00:03:26.560> changing

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
I have it here but instead of changing

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.470 
I have it here but instead of changing
the<00:03:27.310> hue<00:03:27.519> I'll<00:03:27.790> just<00:03:27.940> set<00:03:28.090> that<00:03:28.180> back<00:03:28.329> to<00:03:28.450> zero

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.860 
the hue I'll just set that back to zero
I'm<00:03:29.019> going<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.769> set<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.870> secondary

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.000 
I'm going to set the secondary
saturation<00:03:32.799> to<00:03:33.400> negative<00:03:33.760> 100<00:03:34.739> now<00:03:35.739> you<00:03:35.799> don't

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
saturation to negative 100 now you don't

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.800 
saturation to negative 100 now you don't
see<00:03:36.220> much<00:03:36.549> going<00:03:36.879> on<00:03:36.940> here<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.299> shirts<00:03:37.540> being
