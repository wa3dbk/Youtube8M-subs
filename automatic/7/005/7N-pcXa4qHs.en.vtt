00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:02.840
 the referee Posse escalated 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.859
 the crash is still trying to prevent the exclusion of his colleagues 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.460
 he presents the leader she plays a refereeing concept 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.849
 to reform 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.470
 the league does not agree on the concept of locking up the 49-year-old 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.539
 additional 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.289
 Kapsch one has nothing left to lose he goes to the public 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.880
 one should have been able to attend the presidium meeting on Wednesday 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.029
 Formally, the decision made by the women and men visibly everyone 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.949
 The two colleagues had stood in the apron 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.170
 exclude where she complains so in my view a Renner like 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.490
 Ai I did not have to replace personal motives with my two colleagues 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.110
 to declare solidarity 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.710
 This solidarity could cost him quite at a loss for his league career 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.380
 In his opinion, the actions of citizens are not legitimate 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.170
 From my point of view, the two colleagues have Kienbaum Euro 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.500
 so it would justify a passing courses 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.910
 excluded 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.640
 Erich Kratschmer sees himself and his colleagues as victims of the current 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.800
 Balance of power in the defense is 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.140
 in Panama one prints only with a basketball are like that 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.220
 that in fact percentages in the style of having some managers and concerns sparking 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.020
 that's what the club wants to say 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.210
 Immediately the mighty urgent water finally reunited so think that 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.280
 but then let it align because if you open your mouth about 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.720
 Lenie Wiedenest playoff meet 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.150
 alone that shows and that this measure also came through enforce points 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.470
 the one model drives the referee of the clubs and 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.800
 whose presidential managers are in no way given and who are waiting 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.950
 in the case of Abedi president he stands in his private life to the ladies club post 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.469
 Vienna

 be it brisk games to lead games says Karch 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.240
 a referee 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.990
 Kind of the crew of the Mr. Doctor Stiller guy there's the Flying Foxes 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.360
 percent 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.440
 he has to expect when the team loses its source 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.910
 Future possibilities were limited 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.070
 the Kapsch massively the objectivity of the referee meanwhile strong 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.709
 the fourth 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:10.870
 but even 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.270
 In the past few weeks, I have asserted myself on the 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.769
 matchfield 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.650
 in critical decisions to ask if this decision is now 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.440
 to meet the game fit 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.359
 the personal pity 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.769
 and if she gets that far you should say better 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.059
 I am no longer objective and I have to 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:33.029
 Second shines 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:36.999
 as examples, Gartner names the referee cast Strauss Evans 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:38.009
 and Harald Fischl 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:41.189
 and the powerful and 4 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.679
 the city they are easily Delon percent 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:47.119
 he was cup winner a week later 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:51.239
 and I can not judge what those subconscious actions are there 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.549
 published tents 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.549
