there's<00:01:41.369> no<00:01:41.490> black<00:01:41.700> there<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.299> then<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.810> lab

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
there's no black there and then the lab

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.410 
there's no black there and then the lab
stuff<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.740> all<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.009> testing<00:01:44.430> monitoring

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
stuff so all the testing monitoring

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.139 
stuff so all the testing monitoring
stuff<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:45.960> do<00:01:46.140> now<00:01:46.380> blood<00:01:47.280> lactate<00:01:47.460> vo2

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
stuff you can do now blood lactate vo2

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.789 
stuff you can do now blood lactate vo2
and<00:01:48.420> all<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.810> all<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.079> sort<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.350> stuff<00:01:49.590> so

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
and all and all that sort of stuff so

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.410 
and all and all that sort of stuff so
that's<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.280> massive<00:01:50.430> benefit<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.060> think<00:01:51.090> you
