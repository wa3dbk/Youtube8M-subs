00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
linemates for sure midpoint of the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.810 
linemates for sure midpoint of the
season<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.039> team<00:00:29.279> where<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.519> thought<00:00:29.670> it

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
season is this team where you thought it

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.840 
season is this team where you thought it
would<00:00:29.880> be<00:00:30.949> probably<00:00:31.949> somewhere<00:00:32.340> around<00:00:32.399> where

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
would be probably somewhere around where

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.660 
would be probably somewhere around where
we<00:00:33.030> had<00:00:33.180> I'd<00:00:34.079> hoped<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.440> be<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.770> mean<00:00:37.010> you<00:00:38.010> you

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
we had I'd hoped to be I mean you you

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.369 
we had I'd hoped to be I mean you you
want<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.940> be<00:00:39.180> playing<00:00:39.329> playoff<00:00:39.780> games<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.200> home

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
want to be playing playoff games in home

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.130 
want to be playing playoff games in home
ice<00:00:40.530> if<00:00:40.800> possible<00:00:41.610> but<00:00:41.760> but<00:00:42.690> we've<00:00:42.899> set

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
ice if possible but but we've set

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.100 
ice if possible but but we've set
ourselves<00:00:43.260> up<00:00:43.680> now<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.219> can<00:00:45.079> with<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
ourselves up now that we can with a

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.420 
ourselves up now that we can with a
solid<00:00:46.500> second<00:00:46.800> half<00:00:46.950> will<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
solid second half will be in the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.970 
solid second half will be in the
playoffs<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.270> now<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.110> think<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.710> start

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
playoffs and and now I think you start

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.670 
playoffs and and now I think you start
striving<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:51.780> really<00:00:52.050> compete<00:00:52.410> against

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
striving to to really compete against

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.799 
striving to to really compete against
some<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.920> those<00:00:52.980> top<00:00:53.250> teams<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.789> teams<00:00:54.600> are

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
some of those top teams and teams are

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.200 
some of those top teams and teams are
like<00:00:55.140> Boston<00:00:55.620> New<00:00:55.739> York<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.280> those<00:00:56.789> guys<00:00:57.000> if

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
like Boston New York and those guys if

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.900 
like Boston New York and those guys if
we<00:00:57.390> want<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.949> eventually<00:00:58.949> get<00:00:59.280> into<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.670> top

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
we want to eventually get into that top

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.479 
we want to eventually get into that top
tier<00:01:03.350> separation<00:01:04.350> between<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.650> two<00:01:04.949> teams<00:01:05.159> to

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
tier separation between the two teams to

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.280 
tier separation between the two teams to
arrivals<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.420> guys<00:01:06.600> think<00:01:06.869> about<00:01:06.990> that

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
arrivals you guys think about that

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.320 
arrivals you guys think about that
getting<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.220> know<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> 10-point<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.060> change

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
getting you know a 10-point to change

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.690 
getting you know a 10-point to change
yeah<00:01:10.200> absolutely<00:01:10.530> um<00:01:11.189> they're<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> team<00:01:12.150> that

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
yeah absolutely um they're a team that

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.609 
yeah absolutely um they're a team that
they've<00:01:14.700> had<00:01:14.729> some<00:01:15.060> big<00:01:15.689> injury<00:01:16.049> problems<00:01:16.259> and

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
they've had some big injury problems and

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.810 
they've had some big injury problems and
I<00:01:16.680> think<00:01:16.890> they're<00:01:17.009> still<00:01:17.220> pretty<00:01:17.340> banged<00:01:17.670> up

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
I think they're still pretty banged up

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.990 
I think they're still pretty banged up
regularly<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.560> mean<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.340> important<00:01:20.820> to

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
regularly and I mean it's important to

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.570 
regularly and I mean it's important to
capitalize<00:01:21.750> when<00:01:22.220> when<00:01:23.220> teams<00:01:23.430> are

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
capitalize when when teams are

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.880 
capitalize when when teams are
short-handed<00:01:23.850> like<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.710> want

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
short-handed like that and and you want

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.679 
short-handed like that and and you want
to<00:01:25.950> distance<00:01:26.250> yourself<00:01:26.700> as<00:01:27.060> much<00:01:27.240> as<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.479> can

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
to distance yourself as much as you can

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.960 
to distance yourself as much as you can
from<00:01:27.750> them<00:01:28.020> because<00:01:28.579> again<00:01:29.579> they're<00:01:29.790> probably

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
from them because again they're probably

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.880 
from them because again they're probably
didn't<00:01:30.689> get<00:01:30.780> healthy<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.290> probably<00:01:31.680> be

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
didn't get healthy and probably be

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.899 
didn't get healthy and probably be
playing<00:01:32.130> some<00:01:32.280> better<00:01:32.400> hockey<00:01:32.579> on<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
playing some better hockey on the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.210 
playing some better hockey on the
stretch

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.950 

to<00:01:37.310> how<00:01:37.490> difficult<00:01:38.030> it<00:01:38.150> is<00:01:38.240> to<00:01:38.300> get<00:01:38.510> things<00:01:38.750> in

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
to how difficult it is to get things in

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.960 
to how difficult it is to get things in
the<00:01:39.050> second<00:01:39.380> two<00:01:39.860> makeups<00:01:40.190> around<00:01:40.430> it's<00:01:40.790> tough

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
the second two makeups around it's tough

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.060 
the second two makeups around it's tough
yeah<00:01:41.240> especially<00:01:41.450> with<00:01:42.380> all<00:01:42.470> the<00:01:42.530> three-point

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
yeah especially with all the three-point

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.910 
yeah especially with all the three-point
games<00:01:43.340> and<00:01:43.700> and<00:01:44.140> it<00:01:45.140> seems<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.500> second<00:01:45.800> half

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
games and and it seems the second half

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.380 
games and and it seems the second half
of<00:01:46.010> the<00:01:46.100> earth<00:01:46.220> is<00:01:46.370> you<00:01:46.580> play<00:01:46.790> even<00:01:47.000> more<00:01:47.060> in

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
of the earth is you play even more in

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.380 
of the earth is you play even more in
conference<00:01:47.960> so<00:01:48.230> last<00:01:48.980> year<00:01:49.130> I<00:01:49.730> mean<00:01:50.030> we<00:01:50.240> were

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
conference so last year I mean we were

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.540 
conference so last year I mean we were
winning<00:01:51.140> four<00:01:51.530> out<00:01:51.590> of<00:01:51.650> five<00:01:51.800> games<00:01:52.130> it<00:01:52.370> felt

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
winning four out of five games it felt

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.580 
winning four out of five games it felt
like<00:01:52.730> and<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.180> only<00:01:53.780> gaining<00:01:53.990> a<00:01:54.170> point<00:01:54.410> or<00:01:54.560> two

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
like and and only gaining a point or two

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.410 
like and and only gaining a point or two
on<00:01:54.800> teams<00:01:55.010> so<00:01:55.340> it<00:01:55.490> can<00:01:56.270> get<00:01:56.360> pretty

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
on teams so it can get pretty

team<00:03:53.510> is<00:03:53.630> trying<00:03:53.780> to<00:03:53.900> or<00:03:54.230> a<00:03:54.530> lot<00:03:54.800> of<00:03:54.920> teams<00:03:55.069> try

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
team is trying to or a lot of teams try

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.320 
team is trying to or a lot of teams try
and<00:03:55.340> forge<00:03:55.520> an<00:03:55.640> identity<00:03:56.000> throughout<00:03:56.209> the

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
and forge an identity throughout the

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.280 
and forge an identity throughout the
course<00:03:56.510> this<00:03:56.660> season<00:03:56.900> it<00:03:56.959> seems<00:03:57.110> like<00:03:57.200> this

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
course this season it seems like this

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.600 
course this season it seems like this
team's<00:03:57.500> got<00:03:57.709> an<00:03:57.830> identity<00:03:58.190> with<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.400> speed

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
team's got an identity with the speed

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.820 
team's got an identity with the speed
game<00:03:58.880> are<00:03:59.480> you<00:03:59.630> is<00:03:59.810> that<00:03:59.900> kind<00:04:00.260> of<00:04:00.319> a<00:04:00.500> correct

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
game are you is that kind of a correct

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.140 
game are you is that kind of a correct
assessment<00:04:01.069> that<00:04:01.370> this<00:04:01.489> team<00:04:01.670> is<00:04:01.730> comfortable

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
assessment that this team is comfortable

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.900 
assessment that this team is comfortable
with<00:04:02.239> this<00:04:02.330> identity<00:04:02.720> network<00:04:03.850> yeah<00:04:04.850> I<00:04:05.090> think

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
with this identity network yeah I think

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.340 
with this identity network yeah I think
that<00:04:07.910> is<00:04:08.090> going<00:04:08.269> to<00:04:08.360> be<00:04:08.420> our<00:04:08.540> identity<00:04:08.930> look<00:04:09.260> at

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
that is going to be our identity look at

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.330 
that is going to be our identity look at
her<00:04:09.440> team<00:04:09.590> we're<00:04:09.709> not<00:04:09.860> going<00:04:10.070> to<00:04:10.130> overpower

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
her team we're not going to overpower

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.570 
her team we're not going to overpower
teams<00:04:11.120> we're<00:04:11.510> not<00:04:11.830> super<00:04:12.830> physical<00:04:13.310> I<00:04:13.400> mean

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
teams we're not super physical I mean

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.770 
teams we're not super physical I mean
we've<00:04:13.730> got<00:04:13.760> some<00:04:14.030> guys<00:04:14.209> who<00:04:14.360> play<00:04:14.540> physical

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
we've got some guys who play physical

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.599 
we've got some guys who play physical
game<00:04:15.170> but<00:04:15.380> but<00:04:16.130> we're<00:04:16.310> going<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:16.519> be

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
game but but we're going to be

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.460 
game but but we're going to be
successful<00:04:16.910> by<00:04:17.299> skating<00:04:17.870> winning<00:04:18.290> races

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
successful by skating winning races

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.460 
successful by skating winning races
Tupac's<00:04:19.329> and<00:04:20.329> I<00:04:20.690> mean<00:04:20.840> you<00:04:20.930> can<00:04:21.079> still<00:04:21.320> win

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
Tupac's and I mean you can still win

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.140 
Tupac's and I mean you can still win
battles<00:04:21.859> with<00:04:21.950> with<00:04:22.460> speed<00:04:22.760> you<00:04:22.970> don't

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
battles with with speed you don't

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.760 
battles with with speed you don't
necessarily<00:04:23.360> have<00:04:23.780> to<00:04:23.870> be<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.020> biggest

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
necessarily have to be the biggest

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.580 
necessarily have to be the biggest
strongest<00:04:24.950> guy<00:04:25.250> on<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.490> ice<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:26.840> I<00:04:26.960> think<00:04:27.200> for

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
strongest guy on the ice and I think for

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.270 
strongest guy on the ice and I think for
the<00:04:27.620> most<00:04:27.770> part<00:04:27.919> we've<00:04:28.820> been<00:04:28.970> doing<00:04:29.180> that
