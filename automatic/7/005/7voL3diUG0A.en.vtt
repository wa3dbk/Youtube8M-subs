left same concept so for me four three

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.620 
left same concept so for me four three
two<00:02:20.220> one<00:02:20.430> is<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.700> lot<00:02:21.090> better<00:02:21.620> play<00:02:22.620> wise<00:02:23.630> to

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
two one is a lot better play wise to

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.540 
two one is a lot better play wise to
play<00:02:24.840> ronaldo<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.320> you<00:02:25.530> know<00:02:25.650> if<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:26.340> was<00:02:26.520> to

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
play ronaldo and you know if you was to

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.240 
play ronaldo and you know if you was to
get<00:02:26.850> him<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.270> put<00:02:27.540> him<00:02:27.690> left<00:02:28.020> mid<00:02:28.290> i<00:02:28.500> just

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
get him and put him left mid i just

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.150 
get him and put him left mid i just
think<00:02:29.400> it's<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.670> waste<00:02:29.820> really<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:31.110> is<00:02:31.470> it

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
think it's a waste really it is it

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.070 
think it's a waste really it is it
really<00:02:32.460> is<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.580> waste<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.390> use<00:02:33.540> ronaldo<00:02:33.960> as<00:02:34.050> a

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
really is a waste to use ronaldo as a

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.620 
really is a waste to use ronaldo as a
left<00:02:34.320> mid<00:02:34.470> again<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.070> same<00:02:35.310> i<00:02:35.640> think<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.480> same
