00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.840
 well the first thing we do is moisten 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.840
 the hair cut 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.920
 and we unravel it 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.800
 to make it much easier for us 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.890
 this cut is very simple 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.980
 and very fast a cut 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.149
 and I call it the catwalk is a cut 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.149
 very very very fast 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.570
 front let's comb 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.970
 We have divided all the hair by the 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.370
 center 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.750
 we have lived through the center until the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.760
 the cutting crown 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.760
 all very pegadito 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.740
 to the scalp 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.950
 everything and we are receiving with the palm of 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.540
 hand 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.790
 we comb and hold 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.930
 for us to be very very well 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.930
 very well combed 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.320
 we are perfect 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.540
 we bring it exactly to the middle of the 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.290
 nape 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.290
 behind 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.590
 we hold the pigtail 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.590
 up to the ponytail 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.549
 and that 's the one we're going to cut well at 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.860
 Sen is important in this case because 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.409
 can also be on the side if one wants 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.890
 one side shorter than the other in this 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:57.800
 case what we have very even 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.190
 observe that in the back of the 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.510
 I'm doing a little pigtail 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.040
 lift I'm not cutting 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.810
 directly 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.330
 at 0 degrees it has a small elevation 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.330
 three languages just cut it 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.580
 and retiring for you to see the 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.319
 process 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.999
 it's supposed to be much faster but 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.999
 making slow for you 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.250
 true 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.250
 even retiring hair 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.090
 Be careful not to cut it 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.680
 and then we let go of our hair and 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.440
 let's comb it to its normal state 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.140
 as you would think any 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.790
 sole person 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.430
 and look at the scale it also does not 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.150
 is giving 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.150
 in agreement 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.860
 this or even 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:17.710
 we are perfectly even 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.130
 and we always measure it in front to know 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.500
 if we stay 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.900
 in synchrony on one side with the other is 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.129
 perfect according 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.129
 why 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.610
 we take the little horse 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.540
 this same lock the one that is 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.769
 sticking out 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.769
 which is excelling 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.670
 and I just love going out to cut 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.569
 then here we have our 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.950
 final result because it is a strong cut 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.830
 with the tips very strong towards 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:14.870
 forward and back s 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:17.910
 it is falling with nothing effect 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:21.650
 I hope it cost them and then we 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.650
 we see the next video that you enjoy
