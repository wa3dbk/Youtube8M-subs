00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
me was a big package here about 13 or 14

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.150 
me was a big package here about 13 or 14
3c<00:00:44.219> kaulitz<00:00:44.670> which<00:00:44.940> most<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.020> them<00:00:46.200> at<00:00:47.100> least

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
3c kaulitz which most of them at least

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.369 
3c kaulitz which most of them at least
to<00:00:47.460> my<00:00:47.610> eyes<00:00:47.820> seemed<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.629> off<00:00:48.809> sizes

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
to my eyes seemed to be in the off sizes

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.610 
to my eyes seemed to be in the off sizes
of<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.860> 32nd<00:00:50.520> 64<00:00:51.090> ones<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.289> don't<00:00:52.559> have

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
of the 32nd 64 ones that I don't have

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.279 
of the 32nd 64 ones that I don't have
and<00:00:53.059> so<00:00:54.059> with<00:00:54.449> these<00:00:54.600> they'll<00:00:54.870> be<00:00:54.960> able<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.199> do

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
and so with these they'll be able to do

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.200 
and so with these they'll be able to do
a<00:00:55.320> lot<00:00:55.530> more<00:00:55.559> call<00:00:56.100> at<00:00:56.219> work<00:00:56.370> which<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.879> great

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
a lot more call at work which is great

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.060 
a lot more call at work which is great
and<00:00:58.010> he<00:00:59.010> also<00:00:59.190> sent<00:00:59.579> me<00:00:59.699> over<00:01:00.410> this<00:01:01.410> which<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.920> a

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
and he also sent me over this which is a

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.170 
and he also sent me over this which is a
threading<00:01:02.670> stop<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.149> clamps<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:05.180> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
threading stop that clamps to the the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.530 
threading stop that clamps to the the
cross<00:01:06.420> slide<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.020> can<00:01:07.799> set<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:09.060> stop

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
cross slide and you can set the the stop

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.450 
cross slide and you can set the the stop
point<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.930> your<00:01:09.990> threats<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.560> instead<00:01:11.400> of

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
point of your threats so instead of

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.670 
point of your threats so instead of
going<00:01:11.700> by<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.000> dial<00:01:12.390> when<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.720> when<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.140> turn

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
going by a dial when you when you turn

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.550 
going by a dial when you when you turn
into<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.189> zero<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.390> set<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.229> go

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
into the zero you just set this and go

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.230 
into the zero you just set this and go
until<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.070> stops<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:17.759> automatically

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
until it stops and you can automatically

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.580 
until it stops and you can automatically
get<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.750> every<00:01:18.900> time<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.470> way

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
get it to it every time so that way

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.570 
get it to it every time so that way
there<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.860> have<00:01:19.950> less<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.280> chance<00:01:20.310> of

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
there you have less of a chance of

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.490 
there you have less of a chance of
screwing<00:01:20.850> up<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.659> will<00:01:21.869> show<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.350> use<00:01:22.470> of

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
screwing up and I will show the use of

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.410 
screwing up and I will show the use of
this<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:23.340> one<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.790> videos<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:25.040> let<00:01:26.040> me

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
this on one of the videos and let me

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.819

I kind of want to get a set of straight
beginner<00:02:54.609> beginner<00:02:54.790> things<00:02:55.329> going<00:02:55.750> on<00:02:55.870> like

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
beginner beginner things going on like

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.839 
beginner beginner things going on like
exactly<00:02:57.639> what<00:02:58.329> controls<00:02:58.750> do<00:02:58.989> what<00:02:59.790> how<00:03:00.790> the

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
exactly what controls do what how the

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.750 
exactly what controls do what how the
threading<00:03:01.389> dial<00:03:01.629> works<00:03:02.129> kind<00:03:03.129> of<00:03:03.189> speeds<00:03:03.549> and

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
threading dial works kind of speeds and

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.729 
threading dial works kind of speeds and
feeds<00:03:03.790> how<00:03:04.629> to<00:03:04.689> figure<00:03:04.930> those<00:03:05.109> out<00:03:05.319> just<00:03:05.590> on

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
feeds how to figure those out just on

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.159 
feeds how to figure those out just on
the<00:03:05.859> fly<00:03:06.069> of<00:03:06.209> how<00:03:07.209> it<00:03:07.659> goes<00:03:07.840> with<00:03:08.139> that<00:03:08.169> and

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:10.169 
the fly of how it goes with that and

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:13.379 
the fly of how it goes with that and
just<00:03:11.169> back<00:03:11.709> to<00:03:11.949> basics<00:03:12.400> you<00:03:12.730> know<00:03:12.819> turning

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
just back to basics you know turning

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:16.949 
just back to basics you know turning
threading<00:03:14.310> facing<00:03:15.310> and<00:03:15.849> things<00:03:16.569> like<00:03:16.719> that<00:03:16.780> I

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
threading facing and things like that I

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.119 
threading facing and things like that I
kind<00:03:17.290> of<00:03:17.379> did<00:03:17.530> it<00:03:17.620> with<00:03:17.769> the<00:03:18.269> with<00:03:19.269> the<00:03:20.129> tool

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
kind of did it with the with the tool

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.520 
kind of did it with the with the tool
grinding<00:03:21.609> video<00:03:21.909> and<00:03:22.840> I<00:03:23.019> kind<00:03:23.229> of<00:03:23.259> want<00:03:23.409> to<00:03:23.470> get

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
start at the beginning with the controls

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.539 
start at the beginning with the controls
of<00:03:31.359> the<00:03:31.509> lathe<00:03:31.689> and<00:03:31.959> and<00:03:32.169> and<00:03:32.769> step<00:03:33.040> on<00:03:33.220> up<00:03:33.400> in

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
of the lathe and and and step on up in

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.189 
of the lathe and and and step on up in
increments<00:03:33.759> like<00:03:34.509> I<00:03:34.629> said<00:03:34.689> that's<00:03:34.959> not<00:03:35.139> going

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:35.199 
increments like I said that's not going

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:38.099 
increments like I said that's not going
to<00:03:35.379> be<00:03:36.030> we<00:03:37.030> got<00:03:37.239> the<00:03:37.359> week<00:03:37.509> at<00:03:37.689> the<00:03:37.810> week<00:03:37.959> of

to be we got the week at the week of
video<00:03:38.349> of<00:03:38.500> that<00:03:38.620> because<00:03:38.769> I<00:03:38.859> know<00:03:38.919> that's

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:39.159 
video of that because I know that's

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:40.679 
video of that because I know that's
going<00:03:39.280> to<00:03:39.370> get<00:03:39.459> boring<00:03:39.790> for<00:03:39.819> a<00:03:40.060> lot<00:03:40.239> more<00:03:40.540> the
