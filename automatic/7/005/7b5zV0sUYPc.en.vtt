so from I think two videos ago I did a

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.089 
so from I think two videos ago I did a
Q&amp;A<00:00:30.330> video<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.289> video<00:00:31.529> somebody

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
Dunkin Donuts and my response was

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.880 
Dunkin Donuts and my response was
Starbucks<00:00:37.410> but<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.610> made<00:00:39.090> me<00:00:39.540> think<00:00:40.050> about<00:00:40.410> a

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
Starbucks but that made me think about a

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.880 
Starbucks but that made me think about a
video<00:00:41.489> because<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.270> my<00:00:42.390> Q&amp;A<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:43.170> showed<00:00:43.739> you

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
guys how the barista spelled my name

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.690 
guys how the barista spelled my name
completely<00:00:46.500> wrong<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.129> how<00:00:47.219> they<00:00:47.340> never<00:00:47.489> get

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
completely wrong and how they never get

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.810 
completely wrong and how they never get
my<00:00:47.820> name<00:00:48.030> correct<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.770> inspired<00:00:50.190> me<00:00:50.309> to

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820
