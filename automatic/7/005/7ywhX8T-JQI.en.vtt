back<00:00:13.230> into<00:00:13.410> town<00:00:13.650> obviously<00:00:14.400> as<00:00:14.490> we've<00:00:14.700> seen

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
back into town obviously as we've seen

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.790 
back into town obviously as we've seen
in<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.059> beginning<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.540> this<00:00:15.719> recent<00:00:16.470> season

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
in the beginning of this recent season

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.970 
in the beginning of this recent season
and<00:00:16.949> then<00:00:17.550> he<00:00:18.090> kills<00:00:18.539> all<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.810> neo-nazis<00:00:19.680> he

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
and then he kills all the neo-nazis he

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.620 
and then he kills all the neo-nazis he
kind<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.430> takes<00:00:20.580> his<00:00:20.850> revenge<00:00:21.060> on<00:00:21.420> them<00:00:21.570> I

think the main neo-nazi will be killed
in<00:00:23.550> some<00:00:24.000> kind<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.300> gruesome<00:00:24.930> fashion<00:00:25.380> like

Jessie's ex-girlfriend so yeah that's
what<00:00:59.910> I<00:00:59.940> think<00:01:00.210> will<00:01:00.329> happen<00:01:00.480> then<00:01:00.690> at<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> end

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
what I think will happen then at the end

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.020 
what I think will happen then at the end
I<00:01:01.230> think<00:01:01.260> Walt<00:01:01.649> dies<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.670> course<00:01:02.699> my

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
I think Walt dies this is of course my

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.539 
I think Walt dies this is of course my
prediction<00:01:03.600> but<00:01:03.840> I'm<00:01:04.559> pretty<00:01:04.890> right<00:01:05.280> with

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
prediction but I'm pretty right with

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.280 
prediction but I'm pretty right with
these<00:01:05.700> kind<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.090> things<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.689> kind<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:06.960> grasp

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
these kind of things I can kind of grasp

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.500 
these kind of things I can kind of grasp
the<00:01:07.650> mind<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.159> movie<00:01:08.549> producers<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.360> writers

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the mind of movie producers and writers

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.960 
the mind of movie producers and writers
I<00:01:09.930> feel<00:01:10.439> like<00:01:10.590> I'm<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.640> be<00:01:11.850> at<00:01:11.939> least

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
I feel like I'm going to be at least

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.420 
I feel like I'm going to be at least
seventy<00:01:12.840> percent<00:01:13.020> right<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:13.770> my<00:01:13.890> prediction

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
seventy percent right with my prediction

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.700 
seventy percent right with my prediction
here<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.150> if<00:01:15.240> I'm<00:01:15.360> not<00:01:15.420> hopefully<00:01:16.200> breaking

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
here and if I'm not hopefully breaking

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.160 
here and if I'm not hopefully breaking
bad<00:01:17.070> doesn't<00:01:17.460> pull<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> dexter<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.270> us<00:01:18.450> not<00:01:19.080> to

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
bad doesn't pull a dexter on us not to

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.890 
bad doesn't pull a dexter on us not to
say<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.439> dexter<00:01:19.770> finale<00:01:19.890> was<00:01:20.310> all<00:01:20.549> of

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
say that dexter finale was all of

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.690 
say that dexter finale was all of
incredibly<00:01:21.900> horrible<00:01:22.200> but<00:01:22.650> let's<00:01:23.189> be<00:01:23.340> honest

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
incredibly horrible but let's be honest

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.719 
incredibly horrible but let's be honest
here<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.180> uh<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.990> was<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.950> know<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.159> wasn't<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
here it uh it was you know it wasn't the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.460 
here it uh it was you know it wasn't the
best<00:01:26.970> they<00:01:27.420> could<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.780> done<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.200> little

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
best they could have done a little

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.499 
best they could have done a little
better<00:01:28.770> than<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.250> but<00:01:29.759> here's<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.180> game

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
better than that but here's this game

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.109 
better than that but here's this game
and<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.229> basically<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.909> platforming<00:01:32.909> game

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
and this is basically a platforming game

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.210 
and this is basically a platforming game
I<00:01:33.329> mean<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.869> looks<00:01:34.079> like<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> simple<00:01:34.530> flash<00:01:34.950> game

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
I mean it looks like a simple flash game

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.830 
I mean it looks like a simple flash game
but<00:01:35.430> it's<00:01:35.549> actually<00:01:35.700> pretty<00:01:36.180> elaborate

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
but it's actually pretty elaborate

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.569 
but it's actually pretty elaborate
there's<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.170> lot<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.500> stuff<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.070> do<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.400> there's

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
there's a lot of stuff to do and there's

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.760 
there's a lot of stuff to do and there's
a<00:01:38.670> lot<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.939> levels<00:01:39.270> it's<00:01:39.659> like<00:01:39.869> several<00:01:40.170> dozen

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
a lot of levels it's like several dozen

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.740

rich than you'd expect from a simple
flash<00:02:38.709> game<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:39.190> mean<00:02:39.579> really<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:40.060> isn't<00:02:40.239> a

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
flash game I mean really it isn't a

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.390 
flash game I mean really it isn't a
simple<00:02:40.659> flash<00:02:40.989> game<00:02:41.200> it<00:02:41.319> looks<00:02:41.379> like<00:02:41.859> it<00:02:42.129> but

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
simple flash game it looks like it but

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.069 
simple flash game it looks like it but
the<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.879> gameplay<00:02:43.299> is<00:02:43.359> rich<00:02:43.569> enough<00:02:43.599> where<00:02:43.989> it

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
the the gameplay is rich enough where it

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.140 
the the gameplay is rich enough where it
could<00:02:44.170> easily<00:02:44.349> be<00:02:44.769> like<00:02:44.980> one<00:02:45.159> of<00:02:45.189> those<00:02:45.400> indie

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150
