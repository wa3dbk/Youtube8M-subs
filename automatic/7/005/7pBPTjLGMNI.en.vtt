00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.880
 bye 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.910
 Now I'm going to talk about rock vale is the 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:17.110
 second game this week already 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.820
 we won in the first round when 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.130
 jackson I remember how fat he talks 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.720
 with the coach of the is they told me not to 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.550
 they had to bathe us jacques 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.289
 more important things to bathe and what 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.720
 that against since you just had to know 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.109
 play this time I'm sure we're going 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.480
 to win 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.250
 jacques is going to be a difficult game is 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.160
 very important 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.800
 it's going to be difficult because 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.280
 good 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.809
 they will see their fans to see their fans but 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.610
 but being a difficult match because 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.260
 the others were many and the zones 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.910
 we win we put 20 and in case of 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.140
 win tie always go to 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.350
 be above rocks then 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.140
 we would have the playoffs pretty 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:02.089
 pretty pretty well pretty good 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:05.390
 but not sure and of course if they want 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.680
 get in there if you want to have it then if 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.690
 you want to be in the playoffs from 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.860
 then they have to earn us but in 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.680
 case of a tie because we would have a 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.409
 tie-break to see rocks are very team 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.899
 basic abc is very basic 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.439
 I've been seeing what I 've been with 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:23.179
 the hiding and good seems to be that 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:28.810
 they are preparing quite thoroughly against 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:34.280
 us but still I'm confident 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:36.290
 I think if we can get a mushroom 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.520
 with which we are comfortable in the stage 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.450
 we're going to win so it's not that 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.729
 basically 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.710
 with which we have better law than them if 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.140
 we get to the law because I think 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.810
 that our execution when we 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.670
 we count as 5 and such is going to be better and 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.860
 especially if we play those stages this 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.290
 approach I'm going to raise that you can see 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.320
 and they are very passive they are so 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:09.630
 liabilities that surely the game arrives 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.630
 to the law and then we will see
