00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.029
 Hello 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.120
 how everything goes like it is for everyone but 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.200
 as 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.840
 Y 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.389
 in the new video of soca like my 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.100
 channel 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:19.420
 explaining some things of minecraft 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.260
 I'm going to teach you in this video 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.940
 how is it done how to shoot and how 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.010
 use dispensers well 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.580
 this little thing 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.580
 thinkers 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.740
 They found here in section 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.470
 rest 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.960
 the dispensers that are used to throw 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.660
 arrows to produce objects 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.390
 pressing a button 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.520
 always a lot of things but what I 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.870
 the most it occupies is to defend my house or 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.430
 my things 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.410
 or to defend something precious that does not 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.460
 I want you to approach the monsters and 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.460
 this becomes similar 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.170
 the corridor to defend it to the purest 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.300
 'short style because the truth is that 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.170
 after you reload it with arrow and it 's 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.170
 pretty tedious 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.420
 or indiana jones or not like that 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.619
 a shuttle hall or if you manage to be 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.950
 One-sided no more with dispensers 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.530
 they do the joel community something like 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.299
 rod 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.299
 makes the hollywood movie more 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.840
 what they have to do is 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.840
 turn on three dates 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.260
 it's not enough 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.580
 but they have to do was ride 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.580
 dispenser with the right click 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.370
 will begin to charge the two 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.370
 they start to grab 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.100
 simply this is quite simple 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.840
 just you to activate with 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.840
 pressure plate pressure 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.660
 that is all 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.660
 the pressure plates will activate 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:35.610
 and to infinity and beyond 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.280
 you can do it but to go ordered the 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.970
 I work to carry all the 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.800
 dispensers conflicts would be quite 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.800
 boring if you do that 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.470
 this is easy this is very easy to load 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.989
 dispenser and place it and obviously if 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.879
 you want it to happen more piola you what 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:00.519
 you can place with stones that arrive or 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.519
 not affect the dispensers at all 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.590
 the other way the other way is to place 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.390
 a dispenser if there was a shot 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.390
 you only place a dispenser 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.849
 the thinker 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.230
 and here you put a 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.800
 and will shoot 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.300
 and I'm going to tell you one thing for and for 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.150
 shoot arrows with fire the truth that 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.250
 It is also quite easy because it is 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.980
 flexed and I'm going they will not hurt 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.950
 So much for what we need 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.040
 to be flex with fire is 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:53.080
 in lava lava you need a goal of 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.080
 block any stone is not going to be 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.530
 with two for bass will be fine 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.530
 to 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.200
 If I leave the cow, it will run when 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.970
 leave the square in a box is going to 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.190
 run two frames forward or 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.790
 towards the side that has the option of walking 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.190
 the work 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:44.990
 then you simply do this 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.990
 and you leave the lava here 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.390
 to lower the lava and then this is 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.860
 quite as obvious if a date for 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.860
 speak for the lava you will learn 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.100
 then leave them the cow apart with the 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.630
 lava are not going to approach the dispenser 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.790
 and you can leave this almost like 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.310
 covered and how 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.990
 with stones here then so that 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.360
 do not approach as well as a kind of 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:15.860
 bunker so they do not come near 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:18.759
 and you then start shooting and the 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.759
 dates are going to continue 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.099
 look the dates are going to come out with fire 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.610
 and obviously there are dates that go to 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.610
 be more hurt 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.289
 as they see it is pretty nobody cares 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.289
 of these dispensers 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.840
 with this simple explanation just 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.460
 raising my channel your minecraft videos 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.810
 from the web 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.810
 of the rule every win 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:53.539
 until the next video goodbye
