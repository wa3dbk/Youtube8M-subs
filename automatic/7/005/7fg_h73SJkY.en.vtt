showing 26,000 miles this although we've
got<00:00:24.750> unusual<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.619> full<00:00:25.800> military<00:00:25.949> history

on it all the full military lock books
and<00:00:28.740> everything<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.189> say<00:00:29.340> what<00:00:29.519> has<00:00:29.939> been<00:00:30.090> done

and everything to say what has been done

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.930 
and everything to say what has been done
to<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:31.320> think<00:00:32.309> it's<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.489> it's<00:00:32.730> certainly

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
to it I think it's that it's certainly

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.790 
to it I think it's that it's certainly
had<00:00:33.059> an<00:00:33.120> engine<00:00:33.360> change<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.809> one<00:00:33.989> and

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
had an engine change this one and

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.350 
had an engine change this one and
probably<00:00:34.920> speedo<00:00:35.399> changes<00:00:35.790> what<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:35.940> think

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
probably speedo changes what I think

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.150 
probably speedo changes what I think
from<00:00:36.600> memory<00:00:36.780> have<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.559> look<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.800> up<00:00:37.860> i<00:00:37.980> think

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
from memory have to look it up i think

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.650 
from memory have to look it up i think
it's<00:00:38.250> actually<00:00:38.460> probably<00:00:38.579> done<00:00:38.850> about<00:00:38.940> 80,000

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
it's actually probably done about 80,000

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.450 
it's actually probably done about 80,000
miles<00:00:39.809> all<00:00:39.989> told<00:00:42.860> say<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.010> military<00:00:44.340> issue

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
that solutely fantastic i'm going to see

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.420 
that solutely fantastic i'm going to see
one<00:00:46.260> like<00:00:46.379> it

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
one like it

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.190 
one like it
or<00:00:48.970> the<00:00:49.150> instruments<00:00:49.510> are<00:00:49.570> working<00:00:49.960> speed

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
or the instruments are working speed

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.840 
or the instruments are working speed
over<00:00:50.440> fuel<00:00:50.740> gauge<00:00:50.890> in<00:00:51.070> temperature<00:00:51.400> gauge

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.250 

engine<00:00:57.850> sounds<00:00:58.150> really<00:00:58.420> smooth<00:00:58.750> and<00:00:58.870> quiet<00:00:59.080> on

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
engine sounds really smooth and quiet on

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.680 
engine sounds really smooth and quiet on
this<00:00:59.350> one

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.240 

biggest<00:01:02.410> noise<00:01:02.559> you<00:01:02.680> get<00:01:02.829> from<00:01:02.980> the<00:01:03.039> tires

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
biggest noise you get from the tires

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.090 
biggest noise you get from the tires
because<00:01:03.460> of<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.640> military<00:01:03.940> ones<00:01:04.119> away<00:01:04.420> sir<00:01:05.100> to

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
because of the military ones away sir to

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:17.690 
because of the military ones away sir to
make<00:01:06.250> a<00:01:06.280> bit<00:01:06.460> of<00:01:06.490> road<00:01:06.640> noise<00:01:06.790> 1100

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.390 

so<00:01:18.700> if<00:01:18.760> we<00:01:18.820> go<00:01:19.620> say<00:01:20.620> starts<00:01:21.010> on<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.130> bottom

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
so if we go say starts on the bottom

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.360 
so if we go say starts on the bottom
there's<00:01:21.580> no<00:01:22.140> misfiring<00:01:23.140> hesitancy<00:01:23.950> important

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
there's no misfiring hesitancy important

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.620 
there's no misfiring hesitancy important
no<00:01:24.430> overheating<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:25.060> temperature<00:01:25.480> gauges

no overheating the temperature gauges

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.960 
no overheating the temperature gauges
just<00:01:25.990> start<00:01:26.200> to<00:01:26.320> move<00:01:26.470> out<00:01:26.650> of<00:01:26.800> the<00:01:26.970> cold

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
just start to move out of the cold

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.750 
just start to move out of the cold
sector<00:01:28.420> now
