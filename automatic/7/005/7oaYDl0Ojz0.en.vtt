00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:08.160
 we are on computex 2015 here we are against 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.570
 the bus stands asus eeebox this 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.309
 device was announced only 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.040
 a few days ago but now well 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.289
 exposed for his time 44 to you that me 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.300
 I found this exposition with this 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.369
 all three versions see there is the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.460
 white version that I put in my hand 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.869
 there's the gold that behind and wool 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.279
 end up seeing it in the world 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.029
 the peculiarity of this model that it is 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.800
 a small internet-based mini pc is 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.079
 its characteristic of strength a 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.969
 came the intel hardware platform 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.399
 braswell can we have a processor is 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.559
 in 2003 and precisely I owe them the con 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.950
 tdp of four acts only 4 watts and that is 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.649
 obviously makes romania flaws 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.850
 absolutely the most modern stages 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.829
 available on the market this moment 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.510
 we want the frame is this version 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.320
 white I repeat in plastic how pretty 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.250
 very solid with the front USB 3.0 and 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.050
 the usb type was venerated small 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.059
 reversible there is also a line doves r 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.970
 a sensor to find the management with 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.630
 TV remote 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.220
 on the back two hdmi outputs and a third of 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.720
 on the doors because in fact as you see 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.820
 just the soul shoulders can be found 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.010
 configurations with three monitors that 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.480
 makes it absolutely very performing is 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.940
 much more suitable for any type of 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.400
 also a business context 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.080
 let's make an office more complete 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.580
 all the rest the gigabit ethernet 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:30.520
 ethernet and 2 to 3 2 usb 3.0 arrive in 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.730
 configuration with 4gb of ram with module 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.800
 ssd td with the two some certain 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.170
 computing power behind me 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.520
 I also show you what it is that 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.200
 here the acid but 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.570
 also something I hadn't said before 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.369
 there is a power supply just as much of 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.660
 slot to manage with pin 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.020
 owner and this is perhaps the only one 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.009
 flaw compared to mini pc a little more 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.479
 small and more compact on virtues 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.220
 Romans for usb but to the advantage 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.930
 obviously different and for the rest 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.479
 precisely division of 110 x 46 118 18 mm 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.210
 x and behind me is the cp they will use 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:10.209
 state monitor with the note 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.430
 calculation frequency of the cpu nnn 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:18.980
 3000 here still all one 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:21.620
 more than once confirm why in 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.390
 this moment here is running from 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.790
 this morning for this model here 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.349
 exposed I have touched is absolutely a 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.659
 fumone on good temperatures 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.730
 we say that from the point of view promises 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.620
 promises very nice are the first ones 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.370
 who use this new person but 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.379
 taxi technology which includes typical of 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.420
 which 4 of the comites of all the mini PCs 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:45.349
 new to this type this type of 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.939
 several 3.0 so many are also mounted 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.319
 even more than one but anyway for 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.060
 more information on 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.799
 availability and prices that makes dax 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.629
 were more versions depending on how to 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.669
 usual of the disk operating system 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.109
 the amount of ram pre-installed 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:58.609
 read the link as usual 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.500
 find now is the extension for which 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.950
 which obviously takes you to the page of 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.950
