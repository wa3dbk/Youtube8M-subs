00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
to do the last update or well they could

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.030 
to do the last update or well they could
just<00:01:54.390> buy<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.570> rights<00:01:54.899> all<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.350> shader<00:01:55.649> mod

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
just buy the rights all the shader mod

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.889 
just buy the rights all the shader mod
developers<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:57.149> would<00:01:57.299> save<00:01:57.479> them<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.630> lot<00:01:57.689> of

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
developers that would save them a lot of

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
time and codeine I'm and trial and error

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.730 
time and codeine I'm and trial and error
cuz<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.329> was<00:02:00.509> not<00:02:00.719> easy<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.140> develop<00:02:01.290> over

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
cuz that was not easy to develop over

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.410 
cuz that was not easy to develop over
all<00:02:01.829> these<00:02:01.979> years<00:02:02.210> apparently<00:02:03.210> though<00:02:03.390> this

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
all these years apparently though this

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.660 
all these years apparently though this
could<00:02:03.810> be<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> performance<00:02:04.590> update<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.490> we'll

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
could be a performance update so we'll

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.760 
could be a performance update so we'll
see<00:02:05.909> just<00:02:06.210> how<00:02:06.390> much<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.600> affects<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.380> but

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
see just how much that affects it but

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.740 
see just how much that affects it but
overall<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.369> know<00:02:08.399> this<00:02:08.729> will<00:02:08.879> create<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.270> huge

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
overall you know this will create a huge

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.839 
overall you know this will create a huge
mass<00:02:10.110> appeal<00:02:10.530> visually<00:02:11.190> for<00:02:11.459> people<00:02:11.730> who

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
mass appeal visually for people who

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.430 
mass appeal visually for people who
already<00:02:11.910> think

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
already think

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.860 
already think
minecraft<00:02:12.830> looks<00:02:13.160> a<00:02:13.250> little<00:02:13.400> blue<00:02:13.850> but<00:02:14.720> what

do you guys think would you like to see
this<00:02:16.580> as<00:02:16.640> like<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.390> shader<00:02:17.720> option<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.650> flip<00:02:18.860> on

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
this as like a shader option the flip on

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.400 
this as like a shader option the flip on
in<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.580> video<00:02:19.730> settings<00:02:20.270> or<00:02:20.480> would<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:21.290> like

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
in the video settings or would you like
