danced before so you can imagine how

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.250 
danced before so you can imagine how
tough<00:04:45.750> it<00:04:46.080> was<00:04:46.370> but<00:04:47.370> it<00:04:47.610> was<00:04:47.670> all<00:04:48.270> worth<00:04:48.720> it<00:04:48.990> in

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
tough it was but it was all worth it in

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.040 
tough it was but it was all worth it in
the<00:04:49.440> end<00:04:49.650> and<00:04:50.040> after<00:04:50.760> three<00:04:51.060> months<00:04:51.420> of<00:04:51.540> that<00:04:51.600> I

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
the end and after three months of that I

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.440 
the end and after three months of that I
decided<00:04:52.980> that<00:04:53.130> the<00:04:53.310> partnership<00:04:53.700> could<00:04:54.120> work

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450

and<00:04:54.780> I<00:04:55.290> quit<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:55.620> continuum<00:04:56.130> and<00:04:56.340> I'm<00:04:57.210> never

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
and I quit the continuum and I'm never

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.720 
and I quit the continuum and I'm never
