flax<00:00:25.240> seeds<00:00:25.510> they<00:00:25.990> work<00:00:26.350> kind<00:00:26.620> of<00:00:26.740> the<00:00:26.830> exact

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.040 
flax seeds they work kind of the exact

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.210 
flax seeds they work kind of the exact
same<00:00:27.250> way<00:00:27.460> so<00:00:28.030> what<00:00:28.690> they<00:00:28.810> do<00:00:28.870> is<00:00:29.230> they<00:00:29.440> form<00:00:29.950> a

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
same way so what they do is they form a

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.220 
same way so what they do is they form a
gel<00:00:30.610> when<00:00:31.000> they're<00:00:31.150> mixed<00:00:31.450> with<00:00:31.600> water<00:00:31.840> so

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
gel when they're mixed with water so

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.380 
gel when they're mixed with water so
they<00:00:32.349> puff<00:00:32.739> up<00:00:32.950> and<00:00:33.250> they<00:00:33.700> form<00:00:33.940> this<00:00:34.120> really

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
they puff up and they form this really

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.200 
they puff up and they form this really
gelatinous<00:00:34.989> fibrous<00:00:35.699> awesome<00:00:36.699> combination

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
gelatinous fibrous awesome combination

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.509 
gelatinous fibrous awesome combination
that's<00:00:38.079> gonna<00:00:38.320> work<00:00:38.620> the<00:00:38.829> same<00:00:39.039> way<00:00:39.219> than<00:00:39.429> an

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:39.519 
that's gonna work the same way than an

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:42.329 
that's gonna work the same way than an
egg<00:00:39.760> would<00:00:39.969> in<00:00:40.269> recipes<00:00:40.660> so<00:00:41.589> we're<00:00:41.920> gonna<00:00:42.039> try

to get a tablespoon tablespoon of chia
seeds

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
seeds

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.369 
seeds
these<00:00:47.710> ones<00:00:47.920> are<00:00:48.039> sprouted<00:00:48.579> chia<00:00:48.760> seeds

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
these ones are sprouted chia seeds

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.319 
these ones are sprouted chia seeds
normally<00:00:50.379> the<00:00:50.649> rule<00:00:51.159> is<00:00:51.370> anything<00:00:51.850> sprouted

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
normally the rule is anything sprouted

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.239 
normally the rule is anything sprouted
is<00:00:52.449> better<00:00:52.690> the<00:00:53.559> great<00:00:53.710> thing<00:00:53.920> about<00:00:54.010> this

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:54.249 
is better the great thing about this

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:56.160 
is better the great thing about this
days<00:00:54.489> is<00:00:54.670> because<00:00:54.999> it's<00:00:55.179> sprouted<00:00:55.629> it's<00:00:55.929> more

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
days is because it's sprouted it's more

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
one of my favorite recipes and when I

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:39.990 
one of my favorite recipes and when I
went<00:01:38.859> vegan<00:01:39.039> it<00:01:39.310> was<00:01:39.399> kind<00:01:39.549> of<00:01:39.609> heartbreaking

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
went vegan it was kind of heartbreaking

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.420 
went vegan it was kind of heartbreaking
because<00:01:40.270> I<00:01:40.750> wasn't<00:01:41.680> sure<00:01:41.890> that<00:01:42.159> I'd<00:01:42.250> be<00:01:42.369> able

like<00:01:54.609> cinnamon<00:01:55.090> nutmeg<00:01:55.299> some<00:01:55.899> vanilla<00:01:56.229> and

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
like cinnamon nutmeg some vanilla and

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.289 
like cinnamon nutmeg some vanilla and
then<00:01:56.859> you<00:01:56.979> soak<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.340> bread<00:01:57.520> in<00:01:57.579> this<00:01:57.939> mushy

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
then you soak the bread in this mushy

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.450 
then you soak the bread in this mushy
banana<00:01:58.659> mixture<00:01:58.990> and<00:01:59.469> that<00:01:59.649> kind<00:01:59.979> of<00:02:00.070> forms<00:02:00.369> a

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
banana mixture and that kind of forms a

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.160 
banana mixture and that kind of forms a
nice<00:02:00.609> coat

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
nice coat

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.050 
nice coat
on<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.350> outside<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.860> bread<00:02:02.070> what<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.820> like

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
on the outside of the bread what I like

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.399 
on the outside of the bread what I like
to<00:02:03.180> do<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.390> sprinkle<00:02:03.690> it<00:02:03.930> with<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.050> little<00:02:04.260> bit

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
to do is sprinkle it with a little bit

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.500 
to do is sprinkle it with a little bit
of<00:02:04.470> coconut<00:02:05.159> as<00:02:05.340> well<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.940> make<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.240> coating

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
of coconut as well to make this coating

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.230 
of coconut as well to make this coating
on<00:02:06.720> top<00:02:06.900> of<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.140> banana<00:02:07.409> because<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.830> banana

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
on top of the banana because the banana

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.600 
on top of the banana because the banana
gets<00:02:09.240> a<00:02:09.330> little<00:02:09.450> bit<00:02:09.630> hot<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.200> burns<00:02:10.709> quite

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
gets a little bit hot and burns quite

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.460 
gets a little bit hot and burns quite
easily<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.209> then<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.780> there<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.140> have<00:02:13.319> it

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
easily and then you there you have it

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.650 
easily and then you there you have it
you<00:02:13.620> have<00:02:13.650> vegan<00:02:14.010> french<00:02:14.400> toast<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:15.450> that's

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
you have vegan french toast so that's

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.900 
you have vegan french toast so that's
another<00:02:15.900> way<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.140> replace<00:02:16.470> eggs<00:02:16.770> but<00:02:17.160> probably

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
another way to replace eggs but probably

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.780 
another way to replace eggs but probably
by<00:02:18.090> now<00:02:18.300> our<00:02:18.570> chia<00:02:18.990> seeds<00:02:19.230> have<00:02:19.440> set<00:02:19.709> up<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.580> as

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
by now our chia seeds have set up so as

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.880 
by now our chia seeds have set up so as
you<00:02:20.910> can<00:02:21.060> see<00:02:21.120> it's<00:02:21.570> no<00:02:21.720> longer<00:02:21.750> powder<00:02:22.440> and

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
you can see it's no longer powder and

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.310 
you can see it's no longer powder and
instead<00:02:23.220> it's<00:02:23.459> kind<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.730> like<00:02:23.850> this<00:02:24.000> goop<00:02:24.990> and

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
instead it's kind of like this goop and

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.490 
instead it's kind of like this goop and
a<00:02:26.220> scoop<00:02:26.580> is<00:02:26.760> gonna<00:02:26.970> do<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.330> exact<00:02:27.750> same<00:02:28.080> thing
