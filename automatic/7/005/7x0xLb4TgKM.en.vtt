guide how to find timeless Burke way I

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.140 
guide how to find timeless Burke way I
haven't<00:00:10.559> been<00:00:10.769> able<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:11.130> get<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:12.000> myself

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
haven't been able to get it myself

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.570 
haven't been able to get it myself
because<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:13.139> server<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.500> I'm<00:00:13.590> honest<00:00:14.040> it's

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
because the server that I'm honest it's

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.840 
because the server that I'm honest it's
fairly<00:00:14.940> populated<00:00:15.599> so<00:00:16.350> it's<00:00:16.590> kind<00:00:17.550> of<00:00:17.580> hard<00:00:17.789> to

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
fairly populated so it's kind of hard to

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.750 
fairly populated so it's kind of hard to
get<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.210> oh<00:00:18.420> when<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.470> are<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:19.980> with<00:00:20.279> two<00:00:20.640> main

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
get it oh when you are so with two main

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.929 
get it oh when you are so with two main
fuel<00:00:21.199> but<00:00:22.199> if<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.470> are<00:00:22.650> on<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.250> low<00:00:23.369> hablas<00:00:23.730> so

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
fuel but if you are on a low hablas so

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.660 
fuel but if you are on a low hablas so
it<00:00:24.060> shouldn't<00:00:24.390> be<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.600> problem<00:00:24.830> so<00:00:25.830> let's<00:00:26.580> get

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
it shouldn't be a problem so let's get

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.720 
it shouldn't be a problem so let's get
started<00:00:26.820> I've<00:00:27.599> seen<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:27.960> over<00:00:28.080> here<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:29.070> here

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
started I've seen it over here and here

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.959 
started I've seen it over here and here
let's<00:00:30.480> say<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:31.040> you<00:00:32.040> can<00:00:32.160> see<00:00:32.279> one<00:00:32.460> point<00:00:32.700> but

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
let's say I you can see one point but

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.450 
let's say I you can see one point but
basically<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.840> area<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.350> heard<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.370> lot

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.190 
some people might just want to just stay
in<00:01:59.530> weight<00:01:59.970> instead<00:02:00.970> of<00:02:01.210> a<00:02:01.390> bang<00:02:01.780> on<00:02:01.960> all<00:02:02.140> the

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
in weight instead of a bang on all the

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.139 
in weight instead of a bang on all the
time<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:04.319> six<00:02:05.319> to<00:02:05.440> seven<00:02:05.679> hours<00:02:05.740> I<00:02:06.149> think

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
time so six to seven hours I think

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.050 
time so six to seven hours I think
that's<00:02:07.299> the<00:02:07.720> approximate<00:02:08.380> time<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:09.580> if<00:02:09.940> you

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
that's the approximate time and if you

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.759 
that's the approximate time and if you
are<00:02:10.239> a<00:02:10.269> whole<00:02:10.780> instead<00:02:10.989> of<00:02:11.260> me<00:02:11.500> I'm<00:02:11.650> an

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
are a whole instead of me I'm an

snowfall<00:02:36.070> X<00:02:36.220> here<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:36.609> Cygnus<00:02:37.299> damage<00:02:37.570> so<00:02:38.410> the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
snowfall X here and Cygnus damage so the

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.220 
snowfall X here and Cygnus damage so the
pH<00:02:38.829> find<00:02:39.190> it<00:02:39.329> because<00:02:40.329> you<00:02:40.660> know<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:40.900> will<00:02:40.930> be<00:02:41.200> a

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
pH find it because you know it will be a

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.620 
pH find it because you know it will be a
pain<00:02:41.380> in<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.530> ass<00:02:41.680> go<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:43.030> up<00:02:43.120> from<00:02:43.299> up<00:02:43.420> here

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
pain in the ass go to up from up here

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.620 
pain in the ass go to up from up here
for<00:02:43.900> example<00:02:44.320> you<00:02:44.440> go<00:02:44.709> today<00:02:44.859> you'll<00:02:45.190> die<00:02:45.630> all

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
for example you go today you'll die all

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.440 
for example you go today you'll die all
will<00:02:47.019> just<00:02:47.200> take<00:02:47.290> a<00:02:47.350> lot<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:47.530> damage<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:49.390> you

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
will just take a lot of damage so you

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.860 
will just take a lot of damage so you
wanna<00:02:50.109> want<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:51.070> avoid<00:02:51.340> that<00:02:51.609> but<00:02:52.480> still<00:02:52.690> get

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
wanna want to avoid that but still get

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.440 
wanna want to avoid that but still get
great<00:02:53.079> right<00:02:53.489> so<00:02:54.489> that<00:02:54.790> is<00:02:54.940> actually<00:02:55.180> why<00:02:55.570> most

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
great right so that is actually why most

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.630 
great right so that is actually why most
they<00:02:56.810> farm<00:02:57.230> it<00:02:57.379> down<00:02:57.530> here<00:02:57.800> first<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.340> are<00:02:58.489> at
