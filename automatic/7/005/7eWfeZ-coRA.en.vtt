00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.140
 hello welcome to here 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:10.270
 golden tricks to the video tutorial like 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.420
 in windows 10 the window colors 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.910
 can because this is always by default 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.310
 know how to now but can scare 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.949
 this window always knows about it too 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:25.119
 if i changed the color for 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:27.249
 example to yellow is here 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.419
 my start with yellow has the windows 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:31.210
 color remains above it was only the 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.410
 border is slightly yellow and how to 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.390
 that can also change with a few 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.230
 I will show you a few tricks now 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.760
 To do this , first open the explorer 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.590
 gives the following address bar 1 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.960
 So go to c windows resources 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.440
 teamcenter and then find one here 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.680
 folder called euro 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.900
 So copy this folder with you 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:04.359
 Control c and then you click one 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:05.829
 continue control and these mrs part 

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:07.299
 you can not copy this file 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:10.030
 So let's skip it 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.999
 that 's not a problem though 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.530
 skip 

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:16.329
 Now we have an exact copy of 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.969
 this folder so these two files 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:23.340
 Created this folder we call then 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:25.450
 in windows again 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.670
 then continue administrator privileges 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.049
 let's open this folder go to this one 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.520
 file 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.520
 we also call these in windows 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:38.409
 continue 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:44.939
 Then give eurolite and windows file 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:47.670
 we find in the de gros de ja a sms 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:53.850
 styles file 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.850
 We can also convert these into windows 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.750
 continue 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:05.970
 then we go back to the 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:09.050
 teams folders mark the one 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:13.220
 red part control c resp 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.810
 copy this into another folder 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.830
 ctr v 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.600
 then we find the file here now 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.830
 there we go make a right click 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.340
 to open this file with you 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.610
 City then choose another app 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.110
 then you are looking for your editor and it is 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.370
 important that does not fit this on 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.770
 tick is set then select elite 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:46.560
 presses okay then opens the now 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:51.600
 editor then you scroll down to 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:55.440
 for 30 long the file listless times then 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.670
 he goes and measures of course now 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:05.340
 the file to finish 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:11.220
 in windows file tender and disabled 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:15.320
 windows and then if only mss star so 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:19.049
 ms part of the power you save once 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:22.650
 includes all again makes a 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:25.560
 double click on the file then appears 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.489
 this chip and the window color is now 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.700

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.040
 change by so you can 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.190
