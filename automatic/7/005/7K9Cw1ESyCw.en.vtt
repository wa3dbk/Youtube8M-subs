00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.250
 some arrivals from Bey 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.100

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.030
 was really superb 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.430
 that's why I want them 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.030

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.489
 boils that it has continued with 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.590

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.739
 small cell phones 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.600
 figurines that are as pretty at 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.940
 originally I just wanted the evoli and 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.860
 the nafali but as the figurine is 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.350
 sold around 10 12 euros 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.760
 with postage included obviously the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.590
 figurine I said no no I did not 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.750
 especially not that price for the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.640
 figurines and a seller sells his six 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.140
 coins for god euros postage 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.589
 free they go which obviously I have 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.140
 benefited 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.640
 good the other four who are here do not 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.229
 I'm not interested but if I ever 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.530
 make a contest I would surely put it 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.119
 in batches so to follow the little 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.159
 find on the empty attics 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.990
 now started with the cat 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.150
 booster of the black and white collection 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.610
 with a noble victory and power 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.630
 emerging for 50 cents piece so 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.580
 really well we continue with another 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.369
 booster found on river by cons of 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.020
 black and white noble victory here they are 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.650
 so of course I will make a video and I 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.560
 will tell you all that at the same time with 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.320
 found on ebay also an album for 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.659
 tidy up all his cards with frost 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.560
 filali allies who are presented well 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.970
 nice album too and going to make 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.979
 the little girl is in the store of 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.860
 destocking noz I came across this 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.600
 little pokemon mirror dating back years 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.579
 2000 by the way I was very surprised and 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.500
 for the price of 1 euro 50 only 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.060
 so frankly it's worth it and has 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.189
 added to the small collection was 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.110
 still no worse find beautiful find 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:12.840
 nice to finish with them and who 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.120
 comes from crossroads 2 dec 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.590

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.019
 that I would finally open I do not know too much 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.489
 again if I'm going to open them I do not know 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.680
 still so I think I prefer the 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.930
 leave in the 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.180

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.409
 two of the cases add to the collection and 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.540
 I wanted to take a 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.060

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.950
