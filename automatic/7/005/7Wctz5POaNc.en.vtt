00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
some sand shifts that see we've got one

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.560 
some sand shifts that see we've got one
there<00:01:19.040> already

the this the starting off one is only a
three<00:01:26.840> by<00:01:26.960> three<00:01:27.409> and<00:01:27.619> so<00:01:28.550> you<00:01:28.610> get

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
three by three and so you get

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
three by three and so you get
growing<00:01:30.760> up<00:01:30.880> like<00:01:31.030> this<00:01:31.210> okay<00:01:31.660> now<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:33.000> harvest

detectives<00:02:02.110> I<00:02:02.260> wouldn't<00:02:02.590> recommend<00:02:02.800> it

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
detectives I wouldn't recommend it

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.730 
detectives I wouldn't recommend it
because<00:02:03.160> it<00:02:03.460> uses<00:02:03.640> more<00:02:04.000> power<00:02:04.330> to<00:02:04.780> remove<00:02:05.560> the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.660 

using<00:02:32.900> my<00:02:33.019> omni-tool<00:02:33.700> that<00:02:34.700> way<00:02:35.920> my<00:02:36.920> chests<00:02:37.310> no

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
using my omni-tool that way my chests no

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.589 
using my omni-tool that way my chests no
jest<00:02:37.940> it<00:02:38.930> doesn't<00:02:39.230> matter<00:02:39.379> okay<00:02:40.030> now<00:02:41.030> once<00:02:41.360> the

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
jest it doesn't matter okay now once the

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.210 
jest it doesn't matter okay now once the
plants<00:02:41.930> are<00:02:42.019> grown<00:02:42.230> like<00:02:42.650> this

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
plants are grown like this

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.930 
plants are grown like this
we'll<00:02:43.640> just<00:02:43.819> great<00:02:43.970> watch<00:02:44.120> using<00:02:45.019> some<00:02:45.940> okay

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
we'll just great watch using some okay

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.180 
we'll just great watch using some okay
so<00:02:47.000> up<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.860> then<00:02:49.730> it<00:02:50.030> should<00:02:50.450> spit<00:02:51.170> what<00:02:52.099> it

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
so up and then it should spit what it

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.850 
so up and then it should spit what it
gets<00:02:52.280> out<00:02:52.519> the<00:02:52.610> back

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
gets out the back

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.050 
gets out the back

she'd<00:02:56.630> skated<00:02:57.020> right<00:02:57.050> back<00:02:58.750> let's<00:02:59.750> say<00:03:02.410> chest

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.180 

okay<00:03:06.650> now

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.800 

there<00:03:10.790> we<00:03:10.910> go<00:03:11.440> we'll<00:03:12.440> do<00:03:12.620> that<00:03:12.740> again

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.830 

works<00:03:16.410> pretty<00:03:16.590> fast<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.640> takes<00:03:18.210> energy<00:03:18.480> to

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
works pretty fast and takes energy to

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.750 
works pretty fast and takes energy to
get<00:03:19.080> rid<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.710> leaves<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.430> log<00:03:20.610> as

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
get rid of the leaves and the log as

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.260 
get rid of the leaves and the log as
well<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:22.250> should<00:03:23.250> pump<00:03:23.520> out<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.730> backs<00:03:24.000> of<00:03:24.150> it

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
well and should pump out the backs of it

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.800 
well and should pump out the backs of it
but<00:03:24.390> this<00:03:24.510> doesn't<00:03:25.050> yes<00:03:25.520> now<00:03:26.520> how<00:03:27.420> do<00:03:27.480> we<00:03:27.660> turn

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
but this doesn't yes now how do we turn

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.570 
but this doesn't yes now how do we turn
this<00:03:27.870> into<00:03:28.080> a<00:03:28.260> renewable<00:03:28.530> energy<00:03:28.710> source<00:03:29.070> by

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
this into a renewable energy source by

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.600 
this into a renewable energy source by
doing<00:03:29.940> this<00:03:30.750> this<00:03:31.560> is<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.850> my<00:03:32.850> first<00:03:33.600> attempt<00:03:34.260> at

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
doing this this is a my first attempt at

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.780 
doing this this is a my first attempt at
doing<00:03:35.610> it<00:03:36.830> so<00:03:37.830> we've<00:03:38.040> got<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.310> plant<00:03:38.550> on<00:03:38.760> its

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
doing it so we've got the plant on its

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.790 
doing it so we've got the plant on its
ground

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800

this<00:03:41.280> chest<00:03:41.580> picks<00:03:41.910> up<00:03:42.060> extra<00:03:42.390> seedlings<00:03:42.780> that

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
this chest picks up extra seedlings that

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.680 
this chest picks up extra seedlings that
are<00:03:43.080> that<00:03:44.070> get<00:03:44.220> made<00:03:44.400> over<00:03:44.760> time<00:03:44.970> because

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
are that get made over time because

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.850 
are that get made over time because
eventually<00:03:45.870> it'll<00:03:46.080> create<00:03:46.290> more<00:03:46.440> seedlings

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
eventually it'll create more seedlings

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.180 
eventually it'll create more seedlings
and<00:03:47.010> it<00:03:47.100> needs<00:03:48.320> saw<00:03:49.320> just<00:03:49.530> do<00:03:49.620> that

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
and it needs saw just do that

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.100 
and it needs saw just do that
and<00:03:51.580> it'll<00:03:51.910> get<00:03:52.450> rid<00:03:52.540> of<00:03:52.630> these<00:03:52.930> and<00:03:53.230> such<00:03:53.410> I

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
and it'll get rid of these and such I

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.900 
and it'll get rid of these and such I
have<00:03:56.110> some<00:03:56.460> think<00:03:57.460> that's<00:03:57.720> don't<00:03:58.720> type<00:03:59.590> it

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
goes towards a dying pipe which then

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.220 
goes towards a dying pipe which then
directs<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.340> wood<00:04:03.520> into<00:04:03.940> this<00:04:04.230> powered

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
directs the wood into this powered

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.440 
directs the wood into this powered
furnace<00:04:06.570> the<00:04:07.570> seeds<00:04:08.290> go<00:04:08.830> up<00:04:09.100> and<00:04:09.550> over<00:04:09.700> into

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
furnace the seeds go up and over into

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.570 
furnace the seeds go up and over into
that<00:04:10.690> box<00:04:10.900> and<00:04:11.110> then<00:04:11.710> eventually<00:04:11.980> back<00:04:12.280> into

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
that box and then eventually back into

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.960 
that box and then eventually back into
the<00:04:12.700> machine<00:04:13.000> and<00:04:13.270> if<00:04:13.780> not<00:04:13.960> into<00:04:14.620> there

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
the machine and if not into there

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:22.650 
the machine and if not into there
but<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.380> furnace<00:04:18.930> takes<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:20.110> wood

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.500 

turns<00:04:23.200> it<00:04:23.380> into<00:04:23.530> cold

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
turns it into cold

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.189 
turns it into cold
which<00:04:26.020> then

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.010 

gets<00:04:30.159> popped<00:04:30.400> out<00:04:30.580> to<00:04:30.819> the<00:04:30.849> pot<00:04:31.090> and<00:04:31.389> in<00:04:31.930> this

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
gets popped out to the pot and in this

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.320 
gets popped out to the pot and in this
case<00:04:32.259> goes<00:04:32.499> to<00:04:32.650> a<00:04:32.710> Stirling<00:04:33.069> engine<00:04:33.330> starting

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
case goes to a Stirling engine starting

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.209 
case goes to a Stirling engine starting
engine<00:04:34.599> then<00:04:34.870> goes<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:37.169> charges<00:04:38.169> up<00:04:38.289> this<00:04:38.409> red

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:39.219 
engine then goes and charges up this red

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:41.159 
engine then goes and charges up this red
star<00:04:39.430> energy<00:04:39.789> cell<00:04:39.969> now<00:04:40.569> this<00:04:40.810> system<00:04:40.990> is

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
star energy cell now this system is

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:46.619 
star energy cell now this system is
pretty<00:04:41.710> simple<00:04:42.189> not<00:04:42.580> very<00:04:42.759> powerful<00:04:45.509> you<00:04:46.509> need

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:46.629 
pretty simple not very powerful you need

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:47.730 
pretty simple not very powerful you need
to<00:04:46.719> make<00:04:46.840> it<00:04:46.930> really<00:04:47.080> bigger<00:04:47.289> like<00:04:47.469> I<00:04:47.590> want

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
to make it really bigger like I want

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.149 
to make it really bigger like I want
over<00:04:47.830> there

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159 
over there

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:50.279 
over there
but<00:04:48.520> another<00:04:49.060> think<00:04:49.240> about<00:04:49.389> the<00:04:49.509> harvester<00:04:50.229> is

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
but another think about the harvester is

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:53.450 
but another think about the harvester is
it<00:04:50.439> does<00:04:50.560> create<00:04:50.830> swatch<00:04:51.639> which<00:04:52.599> you<00:04:52.870> can

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
it does create swatch which you can

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.029 
it does create swatch which you can
destroy<00:04:54.460> all<00:04:54.789> store<00:04:55.449> up<00:04:55.659> in<00:04:55.840> a<00:04:55.930> multi<00:04:56.830> tank

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
destroy all store up in a multi tank

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:01.920 
destroy all store up in a multi tank
here<00:04:57.249> and<00:04:58.979> out<00:04:59.979> so<00:05:00.249> look<00:05:00.490> at<00:05:00.580> the<00:05:00.779> the<00:05:01.779> other

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
here and out so look at the the other

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.300 
here and out so look at the the other
one<00:05:02.020> I'm<00:05:02.110> a<00:05:02.199> which<00:05:02.349> is<00:05:02.500> a<00:05:02.529> little<00:05:02.740> more<00:05:02.889> compact

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
one I'm a which is a little more compact

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.800 
one I'm a which is a little more compact
a<00:05:03.639> little<00:05:04.330> bit<00:05:04.419> more<00:05:04.539> powerful<00:05:05.490> the<00:05:06.509> this<00:05:07.509> time

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
a little bit more powerful the this time

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.959 
a little bit more powerful the this time
the<00:05:08.169> caller<00:05:08.590> gets<00:05:08.830> charcoal<00:05:09.669> that<00:05:09.849> gets

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:09.969 
the caller gets charcoal that gets

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:12.450 
the caller gets charcoal that gets
created<00:05:10.210> it<00:05:10.389> goes<00:05:10.569> into<00:05:11.169> a<00:05:11.560> steam<00:05:12.250> boiler

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
created it goes into a steam boiler

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.170 
created it goes into a steam boiler
which<00:05:13.029> is<00:05:13.210> incredibly<00:05:13.810> efficient<00:05:14.969> I've<00:05:15.969> got

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
which is incredibly efficient I've got

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.209 
which is incredibly efficient I've got
it<00:05:16.240> running<00:05:16.360> through<00:05:17.009> hobbyist<00:05:18.009> steam

crazy<00:05:43.489> you<00:05:44.489> can<00:05:44.699> do<00:05:44.849> that<00:05:45.319> this<00:05:46.319> is<00:05:46.379> I<00:05:46.979> think

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729

00:05:51.179 --> 00:05:53.600 
might be the Maximus max Maximus
it's<00:05:51.569> like<00:05:51.719> gladiator<00:05:52.169> maximum<00:05:53.159> sight<00:05:53.339> is<00:05:53.489> you

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
it's like gladiator maximum sight is you

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.540 
it's like gladiator maximum sight is you
can<00:05:53.729> go<00:05:53.849> with<00:05:54.749> a<00:05:54.979> probably<00:05:55.979> more<00:05:56.069> that's<00:05:56.429> an

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
can go with a probably more that's an

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.749 
can go with a probably more that's an
airlock<00:05:56.909> great<00:05:57.800> that's<00:05:58.800> an<00:05:59.039> increase<00:05:59.550> of<00:05:59.579> a

00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 
airlock great that's an increase of a

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:02.179 
airlock great that's an increase of a
weapon<00:06:00.089> square<00:06:00.419> so<00:06:00.569> it's<00:06:00.779> 11<00:06:01.379> squares<00:06:01.949> out

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:02.189 
weapon square so it's 11 squares out

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:05.779 
weapon square so it's 11 squares out
from<00:06:02.729> the<00:06:03.029> original<00:06:03.389> three

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789

as<00:06:06.240> you<00:06:06.330> can<00:06:06.449> see<00:06:06.569> it's<00:06:06.689> not<00:06:06.779> really<00:06:06.960> doing

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
as you can see it's not really doing

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.989 
as you can see it's not really doing
much<00:06:07.139> because<00:06:07.469> it's<00:06:07.620> not<00:06:07.800> time<00:06:08.009> plants<00:06:08.879> don't

00:06:08.989 --> 00:06:08.999 
much because it's not time plants don't

creating<00:06:50.240> was<00:06:50.539> it<00:06:51.879> one<00:06:52.879> of<00:06:52.909> these<00:06:53.059> tensions

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:53.419

doing<00:06:53.749> a<00:06:53.930> thing<00:06:54.229> now<00:06:54.889> these<00:06:55.009> ones<00:06:55.159> are

00:06:55.329 --> 00:06:55.339 
doing a thing now these ones are

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:56.769 
doing a thing now these ones are
industrial<00:06:55.759> ones<00:06:55.909> actually<00:06:56.089> so<00:06:56.569> they're

00:06:56.769 --> 00:06:56.779 
industrial ones actually so they're

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:59.829 
industrial ones actually so they're
doing<00:06:56.990> 8h<00:06:57.789> so<00:06:58.789> I<00:06:58.819> think<00:06:58.999> I<00:06:59.180> faked<00:06:59.360> over<00:06:59.539> so<00:06:59.659> like

00:06:59.829 --> 00:06:59.839 
doing 8h so I think I faked over so like

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:02.769 
doing 8h so I think I faked over so like
they're<00:07:00.740> been<00:07:00.889> doing<00:07:01.430> about<00:07:01.520> 70<00:07:01.939> minecraft

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:12.640 
so I think that's it for this video you

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.540

can<00:07:13.640> do<00:07:13.910> these<00:07:14.120> things<00:07:14.180> with<00:07:14.780> a<00:07:15.550> golden

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:16.550 
can do these things with a golden
