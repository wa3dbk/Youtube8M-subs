00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.290
Hello boys and girls

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.260
This is Aunt Frenita and I have a wonderful story for you

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.040
Called "God's Rainbow Promise"

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.020
Today's memory verse is from Genesis 9:13

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.680
It says "I have set my rainbow in the clouds... it will be a sign"

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.540
The message for today's story is "We thank God for His promises"

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.820
Have you ever seen a rainbow?

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.920
Sometimes you can see one after it rains

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.070
Noah and his family saw the very first rainbow God made

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.510
Do you know why?

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.000
The animals were restless

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.230
Monkeys chattered constantly and swung wildly around the bars in their cages

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.690
Parrots shrieked

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.710
Everybody was eager to get off of the ark

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.200
Finally God said to Noah, "It's time"

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.200
"It's time to leave the ark"

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.990
So God sent an angel to open the heavy door

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.590
The animals thundered down the ramp

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.030
Horses kicked up their heels as they ran

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.870
Kangaroos bounced happily back and forth

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.780
Eagles soared and lions roared

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.780
Noah and his family felt happy and sad at the same time

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.900
They were very happy to be out of the ark

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.300
Bit they were sad at what they found outside of the ark

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.250
The earth was so ugly

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.740
Big boulders covered the land

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:32.310
Even though new green grass sprouted almost everywhere and young trees were beginning to poke up through the ground

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.060
It didn't look like anything like the beautiful world they had left when they entered the ark

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.710
But they were safe. God had kept his promise

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.680
So Noah built an altar and gathered his family around it

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.570
They thanked God for keeping his promise to save them from the terrible flood

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.100
They praised God for His protection

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.410
God gave Noah's family a special blessing

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.620
Then God gave them a promise

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.960
"I am making a promise to you and to all who come after you"

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.510
"Even though the rain will fall, I will never again destroy the whole world with a flood"

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.590
"Look into the sky and you will see the sign of my promise"

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.560
Noah and his family looked up

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.010
A brilliant rainbow stretched across the heavens

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.150
They had never seen anything like it before

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:30.050
It was brilliant with reds and oranges and yellows and greens and blues and violet

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.350
"Whenever you see the rainbow in the clouds," God said

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.640
"You can be sure that I will keep my promise"

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.930
Noah and his family stayed near the altar for a long time

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.140
They sang songs of praise

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.570
They prayed prayers of thanksgiving

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.840
They had a rainbow sigh

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.250
They knew that God would always keep His promises

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.890
And we know that too

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.150
God has never again covered the whole earth with water

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.600
Even today He still keeps His rainbow promise

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.760
Just as God kept His promise to Noah and his family, God will keep His promises to us

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.550
We can find His promises in His word, the bible

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.170
And we can be sure He will keep them

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.060
Why?

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.670
Because He loves us, very much

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.960
