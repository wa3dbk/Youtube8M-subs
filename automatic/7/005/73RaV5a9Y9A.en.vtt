from<00:01:40.150> a<00:01:40.210> technical<00:01:40.570> standpoint<00:01:40.840> our<00:01:41.260> guide

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
from a technical standpoint our guide

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.520 
from a technical standpoint our guide
fingers<00:01:42.310> so<00:01:42.910> your<00:01:43.060> fourth<00:01:43.360> finger<00:01:43.450> was<00:01:44.020> on<00:01:44.260> the

fingers so your fourth finger was on the
second<00:01:44.890> string<00:01:45.160> when<00:01:46.000> you<00:01:46.030> played<00:01:46.300> the<00:01:46.420> f9<00:01:46.780> you

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
second string when you played the f9 you

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.590 
second string when you played the f9 you
block<00:01:48.070> notice<00:01:48.760> how<00:01:48.850> you<00:01:48.910> always<00:01:49.210> block<00:01:49.450> the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
block notice how you always block the

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.000 
block notice how you always block the
right<00:01:49.750> hand<00:01:49.960> leads<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.320> left<00:01:50.530> meaning<00:01:50.830> you

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
right hand leads the left meaning you

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.100 
right hand leads the left meaning you
come<00:01:51.250> into<00:01:51.430> play<00:01:51.640> dampen<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:52.600> string<00:01:52.840> so<00:01:52.960> your

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
come into play dampen the string so your

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.300 
come into play dampen the string so your
guinea<00:01:53.320> open<00:01:53.560> strings<00:01:53.830> and<00:01:54.100> it's<00:01:54.190> also

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
guinea open strings and it's also

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.550 
guinea open strings and it's also
efficient<00:01:54.880> so<00:01:55.450> your<00:01:55.570> fourth<00:01:55.840> finger<00:01:55.930> slid<00:01:56.440> up

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
efficient so your fourth finger slid up

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.550 
efficient so your fourth finger slid up
to<00:01:56.680> the<00:01:56.770> F<00:01:57.510> you<00:01:58.510> have<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.750> D<00:01:58.900> minor<00:01:59.110> seven<00:01:59.530> flat

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
to the F you have the D minor seven flat

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.160 
to the F you have the D minor seven flat
five<00:02:00.150> then<00:02:01.150> you're<00:02:01.270> gonna<00:02:01.360> move<00:02:01.600> down<00:02:01.900> and

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
five then you're gonna move down and

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.600 
five then you're gonna move down and
your<00:02:02.320> third<00:02:02.560> and<00:02:02.770> your<00:02:02.890> fourth<00:02:03.130> fingers<00:02:03.460> will

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
your third and your fourth fingers will

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.719 
your third and your fourth fingers will
be<00:02:03.640> guide<00:02:03.940> fingers<00:02:05.190> you're<00:02:06.190> playing<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.550> root

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
be guide fingers you're playing the root

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.180 
be guide fingers you're playing the root
the<00:02:06.880> third<00:02:07.090> of<00:02:07.210> that<00:02:07.330> G<00:02:07.509> augmented<00:02:08.050> then<00:02:09.039> your

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
the third of that G augmented then your

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.430 
the third of that G augmented then your
bass<00:02:09.369> line<00:02:09.640> goes<00:02:09.850> over<00:02:10.149> to<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.390> third<00:02:13.440> so

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
bass line goes over to the third so

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.319 
bass line goes over to the third so
second<00:02:14.800> half

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:25.699 

you<00:02:18.329> see<00:02:18.540> them<00:02:23.780> now<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:24.810> would<00:02:25.019> encourage<00:02:25.409> you

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
you see them now I would encourage you

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.709 
you see them now I would encourage you
to<00:02:25.829> explore<00:02:26.280> other<00:02:26.519> fingerings<00:02:27.269> for<00:02:27.359> this

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
to explore other fingerings for this

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.989 
to explore other fingerings for this
passage<00:02:27.989> I<00:02:28.469> would<00:02:28.980> also<00:02:29.159> encourage<00:02:29.609> you<00:02:29.730> to

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:29.999 
passage I would also encourage you to

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:33.140 
passage I would also encourage you to
take<00:02:30.629> this<00:02:30.870> progression<00:02:31.349> and<00:02:31.879> move<00:02:32.879> it<00:02:33.060> around

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
take this progression and move it around

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.179 
take this progression and move it around
with<00:02:33.540> different<00:02:33.900> voicings<00:02:34.379> experiment

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:35.189 
with different voicings experiment

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.009 
with different voicings experiment
because<00:02:35.519> you<00:02:36.150> know<00:02:36.269> you<00:02:36.329> don't<00:02:36.540> want<00:02:36.719> to<00:02:36.750> just

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
because you know you don't want to just

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.349 
because you know you don't want to just
understand<00:02:37.560> how<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.769> play<00:02:37.980> one<00:02:38.340> one<00:02:38.849> way<00:02:39.090> when

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
understand how to play one one way when

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.000 
understand how to play one one way when
you<00:02:39.450> play<00:02:39.629> a<00:02:39.659> progression<00:02:40.049> make<00:02:40.739> sure<00:02:40.920> you

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
you play a progression make sure you

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.530 
you play a progression make sure you
experiment<00:02:41.430> with<00:02:41.519> different<00:02:41.609> baselines<00:02:42.269> and

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
experiment with different baselines and

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:51.050 
experiment with different baselines and
also<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.560> can<00:02:43.829> get<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.010> little<00:02:44.250> busier<00:02:50.060> put

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
also you can get a little busier put

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:58.250 
also you can get a little busier put
some<00:02:51.209> baseline<00:02:56.599> I'm<00:02:57.599> just<00:02:57.840> coming<00:02:58.079> right<00:02:58.230> out

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
some baseline I'm just coming right out

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.849 
some baseline I'm just coming right out
of<00:02:58.379> the<00:02:58.469> chord<00:02:58.739> have<00:02:59.400> fun<00:02:59.549> with<00:02:59.699> this<00:02:59.790> one
