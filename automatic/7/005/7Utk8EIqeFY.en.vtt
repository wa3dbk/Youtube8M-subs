00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
but the montclair I had some trouble

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.600 
but the montclair I had some trouble
when<00:01:48.930> designing<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.710> we<00:01:50.040> decided<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.520> go

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
when designing it so we decided to go

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.580 
when designing it so we decided to go
with<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.790> straight<00:01:51.090> blade<00:01:51.270> instead<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.930> we're

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
with a straight blade instead and we're

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.990 
with a straight blade instead and we're
glad<00:01:52.740> he<00:01:52.950> went<00:01:53.100> with<00:01:53.189> his<00:01:53.280> final<00:01:53.670> design

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
glad he went with his final design

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.819 
glad he went with his final design
because<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:54.659> think<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.079> came<00:01:55.200> out<00:01:55.350> perfectly

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
because we think it came out perfectly

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.039 
because we think it came out perfectly
and<00:01:56.100> now<00:01:56.729> instead<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.149> just<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.509> single<00:01:57.750> weapon

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049
