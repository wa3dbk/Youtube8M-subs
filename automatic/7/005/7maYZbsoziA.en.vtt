00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.100
 hi friends from youtube i'm lyon cris and 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.620
 today I come to you with something new and different 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.540
 I come to my types of videos as I already do 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.910
 they saw in the title then with some 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.490
 coincidences or similarities of gta 5 and gta 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.380
 three vice city and san andreas these 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.760
 similarities or coincidences have to do 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.739
 with the characters that are the 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.840
 protagonists of the gta tsja named 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.620
 good to not lengthen the thing 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.350
 let's start 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.329
 good on the left hand side up 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.239
 we see tommy vercetti del gta vice city 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.649
 jamtahael del gta 5 as we can notice 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.379
 are very similar 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.660
 first look good mouth and knob 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.729
 the ears are equal the part of the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.040
 beard they have are identical they 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:01.979
 they look alike a bit on the nose in the 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.839
 mouth your eyes and eyebrows let's reflect 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.790
 same as in the textures of the vice gta 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.830
 city â€‹â€‹the textures were too bad for 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.930
 this time if they did to tommy vercetti 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.090
 with the textures of gta 5 would be 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.310
 identical to maicon but if rock star what 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.050
 they obviously would do it differently 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.640
 so they do not look alike and do not start 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.860
 take out accounts that would be michael the 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.860
 son of lopez is one of those 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.750
 the second resemblance or coincidence is in 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.940
 the bottom part where we see Gregory 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.410
 clau de speed as we can notice in the 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.870
 bottom part on the right side e 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.150
 left these characters are identical 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.400
 first let's look at the image on the side 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.340
 left down look the forehead of both 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.680
 characters have almost the same height 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.990
 Look at those eyebrows that are identical to the 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.940
 ears and whiskers equal the eyes clau 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.220
 he is always serious and trevor is always 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.350
 the pagan we imagine a serious trevor 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.780
 it would be like clau in the form of 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.250
 face would be almost the same look the part 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.320
 of the nose and the chin because they are 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.240
 identical the shape of the mouth that 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.030
 they put to the voice then it does not differ in 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.430
 nothing good now look at the image of the 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.830
 bottom part right side as always 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.020
 trevor is angry x imagine 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.940
 applauds angry because it would be the same 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.820
 I dare to look at the part of the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.100
 chin again the mouth the pain not 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.710
 they differ in nothing the height of the 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.510
 front does not differ much 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.450
 the third and last resemblance or 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.310
 coincidence this jack and franklin like 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.410
 we can notice they seem in the first place 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.080
 the haircut they do not care 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.390
 also the pear and nose and mouth do not 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.880
 a lot since cj is not talking to 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.280
 nobody franklin in that photo was for him 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.710
 talk to your friend from the jove street 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.180
 they seem a little almost nothing in the eyes and 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.090
 ears 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.620
 and finally my personal opinion I think 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.590
 that rockstar did this for two reasons 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.480
 one because they had no more imagination 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.129
 to create other characters so the 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.680
 they made similar to the protagonists 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.900
 of the other gt as and 2 so that the people 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.019
 draw conclusions from similar 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.099
 xtb good that was all hopefully they were 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:04.560
 liked the video of I like to share 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.329
 comment and above all subscribe if in the 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.209
 description I left the link of the image 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.459
 possible in the heaslip description of 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.739
 the image created by me left it by itself 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.150
 they can not appreciate it very well to God and 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.150
 I wish you liked it we say
