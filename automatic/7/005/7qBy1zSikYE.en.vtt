this<00:00:22.470> channel<00:00:22.529> because<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.310> both<00:00:23.519> want<00:00:23.820> to

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970

and we thought YouTube is a good way to
you<00:00:29.220> know<00:00:29.340> share<00:00:29.820> your<00:00:30.269> story<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.289> stuff<00:00:31.619> and
