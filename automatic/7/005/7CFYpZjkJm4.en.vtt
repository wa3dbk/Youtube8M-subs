00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
right hello Pete so I guess the first

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.460 
right hello Pete so I guess the first
question<00:00:16.640> would<00:00:17.000> be<00:00:17.060> it's<00:00:17.930> been<00:00:18.110> a<00:00:18.140> long<00:00:18.440> time

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
question would be it's been a long time

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.650 
question would be it's been a long time
since<00:00:18.800> there's<00:00:19.490> been<00:00:19.550> an<00:00:19.730> ex-con<00:00:20.150> game<00:00:20.420> and

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
since there's been an ex-con game and

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.080 
since there's been an ex-con game and
last<00:00:21.590> I<00:00:21.740> checked<00:00:21.800> for<00:00:22.220> axis<00:00:22.610> didn't<00:00:22.820> make<00:00:22.970> the

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
last I checked for axis didn't make the

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.620 
last I checked for axis didn't make the
old<00:00:23.240> one<00:00:23.420> so<00:00:23.570> I<00:00:23.600> guess<00:00:23.780> my<00:00:23.810> question<00:00:23.990> would<00:00:24.410> be

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
old one so I guess my question would be

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.150 
old one so I guess my question would be
y'all<00:00:26.630> do<00:00:26.750> have<00:00:26.870> a<00:00:26.900> long<00:00:27.080> line<00:00:27.290> of<00:00:27.320> like<00:00:27.590> a<00:00:27.800> long

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
y'all do have a long line of like a long

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.220 
y'all do have a long line of like a long
history<00:00:28.400> of<00:00:28.610> making<00:00:28.700> strategy<00:00:29.480> games<00:00:29.660> what

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
versus the old ones and as for axis and

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.660 
versus the old ones and as for axis and
what<00:00:35.180> are<00:00:35.240> y'all<00:00:35.390> bringing<00:00:35.600> to<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:35.960> table

knowing else history of working on the
civilization<00:00:39.530> games<00:00:39.770> well<00:00:40.220> there's<00:00:40.370> actually

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
civilization games well there's actually

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.760 
civilization games well there's actually
a<00:00:40.730> fairly<00:00:41.270> direct<00:00:41.630> link<00:00:41.870> between<00:00:41.930> the<00:00:42.620> old

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
a fairly direct link between the old

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.770

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.750 
we also have Ironman mode as a toggle
which<00:02:23.990> means<00:02:24.260> no<00:02:24.710> reloading<00:02:25.100> saves<00:02:25.490> it's

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
which means no reloading saves it's

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.240 
which means no reloading saves it's
saving<00:02:26.290> continuously<00:02:27.290> recognize<00:02:27.800> that<00:02:28.130> so

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
saving continuously recognize that so

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.980 
saving continuously recognize that so
many<00:02:28.340> dyes<00:02:28.580> are<00:02:28.610> out<00:02:29.000> of<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.240> so<00:02:29.600> that's<00:02:29.660> like<00:02:29.870> a

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
many dyes are out of it so that's like a

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.270 
many dyes are out of it so that's like a
half<00:02:30.200> step<00:02:30.530> between<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:30.980> different

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
half step between the different

half step between the different
difficulty<00:02:31.730> levels<00:02:31.760> I<00:02:32.240> definitely<00:02:32.900> don't

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
difficulty levels I definitely don't

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.780 
difficulty levels I definitely don't
recommend<00:02:33.710> starting<00:02:34.070> out<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.400> game<00:02:34.550> and

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
recommend starting out the game and

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.280 
recommend starting out the game and
jumping<00:02:35.060> right<00:02:35.180> into<00:02:35.360> impossible<00:02:35.930> it<00:02:36.110> would

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
jumping right into impossible it would

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.170 
jumping right into impossible it would
be<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:37.100> kind<00:02:37.310> of<00:02:37.370> experience<00:02:37.880> if<00:02:38.060> you

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
be the kind of experience if you

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.120 
be the kind of experience if you
remember<00:02:38.630> but<00:02:38.900> kind<00:02:39.470> of<00:02:39.530> in<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.680> same<00:02:39.770> way<00:02:40.070> you

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
remember but kind of in the same way you

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.380

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
level they do and that really creates a

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.100 
level they do and that really creates a
sense<00:04:48.340> of<00:04:48.490> attachment<00:04:48.760> to<00:04:49.120> your<00:04:49.210> soldiers<00:04:49.630> so

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
customize the way that they look and

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.920 
customize the way that they look and
stuff<00:05:33.280> absolutely<00:05:33.820> is<00:05:33.970> that<00:05:34.120> gonna<00:05:34.240> make<00:05:34.630> you

know the permadeath like way more

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.370 
know the permadeath like way more
devastating<00:05:37.240> for<00:05:37.390> players<00:05:37.630> I<00:05:37.870> think<00:05:38.080> it<00:05:38.169> does

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
devastating for players I think it does

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.159 
devastating for players I think it does
um<00:05:38.590> and<00:05:39.070> then<00:05:39.520> consequently<00:05:39.970> the<00:05:40.690> reaction

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
um and then consequently the reaction

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.050 
um and then consequently the reaction
that<00:05:41.289> you<00:05:41.410> have<00:05:41.560> when<00:05:41.710> you<00:05:41.800> succeed<00:05:42.310> makes<00:05:42.880> the

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
that you have when you succeed makes the

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.490 
that you have when you succeed makes the
game<00:05:43.180> that<00:05:43.419> much<00:05:43.570> sweeter<00:05:43.720> so<00:05:44.080> when<00:05:44.229> you<00:05:44.289> win

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
game that much sweeter so when you win

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.469 
game that much sweeter so when you win
it<00:05:44.620> over<00:05:44.740> serious<00:05:45.490> consequences<00:05:46.120> serious

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 
it over serious consequences serious
