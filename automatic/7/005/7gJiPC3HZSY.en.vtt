the<00:01:18.610> excitement<00:01:19.000> of<00:01:19.299> this<00:01:19.420> piece<00:01:19.720> but<00:01:20.229> not

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
the excitement of this piece but not

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.550 
the excitement of this piece but not
conveyed<00:01:21.070> so<00:01:21.610> much<00:01:21.790> through<00:01:22.030> speed<00:01:22.330> and<00:01:22.690> not

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
conveyed so much through speed and not

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.649 
conveyed so much through speed and not
conveyed<00:01:23.920> so<00:01:24.070> much<00:01:24.250> through<00:01:24.580> sheer<00:01:25.270> physical

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
conveyed so much through sheer physical

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.899 
conveyed so much through sheer physical
excitement<00:01:26.350> as<00:01:26.440> through<00:01:27.400> differences

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
excitement as through differences

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.050 
excitement as through differences
because<00:01:28.810> I<00:01:29.020> got<00:01:29.500> a<00:01:29.530> very<00:01:29.890> strong<00:01:30.729> sense<00:01:30.940> of

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
because I got a very strong sense of

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.620 
because I got a very strong sense of
motoric<00:01:31.570> energy<00:01:32.080> and<00:01:32.320> a<00:01:32.950> kind<00:01:33.159> of<00:01:33.220> power<00:01:33.450> but<00:01:34.450> I

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
motoric energy and a kind of power but I

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.039 
motoric energy and a kind of power but I
didn't<00:01:34.960> hear<00:01:35.610> differences<00:01:36.610> and<00:01:36.850> that's<00:01:37.630> where

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
didn't hear differences and that's where

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.580 
didn't hear differences and that's where
the<00:01:38.920> music<00:01:39.040> I<00:01:39.430> think<00:01:39.729> is<00:01:40.090> most<00:01:40.390> important<00:01:41.140> the

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
the music I think is most important the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.170 
the music I think is most important the
thing<00:01:41.799> that's<00:01:41.979> very<00:01:42.190> hard<00:01:42.490> in<00:01:42.610> this<00:01:42.729> is<00:01:42.940> to

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
thing that's very hard in this is to

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.910 
thing that's very hard in this is to
play<00:01:43.360> legato<00:01:43.540> I'm<00:01:43.869> sorry<00:01:44.049> we'll<00:01:44.440> do<00:01:44.560> this<00:01:44.710> over

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
play legato I'm sorry we'll do this over

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:57.090 
play legato I'm sorry we'll do this over
time<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:46.030> play<00:01:46.210> legato<00:01:55.200> find<00:01:56.200> a<00:01:56.320> way<00:01:56.500> but<00:01:56.950> you

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
time to play legato find a way but you

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.260 
time to play legato find a way but you
see<00:01:57.130> if<00:01:57.340> you<00:01:57.429> put<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:57.670> pedal<00:01:57.880> on<00:01:58.440> you<00:01:59.440> get<00:01:59.590> this

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.510 

that's<00:02:03.540> why<00:02:03.690> it's<00:02:03.810> hard<00:02:03.960> because<00:02:04.520> nobody

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
that's why it's hard because nobody

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.260 
that's why it's hard because nobody
really<00:02:05.730> knows<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:07.790> and<00:02:08.790> the<00:02:08.940> same<00:02:09.119> time

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
really knows this is and the same time

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.180 
really knows this is and the same time

Beethoven sonatas which is most
obsessively<00:02:35.520> based<00:02:35.820> around<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.270> single<00:02:36.600> figure

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
obsessively based around a single figure

obsessively based around a single figure
so<00:02:37.200> music<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.250> easily<00:02:38.460> degenerate<00:02:39.270> into<00:02:39.960> a

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
so music and to easily degenerate into a

so music and to easily degenerate into a
trade<00:02:40.830> is<00:02:41.610> something<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:42.060> people<00:02:42.180> have<00:02:42.360> a

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
trade is something that people have a

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.290 
trade is something that people have a
knack<00:02:42.630> for<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:43.230> something<00:02:43.710> that<00:02:44.300> becomes

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
knack for and something that becomes

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.110 
knack for and something that becomes
something<00:02:45.810> relatively<00:02:46.500> limited<00:02:46.950> narrow<00:02:47.610> and

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
something relatively limited narrow and

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.680 
something relatively limited narrow and
not<00:02:48.990> open<00:02:49.320> to<00:02:49.500> larger<00:02:50.490> influences<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.540> I

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
not open to larger influences and I

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.790 
not open to larger influences and I
think<00:02:52.020> that<00:02:52.290> what<00:02:53.180> but<00:02:54.180> Martin<00:02:54.540> is<00:02:54.780> trying<00:02:55.650> to

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
think that what but Martin is trying to

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.020 
think that what but Martin is trying to
do<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.400> trying<00:02:56.850> to<00:02:56.970> integrate<00:02:57.300> music<00:02:58.050> and
