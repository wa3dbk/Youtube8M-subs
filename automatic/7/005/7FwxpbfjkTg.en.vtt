00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:10.590 
numbers and the numbers are bad but I
don't<00:04:09.730> think<00:04:09.850> it's<00:04:10.000> a<00:04:10.060> chronic<00:04:10.420> problem

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
don't think it's a chronic problem

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.000 
don't think it's a chronic problem
because<00:04:11.049> here's<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.410> numbers<00:04:11.680> from<00:04:11.799> last

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
shots for an 8 55 save percentage that's

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.200 
shots for an 8 55 save percentage that's
miles<00:04:20.500> better<00:04:20.950> than<00:04:21.070> what<00:04:21.310> it<00:04:21.430> is<00:04:21.459> so<00:04:21.880> because

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
miles better than what it is so because

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.790 
miles better than what it is so because
Reimers<00:04:22.600> short-handed<00:04:23.050> numbers<00:04:23.320> really

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
Reimers short-handed numbers really

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.980 
Reimers short-handed numbers really
really<00:04:24.160> stink<00:04:24.520> this<00:04:24.729> season<00:04:25.120> I<00:04:25.300> don't<00:04:25.510> think

really stink this season I don't think

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.070 
really stink this season I don't think
it's<00:04:26.229> just<00:04:26.500> a<00:04:26.590> trait

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
it's just a trait

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.210 
it's just a trait
his<00:04:27.229> game<00:04:27.409> because<00:04:27.590> if<00:04:27.800> you<00:04:27.889> look<00:04:28.009> at<00:04:28.129> his
