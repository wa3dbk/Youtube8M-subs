00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 It is very hard for each of 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.540
 participants we are all waiting for the start of the whistle 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:14.040

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.230
 scandal the day before 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.840
 so cool you play now you can 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.480
 punching 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:32.029
 ammonium daniel sturridge centimeters 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:36.200
 sends the ball from the bar a moment in order 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:39.440
 to account in the game was open in favor 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:43.160
 to the forefathers of football and starridge 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.190
 very cool punched and at hand but 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.080
 or aval I am up to 1 and here is luck 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.989
 smiled the honduras team 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:57.079
 yes even there is not at hand but by 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:59.899
 goalkeeper board I spend it there 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.570
 pessimistic looking around drove the ball 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.059
 it seemed a net gate 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:10.119
 starridge room misses out very 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.119
 advantageous position to get out 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.240
 with everyone else and show banks 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.880
 turning it was great being good luck on 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.110
 the taste is only 20 years old this guy here 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.310
 look at people like him on the hatch show on 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.689
 Jack Wilshere 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.470
 Of course on Alex Oxlade Chamberlain on 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.830
 Erohina Sterling 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.480
 on the outskirts of his half of the field old 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.720
 which is very cool 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:43.300
 but then at the old bridge which is not 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:45.970
 it turns out this combination is nine 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.760
 very cool here the ball handled and how 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.220
 quickly decided what was not in the transfer 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.440
 and the main tournament for was called otherwise 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.800
 for example, I am now breaking through the pain of the army 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.770
 forward and and whether the wolf will and not yet 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.050
 Now it was very close to the national team 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.240
 England to open a match account 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:08.200
 lies on the lawn maynard and gene attack 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.950
 continues bartley yes there is no wonder that 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.900
 football player got his legs here 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.770
 he reached out and immediately felt though 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:21.160
 now on repeat we understand that 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:26.990
 probably not immediately to the national team player 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:29.570
 Honduras came to that very complicated sheets 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.030
 there was a mara that feeds on a turn 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.910
 hit on the lawn football team 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.740
 Honduras but he doesn't seem to notice 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.800
 show the old man for the third time in 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:43.100
 breaks combination of England and 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.510
 Jerry Benson, she asks to help another 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.260
 time let's look at this combination 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.860
 filing and and starridge squander another 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.590
 episode 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.610
 and so here are scientists from cambridge 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.730
 University based on statistics 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.450
 clarified 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:03.850
 why would the English find it difficult to 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.850
 Brazil show your maximum
