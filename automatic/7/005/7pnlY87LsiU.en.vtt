 very nice running short with 100 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.430

 acknowledge aspiration and end in one 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.670
 Post recording with 160 millimeters 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.460
 Slice brake bigger then we do 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.430
 continue with the seat tube scott

 used here 31 6 mm diameter and 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.360
 a clamp with 34 9 millimeters 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.000

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.310
 We continue with the camp here 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.990

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:11.340
 that means 41 mm diameter and one 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:14.450
 housing width of 92 or 89 5 mm what 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.040
 god are 489 5 mm 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.950
 That's a very common standard for her 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.129
 have the possibility almost every curve 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.170
 in the country to combine that god for it 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.670
 they are known to their frames very much 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.580
 deliver a lot of accessories 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.840
 for the 2015 models rather that is even 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.220
 become even more I show you

 Now everything is new 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.410
 seatpost here already we have one 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.590
 high quality camera team from synchro 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:47.269
 fit black matt then there is 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.459
 a victory over that is one 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.410
 Carbon and aluminum combination model 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.720
 that means we have one 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.870
 aluminum years and then again 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.930
 a levy wrapped over it then suits 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:07.310
 almost perfect for the seat post and also 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.310
 especially various small parts 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:18.170
 For example , we have one 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.840
 border tax rate that is appropriate 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.850
 beautiful god always know that the 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.440
 Storage shells migrated from the lake 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.970
 tax rate have already been priced in 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.950
 that means it would not have to be here 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.370
 do more by yourself and could do it right away 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.760
 Act without special tools you have to 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:38.510
 in the end only ball bearings 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.860
 and fork conzzeta there is a word about it 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:45.470
 also a very detailed guide 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.690
 including cd just fine again 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.340
 Everything is beautifully described as you what 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.210
 we have to assemble you too 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.340
 always happy to help 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.800
 then we have several saddle clamp here 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.670
 once with quick release or the 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.860
 super light version just with 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.380
 I had the screw before 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.580
 Failed muscle skeleton team 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.280
 I want you now again in detail 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.920
 Show and that are just that 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.800
 a mini around in st right and left the 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.290
 be fastened with a screw 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:19.040
 you have various possibilities that 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:23.030
 whole system with plug axis in 12 x 142 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:26.390
 mm to drive or as the fastest 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:29.930
 variant also provides the matching 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:32.660
 set equal to that means almost like to 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.100
 example already has a run of the very 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.850
 is top quality and the again 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.570
 want to use 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:41.030
 Do you have various options there 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.650
 then adjust the heel to the frame 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.760
 there is still a special story 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.440
 which I think is great 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:50.120
 And that is a special eye what 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.710
 again just about the 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.810
 screw 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.020
 will strengthen you see is a little 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.200
 longer and this is specially made 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.490
 for shimano shadow schaltwerk what i 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.480
 now have prepared briefly here and 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:07.210
 Although you have a way out here and 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.670
 words actually right here as 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.950
 screwed executive and with this 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.230
 part when here he is tuned can you 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.460
 quasi this cantilever here in 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.170
 dismantle from failure 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.420
 and then it could be almost direct 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:24.790
 mount a so-called direct 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:26.880
 Of course, the variant will look quite different 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.660
 send out one shows directly mounted 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.790
 Finally, I want you still 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.640
 let's show how the beautiful piece with 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:38.590
 a spring fork look combined 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:40.240
 can once the cities xl worker that is 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:45.190

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:47.350
 on and the fork crown and the shank 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.710
 from carbon almost the top model of 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.930
 rocksongs for me very chic because you 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.790
 once have the diver white splendor 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:59.670
 interview does that mean then meets as 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:06.460
 Again it was about a second variant 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:10.540
 that's their rock shox zxx then 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:14.620

 aluminum and now here in complete 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.750
 black as I think a whole 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.490
 Nice thing that's it already 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.500
 from our imagination of the scott scale 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.950
 700 rc in the nino edition 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.830
 I summarize it again very briefly 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:32.560
 The part weighs 960 grams 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:34.380
