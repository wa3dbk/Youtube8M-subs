00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hello dear subscribers and viewers 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.750
 youtube channel and this is a test drive tank 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.450
 object 140 which is very similar to the tank 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.370
 t-62 and they are not much from each other 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.640
 The only difference is in only 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.570
 $ 62 is a little bit more and 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.720
 so the tanks are absolutely identical too 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.920
 weapons almost the same armor the same 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:32.130
 dynamics there are few differences 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.110
 between t-60 second and object 140 honestly 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.390
 saying don't even understand why wear 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.570
 exactly the same tank is the same 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.730
 the most that the blue pen writes yes there and 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.280
 red pen writes they both write only 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.710
 different colors are also obtained here 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.829
 two identical tanks only one 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.510
 just a little bit there maybe some details 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.199
 different forms 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.460
 Well, nonsense nonsense seems to me okay let's 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.090
 let's see what all of a 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.570
 represents in battle and what he does 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:07.670
 want able i am sure i even make a difference 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.850
 especially not felt between t-60 torim 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:14.250
 fall and middle 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:20.009
 try to highlight 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:22.500
 on the right we give a small glare and if there 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.860
 will freely try to flash this 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.860
 wing 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.219
 the battle begins 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.600
 and so what is the difference between it seems 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:07.049
 tarim a and object 140 it is less visible 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.869
 yage so even with and he don't notice in 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.940
 In general, so far some kind of difference is lower 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.030
 also absolutely cat gaining speed 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.890
 62 and may of course in the future they lead 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:23.190
 some changes but I at least 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:26.400
 I donâ€™t hope so far so far 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.760
 appeared on the light tanchik try 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.849
 now 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.269
 fly under the slide because ours already 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:36.299
 I especially look ahead there 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:39.110
 no growth they have and no try 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.110
 push then 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:53.150
 the tank is fast so if I go to the base 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:57.010
 always have time to come back in general try 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:00.200
 go now to the rear of the enemy the most important thing 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.290
 Now that I am under the juice we do not 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.470
 get here most likely she went 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.470
 here 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:16.300
 all we leave we leave we leave kindness not 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.400
 it will turn out therefore one more spittle 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.209
 make and leave we leave 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:26.700
 and try to get this potato here 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:31.300
 we go in the rear 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.580
 we get one more tank and priority 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:39.330
 there for us becomes t57 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:42.430
 I will harp constantly beat him in the rink 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.940
 you need to kill him immediately because he has 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.420
 drum and this priority tanks i 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:54.310
 feel us behind now 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:56.620
 but already grab 1 try to pick up t57 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.890
 we have it is not very good 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.890
 it turns out 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.180
 got us good weapons fast 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.870
 recharging try to deal with 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.989
 Fri-shkoy 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.840
 I think for us this problem will not 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.560
 here everything is very simple downloaded and logged in 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.180
 to her rear 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:22.449
 I think so everyone would have done literate 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.449
 player and get 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.350
 move on 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:39.450
 try to help on the other flank because 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:42.100
 that this flank, as you can see, we broke through 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.790
 let's see now what we have left 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.790
 other flank 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:52.600
 I really hope that the team will give me 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:56.620
 take a warrior for this fight we are with you 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:59.290
 remember that the tank has properties 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.260
 good masking is that in the beginning 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:06.040
 the fight you so it was clear that even your 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:09.520
 bump here but i don't know how i f 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:15.010
 100 of course. I saw it she bled 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.720
 it was good in general we go and collect 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.750
 fragen 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:22.150
 see object 268 we don't need it yet 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:26.650
 because we need artillery she 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:34.060
 Stopudovo help you and here she will try 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:40.380
 its recharge recharge with ease 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:40.380
 we get artillery will remain 268 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:45.839
 special I will not shoot him because 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:50.179
 that I know I didnâ€™t like him 

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:50.179
 wait until the fabric is another shot 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:06:02.240
 Well, that's fine, I'll tell you two 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:04.800
 absolutely identical tank that's all i 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.699
 frankly the differences don't even particularly 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.330
 felt 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:13.080
 162 that object 140 in my opinion on 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.999
 the moment is the same yes maybe better 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.929
 it was possible to play for this fight but 

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:20.879
 At least I introduced my standard to 

00:06:18.929 --> 00:06:22.709
 Generally, thanks for watching you 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:27.319
 laughter subscribe to my channel 

00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:27.319
