00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.980
 hello welcome from the strict 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.900
 proteins for this product then in 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.450
 this video but test a base of 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.420
 proteins the pro crisis of qinetiq has 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.359
 while here we are on a bar that will 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.010
 rather his kinship a substitute drogba 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.660
 wheels a good rhythm gamer rather than a 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.430
 more protein bar between lee but 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.949
 simply because in terms of 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.650
 dosage and ben kids 40 g they do not 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.660
 contain only 10 g of protein then 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.160
 in law away it's not a product that 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.540
 will replace your shaker braye 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.809
 on the other hand it can be advantageous 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.040
 replace a gamer and then any 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.230
 relationship that you can take the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.940
 day especially if you are in addition 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.579
 tomorrow without muscle gain clearly 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.649
 separated from the body supported in a bag then 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.690
 hanternoz agility 1.10 g protein 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.300
 with mainly protein 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.160
 soy protein wade with 14 grams 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.649
 carbohydrates and 9 grams of fluid 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.510
 then high dosage in lipids while 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.890
 just because this product contains 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.570
 25% from where China 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.400
 we have cashew nuts and 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.220
 peanuts for example what makes 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.780
 that inevitably it greatly increases the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.400
 caloric amount and the amount of 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.630
 lipids but take on lipids 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.549
 rather interesting so it's not 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.460
 frankly I do not have more for the last 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.470
 I am here on a fruit scent is far 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.930
 in plainois blue already said and then the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:30.060
 fruit here from the date and we see we have 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:32.240
 out in a coating that feels the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.240
 rights 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.140
 so I do not feel the date the meaning palio 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.729
 on the other hand one does not say where from 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.130
 black 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.710
 sakho style it looks like anyway 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.179
 and any greenhouse bar in launois 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.579
 kobayashi in common are therefore rather 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.590
 rather not bad in terms of taste no 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.159
 rather positive at this level after a 2 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.670
 e ledy 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.990
 come on a 10 g of barbarian protein 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.130
 so that is before more proteins etc 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.350
 a cereal bar you can 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.780
 save their first so rather positive 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.069
 for the bo rather positive for the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.649
 composition to have a bar that 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:11.170
 will instead replace a small meal or a 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.610
 webinars shaker but not to 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.079
 use to replace the shaker of 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.269
 pure protein so now 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:18.370
 appointments those who file tests 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.470

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.209
 on this test of conciliation and well 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.040
 sure all our sad but finally
