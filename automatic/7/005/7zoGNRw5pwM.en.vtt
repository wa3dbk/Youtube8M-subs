today<00:01:53.070> which<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.689> know<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.259> a

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
today which is you know it is a

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.980 
today which is you know it is a
fantastic<00:01:56.100> tool<00:01:56.490> for<00:01:56.909> capturing<00:01:57.630> your<00:01:57.750> notes

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
fantastic tool for capturing your notes

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.319 
fantastic tool for capturing your notes
capturing<00:01:58.560> anything<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.159> hear<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.520> say<00:01:59.759> and

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
capturing anything you hear and say and

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.660 
capturing anything you hear and say and
and<00:02:01.049> then<00:02:01.170> being<00:02:01.320> able<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.740> interact<00:02:01.770> directly

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
and then being able to interact directly

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.060 
and then being able to interact directly
with<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.210> tap<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.990> get<00:02:04.350> exactly<00:02:04.829> the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
with that tap and get exactly the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.520 
with that tap and get exactly the
information

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
information

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.070 
information
that<00:02:05.740> you've<00:02:05.860> captured<00:02:06.670> so<00:02:07.570> he's<00:02:07.869> like<00:02:08.020> the

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
that you've captured so he's like the

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.870 
that you've captured so he's like the
prime<00:02:08.410> example<00:02:09.039> there<00:02:09.190> is<00:02:09.220> you're<00:02:09.520> taking

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
prime example there is you're taking

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.490 
prime example there is you're taking
notes<00:02:10.060> during<00:02:10.179> a<00:02:10.450> lecture<00:02:10.600> and<00:02:11.050> then<00:02:11.170> you<00:02:11.319> can

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
notes during a lecture and then you can

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.309 
notes during a lecture and then you can
point<00:02:12.160> back<00:02:12.310> up<00:02:12.640> those<00:02:12.819> notes<00:02:13.420> later<00:02:13.780> on<00:02:13.990> and

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
point back up those notes later on and

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.290 
point back up those notes later on and
then<00:02:14.560> it'll<00:02:14.830> play<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.670> part<00:02:15.940> of<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.090> lecture

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
then it'll play the part of a lecture

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.790 
then it'll play the part of a lecture
that's<00:02:16.690> you're<00:02:16.870> pointing<00:02:17.260> at<00:02:17.380> exactly

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
that's you're pointing at exactly

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.960 
that's you're pointing at exactly
college<00:02:18.160> students<00:02:18.490> love<00:02:18.670> it<00:02:18.700> they

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
college students love it they

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.000 
college students love it they
consistently<00:02:19.870> say<00:02:20.080> that<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.319> helps<00:02:20.530> with

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
consistently say that it helps with

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.860 
consistently say that it helps with
their<00:02:21.190> grades<00:02:21.459> they<00:02:21.790> can<00:02:21.940> pay<00:02:22.090> more<00:02:22.450> attention

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
their grades they can pay more attention

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.280 
their grades they can pay more attention
to<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.430> professor<00:02:25.300> and<00:02:25.330> participate<00:02:25.959> more

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
to to the professor and participate more

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.020 
to to the professor and participate more
knowing<00:02:26.920> that<00:02:27.190> they've<00:02:27.340> captured<00:02:27.610> everything

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
knowing that they've captured everything

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.460 
knowing that they've captured everything
that's<00:02:28.360> important<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:28.840> then<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.050> just<00:02:29.200> tap

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
that's important and then you just tap

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.590 
that's important and then you just tap
to<00:02:29.620> get<00:02:29.739> right<00:02:29.920> back<00:02:30.100> up<00:02:30.160> ahead<00:02:30.489> whether<00:02:31.360> it's

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
to get right back up ahead whether it's

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.350 
to get right back up ahead whether it's
on<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.870> paper<00:02:32.020> or<00:02:32.610> we're<00:02:33.610> actually<00:02:33.819> back<00:02:34.150> on

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
on the paper or we're actually back on

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.729 
on the paper or we're actually back on
the<00:02:34.480> desktop<00:02:34.750> environment<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.470> you<00:02:35.530> showed

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
the desktop environment and you showed

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.979 
the desktop environment and you showed
more<00:02:35.920> than<00:02:36.100> 400,000<00:02:36.970> of<00:02:37.090> these<00:02:37.239> we<00:02:37.600> saw<00:02:37.750> more

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
more than 400,000 of these we saw more

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.610 
more than 400,000 of these we saw more
than<00:02:38.019> 400,000<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.840> in<00:02:40.840> part<00:02:41.230> of<00:02:41.320> what<00:02:41.500> we're

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
than 400,000 and in part of what we're

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.560 
than 400,000 and in part of what we're
also<00:02:41.739> doing<00:02:42.010> is<00:02:42.220> making<00:02:42.519> it<00:02:42.790> even<00:02:42.940> easier<00:02:43.180> for
