00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
frustrating aspect of this is that we

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.539 
frustrating aspect of this is that we
are<00:01:24.570> very<00:01:25.320> good<00:01:25.500> at<00:01:25.650> helping<00:01:25.830> them<00:01:26.159> right<00:01:26.340> now

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
and we are getting better but there is

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.280 
and we are getting better but there is
nothing<00:01:28.860> not<00:01:29.280> specific<00:01:30.210> reversal<00:01:30.869> for<00:01:31.140> those

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
nothing not specific reversal for those

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.190 
nothing not specific reversal for those
men<00:01:31.560> it's<00:01:31.710> important<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.600> to<00:01:33.600> show<00:01:33.869> them<00:01:34.170> that

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
men it's important to to show them that

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.260 
men it's important to to show them that
we<00:01:34.530> have<00:01:34.770> many<00:01:34.979> other<00:01:35.070> patients<00:01:35.700> who<00:01:35.790> we<00:01:35.939> help

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
we have many other patients who we help

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.840 
we have many other patients who we help
but<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.810> takes<00:01:37.020> years<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.590> actually<00:01:37.860> go<00:01:38.640> back

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
but it takes years to actually go back

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.359 
but it takes years to actually go back
to<00:01:39.060> normal<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.689> think<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:40.110> some<00:01:40.409> men<00:01:40.710> will

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
to normal and I think that some men will

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.889 
to normal and I think that some men will
probably<00:01:41.820> never<00:01:41.970> go<00:01:42.270> back<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.659> normal

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
probably never go back to a normal

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.560 
probably never go back to a normal
erectile<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.070> sexual<00:01:44.430> function<00:01:44.880> never<00:01:45.329> go

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
erectile and sexual function never go

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.990 
erectile and sexual function never go
back<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.990> don't<00:01:46.530> think<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.250> some<00:01:47.280> man<00:01:47.790> is

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
back I don't think that in some man is

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.789 
back I don't think that in some man is
possible<00:01:48.600> because<00:01:48.720> some<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.500> men<00:01:49.649> I've

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
possible because some of the men I've

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.620 
possible because some of the men I've
seen<00:01:50.009> five<00:01:50.310> years<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.000> they<00:01:51.119> stopped<00:01:51.420> taking

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
seen five years and they stopped taking

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.170 
seen five years and they stopped taking
