00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.690
 my friends drinking another video 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.940
 in this isolated notation that you can 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.220
 let's play with others 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.859
 smartphones you in this application you 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.109
 can control up to 6 martins or 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.800
 you have a voice and can add more 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.900
 six 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.970
 What this application does more 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.490
 problems imagine what you have 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.650
 children or even by starting you 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.210
 offer a mobile phone to someone and 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.430
 this environment application because with 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.750
 application and now let's show you what 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.670
 she does is like this 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.430
 Look, I put another smartphone. 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.690
 aquino the other day to take the test 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.100
 In Thor Relative I can see the 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.149
 smartphone activity for example 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.870
 even though at that time an activity 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.090
 50% on facebook year at birth that are 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.030
 facebook pages in the congress and 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.010
 then it is all the actions that you 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.430
 can still see more you can 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.340
 in this intention can still control 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:13.189
 hence the name of Ricardo in the other in the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:17.009
 phone but you can add here 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:19.650
 Do not shoot, it's business. 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.920
 evaluated but I already took the application that 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.409
 it was to show you a situation and 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.530
 you can add just as days 6 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.040
 and 16 other mobile phones and you can 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.020
 create is the name you want for this 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.210
 just put in a same email when 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.890
 They will do the installation and I will 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.439
 ask has gone through process and 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.869
 use honestly and automatically know 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.579
 that you are am 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.040
 or want to control chaos 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.130
 marketing and what I can do is 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.649
 pmas eudes never the tac application 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.960
 can accurately say no 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.570
 can identify because it recognizes 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.210
 that the other one speaks badly touch this 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.140
 in this case it's the ricardo he calls 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.840
 Ricardo does not have the application and I was 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.530
 to give this information and then another 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.660
 situation 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.730
 You can also lock your smartphone. 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.710
 so you can block the 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.500
 but you do not even have 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:20.580
 but it is beyond this five more you can 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.250
 can do is set a 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.140
 calendar with a disk team is that this 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.990
 application is a measure that 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.600
 control your children and say that 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.760
 during the period of school can not 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.450
 use your smartphone for example 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.270
 then you can only tie 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.120
 set the sleeping time and I will not 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:46.380
 stop using your smartphone time out 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.870
 that's enough, and it's time for what you 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.760
 you can do here in barranquilla 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.590
 can say all the applications that 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.350
 installed on your smartphone 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.750
 and this is because it may be 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.310
 you do this is the Achilles panel 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.440
 facilities around 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.550
 that is you can define here 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.560
 applications that always leave the fan 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.140
 on the other side on the smell is enough you 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.090
 stay here is that after doing here 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.330
 seen in any of the windows 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.920
 next to xbox you can define here 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.070
 an application being created 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.040
 imagine that they do not want the supporter 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:26.340
 another year 2 facebook and it turned out to be 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.040
 within the limits of the calendar 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.900
 is that being as well as possible 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.020
 see a simple application quite 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.120
 simple is its interface and then has 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.270
 here in the state can take more of the kits 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.340
 that's what tells us and the more risk with 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.500
 children and now it's up to you 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.110
 you can put it on 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.420
 does not encourage anyone but everyone has used 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.580
 some ideas and then booking passed 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.820
 You can set new passed and then 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.280
 the kid ie we will not use 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:59.160
 now the application is very simple I'm going 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.260
 leave in the winck description for you 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.980
 can download the application is 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.170
 the team hi there and then you only have 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.720
 to install in other March with the same 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.120
 has passed and I will automatically set 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.980
 and will know and will appear is that the 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.960
 other mobile phones that advice gives a 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.970
 name you want I can stay only at the level of 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.380
 example my friends and was thus one more 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.870
 video to have a status plus the video 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.790
 Do not forget to subscribe to the channel. 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.790
