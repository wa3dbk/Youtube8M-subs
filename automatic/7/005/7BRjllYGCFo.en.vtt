so<00:01:47.159> many<00:01:47.460> people<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.530> boxing

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
so many people in boxing

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.510 
so many people in boxing

and asking me all these questions and so
I<00:01:54.550> figure<00:01:55.330> a<00:01:55.570> great<00:01:55.930> way<00:01:56.170> to<00:01:56.650> ask<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.400> question

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
I figure a great way to ask the question

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.090 
I figure a great way to ask the question
because<00:01:57.970> I<00:01:58.540> think<00:01:59.080> if<00:01:59.500> you<00:01:59.590> could<00:01:59.740> just<00:01:59.770> have<00:02:00.070> a

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
because I think if you could just have a

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.220 
because I think if you could just have a
conversation<00:02:00.400> you<00:02:00.940> know<00:02:01.240> it's<00:02:01.810> going<00:02:02.020> to<00:02:02.080> be

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
conversation you know it's going to be

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:08.250 
conversation you know it's going to be
easier<00:02:02.550> to<00:02:03.780> do<00:02:04.780> so<00:02:05.740> I<00:02:06.450> would<00:02:07.450> love<00:02:07.690> it<00:02:07.900> if<00:02:08.050> you
