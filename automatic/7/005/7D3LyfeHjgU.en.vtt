the golden our mystery clock and it was
a<00:00:31.710> mystery<00:00:32.070> because<00:00:32.279> there's<00:00:32.730> no<00:00:32.940> apparent

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
motor and it's not as difficult once you

motor and it's not as difficult once you
see<00:00:40.320> how<00:00:40.500> they<00:00:40.739> work<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.250> how<00:00:41.340> they<00:00:42.059> work<00:00:42.300> is

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
see how they work and how they work is

see how they work and how they work is
the<00:00:43.110> actual<00:00:43.770> glass<00:00:44.270> itself<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.570> what<00:00:45.960> moves

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the actual glass itself is what moves

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.590 
the actual glass itself is what moves
and<00:00:46.879> the<00:00:47.879> glass<00:00:48.149> moves<00:00:48.570> by<00:00:49.050> way<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.640> this<00:00:50.640> we

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
and the glass moves by way of this we

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.290 
and the glass moves by way of this we
have<00:00:51.719> another<00:00:51.989> one<00:00:52.199> here<00:00:52.379> apart<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:53.550> giant

have another one here apart this giant

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.869 
have another one here apart this giant
ring<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.530> goes<00:00:55.680> all<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.010> way<00:00:56.100> around<00:00:56.309> the

glass here's the glass here what this

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.799 
glass here's the glass here what this
ring<00:01:00.180> has<00:01:00.420> gear<00:01:00.930> teeth<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.660> there<00:01:03.660> it

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
ring has gear teeth in it and there it

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.260 
ring has gear teeth in it and there it
is<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.710> glass<00:01:05.040> sits<00:01:05.790> inside<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:08.060> system<00:01:09.060> side

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
is the glass sits inside the system side

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.420 
is the glass sits inside the system side
here<00:01:09.689> ring<00:01:09.900> like<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.770> supposed<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.340> be

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
here ring like that it's supposed to be

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.580 
here ring like that it's supposed to be
it's<00:01:11.939> supposed<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.299> be<00:01:12.390> adhesive<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.170> if

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
it's supposed to be adhesive on this if

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.230 
it's supposed to be adhesive on this if
you<00:01:13.650> have<00:01:13.890> one<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.189> has<00:01:14.760> come<00:01:14.850> off<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
you have one that has come off the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.330 
you have one that has come off the
adhesive<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.320> got<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.590> reattach<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:17.250> and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
adhesive you got to reattach it and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.730 
adhesive you got to reattach it and
probably<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> rearview<00:01:18.509> mirror<00:01:19.140> cement

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
probably a rearview mirror cement

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.710 
probably a rearview mirror cement
something<00:01:20.130> like<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.460> will<00:01:20.610> work<00:01:20.640> fine<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.299> if

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
something like that will work fine is if

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.350 
something like that will work fine is if
you<00:01:21.840> don't<00:01:22.049> really<00:01:23.009> pin<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.580> liter<00:01:23.820> lose<00:01:24.090> time

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
you don't really pin a liter lose time

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.609 
you don't really pin a liter lose time
or<00:01:24.570> gain<00:01:24.750> time<00:01:26.570> but<00:01:27.570> anyway<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.290> meshes

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
or gain time but anyway and that meshes

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.560 
or gain time but anyway and that meshes
with<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.250> gear<00:01:29.579> which<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.000> down<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.420> base

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
with this gear which is down in the base

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.539 
with this gear which is down in the base
of<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.900> clock<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.380> meshes<00:01:31.560> with<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.040> gear<00:01:32.340> of

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
of the clock it meshes with that gear of

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.289 
of the clock it meshes with that gear of
this<00:01:32.759> reduction<00:01:33.270> unit<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.579> 1/12<00:01:35.579> rpm

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
this reduction unit this is a 1/12 rpm

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.420 
this reduction unit this is a 1/12 rpm
so<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.750> other<00:01:36.840> words<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.590> will<00:01:37.860> make<00:01:38.100> one

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
so in other words this will make one

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.390 
so in other words this will make one
continuous<00:01:39.240> circle<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.170> 12<00:01:40.710> minutes<00:01:41.220> and

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
continuous circle in 12 minutes and

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.819 
continuous circle in 12 minutes and
that's<00:01:42.240> how<00:01:42.509> slow<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.200> thing<00:01:43.259> goes<00:01:43.619> you

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
that's how slow this thing goes you

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.620 
that's how slow this thing goes you
really<00:01:44.070> can't<00:01:44.340> see<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.610> move<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.060> can<00:01:45.299> you

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
really can't see it move you can you

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.510 
really can't see it move you can you
really<00:01:45.869> concentrate<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.829> see<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.130> you

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
really concentrate on you can see it you

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.880 
really concentrate on you can see it you
know<00:01:47.610> like<00:01:47.790> barely<00:01:48.060> moving<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:49.229> has<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.409> typical

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
this top area because it's a gear right

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.400 
this top area because it's a gear right

behind that skin and if you cut into the

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.940 
behind that skin and if you cut into the
gear<00:03:11.590> it's<00:03:11.800> over<00:03:12.130> but<00:03:12.760> once<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.360> open<00:03:13.390> the

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
gear it's over but once you open the

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.080 
gear it's over but once you open the
transmission<00:03:14.950> up<00:03:15.130> you'll<00:03:15.610> see<00:03:15.850> there's<00:03:16.030> a

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
transmission up you'll see there's a

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.710 
transmission up you'll see there's a
whole<00:03:16.240> pile<00:03:16.540> of<00:03:16.570> gears<00:03:16.990> in<00:03:17.200> here<00:03:17.230> and<00:03:18.300> the<00:03:19.300> gear

you'll notice that the the missing teeth

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.520 
you'll notice that the the missing teeth
and<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.400> gear<00:04:14.610> are<00:04:14.819> in<00:04:15.060> a<00:04:15.180> in<00:04:15.599> a<00:04:15.750> very<00:04:16.019> narrow

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
material on this thing the gear just has

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.290 
material on this thing the gear just has
to<00:04:21.600> be<00:04:21.630> moved<00:04:21.959> up<00:04:22.169> a<00:04:22.320> little<00:04:22.440> bit<00:04:22.770> so<00:04:23.639> what<00:04:24.120> you

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
to be moved up a little bit so what you

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.379 
to be moved up a little bit so what you
do<00:04:24.479> is<00:04:24.750> you<00:04:24.900> take<00:04:25.139> a<00:04:25.380> washer<00:04:26.280> and<00:04:26.490> put<00:04:27.300> it

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
do is you take a washer and put it

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.930 
do is you take a washer and put it
underneath<00:04:27.780> this<00:04:28.410> gear<00:04:28.860> here<00:04:29.310> just<00:04:29.610> a<00:04:29.699> plain

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
underneath this gear here just a plain

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.750 
underneath this gear here just a plain
flat<00:04:30.180> washer<00:04:30.840> what<00:04:31.590> that's<00:04:31.830> going<00:04:32.130> to<00:04:32.310> do<00:04:32.490> is

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
flat washer what that's going to do is

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.500 
flat washer what that's going to do is
lift<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.360> gear<00:04:33.630> up<00:04:33.870> into<00:04:34.380> a<00:04:34.729> unused<00:04:35.729> portion

of the original mangled gear and I'm

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.450 
of the original mangled gear and I'm
going<00:04:40.560> to<00:04:40.620> show<00:04:40.740> you<00:04:40.770> how<00:04:41.010> that's<00:04:41.190> possible

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
going to show you how that's possible

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.750 
going to show you how that's possible
here<00:04:42.000> they<00:04:42.449> left<00:04:42.780> enough<00:04:43.080> room<00:04:43.199> on<00:04:43.620> here<00:04:43.979> that

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
here they left enough room on here that

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.939 
here they left enough room on here that
that's<00:04:44.940> possible<00:04:45.600> to<00:04:45.750> do<00:04:45.930> without<00:04:46.260> destroying

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
that's possible to do without destroying

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.120 
that's possible to do without destroying
it<00:04:47.220> now<00:04:47.850> if<00:04:48.389> you<00:04:49.199> see<00:04:49.530> with<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.740> gears<00:04:49.949> in

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
it now if you see with the gears in

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.730 
it now if you see with the gears in
place<00:04:50.370> you<00:04:50.970> can<00:04:51.180> move<00:04:51.389> this<00:04:51.630> up<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.110> down<00:04:52.199> and

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
place you can move this up and down and

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.640 
place you can move this up and down and
you<00:04:53.280> have<00:04:53.430> plenty<00:04:53.699> of<00:04:53.850> room<00:04:54.169> see<00:04:55.169> how<00:04:55.260> much<00:04:55.410> how

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
much room you have there

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.120 
much room you have there
you<00:04:57.630> just<00:04:57.870> put<00:04:58.020> a<00:04:58.050> washer<00:04:58.530> underneath<00:04:58.979> the

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
you just put a washer underneath the

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.770 
you just put a washer underneath the
gear<00:04:59.340> that<00:04:59.490> my<00:04:59.669> thumb<00:05:00.030> and<00:05:00.150> finger<00:05:00.449> are<00:05:00.600> on

gear that my thumb and finger are on

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.810 
gear that my thumb and finger are on
right<00:05:01.020> now<00:05:01.260> you<00:05:01.860> put<00:05:02.070> a<00:05:02.100> washer<00:05:02.490> under<00:05:02.699> that

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
right now you put a washer under that

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.089 
right now you put a washer under that
it'll<00:05:03.570> move<00:05:03.780> it<00:05:03.960> up<00:05:04.080> a<00:05:04.200> little<00:05:04.320> bit<00:05:04.590> and<00:05:04.740> it

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
it'll move it up a little bit and it

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:06.950 
it'll move it up a little bit and it
won't<00:05:05.310> cause<00:05:05.580> any<00:05:05.820> interference<00:05:06.599> with<00:05:06.840> the

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
won't cause any interference with the

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.750 
won't cause any interference with the
other<00:05:07.110> gear<00:05:07.440> when<00:05:07.860> it<00:05:07.950> will<00:05:08.099> allow<00:05:08.340> it<00:05:08.520> to<00:05:08.610> have

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
other gear when it will allow it to have

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.540 
other gear when it will allow it to have
fresh<00:05:09.180> new<00:05:09.479> teeth<00:05:09.810> to<00:05:10.080> work<00:05:10.260> with<00:05:10.500> this<00:05:11.190> is<00:05:11.400> the

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
fresh new teeth to work with this is the

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.670 
fresh new teeth to work with this is the
phenolic<00:05:12.090> gear<00:05:12.360> right<00:05:12.599> here<00:05:12.630> and<00:05:13.080> that's<00:05:13.470> what

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
phenolic gear right here and that's what

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.080 
phenolic gear right here and that's what
you<00:05:13.740> have<00:05:13.860> to<00:05:13.889> be<00:05:14.070> careful<00:05:14.490> the<00:05:14.700> reason<00:05:15.000> it's

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
you have to be careful the reason it's

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.050 
you have to be careful the reason it's
phenolic<00:05:15.570> it's<00:05:15.720> softer<00:05:16.229> and<00:05:16.410> it<00:05:17.070> so<00:05:17.669> it<00:05:17.789> makes

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
phenolic it's softer and it so it makes

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.570 
phenolic it's softer and it so it makes
the<00:05:18.270> quieter<00:05:18.840> gear<00:05:19.139> train<00:05:19.500> then<00:05:20.280> when<00:05:20.460> you're

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
the quieter gear train then when you're

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.339 
the quieter gear train then when you're
all<00:05:20.729> done<00:05:20.970> you<00:05:21.270> put<00:05:21.630> the<00:05:21.720> thing<00:05:21.930> back<00:05:21.960> together

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 
all done you put the thing back together

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:25.460 
all done you put the thing back together
again<00:05:22.710> and<00:05:23.099> I'm<00:05:23.669> just<00:05:23.910> going<00:05:24.060> to<00:05:24.200> solder<00:05:25.200> it<00:05:25.410> in

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
again and I'm just going to solder it in

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.020 
again and I'm just going to solder it in
just<00:05:25.680> a<00:05:25.770> couple<00:05:25.950> of<00:05:26.099> places<00:05:26.310> to<00:05:26.610> make<00:05:26.760> it<00:05:26.910> so

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
just a couple of places to make it so

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.240 
just a couple of places to make it so
it's<00:05:27.180> easier<00:05:27.450> to<00:05:27.539> take<00:05:27.720> back<00:05:27.960> apart<00:05:28.320> again<00:05:28.560> but

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
it's easier to take back apart again but

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.550 
it's easier to take back apart again but
anyway<00:05:29.520> that's<00:05:29.940> the<00:05:30.200> brief<00:05:31.200> look<00:05:31.470> at

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
anyway that's the brief look at

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.029 
anyway that's the brief look at
repairing<00:05:32.099> the<00:05:32.630> Golden<00:05:33.630> helm<00:05:33.930> and<00:05:34.260> the<00:05:34.320> Golden

if they're in working condition so it's

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.670 
if they're in working condition so it's
worth<00:05:42.479> fooling<00:05:42.900> around<00:05:43.169> with<00:05:43.320> them<00:05:43.440> and
