the car or was the Bahrain one in fact
it's<00:01:16.330> a<00:01:16.450> mistake<00:01:16.630> to<00:01:16.840> think<00:01:17.170> in<00:01:17.380> those<00:01:17.530> terms

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
it's a mistake to think in those terms

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:20.730 
it's a mistake to think in those terms
because<00:01:18.789> it<00:01:18.910> wasn't<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.300> same<00:01:19.539> car<00:01:19.869> at<00:01:20.530> those

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
because it wasn't the same car at those

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.510 
because it wasn't the same car at those
tracks<00:01:21.270> between<00:01:22.270> Bahrain<00:01:23.110> and<00:01:23.409> China<00:01:23.890> we

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
tracks between Bahrain and China we

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.090 
tracks between Bahrain and China we
improved<00:01:24.940> the<00:01:25.060> car<00:01:25.330> quite<00:01:25.630> substantially<00:01:26.470> so

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
improved the car quite substantially so

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.770 
improved the car quite substantially so
even<00:01:27.369> though<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.640> track<00:01:27.880> characteristics

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
even though the track characteristics

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.710 
even though the track characteristics
changed<00:01:29.290> so<00:01:29.950> did<00:01:30.070> our<00:01:30.250> car<00:01:30.520> and<00:01:30.820> that's<00:01:31.540> the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
changed so did our car and that's the

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.859 
changed so did our car and that's the
key<00:01:31.960> to<00:01:32.650> having<00:01:32.860> a<00:01:33.189> successful<00:01:33.250> season<00:01:34.180> you

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
key to having a successful season you

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.690 
key to having a successful season you
need<00:01:35.020> to<00:01:35.140> keep<00:01:35.350> improving<00:01:35.710> your<00:01:36.040> car<00:01:36.280> at<00:01:36.430> every

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
need to keep improving your car at every

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.760 
need to keep improving your car at every
race<00:01:36.909> if<00:01:37.630> we<00:01:37.810> can<00:01:37.960> do<00:01:38.110> that<00:01:38.140> successfully

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
race if we can do that successfully

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.800 
race if we can do that successfully
bringing<00:01:39.520> a<00:01:39.729> meaningful<00:01:40.210> amount<00:01:40.570> of

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
bringing a meaningful amount of

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.660 
bringing a meaningful amount of
performance<00:01:41.350> to<00:01:41.500> every<00:01:41.740> one<00:01:41.890> of<00:01:42.010> those<00:01:42.100> races

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
performance to every one of those races

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.300 
performance to every one of those races
then<00:01:43.270> we<00:01:43.930> will<00:01:44.110> keep<00:01:44.320> seeing<00:01:44.710> a<00:01:44.830> step<00:01:45.070> forward

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
then we will keep seeing a step forward

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.539 
then we will keep seeing a step forward
and<00:01:46.030> that<00:01:46.270> will<00:01:46.509> describe<00:01:46.960> the<00:01:47.290> true<00:01:47.560> f-14<00:01:48.220> t

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
and that will describe the true f-14 t
