00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.669
 hello talk in today's video I bring you 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.529
 a small basket that I have prepared as a gift 

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:10.440
 that you have asked me enough 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.330
 will teach and then well I teach you 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.430
 how I prepare the things that I put 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.560
 etcetera etcetera and the autonomous to 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.419
 start the first thing you have to do is 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.419
 ride the different ones come like this 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.200
 Y 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.090
 bought in the naval market 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.170
 as you see when you open it directly 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.870
 and in theory it is thought for what 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.400
 you will not know how to look at the system that 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.620
 carries 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.630
 it's like that then when you carry it in here 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.630
 a whole lid 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.840
 well, it does not move well, we're going to 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.840
 start putting things 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.930
 a baking paper and I use well this 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.930
 onion paper 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.890
 but good this range 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.890
 it would also be cool 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.110
 well then the first thing I'm going to 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.110
 cider is going to be the cider 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.290
 I'm going to put the little package this 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.290
 polvorones 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.269
 I'm going to put the two nougat 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:31.700
 wipes these sponges that I bought 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.700
 in artisan aromas 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:45.870

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.870

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.020

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.150
 Well, I'm seeing how the 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.760
 small basket 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.540
 with all the little things I think it has 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.540
 pretty good looking 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.530

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.480
