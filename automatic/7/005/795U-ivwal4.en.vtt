00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:06.970 
okay so the next skill that we're going

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.480 
okay so the next skill that we're going
to<00:00:07.029> talk<00:00:07.180> about<00:00:07.210> is<00:00:07.630> the<00:00:07.870> tip<00:00:08.080> pass<00:00:08.320> now<00:00:09.040> tip

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:09.490 
to talk about is the tip pass now tip

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.180 
to talk about is the tip pass now tip
pass<00:00:09.670> is<00:00:09.940> particularly<00:00:10.360> valuable<00:00:11.110> when<00:00:11.889> when

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.190 
pass is particularly valuable when when

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.870 
pass is particularly valuable when when
in<00:00:12.310> multi-ball<00:00:12.820> okay<00:00:14.040> what<00:00:15.040> what<00:00:15.309> it<00:00:15.519> passes

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:15.880 
in multi-ball okay what what it passes

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
in multi-ball okay what what it passes
basically<00:00:16.390> is<00:00:16.840> when<00:00:17.110> you've<00:00:17.260> got<00:00:17.439> the<00:00:18.900> when

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
basically is when you've got the when

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.560 
basically is when you've got the when
you've<00:00:20.020> got<00:00:20.199> the<00:00:20.320> ball<00:00:21.300> trapped<00:00:22.300> on<00:00:22.480> the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
you've got the ball trapped on the

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.939 
you've got the ball trapped on the
flipper<00:00:22.780> or<00:00:24.840> you're<00:00:25.840> trying<00:00:26.080> to<00:00:26.230> pass<00:00:26.380> it<00:00:26.590> over

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949 
flipper or you're trying to pass it over

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.640 
flipper or you're trying to pass it over
and<00:00:27.250> we<00:00:28.150> hit<00:00:28.420> the<00:00:28.510> ball<00:00:28.660> with<00:00:28.869> the<00:00:28.930> end<00:00:29.230> right

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
and we hit the ball with the end right

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.410 
and we hit the ball with the end right
at<00:00:29.800> the<00:00:29.859> end<00:00:29.980> of<00:00:30.039> our<00:00:30.160> flipper<00:00:30.609> just<00:00:31.060> then<00:00:31.180> it's

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
at the end of our flipper just then it's

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.140 
at the end of our flipper just then it's
tiny<00:00:31.840> small<00:00:32.800> little<00:00:33.070> here<00:00:33.280> so<00:00:33.760> it's<00:00:33.879> literally

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
tiny small little here so it's literally

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.240 
tiny small little here so it's literally
just<00:00:34.269> a<00:00:34.540> butt<00:00:35.260> that<00:00:35.410> can<00:00:35.739> you<00:00:35.800> see<00:00:35.949> the<00:00:36.070> the

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
just a butt that can you see the the

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.440 
just a butt that can you see the the
slight<00:00:36.550> difference<00:00:36.910> in<00:00:37.000> the<00:00:37.120> tip<00:00:37.300> in<00:00:37.390> the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
slight difference in the tip in the

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.540 
slight difference in the tip in the
flipper<00:00:37.780> it's<00:00:38.170> just<00:00:38.410> a<00:00:38.530> a<00:00:38.649> really<00:00:39.280> small

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
flipper it's just a a really small

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.479 
flipper it's just a a really small
little<00:00:40.210> touch<00:00:40.480> so<00:00:41.320> I'm<00:00:41.410> just<00:00:41.590> if<00:00:41.829> you<00:00:42.160> watch<00:00:42.309> my

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
little touch so I'm just if you watch my

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:43.260 
little touch so I'm just if you watch my
hand<00:00:42.640> watch<00:00:42.730> my<00:00:42.880> hand

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
hand watch my hand

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.030 
hand watch my hand
I'm<00:00:43.390> just<00:00:43.780> really<00:00:44.170> it's<00:00:44.320> just<00:00:44.380> a<00:00:44.620> really<00:00:44.920> small

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
I'm just really it's just a really small

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.240 
I'm just really it's just a really small
movement<00:00:45.820> to<00:00:46.540> move<00:00:47.530> the<00:00:47.680> flipper<00:00:47.980> just<00:00:48.160> that

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
movement to move the flipper just that

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.440 
movement to move the flipper just that
little<00:00:48.520> bit<00:00:48.670> so<00:00:48.820> you<00:00:48.879> don't<00:00:49.059> want<00:00:49.180> it<00:00:49.239> to<00:00:49.329> do

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
little bit so you don't want it to do

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.060 
little bit so you don't want it to do
too<00:00:49.690> much<00:00:49.870> join<00:00:50.530> multiple<00:00:52.290> and<00:00:53.290> we'll<00:00:53.890> cover

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
too much join multiple and we'll cover

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.119 
too much join multiple and we'll cover
this<00:00:54.250> properly<00:00:54.579> number<00:00:54.879> in<00:00:55.030> a<00:00:55.120> bit<00:00:55.300> but<00:00:55.570> I<00:00:56.129> tend

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
this properly number in a bit but I tend

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.880 
this properly number in a bit but I tend
to<00:00:57.690> make<00:00:58.690> it<00:00:59.340> I<00:01:00.340> tend<00:01:01.239> to<00:01:01.329> play<00:01:02.110> it<00:01:02.379> in<00:01:02.559> the<00:01:02.680> same

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
to make it I tend to play it in the same

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.619 
to make it I tend to play it in the same
way<00:01:03.070> as<00:01:03.219> I<00:01:03.340> do<00:01:03.399> in<00:01:03.670> the<00:01:03.760> single<00:01:04.030> wall<00:01:04.119> play<00:01:04.390> a

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
way as I do in the single wall play a

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.389 
way as I do in the single wall play a
lot<00:01:04.989> of<00:01:05.080> people<00:01:05.289> play<00:01:05.440> multi<00:01:05.770> ball<00:01:05.950> and<00:01:06.070> you

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 
lot of people play multi ball and you

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:07.770 
lot of people play multi ball and you
know<00:01:06.520> they<00:01:06.759> just<00:01:06.970> they're<00:01:07.119> just<00:01:07.149> hitting<00:01:07.420> all

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
know they just they're just hitting all

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.570 
know they just they're just hitting all
the<00:01:08.020> pores<00:01:08.229> around<00:01:08.410> but<00:01:09.190> what's<00:01:09.369> can<00:01:09.550> happen

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
the pores around but what's can happen

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.550 
the pores around but what's can happen
invariably<00:01:10.300> in<00:01:10.509> that<00:01:10.660> situation<00:01:11.259> is<00:01:11.380> you're

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
invariably in that situation is you're

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.169 
invariably in that situation is you're
going<00:01:11.649> to<00:01:11.709> lose<00:01:11.920> one<00:01:12.100> of<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.250> ball<00:01:12.399> so<00:01:12.670> what<00:01:13.149> I

00:01:13.169 --> 00:01:13.179 
going to lose one of the ball so what I

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:17.370 
going to lose one of the ball so what I
try<00:01:13.450> to<00:01:13.479> do<00:01:13.780> is<00:01:14.020> if<00:01:14.830> I<00:01:14.979> can<00:01:15.250> he's<00:01:15.910> get<00:01:16.600> get<00:01:17.140> into

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
try to do is if I can he's get get into

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.800 
try to do is if I can he's get get into
a<00:01:17.440> position<00:01:17.560> where<00:01:18.160> I've<00:01:18.970> got<00:01:19.209> one<00:01:19.450> trapped

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
a position where I've got one trapped

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.240 
a position where I've got one trapped
and<00:01:20.080> then<00:01:20.170> I<00:01:20.259> can<00:01:20.410> play<00:01:20.590> with<00:01:20.800> the<00:01:20.890> other<00:01:21.009> ball

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
and then I can play with the other ball

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
and then I can play with the other ball
okay<00:01:21.849> so<00:01:22.810> in<00:01:23.080> this<00:01:23.590> situation<00:01:23.830> if<00:01:24.490> we<00:01:24.670> can<00:01:24.940> get

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
okay so in this situation if we can get

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.270 
okay so in this situation if we can get
into<00:01:25.450> this<00:01:25.539> situation<00:01:25.750> now<00:01:26.500> this<00:01:26.830> is<00:01:26.950> this<00:01:27.099> was

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
into this situation now this is this was

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.410 
into this situation now this is this was
the<00:01:27.340> situation<00:01:27.759> I<00:01:27.789> was<00:01:27.910> talking<00:01:28.119> about<00:01:28.179> with<00:01:28.360> a

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
the situation I was talking about with a

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.130 
the situation I was talking about with a
tip<00:01:28.569> pass<00:01:28.720> okay

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
tip pass okay

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.010 
tip pass okay
so<00:01:29.470> what<00:01:29.979> I'm<00:01:30.039> gonna<00:01:30.130> do<00:01:30.369> is<00:01:30.940> I'm<00:01:31.270> gonna<00:01:31.539> try

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.199 
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try
and<00:01:32.319> this<00:01:33.220> this<00:01:33.429> is<00:01:33.580> called<00:01:33.759> a<00:01:33.819> cradle

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:34.209 
and this this is called a cradle

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:36.389 
and this this is called a cradle
separation<00:01:34.810> okay<00:01:35.080> so<00:01:35.679> you've<00:01:35.800> got<00:01:35.830> two<00:01:36.130> balls

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
separation okay so you've got two balls

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.040 
separation okay so you've got two balls
on<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.610> same<00:01:36.759> flip<00:01:36.970> and<00:01:37.119> now<00:01:37.179> obviously<00:01:37.539> we

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
on the same flip and now obviously we

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.719 
on the same flip and now obviously we
don't<00:01:38.200> want<00:01:38.470> that<00:01:38.619> we<00:01:39.009> want<00:01:39.039> one<00:01:39.429> on<00:01:39.459> each

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
don't want that we want one on each

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.490 
don't want that we want one on each
Lipper<00:01:40.119> so<00:01:40.539> what<00:01:40.690> I'm<00:01:40.750> gonna<00:01:40.840> do<00:01:41.050> is<00:01:41.259> I'm<00:01:41.440> gonna

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
Lipper so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.830 
Lipper so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
try<00:01:42.009> and<00:01:42.130> bump<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.490> ball<00:01:42.700> up<00:01:42.910> up<00:01:43.630> the

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
try and bump the ball up up the

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.660 
try and bump the ball up up the
slingshot<00:01:44.380> so<00:01:45.009> that<00:01:45.130> it<00:01:45.220> doesn't<00:01:45.550> make

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
slingshot so that it doesn't make

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.180 
slingshot so that it doesn't make
contact<00:01:45.729> the<00:01:46.569> ball<00:01:46.780> comes<00:01:47.020> back<00:01:47.110> down<00:01:47.500> hits

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
contact the ball comes back down hits

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.059 
contact the ball comes back down hits
this<00:01:48.429> ball<00:01:48.700> and<00:01:49.000> then<00:01:49.450> with<00:01:50.140> sometimes<00:01:50.920> with

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
this ball and then with sometimes with

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:52.859 
this ball and then with sometimes with
its<00:01:51.220> little<00:01:51.429> tip<00:01:51.670> pass<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.360> ball<00:01:52.569> will<00:01:52.720> come

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
its little tip pass the ball will come

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.719 
its little tip pass the ball will come
back<00:01:53.140> over<00:01:53.530> onto<00:01:53.649> this<00:01:53.800> flipper<00:01:54.099> with<00:01:54.459> still

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
back over onto this flipper with still

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.930 
back over onto this flipper with still
having<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.149> ball<00:01:55.330> safely<00:01:55.989> secured<00:01:56.739> there<00:01:56.979> but

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
having the ball safely secured there but

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.699 
having the ball safely secured there but
a<00:01:58.209> tip<00:01:58.479> pass<00:01:58.660> is<00:01:58.810> really<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.080> this<00:01:59.470> is<00:01:59.619> another

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
a tip pass is really you this is another

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:01.350 
a tip pass is really you this is another
situation<00:02:00.069> where<00:02:00.399> a<00:02:00.429> tip<00:02:00.580> pass<00:02:00.759> can<00:02:00.940> be<00:02:01.000> useful

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
situation where a tip pass can be useful

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.210 
situation where a tip pass can be useful
there<00:02:01.720> you<00:02:01.840> go<00:02:01.989> that<00:02:02.560> was<00:02:02.590> a<00:02:02.679> really<00:02:02.860> nice<00:02:03.009> tip

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
there you go that was a really nice tip

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.160 
there you go that was a really nice tip
pass<00:02:03.429> so<00:02:03.940> I<00:02:03.970> try<00:02:04.479> and<00:02:04.509> do<00:02:04.630> that<00:02:04.720> again<00:02:04.810> if<00:02:05.080> I

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
pass so I try and do that again if I

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.139 
pass so I try and do that again if I
shoot<00:02:05.410> to<00:02:06.009> this<00:02:06.130> ramp<00:02:06.399> so<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.759> balls<00:02:06.940> you're

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
shoot to this ramp so the balls you're

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.969 
shoot to this ramp so the balls you're
not<00:02:07.300> got<00:02:07.479> quite<00:02:07.780> enough<00:02:08.020> momentum<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.470> go<00:02:08.679> over

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
not got quite enough momentum to go over

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.800 
not got quite enough momentum to go over
so<00:02:09.369> I<00:02:09.429> just<00:02:09.550> do<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:09.700> little<00:02:09.880> tip<00:02:10.209> pass<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.720> then

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
so I just do a little tip pass and then

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.420 
so I just do a little tip pass and then
then<00:02:11.290> it<00:02:11.410> will<00:02:11.500> make<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:11.739> all<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:11.890> way<00:02:12.040> over<00:02:12.250> to

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
then it will make it all the way over to

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.900 
then it will make it all the way over to
the<00:02:12.519> other<00:02:12.549> flipper

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
the other flipper

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.450 
the other flipper
little<00:02:15.910> tip<00:02:16.300> and<00:02:16.630> then<00:02:17.080> it's<00:02:17.230> over<00:02:17.560> here<00:02:18.010> so

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
little tip and then it's over here so

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.190 
little tip and then it's over here so
it's<00:02:18.610> just<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:18.940> tiny<00:02:19.270> little<00:02:19.420> touch<00:02:19.870> at<00:02:20.110> the

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
it's just that tiny little touch at the

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.050 
it's just that tiny little touch at the
end<00:02:20.380> of<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.650> flipper<00:02:20.890> because<00:02:21.460> the<00:02:21.760> way<00:02:21.850> that

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
end of the flipper because the way that

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.250 
end of the flipper because the way that
the<00:02:22.150> flip<00:02:22.330> is<00:02:22.480> made<00:02:22.660> is<00:02:22.810> there<00:02:22.990> there's

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
the flip is made is there there's

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.170 
the flip is made is there there's
there's<00:02:23.590> two<00:02:23.800> coils<00:02:24.070> inside<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:25.000> it's<00:02:25.120> a

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
there's two coils inside and it's a

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.460 
there's two coils inside and it's a
small<00:02:25.390> corner<00:02:25.570> and<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:25.750> big<00:02:25.870> one<00:02:26.020> and<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.260> small

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
small corner and a big one and the small

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.080 
small corner and a big one and the small
one<00:02:26.590> is<00:02:26.710> the<00:02:26.740> one<00:02:27.040> that<00:02:27.160> it<00:02:27.280> has<00:02:27.400> that<00:02:27.850> last

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
one is the one that it has that last

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.520 
one is the one that it has that last
little<00:02:28.240> bit<00:02:28.420> all<00:02:28.960> right<00:02:29.020> so<00:02:29.200> you've<00:02:29.320> got<00:02:29.440> the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
little bit all right so you've got the

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.170 
little bit all right so you've got the
big<00:02:29.740> brute<00:02:30.070> one<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.550> then<00:02:30.820> you've<00:02:30.940> got<00:02:31.060> that

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
big brute one and then you've got that

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.700 
big brute one and then you've got that
last<00:02:31.390> little<00:02:31.660> one<00:02:31.780> which<00:02:31.930> is<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.380> kind<00:02:32.560> of<00:02:32.650> the

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
last little one which is the kind of the

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.370 
last little one which is the kind of the
finesse<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:34.180> if<00:02:34.360> we're<00:02:34.510> able<00:02:34.630> to<00:02:34.810> do<00:02:34.990> that<00:02:35.140> and

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
finesse and if we're able to do that and

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.370 
finesse and if we're able to do that and
just<00:02:35.500> try<00:02:35.680> one<00:02:35.890> more<00:02:36.010> time<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.990> then<00:02:38.230> we've

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
just try one more time and then we've

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.140 
just try one more time and then we've
got<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.590> little<00:02:38.770> tip<00:02:38.920> over<00:02:39.220> yeah<00:02:39.400> so<00:02:39.970> that's

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
got the little tip over yeah so that's

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.120 
got the little tip over yeah so that's
the<00:02:40.240> guy<00:02:40.330> that's<00:02:40.720> your<00:02:40.960> tip<00:02:41.140> pass<00:02:41.350> and<00:02:41.770> it

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
the guy that's your tip pass and it

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.460 
the guy that's your tip pass and it
again<00:02:42.610> all<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.150> is<00:02:43.270> all<00:02:43.750> I'm<00:02:43.870> trying<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.170> do<00:02:44.320> is

achieve<00:02:44.590> is<00:02:45.130> get<00:02:45.460> the<00:02:45.550> ball<00:02:45.700> back<00:02:45.940> under

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
achieve is get the ball back under

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.860 
achieve is get the ball back under
control

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
control

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.199 
control
and<00:02:47.860> with<00:02:48.040> all<00:02:48.190> that<00:02:48.310> momentum<00:02:48.459> coming<00:02:49.120> out

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
and with all that momentum coming out

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.550 
and with all that momentum coming out
down<00:02:49.480> you<00:02:49.720> know<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:49.900> want<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.110> take<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.350> dot

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
down you know you want to take the dot

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.620 
down you know you want to take the dot
out<00:02:50.709> of<00:02:50.830> it<00:02:50.950> some<00:02:51.820> more<00:02:51.910> little<00:02:52.120> tip<00:02:52.270> pass<00:02:52.450> will

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
out of it some more little tip pass will

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.080 
out of it some more little tip pass will
get<00:02:52.750> you<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:52.959> back<00:02:53.110> underneath<00:02:53.350> control<00:02:54.090> okay

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
get you the back underneath control okay

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.350 
get you the back underneath control okay
so<00:02:55.990> that's<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.230> tip<00:02:56.410> pass<00:02:57.000> so<00:02:58.000> for<00:02:58.240> more

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
so that's the tip pass so for more
