00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.650
 let's see how long this is 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.860
 I hope this has been some time 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.510
 because you really understand enough 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.520

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.500

 base of paulo is multipurpose 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:01.210
 This is because the inside is outside 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.970
 a simple thing but in the background is 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:08.080
 The essence of the house is quite complex. 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:10.959
