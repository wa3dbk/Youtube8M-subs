00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
game and part of that is because it

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.950 
game and part of that is because it

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
from this game I think this might be the

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.140 
from this game I think this might be the
one<00:04:42.050> most<00:04:42.350> of<00:04:42.620> you<00:04:42.740> disagree<00:04:43.220> with<00:04:43.430> but<00:04:44.090> I

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
one most of you disagree with but I

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.090 
one most of you disagree with but I
found<00:04:44.480> out<00:04:44.690> last<00:04:44.900> to<00:04:45.200> be<00:04:45.320> far<00:04:45.770> more<00:04:45.800> effective

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
found out last to be far more effective

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.950 
found out last to be far more effective
as<00:04:46.640> a<00:04:46.670> horror<00:04:46.970> game<00:04:47.090> when<00:04:47.540> it<00:04:47.630> was<00:04:47.780> being

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
as a horror game when it was being

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.730 
as a horror game when it was being
realistic<00:04:49.750> before<00:04:50.750> the<00:04:50.930> supernatural

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
realistic before the supernatural

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.030 
realistic before the supernatural
element<00:04:52.160> was<00:04:52.310> introduced<00:04:52.820> I<00:04:53.030> was<00:04:53.300> all<00:04:53.600> in

element was introduced I was all in

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.520 
element was introduced I was all in
afterward<00:04:55.040> the<00:04:55.340> game<00:04:55.550> lost<00:04:55.880> me<00:04:56.120> a<00:04:56.150> bit<00:04:56.530> it's

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
afterward the game lost me a bit it's

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.230 
afterward the game lost me a bit it's
like<00:04:57.740> when<00:04:57.950> you<00:04:58.070> get<00:04:58.220> your<00:04:58.280> head<00:04:58.640> exploding

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240

of ruins things a little bit horror is
far<00:05:05.690> more<00:05:05.990> effective<00:05:06.560> when<00:05:06.920> I<00:05:06.950> feel<00:05:07.310> it<00:05:07.460> can

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
far more effective when I feel it can

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.000 
far more effective when I feel it can
