00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
hop we were experimenting with the rear

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.050 
hop we were experimenting with the rear
triangle<00:02:54.010> choke<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:54.549> we<00:02:54.640> found<00:02:54.760> something

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
triangle choke and we found something

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.410 
triangle choke and we found something
out<00:02:55.269> so<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.530> rear<00:02:56.709> trying<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.280> start<00:02:58.060> softer

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
out so the rear trying to start softer

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.229 
out so the rear trying to start softer
