00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
I can tell already this is a very good

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.719 
I can tell already this is a very good
quality<00:02:06.910> case<00:02:07.360> I<00:02:08.289> usually<00:02:09.039> do<00:02:09.130> not<00:02:09.160> have<00:02:09.490> I'm

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
quality case I usually do not have I'm

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.970 
quality case I usually do not have I'm
usually<00:02:09.970> not<00:02:10.210> a<00:02:10.330> fan<00:02:10.420> of<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:11.440> rubber

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
usually not a fan of the rubber

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.550 
usually not a fan of the rubber
two-piece<00:02:12.970> cases<00:02:13.450> but<00:02:13.810> this<00:02:14.230> one<00:02:14.380> definitely

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
two-piece cases but this one definitely

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.010 
two-piece cases but this one definitely
feels<00:02:15.069> like<00:02:15.340> it's<00:02:15.520> it's<00:02:16.090> not<00:02:16.270> cheaply<00:02:16.660> made

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
feels like it's it's not cheaply made

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.580 
feels like it's it's not cheaply made
and<00:02:17.350> it<00:02:17.830> seems<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.460> be<00:02:18.550> a<00:02:18.640> good<00:02:18.819> quality<00:02:19.210> rubber

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
and it seems to be a good quality rubber

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.020 
and it seems to be a good quality rubber
