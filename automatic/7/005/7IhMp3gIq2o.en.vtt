your local home improvement store and
assemble<00:00:44.190> them<00:00:44.670> into<00:00:44.879> four<00:00:45.239> rectangular

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
assemble them into four rectangular

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.600 
assemble them into four rectangular
boxes<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.530> which<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.890> simply<00:00:47.280> screw<00:00:47.550> it

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
boxes of which I simply screw it

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.299 
boxes of which I simply screw it
together<00:00:47.899> then<00:00:48.899> held<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.559> place<00:00:49.680> with<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.160> use

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
together then held in place with the use

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.119 
together then held in place with the use
of<00:00:50.340> some<00:00:50.700> steel<00:00:50.969> brackets<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.719> use<00:00:52.590> screws<00:00:52.920> on

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
of some steel brackets I use screws on

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.740 
of some steel brackets I use screws on
the<00:00:53.219> corners<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.730> sides<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.360> pond<00:00:54.539> to

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
the corners and sides of the pond to

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.080 
the corners and sides of the pond to
ensure<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.170> did<00:00:55.320> not<00:00:55.469> shift<00:00:55.800> as<00:00:56.039> well<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.879> is

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
ensure it did not shift as well this is

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.000 
ensure it did not shift as well this is
important<00:00:57.600> because<00:00:57.660> any<00:00:58.199> movement<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.890> these

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
important because any movement of these

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.830 
important because any movement of these
four<00:00:59.340> rectangular<00:00:59.579> boxes<00:01:00.420> would<00:01:00.570> basically

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
four rectangular boxes would basically

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.779 
four rectangular boxes would basically
result<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.680> pond<00:01:01.920> falling<00:01:02.309> apart

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
result in the pond falling apart

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.509 
result in the pond falling apart
now<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.449> make<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.750> hold<00:01:04.019> water<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.439> used<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:05.100> PVC

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
now to make it hold water I used a PVC

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.179 
now to make it hold water I used a PVC
anti<00:01:06.299> puncture<00:01:06.780> pond<00:01:07.049> liner<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.590> simply<00:01:07.979> cut

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
anti puncture pond liner and simply cut

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.760 
anti puncture pond liner and simply cut
it<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.460> size<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:09.030> then<00:01:09.810> use<00:01:10.080> small<00:01:10.409> screws

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
it to size I then use small screws

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.740 
it to size I then use small screws
combined<00:01:11.189> with<00:01:11.340> washers<00:01:11.850> hammered<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.570> all

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
combined with washers hammered in on all

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.810 
combined with washers hammered in on all
sides<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> structure<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:14.280> keep<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.610> liner

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
sides of the structure to keep the liner

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.120 
sides of the structure to keep the liner
in<00:01:15.030> place<00:01:15.060> then<00:01:15.900> just<00:01:16.140> remove<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.560> excess<00:01:16.920> to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
in place then just remove the excess to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.730 
in place then just remove the excess to
create<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> nice<00:01:17.670> clean<00:01:18.150> look<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:19.320> far<00:01:19.560> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
create a nice clean look so far the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.770 
create a nice clean look so far the
liner<00:01:19.950> has<00:01:20.070> held<00:01:20.460> up<00:01:20.610> great<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.270> expect<00:01:21.689> it

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
liner has held up great and I expect it

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.679 
liner has held up great and I expect it
to<00:01:21.840> last<00:01:22.200> for<00:01:22.470> years<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.430> that's<00:01:23.939> basically<00:01:24.450> an

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
to last for years so that's basically an

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.289 
to last for years so that's basically an
in-depth<00:01:25.259> look<00:01:25.409> at<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.799> pond<00:01:26.130> itself<00:01:26.520> now

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
in-depth look at the pond itself now

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.200 
in-depth look at the pond itself now
let's<00:01:27.780> talk<00:01:27.960> about<00:01:28.290> lighting<00:01:29.180> before<00:01:30.180> I

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
let's talk about lighting before I

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.640 
let's talk about lighting before I
discuss<00:01:30.630> my<00:01:30.810> lighting<00:01:31.170> system<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.619> should

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
discuss my lighting system I should

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.170 
discuss my lighting system I should
mention<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.340> lot<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.759> viewers<00:01:33.000> on

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
mention that a lot of viewers on

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.760 
mention that a lot of viewers on
Facebook<00:01:33.210> kept<00:01:33.810> saying<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.200> should<00:01:34.409> use<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
Facebook kept saying I should use the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.469 
Facebook kept saying I should use the
Sun<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.130> grow<00:01:35.250> my<00:01:35.400> plants<00:01:35.430> as<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.150> would<00:01:36.299> save

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
Sun to grow my plants as it would save

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.080 
Sun to grow my plants as it would save
me<00:01:36.630> money<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:36.990> electricity<00:01:37.729> while<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.939> is

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
me money on electricity while that is

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.270 
me money on electricity while that is
possible<00:01:39.720> with<00:01:39.990> emerge<00:01:40.350> grown<00:01:40.619> plants<00:01:41.100> it's

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
possible with emerge grown plants it's

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.370 
possible with emerge grown plants it's
much<00:01:41.579> harder<00:01:41.909> with<00:01:42.240> submerged<00:01:42.659> grown<00:01:42.960> plants

I<00:03:00.790> can<00:03:01.630> basically<00:03:01.840> say<00:03:02.380> I<00:03:02.410> moved<00:03:02.980> my<00:03:03.190> entire

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
I can basically say I moved my entire

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.030 
I can basically say I moved my entire

I<00:03:07.360> really<00:03:07.990> didn't<00:03:08.320> change<00:03:08.590> anything<00:03:08.830> I'm

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
I really didn't change anything I'm

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.940 
I really didn't change anything I'm
still<00:03:09.820> using<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.300> same<00:03:10.330> UV<00:03:10.810> sterilizer<00:03:11.320> hydro

canister filter and co2 reactor the only

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.130 
canister filter and co2 reactor the only
difference<00:03:15.310> is<00:03:15.490> a<00:03:15.820> lot<00:03:16.120> more<00:03:16.300> water<00:03:16.660> is<00:03:16.930> being

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
difference is a lot more water is being

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.199 
difference is a lot more water is being
pushed<00:03:17.410> through<00:03:17.560> it<00:03:17.830> and<00:03:17.980> yes<00:03:18.520> I<00:03:18.760> am<00:03:18.910> injecting

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
pushed through it and yes I am injecting

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.240 
pushed through it and yes I am injecting
co2<00:03:19.600> as<00:03:20.020> well<00:03:20.230> that's<00:03:20.560> pretty<00:03:20.770> much<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.220> only

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
co2 as well that's pretty much the only

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.190 
co2 as well that's pretty much the only
reason<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:22.150> plants<00:03:22.510> are<00:03:22.630> absolutely

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
reason the plants are absolutely

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.890 
reason the plants are absolutely

exploding with growth and by the way I'm

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.110 
exploding with growth and by the way I'm
still<00:03:26.200> using<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.650> same<00:03:26.680> Aquatech<00:03:27.610> co2

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
still using the same Aquatech co2

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.090 
still using the same Aquatech co2
regulator<00:03:28.420> that<00:03:28.840> I've<00:03:28.959> had<00:03:29.170> for<00:03:29.440> almost<00:03:29.709> five

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
regulator that I've had for almost five

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.940 
regulator that I've had for almost five
years<00:03:30.430> now<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.330> it's<00:03:32.020> still<00:03:32.200> going<00:03:32.410> strong<00:03:32.530> I

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
years now and it's still going strong I

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.170 
years now and it's still going strong I
pretty<00:03:33.160> much<00:03:33.250> only<00:03:33.550> had<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:33.880> replace<00:03:34.120> a

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
pretty much only had to replace a

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.150 
pretty much only had to replace a
solenoid<00:03:34.630> once<00:03:35.050> because<00:03:35.410> it<00:03:35.560> went<00:03:35.740> out<00:03:35.830> on<00:03:35.890> me

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
solenoid once because it went out on me

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160 
solenoid once because it went out on me
other<00:03:36.670> than<00:03:36.790> that<00:03:37.120> it's<00:03:37.360> a<00:03:37.450> great<00:03:37.660> regulator

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
other than that it's a great regulator

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.680 
other than that it's a great regulator
and<00:03:38.410> it's<00:03:38.980> lasted<00:03:39.430> for<00:03:39.610> a<00:03:39.640> very<00:03:39.700> long<00:03:40.180> time<00:03:40.209> for

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
and it's lasted for a very long time for

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.510 
and it's lasted for a very long time for
me<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:40.959> I<00:03:41.290> expect<00:03:41.620> it<00:03:41.709> to<00:03:41.740> last<00:03:42.010> a<00:03:42.250> lot<00:03:42.459> longer

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520

with the pond as well all right lastly
let's<00:03:45.459> talk<00:03:45.640> about<00:03:45.850> the<00:03:46.090> plants<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:46.690> how

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
let's talk about the plants and how

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.780 
let's talk about the plants and how
they're<00:03:46.990> grown<00:03:47.260> now<00:03:47.920> for<00:03:48.130> substrate<00:03:48.520> I'm

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
they're grown now for substrate I'm

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.699 
they're grown now for substrate I'm
using<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.240> same<00:03:49.450> silica<00:03:49.900> sand<00:03:50.110> I<00:03:50.260> had<00:03:50.410> in<00:03:50.560> both

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
using the same silica sand I had in both

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.880 
using the same silica sand I had in both
my<00:03:50.950> 80<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.520> 50<00:03:51.670> gallon<00:03:52.120> tank<00:03:52.390> however<00:03:53.260> I<00:03:53.590> had

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
my 80 and 50 gallon tank however I had

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.410 
my 80 and 50 gallon tank however I had
to<00:03:54.040> invest<00:03:54.310> in<00:03:54.459> another<00:03:54.610> bag<00:03:54.940> of<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.180> stuff

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
to invest in another bag of the stuff

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.020 
to invest in another bag of the stuff
because<00:03:55.630> I<00:03:55.840> simply<00:03:56.200> didn't<00:03:56.860> have<00:03:57.010> enough<00:03:57.280> that

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
because I simply didn't have enough that

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.120 
because I simply didn't have enough that
meant<00:03:58.300> a<00:03:58.420> rigorous<00:03:59.020> washing<00:03:59.500> process<00:03:59.650> which

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
meant a rigorous washing process which

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.430 
meant a rigorous washing process which
took<00:04:00.370> hours<00:04:00.820> but<00:04:01.120> I<00:04:01.300> eventually<00:04:01.600> got<00:04:02.110> it<00:04:02.230> clean

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
took hours but I eventually got it clean

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.620 
took hours but I eventually got it clean
and<00:04:02.590> now<00:04:02.709> I<00:04:02.740> have<00:04:03.160> a<00:04:03.190> nice<00:04:03.520> one-inch<00:04:04.030> layer<00:04:04.270> in

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
and now I have a nice one-inch layer in

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.270 
and now I have a nice one-inch layer in
the<00:04:04.750> pond<00:04:04.990> to<00:04:05.200> anchor<00:04:05.530> all<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.770> plants<00:04:06.100> down

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
the pond to anchor all the plants down

the pond to anchor all the plants down
for<00:04:07.000> my<00:04:07.120> Moss<00:04:07.360> plants<00:04:07.810> I'm<00:04:07.959> using<00:04:08.170> these<00:04:08.380> pond

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700

the pond I originally wasn't going to

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.800 
the pond I originally wasn't going to
because<00:04:31.100> I<00:04:31.130> knew<00:04:31.520> it<00:04:31.789> would<00:04:31.880> take<00:04:32.120> forever<00:04:32.330> to

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
fill a pond of this size but I figured I

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.390 
fill a pond of this size but I figured I
should<00:04:35.270> because<00:04:36.050> of<00:04:36.199> how<00:04:36.349> beneficial<00:04:36.680> it<00:04:37.310> is

should because of how beneficial it is

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.820 
should because of how beneficial it is

ultra pure water for the plants so while

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:45.999 
ultra pure water for the plants so while
it<00:04:44.569> took<00:04:44.780> two<00:04:44.960> days<00:04:45.110> to<00:04:45.169> fill<00:04:45.500> the<00:04:45.620> pond<00:04:45.800> with

and pretty much all I had to do to make

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.779 
and pretty much all I had to do to make
the<00:05:00.229> RO<00:05:00.380> water<00:05:00.560> suitable<00:05:00.919> for<00:05:01.250> the<00:05:01.340> pond<00:05:01.550> was

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
the RO water suitable for the pond was

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.240 
the RO water suitable for the pond was
add<00:05:02.000> some<00:05:02.240> SECAM<00:05:02.690> equilibrium<00:05:03.349> and<00:05:03.560> I<00:05:04.099> was

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
add some SECAM equilibrium and I was

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.810 
add some SECAM equilibrium and I was
good<00:05:04.400> to<00:05:04.520> go

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
good to go

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.580 
good to go
now<00:05:05.210> since<00:05:05.479> the<00:05:05.599> pond<00:05:05.810> is<00:05:05.930> much<00:05:06.080> bigger<00:05:06.289> than

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
now since the pond is much bigger than

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.170 
now since the pond is much bigger than
my<00:05:06.710> two<00:05:06.770> holding<00:05:07.250> tanks<00:05:07.610> I<00:05:07.729> have<00:05:07.880> a<00:05:07.910> lot<00:05:08.150> of

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
my two holding tanks I have a lot of

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.570 
my two holding tanks I have a lot of
space<00:05:08.509> to<00:05:08.690> grow<00:05:08.870> in<00:05:09.020> house<00:05:09.169> plants<00:05:09.680> this<00:05:10.280> means

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
space to grow in house plants this means

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.129 
space to grow in house plants this means
I'll<00:05:10.759> be<00:05:10.849> able<00:05:10.880> to<00:05:11.060> grow<00:05:11.240> some<00:05:11.449> plants<00:05:11.479> myself

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
I'll be able to grow some plants myself

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.230 
I'll be able to grow some plants myself
and<00:05:12.380> have<00:05:12.530> room<00:05:12.740> to<00:05:12.919> keep<00:05:13.099> more<00:05:13.400> plants<00:05:13.820> thus

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
and have room to keep more plants thus

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.029 
and have room to keep more plants thus
keeping<00:05:14.599> them<00:05:14.750> in<00:05:14.870> stock<00:05:15.050> a<00:05:15.110> lot<00:05:15.410> longer<00:05:15.650> on

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
keeping them in stock a lot longer on

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.070 
keeping them in stock a lot longer on
the<00:05:16.220> website<00:05:16.610> and<00:05:16.880> this<00:05:17.360> is<00:05:17.539> awesome<00:05:17.750> because

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
the website and this is awesome because

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.749 
the website and this is awesome because
before<00:05:18.530> when<00:05:18.680> I<00:05:18.740> was<00:05:18.889> using<00:05:19.070> my<00:05:19.280> two<00:05:19.340> holding

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 
before when I was using my two holding

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:21.610 
before when I was using my two holding
tanks<00:05:20.120> I<00:05:20.210> could<00:05:20.389> only<00:05:20.509> keep<00:05:20.750> a<00:05:20.900> small<00:05:21.259> number

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
tanks I could only keep a small number

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.580 
tanks I could only keep a small number
of<00:05:21.770> each<00:05:22.159> plant<00:05:22.550> in<00:05:22.759> stock<00:05:23.419> because<00:05:24.169> I<00:05:24.199> was<00:05:24.440> so

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
of each plant in stock because I was so

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.589 
of each plant in stock because I was so
limited<00:05:25.039> with<00:05:25.130> space<00:05:25.400> but<00:05:25.759> now<00:05:26.270> that<00:05:26.449> I<00:05:26.479> have

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599 
limited with space but now that I have

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:28.390 
limited with space but now that I have
the<00:05:26.690> pond<00:05:26.930> I<00:05:27.169> can<00:05:27.349> keep<00:05:27.530> forty<00:05:28.069> of<00:05:28.190> one

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
the pond I can keep forty of one

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.270 
the pond I can keep forty of one
individual<00:05:28.970> plant<00:05:29.270> in<00:05:29.419> stock<00:05:29.690> and<00:05:29.930> you<00:05:30.860> can

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
individual plant in stock and you can

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.249 
individual plant in stock and you can
still<00:05:31.550> have<00:05:31.699> space<00:05:32.150> for<00:05:32.210> other<00:05:32.599> plants<00:05:33.050> so

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:33.259 
still have space for other plants so

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:35.379 
still have space for other plants so
it's<00:05:33.440> just<00:05:34.039> so<00:05:34.340> awesome<00:05:34.610> and<00:05:35.120> you<00:05:35.270> know

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
it's just so awesome and you know

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.570 
it's just so awesome and you know
overall<00:05:35.750> I<00:05:36.110> think<00:05:36.169> the<00:05:36.500> pond<00:05:36.710> has<00:05:37.070> been<00:05:37.400> the

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
overall I think the pond has been the

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.610 
overall I think the pond has been the
best<00:05:37.849> investment<00:05:38.060> I<00:05:38.599> could<00:05:38.780> ever<00:05:39.050> make<00:05:39.380> into

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
best investment I could ever make into
