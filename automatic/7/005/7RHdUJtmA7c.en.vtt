00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
like they're dedicated microphone button

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.060 
like they're dedicated microphone button
so<00:00:46.730> usually<00:00:47.210> you<00:00:47.329> have<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:47.960> music<00:00:48.559> and<00:00:48.739> you

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
so usually you have the music and you

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.740 
so usually you have the music and you
know<00:00:49.100> call<00:00:49.340> answer<00:00:49.730> button<00:00:50.030> on<00:00:50.270> the<00:00:50.450> cord

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750

they've<00:00:51.290> separated<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:52.219> microphone<00:00:52.760> so<00:00:53.329> you

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
they've separated the microphone so you

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.569 
they've separated the microphone so you
have<00:00:53.840> less<00:00:54.050> interference<00:00:54.410> so<00:00:55.280> you're<00:00:55.520> not

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
go ahead and just test that out a little

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.269 
go ahead and just test that out a little
bit<00:01:21.170> here<00:01:21.679> we<00:01:21.799> go

00:01:22.269 --> 00:01:22.279

here we go let's start off a little
lower

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.980 

there<00:01:46.330> we<00:01:46.479> go

there we go
that<00:01:47.440> brings<00:01:47.770> me<00:01:47.950> to<00:01:48.190> my<00:01:48.340> next<00:01:48.400> point<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.510> only

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
that brings me to my next point the only

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.770 
that brings me to my next point the only
drawback<00:01:50.560> I've<00:01:50.950> seen<00:01:51.190> so<00:01:51.490> far<00:01:51.520> or<00:01:52.330> actually

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
drawback I've seen so far or actually

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.260 
drawback I've seen so far or actually
you<00:01:53.080> know<00:01:53.170> felt<00:01:53.440> so<00:01:53.650> far<00:01:53.890> is<00:01:54.159> when<00:01:54.490> I<00:01:54.549> am<00:01:55.000> you

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
you know felt so far is when I am you

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.820 
you know felt so far is when I am you
using<00:01:55.720> the<00:01:55.780> headset<00:01:55.960> and<00:01:56.259> I'm<00:01:56.380> listening<00:01:56.560> to

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
using the headset and I'm listening to

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.230 
using the headset and I'm listening to
music<00:01:57.090> for<00:01:58.090> those<00:01:58.210> of<00:01:58.420> us<00:01:58.540> who<00:01:58.840> wear<00:01:59.650> earrings

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
music for those of us who wear earrings

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.550 
music for those of us who wear earrings
they're<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.540> noise<00:02:01.750> cancellation<00:02:02.259> is

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
they're the noise cancellation is

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.490 
they're the noise cancellation is
excellent<00:02:03.159> so<00:02:03.850> it<00:02:04.090> is<00:02:04.240> so<00:02:04.869> good<00:02:05.080> that<00:02:05.110> I<00:02:05.259> can't

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
excellent so it is so good that I can't

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.139 
excellent so it is so good that I can't
actually<00:02:05.740> hear<00:02:06.159> whoo<00:02:06.340> what<00:02:06.460> else<00:02:06.610> is<00:02:06.759> going<00:02:07.030> on

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
actually hear whoo what else is going on

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.529 
actually hear whoo what else is going on
around<00:02:07.330> me<00:02:07.570> when<00:02:07.810> I'm<00:02:07.930> walking<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:09.539> because

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
around me when I'm walking but because

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.229 
around me when I'm walking but because
of<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.840> noise<00:02:11.230> cancellation<00:02:11.739> and<00:02:12.160> you<00:02:13.150> know<00:02:13.209> I

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
of the noise cancellation and you know I

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.850 
of the noise cancellation and you know I
guess<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.600> motion<00:02:14.020> and<00:02:14.319> then<00:02:14.410> you<00:02:14.770> know

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
guess the motion and then you know

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.890 
guess the motion and then you know
actually<00:02:15.310> you<00:02:15.640> know<00:02:15.730> objects<00:02:16.450> touching<00:02:16.810> each
