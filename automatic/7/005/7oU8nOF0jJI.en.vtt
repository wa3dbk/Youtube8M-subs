gonna assume that you know those if not
you<00:01:24.000> should<00:01:24.090> probably<00:01:24.300> look<00:01:24.480> them<00:01:24.630> up<00:01:25.520> I'm<00:01:26.520> not

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640

you should probably look them up I'm not
going<00:01:26.760> to<00:01:26.850> put<00:01:26.940> the<00:01:27.030> chord<00:01:27.240> charts<00:01:27.540> here<00:01:27.750> but

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
going to put the chord charts here but

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.480 
going to put the chord charts here but
so<00:01:30.360> we're<00:01:30.510> starting<00:01:30.630> with<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.960> G<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.680> don't

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
so we're starting with the G and don't

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.840

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
to match with it right so I'm not going

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.740 
to match with it right so I'm not going
to<00:02:10.369> get<00:02:10.520> into<00:02:10.760> you<00:02:10.970> know<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.210> rhythm<00:02:11.390> that<00:02:11.660> I'm

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
to get into you know the rhythm that I'm

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.380 
to get into you know the rhythm that I'm
strumming<00:02:12.140> either<00:02:12.970> just<00:02:13.970> really<00:02:14.210> try<00:02:14.360> to

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
strumming either just really try to

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.610 
strumming either just really try to
focus<00:02:14.630> on<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:14.960> notes<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:17.180> basically<00:02:17.660> the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
focus on the notes and so basically the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.490 
focus on the notes and so basically the
first<00:02:18.770> thing<00:02:18.920> I'm<00:02:19.130> doing<00:02:19.160> is<00:02:19.460> I'm<00:02:19.550> hitting<00:02:20.500> the
