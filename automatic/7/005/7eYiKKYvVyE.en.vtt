 the stoppage is fine the game they go to the first clue they download it once 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.910
 Discharged 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.050
 he is cheap a moral action like this cause quintero done and is to be 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.980
 here 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.720
 2 / a folder 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.390
 we are going to open it and it will leave us an executable of maika that would be with the 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.630
 version 1 points 7 points 3 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.000
 and I do not personally like this version 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.020
 we are going to open it 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.020
 let's respect peta 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.250
 years 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.710
 we keep insisting 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.710
 insert chávez 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.600
 here is the executable 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.180
 here we will put the name you like and in my case because of my channel 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.740
 Once this is done, move forward 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.740
 and we wait for you to load according to brand 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.200
 good despite the version 1 points 7 points 3 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.340
 good to be able to update the we have to do the following we get magical 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.330
 we go to the next address let's start we put running 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.240
 if not 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.870
 that they themselves are 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.230
 and we go to the next route 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.270
 What is it 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.130
 percent to pepe data per cent diagonal diagonal master point 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.140
 He's going to leave this scenario so they do not have any problems with him 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.739
 an answer we will accept 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:15.239
 evaluation be the folder well 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.109
 at first 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:20.919
 and here what we have to do is eliminate this teacher in this serial 

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:22.859
 version 1 point 7 points 3 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.859
 we eliminate 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.149
 and we are going to put that version that you like 

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:34.919
 if it exists it is time for version 1 point 8 simply read 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:36.819
 copy 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.939
 and they paste it here 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:40.979
 in the folder well 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:42.730
 percent there is 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.730
 if you do not like to be replaced by this one and so 

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:48.089
 so he does not want to be 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:50.109
 the milan 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.079
 if you are the one who sent her 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.469
 that will be 1 point as a whole 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:57.039
 hit her in the face 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:00.039
 they just close the magic key tab 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.219
 and our people had already expressed 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.219
 francesca 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:13.379
 equipment in the name will normally already come kilian post that deliver 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.459
 you'll see what this double tie is saying 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.149
 and we wait for it to be 100% 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:22.839
 and this means that our agreement to the version is being expressed 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:25.509
 newer 

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:28.509
 we wait for him to load 

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:50.470
 and good as you can see here is the version 1 point 8 points 1 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.129
 which is the command of how to put in the previous folder 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.149
 if you did not like this version 

00:03:57.149 --> 00:04:01.349
 the closure does not presume ipea will recover that I will leave the extinction 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:02.169
 boiled 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:03.979
 it goes to the pin folder 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:05.830
 ing-wen does the same 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.640
 we substitute percent 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.269
 Saturday file 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.529
 the afternoon the file that we inserted was the version 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:15.529
 the other point is a point 1 we can see here 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.590
 the system likes this version 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.569
 so to do 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:23.900
 what he knew said earlier 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.259
 and well we close teachers 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:30.039
 and logically, this would be all 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.429
 I hope you illustrated them sides has helped more than anything 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.120
 percent 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.340
 this is undoubtedly the day in the idea of ​​how to survive the first days 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.490
 gil 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.960
