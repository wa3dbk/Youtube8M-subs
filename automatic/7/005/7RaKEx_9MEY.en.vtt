00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.810 
as my stats I have like a only put like
20<00:01:28.320> games<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.740> think<00:01:28.920> we<00:01:29.070> only<00:01:29.159> lost<00:01:29.369> two<00:01:29.579> games

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
20 games I think we only lost two games

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.999 
20 games I think we only lost two games
we<00:01:30.630> play<00:01:30.780> like<00:01:30.810> 20<00:01:31.200> or<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.500> guess<00:01:31.829> that's

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
we play like 20 or so I guess that's

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.149 
we play like 20 or so I guess that's
pretty<00:01:32.100> good<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.549> then<00:01:33.350> my<00:01:34.350> kitty<00:01:34.590> against

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
pretty good and then my kitty against

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.370 
pretty good and then my kitty against
pilots<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.820> like<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:35.970> 1.8<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.780> then<00:01:36.869> my<00:01:36.960> overall

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
pilots is like a 1.8 and then my overall

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.280 
pilots is like a 1.8 and then my overall
Katie<00:01:37.650> was<00:01:38.159> like<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.369> five<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.450> don't<00:01:39.900> know<00:01:39.990> if

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
Katie was like a five so I don't know if

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.200 
Katie was like a five so I don't know if
those<00:01:40.500> are<00:01:40.710> good<00:01:41.040> stats<00:01:41.280> either<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.790> i<00:01:42.030> think

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
those are good stats either and i think

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.490 
those are good stats either and i think
my<00:01:42.299> most<00:01:42.509> kills<00:01:42.750> i<00:01:42.869> only<00:01:42.990> play<00:01:43.110> hard<00:01:43.290> point

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
my most kills i only play hard point

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.020 
my most kills i only play hard point
domination<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.220> i<00:01:44.460> don't<00:01:44.759> know<00:01:44.820> if<00:01:44.880> there's

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
domination so i don't know if there's

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.160 
domination so i don't know if there's
another<00:01:45.180> game<00:01:45.390> while<00:01:45.540> it's<00:01:45.659> like<00:01:45.810> better<00:01:46.020> than

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
another game while it's like better than

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.510 
another game while it's like better than
that<00:01:46.350> but<00:01:46.649> i<00:01:46.829> really<00:01:47.040> like<00:01:47.159> her<00:01:47.280> point

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
that but i really like her point

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.160 
that but i really like her point
domination<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.180> think<00:01:48.659> my<00:01:48.720> most<00:01:48.899> clothes<00:01:49.079> I

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
domination I think my most clothes I

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.230 
domination I think my most clothes I
forgot<00:01:49.290> like<00:01:49.439> 17<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.549> don't<00:01:50.700> know<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.970> think

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
forgot like 17 so I don't know I think

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.719 
forgot like 17 so I don't know I think
I'm<00:01:51.390> pretty<00:01:51.540> decent<00:01:51.990> at<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.439> definitely<00:01:52.950> at

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
I'm pretty decent at it I definitely at

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.609 
I'm pretty decent at it I definitely at
least<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.970> little<00:01:54.090> suck<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:55.140> don't<00:01:55.409> know<00:01:55.500> I

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
least a little suck so I don't know I

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.870 
least a little suck so I don't know I
might<00:01:55.799> have<00:01:55.950> put<00:01:56.070> some<00:01:56.219> gameplay<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.670> if<00:01:56.790> I

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
might have put some gameplay that if I

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.340 
might have put some gameplay that if I
get<00:01:57.060> like<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.210> 20<00:01:57.600> kill<00:01:57.750> game<00:01:57.930> or<00:01:58.079> something

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
get like a 20 kill game or something

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.590 
get like a 20 kill game or something
that<00:01:58.799> might<00:01:58.920> be<00:01:59.009> pretty<00:01:59.189> cool<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.399> upload<00:01:59.790> or<00:02:00.030> I

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
that might be pretty cool to upload or I

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.850 
that might be pretty cool to upload or I
might<00:02:01.110> just<00:02:01.200> show<00:02:01.290> up<00:02:01.350> with<00:02:01.469> one<00:02:01.619> video

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
might just show up with one video

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
on time fall in general because the game

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:07.999 
on time fall in general because the game
is<00:02:06.990> good<00:02:07.229> there's<00:02:07.530> nothing<00:02:07.710> wrong<00:02:07.799> with<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
is good there's nothing wrong with the

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.960 
is good there's nothing wrong with the
game<00:02:08.190> but<00:02:08.729> it's<00:02:09.030> not<00:02:09.569> exactly<00:02:10.530> like<00:02:11.220> my<00:02:11.550> taste

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
exactly the type of game that I could

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.000 
exactly the type of game that I could

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
the xbox one it looked really sick so I

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.820

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980
