to wait for me to finally respond at

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.429 
to wait for me to finally respond at
times<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.289> takes<00:00:28.529> us<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:29.390> little<00:00:30.390> bit<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:31.230> get<00:00:31.410> a

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
times it takes us a little bit to get a

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.310 
times it takes us a little bit to get a
response<00:00:31.859> especially<00:00:32.160> through<00:00:32.610> YouTube<00:00:33.320> I've

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
response especially through YouTube I've

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.030 
response especially through YouTube I've
switched<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:35.040> doing<00:00:35.969> videos<00:00:36.620> through<00:00:37.620> my<00:00:37.770> cell

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
switched to doing videos through my cell

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.380 
switched to doing videos through my cell
phone<00:00:38.329> they<00:00:39.329> upload<00:00:39.840> about<00:00:40.170> 30<00:00:40.620> times<00:00:40.950> faster

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
phone they upload about 30 times faster

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.340 
phone they upload about 30 times faster
they<00:00:42.440> come<00:00:43.440> out<00:00:43.469> pretty<00:00:43.649> clear<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:45.350> hopefully

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
they come out pretty clear so hopefully

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.549 
they come out pretty clear so hopefully
it<00:00:46.469> continues<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:47.100> work<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.430> way<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.559> so

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
it continues to work this way and so

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.740 
it continues to work this way and so
that's<00:00:49.739> what<00:00:49.890> we're<00:00:50.039> doing<00:00:50.309> here<00:00:51.180> these<00:00:51.390> this

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
that's what we're doing here these this

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.200 
that's what we're doing here these this
two<00:00:52.530> videos<00:00:52.860> before<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:53.820> one<00:00:54.030> now

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
two videos before this and this one now

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.200 
two videos before this and this one now
it's<00:00:54.480> cell<00:00:55.260> phone<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.739> takes<00:00:56.010> two<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:57.059> some

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
it's cell phone it takes two for some

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.630 
it's cell phone it takes two for some
reason<00:00:57.570> an<00:00:57.780> incredibly<00:00:58.739> long<00:00:58.980> time<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.489> upload

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
reason an incredibly long time to upload

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.889 
reason an incredibly long time to upload
through<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.600> computer<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.829> just<00:01:02.629> it's<00:01:03.629> been

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
through the computer so I just it's been

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.509 
through the computer so I just it's been
it's<00:01:04.439> that's<00:01:04.769> another<00:01:04.979> reason<00:01:05.129> why<00:01:05.280> it's<00:01:05.430> such

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
it's that's another reason why it's such

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.950 
it's that's another reason why it's such
a<00:01:05.640> slow<00:01:05.820> process<00:01:05.850> with<00:01:06.479> things<00:01:06.630> around<00:01:06.810> here

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
a slow process with things around here

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.770 
a slow process with things around here
anyway<00:01:07.530> I'm<00:01:08.130> going<00:01:08.939> with<00:01:09.119> two<00:01:09.299> separate

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
anyway I'm going with two separate

things are slowly progressing I'm

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.360 
things are slowly progressing I'm
getting<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.380> little<00:03:19.470> bit<00:03:19.680> of<00:03:19.769> time<00:03:19.980> here<00:03:20.010> and

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
getting a little bit of time here and

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.180

there to come out here get get answering

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.479 
there to come out here get get answering
questions<00:03:23.670> get<00:03:24.030> things<00:03:24.299> handled<00:03:24.810> with

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
questions get things handled with

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.030 
questions get things handled with
borders<00:03:26.489> so<00:03:27.239> I'm<00:03:27.780> I'm<00:03:28.200> working<00:03:28.470> on<00:03:28.739> it<00:03:28.890> a

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
borders so I'm I'm working on it a

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.890 
borders so I'm I'm working on it a
little<00:03:29.220> difficult<00:03:29.400> still<00:03:29.910> trucking<00:03:30.420> you<00:03:30.810> know

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
little difficult still trucking you know

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.350 
little difficult still trucking you know
dust<00:03:31.769> dawn-to-dusk

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
dust dawn-to-dusk

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.350 
dust dawn-to-dusk
so<00:03:33.600> it's<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.500> little<00:03:35.489> harder<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:35.910> get<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.090> the

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
so it's a little harder to get to the

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.210 
so it's a little harder to get to the
post<00:03:36.840> office<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:37.500> get<00:03:37.560> things<00:03:37.799> shipped<00:03:38.040> out

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
post office and get things shipped out

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.400 
post office and get things shipped out
in<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.640> timely<00:03:39.120> manner<00:03:39.299> but<00:03:39.540> it'll<00:03:40.079> get<00:03:40.170> better

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
in a timely manner but it'll get better

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.310 
in a timely manner but it'll get better
and<00:03:40.680> quicker<00:03:41.190> as<00:03:41.519> as<00:03:42.180> we<00:03:42.359> get<00:03:42.510> closer<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:42.989> the

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
and quicker as as we get closer to the

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.160 
and quicker as as we get closer to the
winter<00:03:44.220> time<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.690> get<00:03:45.690> through<00:03:45.840> harvest

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
winter time and get through harvest

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.920 
winter time and get through harvest
season<00:03:46.530> but<00:03:47.100> anyway<00:03:47.420> essentially<00:03:48.420> another<00:03:48.690> 8

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
a new 8 foot section in here redone let

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.319 
a new 8 foot section in here redone let
me<00:03:52.019> put<00:03:52.200> a<00:03:52.230> building<00:03:52.620> in<00:03:52.739> here<00:03:53.299> probably<00:03:54.299> a

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
me put a building in here probably a

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:55.940 
me put a building in here probably a
couple<00:03:54.630> buildings<00:03:54.870> as<00:03:55.230> this<00:03:55.380> side<00:03:55.620> is<00:03:55.799> going

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
couple buildings as this side is going

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.880 
couple buildings as this side is going
to<00:03:56.010> be<00:03:56.130> a<00:03:56.160> lot<00:03:56.609> bigger<00:03:56.850> of<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.590> section<00:03:58.590> than<00:03:58.799> the

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
to be a lot bigger of a section than the

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.830 
to be a lot bigger of a section than the
other<00:03:59.040> so<00:03:59.549> it'd<00:04:00.209> take<00:04:00.420> a<00:04:00.450> little<00:04:00.660> bit<00:04:00.750> more

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
other so it'd take a little bit more

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.259 
other so it'd take a little bit more
time<00:04:01.140> to<00:04:01.170> get<00:04:01.410> it<00:04:01.530> up<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:01.799> going<00:04:01.950> but<00:04:02.220> still<00:04:02.910> be

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
time to get it up and going but still be

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.599 
time to get it up and going but still be
