00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
moving on to the borealis the borealis

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.320 
moving on to the borealis the borealis
is<00:01:55.490> a<00:01:55.520> little<00:01:55.910> more<00:01:56.090> delicate<00:01:56.770> looking<00:01:57.770> plant

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
is a little more delicate looking plant

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.500 
is a little more delicate looking plant
slender<00:01:59.330> branches<00:02:00.850> fully<00:02:01.850> loaded<00:02:02.360> with

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
slender branches fully loaded with

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.070 
slender branches fully loaded with
blossoms<00:02:03.440> this<00:02:03.650> year<00:02:05.950> and<00:02:06.950> there's<00:02:07.190> a<00:02:07.280> tall

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
blossoms this year and there's a tall

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.990 
blossoms this year and there's a tall
borealis<00:02:09.080> as<00:02:09.260> well<00:02:09.530> so<00:02:10.190> each<00:02:10.369> plant<00:02:10.700> will<00:02:10.850> grow

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
borealis as well so each plant will grow

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.370 
borealis as well so each plant will grow
in<00:02:11.750> its<00:02:11.960> own<00:02:12.140> particular<00:02:12.830> way<00:02:14.380> sometimes

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
in its own particular way sometimes

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.560 
in its own particular way sometimes
growing<00:02:15.650> tall<00:02:16.520> first<00:02:16.880> and<00:02:17.150> then<00:02:17.240> spreading

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
growing tall first and then spreading

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.420 
growing tall first and then spreading
out<00:02:17.780> at<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.620> bottom<00:02:18.770> and<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:21.560> is<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.740> bush<00:02:22.040> so<00:02:22.310> it

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
out at the bottom and it is a bush so it

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.250 
out at the bottom and it is a bush so it
will<00:02:22.610> send<00:02:22.910> out<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.090> lot<00:02:23.360> of<00:02:23.390> new<00:02:23.780> growth<00:02:23.960> this

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
will send out a lot of new growth this

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.500 
will send out a lot of new growth this
year
