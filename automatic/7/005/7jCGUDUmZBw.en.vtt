I<00:00:28.349> mean<00:00:28.590> did<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.949> nano-sim<00:00:29.460> with<00:00:29.670> the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
I mean did the nano-sim with the

I mean did the nano-sim with the
Straight<00:00:30.029> Talk<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.510> use<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.810> system<00:00:31.170> now<00:00:32.070> at<00:00:32.340> that

Straight Talk I use a system now at that
time<00:00:32.880> they<00:00:33.180> didn't<00:00:33.360> have<00:00:33.600> nano<00:00:33.899> SIM<00:00:34.260> cutters

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
time they didn't have nano SIM cutters

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.190 
time they didn't have nano SIM cutters
because<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.520> wasn't<00:00:35.820> released<00:00:36.149> yet<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:37.050> now

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
because it wasn't released yet but now

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.150 
because it wasn't released yet but now
they<00:00:37.410> do<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.430> just<00:00:38.700> want<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.180> show<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:40.160> how

they do so I just want to show you how
to<00:00:41.219> get<00:00:41.550> AI<00:00:41.790> nano<00:00:42.540> SIM<00:00:42.930> or<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.590> do<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.129> yourself

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
to get AI nano SIM or to do it yourself

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.290 
to get AI nano SIM or to do it yourself
so<00:00:46.379> if<00:00:46.500> you're<00:00:46.590> going<00:00:46.800> prepaid<00:00:47.430> more<00:00:48.149> than

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
so if you're going prepaid more than

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.549 
so if you're going prepaid more than
likely<00:00:49.520> they'd<00:00:50.520> also<00:00:50.670> nano<00:00:51.149> sims<00:00:51.960> for<00:00:52.350> your

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559

method cheapest route to go but if
you're<00:02:44.710> going<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:44.920> be<00:02:45.040> cutting<00:02:45.720> sim<00:02:46.720> cards<00:02:47.140> on

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
you're going to be cutting sim cards on

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.130 
you're going to be cutting sim cards on
and<00:02:47.530> off<00:02:47.650> on<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.010> off<00:02:48.360> then<00:02:49.360> you<00:02:49.720> want<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:49.989> grab

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
and off on and off then you want to grab

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.699 
and off on and off then you want to grab
basically<00:02:50.830> these<00:02:51.070> two<00:02:51.340> tools<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:53.200> do<00:02:53.350> this<00:02:53.500> is

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
basically these two tools you do this is

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.790 
basically these two tools you do this is
a<00:02:53.739> method<00:02:54.250> yes<00:02:54.970> it<00:02:55.300> saves<00:02:55.570> you<00:02:55.870> around<00:02:56.260> 20

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
a method yes it saves you around 20

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.699 
a method yes it saves you around 20
bucks<00:02:57.100> but<00:02:57.690> you<00:02:58.690> know<00:02:58.780> i<00:02:58.810> mean<00:02:58.959> it<00:02:59.140> is<00:02:59.440> at<00:02:59.680> a

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
bucks but you know i mean it is at a

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.949 
bucks but you know i mean it is at a
risk<00:03:00.690> so<00:03:01.690> first<00:03:02.230> thing<00:03:02.470> first<00:03:03.690> right<00:03:04.690> here

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
risk so first thing first right here

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.960 
risk so first thing first right here
this<00:03:05.680> is<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:05.890> scissors<00:03:06.430> I've<00:03:06.670> already

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
this is the scissors I've already

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.240 
this is the scissors I've already
demonstrated<00:03:07.959> in<00:03:08.140> a<00:03:08.260> previous<00:03:08.560> video<00:03:08.980> that

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
demonstrated in a previous video that

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.300 
demonstrated in a previous video that
this<00:03:09.670> is<00:03:09.850> a<00:03:09.880> method<00:03:10.330> does<00:03:10.780> work<00:03:11.110> it<00:03:11.350> is<00:03:11.830> at<00:03:12.100> your

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
this is a method does work it is at your

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.800 
this is a method does work it is at your
own<00:03:12.370> risk<00:03:12.580> and<00:03:13.709> if<00:03:14.709> you're<00:03:15.040> not<00:03:15.220> careful<00:03:15.810> you

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
own risk and if you're not careful you

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.240 
own risk and if you're not careful you
can<00:03:17.020> damage<00:03:17.500> your<00:03:18.150> SIM<00:03:19.150> card<00:03:19.450> okay<00:03:20.140> so<00:03:20.739> some<00:03:21.220> of

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
can damage your SIM card okay so some of

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.040 
can damage your SIM card okay so some of
these<00:03:21.459> sim<00:03:21.700> card<00:03:21.970> are<00:03:22.180> not<00:03:22.360> see<00:03:22.630> especially

Sims into nano Sims with it okay now the
thing<00:04:09.340> with<00:04:09.520> this<00:04:09.670> one<00:04:09.910> is<00:04:10.290> when<00:04:11.290> you<00:04:11.440> when<00:04:11.920> you

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
thing with this one is when you when you

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.930 
thing with this one is when you when you
insert<00:04:12.460> it<00:04:12.520> here<00:04:13.410> it's<00:04:14.410> not<00:04:14.710> from<00:04:15.130> a<00:04:15.280> standard

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
insert it here it's not from a standard

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.510 
insert it here it's not from a standard
sim<00:04:16.270> to<00:04:16.840> a<00:04:16.870> nano<00:04:17.350> sit<00:04:18.300> here<00:04:19.300> you<00:04:19.540> have<00:04:19.750> to<00:04:20.520> your

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
sim to a nano sit here you have to your

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.600 
sim to a nano sit here you have to your
SIM<00:04:21.850> card<00:04:22.120> has<00:04:22.360> to<00:04:22.570> be<00:04:22.720> a<00:04:22.750> micro<00:04:23.230> sim<00:04:23.500> and<00:04:23.800> then

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
SIM card has to be a micro sim and then

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.580 
SIM card has to be a micro sim and then
it<00:04:24.760> cuts<00:04:25.630> it<00:04:25.810> to<00:04:25.960> a<00:04:25.990> nano-sim<00:04:26.710> okay<00:04:28.320> this<00:04:29.320> one

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
it cuts it to a nano-sim okay this one

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.490 
it cuts it to a nano-sim okay this one
right<00:04:29.800> here<00:04:29.860> this<00:04:30.670> is<00:04:30.940> the<00:04:31.530> standard<00:04:32.530> to<00:04:33.460> a

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
right here this is the standard to a

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.250 
right here this is the standard to a
micro<00:04:35.500> okay<00:04:36.400> so<00:04:37.270> the<00:04:37.540> reason<00:04:37.690> why<00:04:37.900> I'm<00:04:38.050> showing

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
micro okay so the reason why I'm showing

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.460 
micro okay so the reason why I'm showing
you<00:04:38.440> this<00:04:38.740> one<00:04:39.040> is<00:04:39.190> because<00:04:39.580> in<00:04:39.820> order<00:04:40.030> to<00:04:40.470> go

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
you this one is because in order to go

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.170 
you this one is because in order to go
from<00:04:41.800> standard<00:04:42.760> sim<00:04:43.060> to<00:04:43.990> a<00:04:44.020> nano-sim<00:04:44.920> I<00:04:45.250> had<00:04:46.030> to

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
from standard sim to a nano-sim I had to

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.780 
from standard sim to a nano-sim I had to
cut<00:04:46.330> it<00:04:46.360> down<00:04:46.480> to<00:04:46.840> a<00:04:46.960> micro<00:04:47.950> sim<00:04:48.190> first<00:04:48.520> and

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
cut it down to a micro sim first and

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.030 
cut it down to a micro sim first and
then<00:04:49.270> to<00:04:49.450> the<00:04:49.480> nanos<00:04:49.960> said<00:04:50.580> okay<00:04:51.580> and<00:04:52.260> so<00:04:53.260> do

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
then to the nanos said okay and so do

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.730 
then to the nanos said okay and so do
you<00:04:54.190> some<00:04:54.400> example<00:04:55.060> of<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.960> sim<00:04:56.230> cards<00:04:56.620> you

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
you some example of the sim cards you

you some example of the sim cards you
might<00:04:56.950> be<00:04:57.100> getting<00:04:58.770> and<00:04:59.770> grab<00:05:00.160> these<00:05:00.430> two

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
might be getting and grab these two

big plates then you want to go to your

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.720 
big plates then you want to go to your
carrier<00:05:23.800> and<00:05:23.980> switch<00:05:24.250> it<00:05:24.280> out<00:05:24.610> okay<00:05:25.770> so<00:05:26.770> let<00:05:27.700> me

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
can see this one the plates the contact

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.280 
can see this one the plates the contact
place<00:05:35.950> it's<00:05:36.310> smaller<00:05:36.790> than<00:05:37.090> this<00:05:37.810> one<00:05:38.020> on<00:05:38.140> the

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
place it's smaller than this one on the

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.670 
place it's smaller than this one on the
right<00:05:38.470> here<00:05:39.600> but<00:05:40.600> really<00:05:40.990> it<00:05:41.140> doesn't<00:05:41.350> matter

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
right here but really it doesn't matter

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.010 
right here but really it doesn't matter
when<00:05:42.100> you<00:05:42.190> cut<00:05:42.400> it<00:05:42.550> down<00:05:42.760> it<00:05:43.540> doesn't<00:05:43.900> matter

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
when you cut it down it doesn't matter

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.790 
when you cut it down it doesn't matter
it's<00:05:44.440> going<00:05:44.800> to<00:05:44.830> a<00:05:45.330> nano-sim<00:05:46.470> but<00:05:47.470> whichever

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
it's going to a nano-sim but whichever

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.100 
it's going to a nano-sim but whichever
one<00:05:48.100> they<00:05:48.130> give<00:05:48.460> you<00:05:48.700> that's<00:05:49.660> the<00:05:49.840> one<00:05:49.990> you're

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
one they give you that's the one you're

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:57.930 
one they give you that's the one you're
going<00:05:50.290> to<00:05:50.350> cut<00:05:52.890> okay<00:05:54.270> so<00:05:55.590> for<00:05:56.590> example<00:05:56.940> we're

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
going to cut okay so for example we're

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.980 
going to cut okay so for example we're
going<00:05:58.030> to<00:05:58.120> cut<00:05:58.300> this<00:05:58.480> one<00:05:58.690> first<00:06:00.150> to<00:06:01.150> a<00:06:01.450> micro

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
going to cut this one first to a micro

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:15.390 
going to cut this one first to a micro
all<00:06:02.500> right<00:06:02.590> it's<00:06:03.430> like<00:06:03.610> that

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.560 

so<00:06:16.400> just<00:06:16.940> cut<00:06:17.120> down<00:06:17.300> to<00:06:17.510> my<00:06:17.660> grill<00:06:19.390> now<00:06:20.390> we're

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
so just cut down to my grill now we're

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.960 
so just cut down to my grill now we're
going<00:06:20.660> to<00:06:20.720> cut<00:06:21.290> it<00:06:21.410> down<00:06:21.440> to<00:06:21.830> a<00:06:22.160> nano<00:06:23.350> so<00:06:24.350> again

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:24.970 
going to cut it down to a nano so again

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:48.399 
going to cut it down to a nano so again
Michael<00:06:25.970> to<00:06:26.090> nano

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:48.409 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:53.899 

and<00:06:49.409> there<00:06:49.590> we<00:06:49.710> go<00:06:49.969> we<00:06:50.969> have<00:06:52.189> an<00:06:53.189> officially

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:53.909 
and there we go we have an officially

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:57.170 
and there we go we have an officially
home-brewed<00:06:54.569> a<00:06:55.340> nano-sim<00:06:56.340> or<00:06:56.669> home<00:06:56.879> cut

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
home-brewed a nano-sim or home cut

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:06.080 
home-brewed a nano-sim or home cut
nano-sim<00:06:57.900> do<00:06:58.139> yourself<00:07:04.009> so<00:07:05.009> now<00:07:05.189> what<00:07:05.849> are<00:07:05.969> the

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.090 
nano-sim do yourself so now what are the

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.749 
nano-sim do yourself so now what are the
costs<00:07:06.330> of<00:07:06.509> these<00:07:06.719> things<00:07:07.020> okay<00:07:07.770> they're<00:07:08.520> about

00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:08.759 
costs of these things okay they're about

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:10.640 
costs of these things okay they're about
you<00:07:09.120> know<00:07:09.419> I<00:07:09.449> mean<00:07:09.659> ten<00:07:09.930> to<00:07:10.080> twenty<00:07:10.439> bucks

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:10.650 
you know I mean ten to twenty bucks

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:14.029 
you know I mean ten to twenty bucks
really<00:07:11.279> on<00:07:11.599> this<00:07:12.599> one<00:07:12.870> i<00:07:13.169> got<00:07:13.439> it<00:07:13.589> for<00:07:13.710> twenty

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 
really on this one i got it for twenty

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:15.920 
really on this one i got it for twenty
dollars<00:07:14.550> at<00:07:15.029> the<00:07:15.270> time<00:07:15.479> it<00:07:15.659> was<00:07:15.689> first

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930 
dollars at the time it was first

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.649 
dollars at the time it was first
released<00:07:16.080> so<00:07:16.759> you're<00:07:17.759> probably<00:07:17.939> starting<00:07:18.509> to

00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:18.659 
released so you're probably starting to

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:25.879 
released so you're probably starting to
see<00:07:18.990> like<00:07:19.229> the<00:07:19.439> pricing<00:07:19.949> drop<00:07:23.270> ok<00:07:24.270> so<00:07:24.330> i<00:07:24.889> guess

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:25.889 
see like the pricing drop ok so i guess

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:28.969 
see like the pricing drop ok so i guess
if<00:07:26.339> you<00:07:26.490> buy<00:07:26.699> two<00:07:27.110> then<00:07:28.110> it's<00:07:28.620> going<00:07:28.770> to<00:07:28.830> be

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:28.979 
if you buy two then it's going to be

00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:30.469 
if you buy two then it's going to be
around<00:07:29.219> you<00:07:29.520> know<00:07:29.610> I<00:07:29.639> mean<00:07:29.879> twenty<00:07:30.210> thirty

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 
around you know I mean twenty thirty

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:36.219 
around you know I mean twenty thirty
bucks<00:07:33.409> I'm<00:07:34.409> not<00:07:34.589> sure<00:07:34.650> if<00:07:35.099> they<00:07:35.249> make<00:07:35.759> the

00:07:36.219 --> 00:07:36.229 
bucks I'm not sure if they make the

00:07:36.229 --> 00:07:40.070 
bucks I'm not sure if they make the
regular<00:07:37.229> sim<00:07:37.589> to<00:07:37.919> nano<00:07:38.520> yet<00:07:38.939> you<00:07:39.689> guys<00:07:39.870> could

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080
