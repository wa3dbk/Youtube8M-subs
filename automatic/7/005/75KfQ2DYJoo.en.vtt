00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.590
 once they have installed it 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.650
 what they have to do they go to 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.570

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.230
 server online spanish 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.570
 as we entered and here is going to say that the 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.870
 description will make us this world 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:08.629
 without creative survival and combat 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.629
 and here he welcomes the server 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.790
 whether I wanted to tell you more 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.340
 They can give us their name when we are 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.800
 Palin in the group or to add 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.220
 enova and so when we are playing in 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.710
 minecraft to be able to talk to us 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.670
 this doing the constructions well 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.240
 so we may want to do 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.240
 this 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.040
 we do not believe in the group trailers so 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.160
 enter the world and begin to destroy 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.280
 our our things that we have 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.340
 constructed 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.700
