g'day folks I just sort of throw a
little<00:00:03.330> update<00:00:03.720> up<00:00:03.929> and<00:00:04.740> I<00:00:04.830> try<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:05.069> do<00:00:05.250> it

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
little update up and I try and do it

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.909 
little update up and I try and do it
using<00:00:05.520> this<00:00:05.700> computer<00:00:06.240> this<00:00:06.420> is<00:00:07.020> an<00:00:07.259> athlon<00:00:07.529> 64

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
using this computer this is an athlon 64

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.770 
using this computer this is an athlon 64
it's<00:00:08.580> not<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.849> original<00:00:09.000> one<00:00:09.330> that<00:00:09.360> was<00:00:09.570> down

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
it's not the original one that was down

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.499 
it's not the original one that was down
next<00:00:10.170> that<00:00:10.290> was<00:00:10.380> still<00:00:10.559> giving<00:00:10.800> me<00:00:10.889> some<00:00:11.070> grief

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:11.509 
next that was still giving me some grief

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:13.850 
next that was still giving me some grief
it's<00:00:12.509> actually<00:00:12.570> an<00:00:12.809> identical<00:00:13.259> board<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:13.799> all

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
it's actually an identical board so all

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.350 
it's actually an identical board so all
I<00:00:13.950> have<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.099> do<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.400> pull<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.700> hard<00:00:14.880> drives<00:00:15.179> and

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
I have to do is pull the hard drives and

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.640 
I have to do is pull the hard drives and
all<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.509> goodies<00:00:15.719> out<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.139> old<00:00:16.230> one<00:00:16.500> and

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
all the goodies out of the old one and

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.500 
all the goodies out of the old one and
chuck<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.039> in<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.310> one<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:18.060> still<00:00:18.480> a

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
chuck it in this one and still a

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.750 
chuck it in this one and still a
standard<00:00:18.990> gigabyte<00:00:19.380> board<00:00:19.710> with<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.920> loads<00:00:20.580> and

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
standard gigabyte board with a loads and

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.200 
standard gigabyte board with a loads and
loads<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:21.150> features<00:00:22.279> 2.1<00:00:23.279> gigahertz<00:00:23.670> clock

speed<00:00:24.890> I'm<00:00:25.890> just<00:00:25.980> installing<00:00:26.400> my<00:00:26.580> camera

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910

like<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.460> my<00:00:29.580> channel<00:00:29.970> quite<00:00:30.240> well<00:00:30.480> so

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
like on my channel quite well so

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.440 
like on my channel quite well so
hopefully<00:00:32.250> it'll<00:00:32.610> be<00:00:32.669> good<00:00:32.790> for<00:00:32.850> editing<00:00:33.270> them

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
hopefully it'll be good for editing them

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.490 
hopefully it'll be good for editing them
I'm<00:00:33.660> not<00:00:33.780> going<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:33.989> use<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.170> for<00:00:34.350> much

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
I'm not going to use this for much

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.750 
I'm not going to use this for much
playback<00:00:35.450> mainly<00:00:36.450> just<00:00:36.540> an<00:00:36.719> editing<00:00:37.079> box<00:00:37.760> I'll

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
playback mainly just an editing box I'll

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.150 
playback mainly just an editing box I'll
replace<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.719> one<00:00:39.960> soon<00:00:40.290> I've<00:00:40.800> already<00:00:40.950> just

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
replace this one soon I've already just

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.799 
replace this one soon I've already just
I<00:00:41.340> just<00:00:41.370> tweaked<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.850> bios<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.239> overclocked

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
I just tweaked the bios and overclocked

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.209 
I just tweaked the bios and overclocked
it<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.989> bit<00:00:43.140> for<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.320> time<00:00:43.530> being<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.950> doesn't

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
it a bit for the time being it doesn't

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.819 
it a bit for the time being it doesn't
matter<00:00:44.340> if<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.410> but<00:00:46.410> for<00:00:46.590> now<00:00:46.710> I'll

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
matter if it it but for now I'll

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.260 
matter if it it but for now I'll
just<00:00:46.860> get<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.100> little<00:00:47.190> more<00:00:47.399> speed<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.760> use<00:00:48.030> out

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
just get a little more speed and use out

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.630 
just get a little more speed and use out
of<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.420> before<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.750> finally<00:00:49.200> parted<00:00:49.649> out<00:00:49.800> and

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
of it before I finally parted out and

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.770 
of it before I finally parted out and
there<00:00:50.850> probably<00:00:50.940> isn't<00:00:51.210> much<00:00:51.300> point<00:00:51.420> in

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
there probably isn't much point in

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.240 
there probably isn't much point in
cutting<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.199> out<00:00:52.320> because<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.770> can't<00:00:52.980> even<00:00:53.070> use

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
cutting it out because I can't even use

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.560 
cutting it out because I can't even use
