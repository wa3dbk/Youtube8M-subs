00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.819
 hello dear friends swami mr 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.830
 X and today I will do a review on 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:13.769
 its such a homemade wooden 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.540
 tank did for tanks I get two days 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.050
 as much as this ship only 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.869
 ships do two days with breaks 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.400
 And this tanks affairs practically without the first 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.849
 catch two days so what are we that this tank 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.890
 It has 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.640
 he has a hatch for mechvod and hatch for 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.850
 commander 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:45.410
 then his gun goes down and 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:45.410
 rises farther his tower spins 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.350
 there was no peace planned what 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.520
 the wheels will spin too 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:03.090
 but due to the fact that I did eight this 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.780
 the camera was narrow so they 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.490
 pulled off and they stop spinning but I 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.400
 then further it is likely 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.260
 I 'll fix it maybe even lay out already from 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.320
 dancing serviceable tracks 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:24.170
 he will drive the wheels and made out of the handle 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.850
 from a shovel that is, here's a smaller and more 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:32.240
 less is from fixing big from 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:36.330
 shovels because I want to say the form of the tower 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.720
 this whole leg is not only the limit of 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.990
 hands hatch and gun and the body is also a single 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.100
 the whole that is, these ones are under the tracks 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:51.110
 these are the answers 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.110
 hole in no bone 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:02:00.740
 wheel hollows 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:04.320
 they were cut with a saw painted it 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.140
 auto enamels are green and black is 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.700
 everything 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.560
 plain black paint anti rotting with 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.150
