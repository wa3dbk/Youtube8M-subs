00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.769
 what is it about opticians now realizes 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 hardly anything in optics fine but 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.610
 background you notice it anyway 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.070
 worse pcs if the finals in place 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.740

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.779
 number can do a bit better 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.480
 especially for not so good pcs is ob 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.830
 dive deep into the useful motto 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.300
 found with the graphics settings 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.949
 Graphics settings you can see very much 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.060
 very many new possibilities for 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.980
 example with details 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.329
 We can go in and out of the clouds 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.399
 here can the cloud height 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.410
 can set here no idea 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.360
 can the grass on default but can 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.460
 almost if they so something around on 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.320
 default so here everything fits 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.840
 with me always a lot of sun and moon can 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.129
 turn it off and then there is 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.570
 even quality there can everything here 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.460
 you better know crest you know 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.809
 determines the mods so if you in the cph 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.340
 There was this here earlier 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.100
 You can now do that with the circle 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.710
 you often and often stuck and found her again 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.019
 make exactly long about custom cars 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.400
 better snow random ops is it all for 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.640
 the texture pack a bit more here 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.780
 so then made the next animations 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.430
 can we all there is enough? 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.920
 animations there are examples of the 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.630
 from smoke from the water of portals 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.210
 her all an issue here so very 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.799
 not even outlook on everything wonderful 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.030
 asa you can do several things for 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.680
 For example, the weather, weather at all 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.240
 in the game should be activated 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.860
 can you make a car save that is 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.140
 now useful for the singleplayer and 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.090
 can also make 3d here have moment 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.960
 I will be stuck on it without 3d 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.140
 glasses 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:40.400
 No one here so away from collecting again 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.360
 the shit then there is again moment 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.560
 there are still the multiplayer here 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.030
 Settings hinschich but I have to 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.030
 very briefly something in the chat 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.970
 so I locked very cool cat 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.500
 she's into multiplayer 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.340
 Settings may vary depending on how chat 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.880
 to adjust 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.820
 here either if there is such a chat 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.569
 I have to leave again 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.229
 wait you could adjust the 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.840
 height 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.010
 scale height if he must open the 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.660
 width depending on 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.280
 I think that's very, very much 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.690
 is useful only in the mod 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.030
 We have just arrived in 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.830
 the 1.5.2010 when the engine is updated 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.540
 what else is added 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.010
 here is the fine cape 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.290
 that opticat does not exist for everyone 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.660
 but you have to go on the opti wan page 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.250
 I think seven euros something on whether 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.780
 donate deeply to a developer and then 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.120
 Can you get there depending on the one there 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.040
 cape to do so in minecraft names 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.150
 but you can do that extra 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.070
 do a tutorial again if that 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.290
 desired is a very great 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.480
 I also find this function if 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.920
 you are now back then cross 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.700
 you have a kind of magnifying glass here you can 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.780
 see further 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.100
 no idea if I am here now 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.720
 At the moment I'm watching here 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.820
 a lot more that is quite good for 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.190
 for screenshots for minecraft is very 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.390
 made very cool and yes I hope so 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.489
 could be a bit more of the courage 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.989
 I show and forget on facebook too 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.880
 go and on the side of the motto 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.570
 So loud then goodbye and 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.570
 bye
