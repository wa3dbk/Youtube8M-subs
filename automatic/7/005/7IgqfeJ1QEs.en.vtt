00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
once we get those out from the box so

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.240 
once we get those out from the box so
inside<00:00:59.270> of<00:00:59.300> the<00:00:59.450> box<00:00:59.660> are<00:00:59.930> two<00:01:00.230> SATA<00:01:00.710> 3<00:01:00.980> 6

a total of 4 SATA ports on the
motherboard<00:01:05.360> itself<00:01:05.900> and<00:01:06.260> you<00:01:06.920> also<00:01:07.100> get<00:01:07.400> a

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
motherboard itself and you also get a

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.910 
motherboard itself and you also get a
driver<00:01:08.060> DVD<00:01:08.540> this<00:01:08.750> is<00:01:08.900> good<00:01:09.049> to<00:01:09.200> get<00:01:09.290> going<00:01:09.740> but

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
driver DVD this is good to get going but

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.560 
driver DVD this is good to get going but
of<00:01:10.070> course<00:01:10.280> it's<00:01:10.490> usually<00:01:10.729> best<00:01:11.120> to<00:01:11.270> get<00:01:11.450> the

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
of course it's usually best to get the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.030 
of course it's usually best to get the
latest<00:01:11.720> from<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.170> manufacturers<00:01:12.890> website

latest from the manufacturers website
you<00:01:14.000> also<00:01:14.030> get<00:01:14.299> a<00:01:14.330> user<00:01:14.540> guide<00:01:14.750> which<00:01:14.810> you'll

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
you also get a user guide which you'll

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.080 
you also get a user guide which you'll
probably<00:01:15.440> want<00:01:15.770> to<00:01:15.860> keep<00:01:16.040> handy<00:01:16.460> for<00:01:16.850> when<00:01:16.880> you

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
probably want to keep handy for when you

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.640 
probably want to keep handy for when you
actually<00:01:17.240> start<00:01:17.780> plugging<00:01:18.049> in<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.380> front

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
actually start plugging in the front

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.330 
actually start plugging in the front
panel<00:01:18.830> cables<00:01:19.310> to<00:01:19.909> the<00:01:20.030> motherboard<00:01:20.299> pins<00:01:21.340> so

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
panel cables to the motherboard pins so

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.680 
panel cables to the motherboard pins so
I'm<00:01:22.400> just<00:01:22.580> flicking<00:01:22.970> through<00:01:23.210> some<00:01:23.510> of<00:01:23.600> the

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
I'm just flicking through some of the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.760 
I'm just flicking through some of the
pages<00:01:23.869> in<00:01:24.260> the<00:01:24.320> manual<00:01:25.040> and<00:01:26.590> whenever<00:01:27.590> I

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
pages in the manual and whenever I

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.020 
pages in the manual and whenever I
finish<00:01:27.860> that<00:01:28.250> right<00:01:28.580> there

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
finish that right there

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.910 
finish that right there
we<00:01:29.390> do<00:01:29.540> have<00:01:29.720> an<00:01:29.900> i/o<00:01:30.049> backplate<00:01:30.619> it's<00:01:30.799> a

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
we do have an i/o backplate it's a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.770 
we do have an i/o backplate it's a
pretty<00:01:31.310> plain<00:01:31.610> one<00:01:31.850> from<00:01:32.180> what<00:01:32.360> I'm<00:01:32.479> seeing

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
pretty plain one from what I'm seeing

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.840 
pretty plain one from what I'm seeing
because<00:01:32.990> it's<00:01:33.560> not<00:01:33.770> color<00:01:34.010> coded<00:01:34.430> or<00:01:34.549> anything

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
because it's not color coded or anything

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.830 
because it's not color coded or anything
like<00:01:35.090> that<00:01:36.340> so<00:01:37.340> that<00:01:37.460> is<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:37.939> i/o<00:01:38.240> backplate

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
like that so that is the i/o backplate

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.960 
like that so that is the i/o backplate
so<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.650> motherboard<00:01:40.070> itself<00:01:40.189> has<00:01:40.580> a<00:01:40.610> glossy

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
so the motherboard itself has a glossy

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.600 
so the motherboard itself has a glossy
black<00:01:41.420> finish<00:01:41.540> as<00:01:42.080> well<00:01:42.260> as<00:01:42.409> some<00:01:42.560> gold<00:01:43.040> ports
