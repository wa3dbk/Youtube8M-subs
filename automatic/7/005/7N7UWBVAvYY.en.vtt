00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
but I don't know if the camera can pick

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.380 
but I don't know if the camera can pick
this<00:00:19.260> up<00:00:19.439> but<00:00:19.590> I'll<00:00:19.710> just<00:00:19.910> you<00:00:20.910> can<00:00:21.090> see<00:00:21.119> I'm

just<00:00:21.600> breaking<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:22.050> apart<00:00:22.939> and<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.029> can

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
just breaking this apart and you can

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.099 
just breaking this apart and you can
actually<00:00:24.300> see<00:00:24.689> how<00:00:24.869> solid<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:26.210> it<00:00:27.210> is

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
actually see how solid this is it is

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.460 
actually see how solid this is it is
very<00:00:28.289> very<00:00:28.740> solid<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.609> this<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.630> with<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> ratio

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
very very solid and this is with a ratio

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.260 
very very solid and this is with a ratio
of<00:00:31.949> 1<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.250> 1<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:32.880> 1<00:00:33.660> part<00:00:33.930> chocolate<00:00:34.380> one<00:00:34.739> part

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
of 1 to 1 so 1 part chocolate one part

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.069 
of 1 to 1 so 1 part chocolate one part
heavy<00:00:36.270> cream<00:00:36.649> so<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:37.890> see<00:00:38.100> how<00:00:38.780> how<00:00:39.780> hard

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
heavy cream so you can see how how hard

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:40.580 
heavy cream so you can see how how hard
that<00:00:40.200> is

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
that is

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.709 
that is
I'm<00:00:41.309> hoping<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.879> camera<00:00:42.210> can<00:00:42.360> pick<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.660> up

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
I'm hoping the camera can pick that up

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.510 
I'm hoping the camera can pick that up
I'll<00:00:43.440> just<00:00:43.649> scrape<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.370> can

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:16.870 
I heated my cream in the microwave so it
was<00:02:10.220> very<00:02:10.399> hot<00:02:10.729> and<00:02:12.970> if<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.090> find<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:15.880> your

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
was very hot and if you find that your

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.759 
was very hot and if you find that your
cream<00:02:17.209> isn't<00:02:17.540> fully<00:02:18.049> melting<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.590> chocolate

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
cream isn't fully melting the chocolate

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.440 
cream isn't fully melting the chocolate
then<00:02:19.130> what<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.400> can<00:02:19.519> do<00:02:19.670> is<00:02:19.819> take<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.180> whole

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
then what you can do is take the whole

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.569 
then what you can do is take the whole
mixture<00:02:20.840> just<00:02:21.470> like<00:02:21.620> this<00:02:21.799> in<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.100> bowl<00:02:22.280> and

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
mixture just like this in the bowl and

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.530 
mixture just like this in the bowl and
put<00:02:23.019> it<00:02:24.019> in<00:02:24.109> the<00:02:24.170> microwave<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:25.269> just<00:02:26.269> put<00:02:26.450> it

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
put it in the microwave and just put it

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.680 
put it in the microwave and just put it
on<00:02:26.660> for<00:02:26.959> about<00:02:27.109> 10<00:02:27.319> seconds<00:02:27.739> at<00:02:27.859> a<00:02:27.889> time<00:02:28.690> you

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
on for about 10 seconds at a time you

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.780 
on for about 10 seconds at a time you
can<00:02:29.840> use<00:02:29.989> regular<00:02:30.440> mode<00:02:30.650> just<00:02:31.280> make<00:02:31.459> sure<00:02:31.639> you

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
can use regular mode just make sure you

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.559 
can use regular mode just make sure you
watch<00:02:32.000> it<00:02:32.139> so<00:02:33.139> that<00:02:33.380> you<00:02:34.130> don't<00:02:34.340> you<00:02:35.269> know<00:02:35.389> have

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
watch it so that you don't you know have

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.490 
watch it so that you don't you know have
it<00:02:35.680> overflow<00:02:36.680> in<00:02:36.980> your<00:02:37.430> microwave<00:02:38.260> so<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:39.319> can

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
it overflow in your microwave so I can

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.990 
it overflow in your microwave so I can
feel<00:02:39.769> that<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.040> chocolate<00:02:40.549> is<00:02:40.670> really

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
feel that the chocolate is really

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.140 
feel that the chocolate is really
starting<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.510> melt<00:02:41.720> now<00:02:42.489> you<00:02:43.489> can<00:02:43.670> also<00:02:43.850> use<00:02:44.000> a

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
starting to melt now you can also use a

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:52.059 
starting to melt now you can also use a
whisk<00:02:44.510> if<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:45.109> wish<00:02:46.989> just<00:02:47.989> do<00:02:48.170> this<00:02:49.630> mmm<00:02:51.069> and

chocolate<00:03:24.250> is<00:03:24.520> just<00:03:24.550> appearing<00:03:25.180> out<00:03:25.450> of

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
chocolate is just appearing out of

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:35.690 
chocolate is just appearing out of
nowhere

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.440 

and<00:03:36.180> right<00:03:36.450> now<00:03:36.770> this<00:03:37.770> is<00:03:38.010> very<00:03:38.069> very<00:03:38.700> liquidy

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
and right now this is very very liquidy

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.070 
and right now this is very very liquidy
however<00:03:40.260> if<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.590> chilled<00:03:40.950> this<00:03:41.160> down<00:03:42.080> it

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
however if you chilled this down it

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:50.930 
however if you chilled this down it
would<00:03:43.410> solidify<00:03:44.720> quite<00:03:45.720> nicely<00:03:49.819> now<00:03:50.819> if

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
would solidify quite nicely now if

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.030 
would solidify quite nicely now if
you're<00:03:51.060> gonna<00:03:51.180> pour<00:03:51.450> this<00:03:51.599> on<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:51.810> cake<00:03:52.140> what

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
you're gonna pour this on a cake what

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.920 
you're gonna pour this on a cake what
you<00:03:53.160> want<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.489> do<00:03:53.640> is<00:03:53.970> you<00:03:54.300> want<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.569> let<00:03:54.810> this

you want to do is you want to let this

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.460 
you want to do is you want to let this
cool<00:03:55.400> because<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:57.000> more<00:03:57.180> liquidy<00:03:57.630> it<00:03:57.780> is<00:03:57.959> the

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
cool because the more liquidy it is the

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.440 
cool because the more liquidy it is the
less<00:03:58.680> is<00:03:58.860> actually<00:03:59.220> going<00:03:59.400> to<00:03:59.489> stay<00:04:00.120> on<00:04:00.150> the

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
less is actually going to stay on the

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
chill down a little bit so what you can

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.680 
chill down a little bit so what you can
do<00:04:10.080> is<00:04:10.200> just<00:04:10.410> leave<00:04:10.650> it<00:04:10.769> on<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:11.040> counter<00:04:11.940> or

what you can do to quicken the process

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.050 
what you can do to quicken the process
so<00:04:14.970> you<00:04:15.000> can<00:04:15.209> put<00:04:15.390> it<00:04:15.739> in<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.950> fridge<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:18.030> chill

so you can put it in the fridge to chill

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.650 
so you can put it in the fridge to chill
it<00:04:18.359> down<00:04:18.590> and<00:04:19.590> then<00:04:20.160> just<00:04:20.340> stir<00:04:20.549> it<00:04:20.700> every<00:04:20.790> 10
