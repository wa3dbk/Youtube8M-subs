post it but it's not super white but

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.370 
post it but it's not super white but
they<00:01:55.619> do<00:01:55.680> look<00:01:56.040> like<00:01:56.689> they<00:01:57.689> look<00:01:57.899> like<00:01:57.930> teeth

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
they do look like they look like teeth

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.050 
they do look like they look like teeth
because<00:01:59.009> teeth<00:01:59.280> have<00:01:59.549> kind<00:01:59.880> of<00:01:59.909> like<00:02:00.000> a

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
because teeth have kind of like a

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.620 
because teeth have kind of like a
natural<00:02:00.890> color<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:02.700> them<00:02:02.939> like<00:02:03.240> different

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
natural color in them like different

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.260 
natural color in them like different
colors<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> little<00:02:04.259> bit<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:05.460> that's<00:02:06.060> what<00:02:06.210> I

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
colors a little bit and that's what I

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.660 
colors a little bit and that's what I
look<00:02:06.450> for<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.110> they<00:02:07.619> match<00:02:07.860> them<00:02:08.069> up<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.280> my

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
look for and they match them up to my

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.309 
look for and they match them up to my
bottom<00:02:08.910> teeth<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.569> does<00:02:09.720> depend<00:02:09.750> on<00:02:10.140> your

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
bottom teeth so it does depend on your

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.240 
bottom teeth so it does depend on your
