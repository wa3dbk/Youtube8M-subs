00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.170
 Hello dear friends with you channel 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.470
 centuries and today we will play a game 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.480
 world palace we have a movie like that 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.760
 war of the worlds z film turned out not very 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.150
 let's see what happens 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.670
 game world war z is adventure 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.340
 action shooter based on the movie a zombie 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.559
 apocalypse this game has excellent 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.780
 the graphics are superb gameplay and 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.540
 great atmosphere we start as usual 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.510
 From the analysis of the plot it is quite simple 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.850
 however, our world is not boring again 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.100
 House swept by a virus 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.320
 which kills people however their bodies 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.160
 continue to live using only 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.410
 by instincts 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.719
 our hero employee un gary lane 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.940
 trying to stop by all means 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.100
 epidemic destroying all the monsters on 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.410
 we have a hard time to go our way 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.270
 way to save the earth as far as 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.030
 the game itself is a beautiful shooter from the first 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.729
 persons which represented as many as 28 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.280
 month as well as a huge arsenal of weapons 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.250
 with all sorts of improvements also in the game 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.280
 world war z there are various 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.090
 puzzles passing which we can 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.409
 take a break from the dead 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.909
 the developers tried to bring closer to 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.070
 friend of reality that is, we will not 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.500
 head off the crowd of zombies 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.960
 no first we have to sort out 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.130
 going on we will find different 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.110
 letters of other survivors 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.110
 listen to radio signals and others 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.420
 important soundtrack recording is also very 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.240
 stressful and grim that reinforces 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.479
 the bloody entourage of the game is something like 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.340
 It was a slender and also very nice 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.920
 there are different modes here 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.679
 control and shooting what does it mean 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.590
 that now we will suffer with uncomfortable 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:59.289
 management also as you progress 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.659
 improve your illumination find 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.270
 new weapons and most importantly do not forget 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.119
 keep track of the number of rounds with a knife 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.569
 against the ban of course very bravely but 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.869
 yet 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:13.330
 hopelessly I'm sure every fan 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.680
 shooters and once faced with the fact that 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.080
 he ran out of ammo 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.170
 agree this is not a very pleasant moment 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.780
 however, this application also has 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.430
 melee combat modes that will allow 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.970
 we survive even with an empty store 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.680
 a few words on the chart it seems to me 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.380
 done very well about it 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.569
 testifies at least the fact that the game 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.530
 weighs about two gigabytes it is very 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.410
 hard game 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.600
 if you have a lot of free space on 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.329
 device then you can without thinking 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.880
 choose this particular shooter he promises 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.350
 we all have a few hours of gameplay and 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.829
 great atmosphere 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:54.010
 Finally I want to say that about one 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.900
 trumps games is a survival mode yes if 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.690
 you have completed the passage of the main 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.609
 but the campaign is very fond of 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.739
 you can try your hand at mode 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:05.680
 survival game promises to be very 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.680
 interesting and exciting
