almost won the heat and then in the main
I<00:03:02.930> thought<00:03:03.260> I<00:03:03.290> was<00:03:03.530> screwed<00:03:03.890> but<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:04.459> then<00:03:04.580> we

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
I thought I was screwed but and then we

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.220 
I thought I was screwed but and then we
came<00:03:04.910> back<00:03:04.970> we<00:03:05.330> fought<00:03:05.600> tooth<00:03:05.900> and<00:03:06.020> nail<00:03:06.110> for

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
came back we fought tooth and nail for

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.830 
came back we fought tooth and nail for
it<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:06.709> you<00:03:06.890> know<00:03:07.010> pull<00:03:07.730> it<00:03:07.880> through<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:08.150> that

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
it and you know pull it through and that

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.620 
it and you know pull it through and that
one's<00:03:09.050> for<00:03:09.170> Jessie<00:03:09.530> I<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.820> had<00:03:11.090> his<00:03:11.240> number<00:03:11.360> on

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
one's for Jessie I I had his number on

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.150 
one's for Jessie I I had his number on
the<00:03:11.720> back<00:03:11.840> of<00:03:12.020> my<00:03:12.080> home<00:03:12.260> at<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.500> whole<00:03:12.680> day<00:03:12.890> he

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
the back of my home at the whole day he

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.040 
the back of my home at the whole day he
was<00:03:13.280> with<00:03:13.430> me<00:03:13.580> for<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.790> whole<00:03:13.910> ride<00:03:14.150> that<00:03:14.810> last

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
was with me for the whole ride that last

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.570 
was with me for the whole ride that last
straightaway<00:03:15.500> that<00:03:15.739> bikes<00:03:15.950> never<00:03:16.220> ran<00:03:16.400> that

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
straightaway that bikes never ran that

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.190 
straightaway that bikes never ran that
good<00:03:16.760> before<00:03:16.910> so<00:03:17.270> I<00:03:17.330> figured<00:03:17.720> Jessie<00:03:18.080> was

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
good before so I figured Jessie was

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.750 
good before so I figured Jessie was
probably<00:03:18.470> running<00:03:18.800> behind<00:03:18.920> me<00:03:19.190> pushing<00:03:19.610> that

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
probably running behind me pushing that

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.210 
probably running behind me pushing that
thing<00:03:19.970> you<00:03:20.810> know<00:03:20.900> I<00:03:20.930> he<00:03:21.620> was<00:03:21.770> with<00:03:21.920> me<00:03:22.040> for<00:03:22.160> the

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
thing you know I he was with me for the

00:03:22.220 --> 00:05:38.720 
thing you know I he was with me for the
whole<00:03:22.340> ride<00:03:22.520> and<00:03:22.730> I<00:03:22.820> could<00:03:23.209> feel<00:03:23.390> him

should have played a little more

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.310 
should have played a little more
conservative<00:05:55.240> we<00:05:55.540> were<00:05:55.630> kind<00:05:55.810> of<00:05:55.870> bumping<00:05:56.230> and

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
conservative we were kind of bumping and

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.450 
conservative we were kind of bumping and
banging<00:05:56.500> and<00:05:56.740> bashed<00:05:56.950> and<00:05:57.130> probably

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
banging and bashed and probably

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.340 
banging and bashed and probably
situation<00:05:58.330> I<00:05:58.390> should<00:05:58.600> have<00:05:58.690> put<00:05:58.810> myself<00:05:58.960> in

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
situation I should have put myself in

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.260 
situation I should have put myself in

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
know I just if I'm not leading try to

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.230 
know I just if I'm not leading try to
get<00:06:14.770> to<00:06:14.860> the<00:06:14.950> front<00:06:15.190> you<00:06:15.700> know<00:06:15.760> I<00:06:15.820> just<00:06:16.030> took

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
get to the front you know I just took

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.420 
get to the front you know I just took
took<00:06:16.720> the<00:06:16.840> easy<00:06:16.990> route<00:06:17.200> and<00:06:17.470> just<00:06:17.650> you<00:06:18.400> know

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
took the easy route and just you know

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.550 
took the easy route and just you know
let<00:06:18.850> it<00:06:18.970> off<00:06:19.090> a<00:06:19.120> turn<00:06:19.450> for<00:06:19.720> and<00:06:19.960> you<00:06:20.260> know<00:06:20.380> made

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
let it off a turn for and you know made

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.070 
let it off a turn for and you know made
those<00:06:20.740> guys<00:06:20.950> try<00:06:21.160> to<00:06:21.220> pass<00:06:21.430> me<00:06:21.670> and<00:06:21.910> uh<00:06:22.020> Jared<00:06:23.020> I

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
those guys try to pass me and uh Jared I

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.840 
those guys try to pass me and uh Jared I
think<00:06:23.110> came<00:06:23.470> up<00:06:23.500> probably<00:06:24.280> about<00:06:24.400> an<00:06:24.760> inch

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 
think came up probably about an inch

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.610 
think came up probably about an inch
short<00:06:25.000> it<00:06:25.480> was<00:06:25.630> it<00:06:25.930> was<00:06:26.020> pretty<00:06:26.200> close<00:06:26.440> there

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
short it was it was pretty close there

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.350 
short it was it was pretty close there
at<00:06:26.680> the<00:06:26.770> line<00:06:26.950> and<00:06:27.190> you<00:06:27.850> know<00:06:27.940> I<00:06:27.970> didn't<00:06:28.240> know

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
at the line and you know I didn't know

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.940 
at the line and you know I didn't know
didn't<00:06:28.900> know<00:06:28.960> who<00:06:29.110> had<00:06:29.290> it<00:06:29.320> till<00:06:29.560> we<00:06:29.620> came<00:06:29.770> back

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:29.950 
didn't know who had it till we came back

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.120 
didn't know who had it till we came back
around<00:06:30.130> but<00:06:30.520> like<00:06:30.790> I<00:06:31.780> said<00:06:31.870> I<00:06:32.020> mean<00:06:32.290> it's<00:06:32.470> uh<00:06:32.560> I

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.130 
around but like I said I mean it's uh I

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.520 
around but like I said I mean it's uh I
don't<00:06:33.640> think<00:06:33.790> it's<00:06:34.060> sunk<00:06:34.480> in<00:06:34.660> yet<00:06:34.750> the<00:06:35.080> knot

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
don't think it's sunk in yet the knot

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.290 
don't think it's sunk in yet the knot
and<00:06:35.680> my<00:06:35.800> stomach's<00:06:36.190> gone<00:06:36.370> but<00:06:36.700> you<00:06:37.150> know<00:06:37.240> I

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
and my stomach's gone but you know I

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.900 
and my stomach's gone but you know I
don't<00:06:37.360> think<00:06:37.660> the<00:06:37.810> whole<00:06:38.770> deal<00:06:38.980> is<00:06:39.190> settled<00:06:39.730> in

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:39.910 
don't think the whole deal is settled in

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.420 
don't think the whole deal is settled in
yet<00:06:40.150> and<00:06:40.630> I<00:06:40.690> think<00:06:40.930> there<00:06:41.080> were<00:06:41.250> just<00:06:42.250> as

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:42.430 
yet and I think there were just as

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.920 
yet and I think there were just as
