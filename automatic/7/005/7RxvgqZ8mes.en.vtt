this<00:00:01.350> video<00:00:01.709> is<00:00:02.070> on<00:00:02.310> lactic<00:00:02.909> acid

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
this video is on lactic acid

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.820 
this video is on lactic acid
fermentation<00:00:05.810> it<00:00:06.810> to<00:00:07.170> begins<00:00:07.620> with<00:00:07.770> a

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
fermentation it to begins with a

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.299 
fermentation it to begins with a
molecule<00:00:08.040> of<00:00:08.400> glucose<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.710> this<00:00:10.710> glucose

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
molecule of glucose and this glucose

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.120 
molecule of glucose and this glucose
molecule<00:00:11.969> splits<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:13.969> forms<00:00:15.289> two<00:00:16.289> molecules

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
molecule splits and forms two molecules

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:30.259 
molecule splits and forms two molecules
of<00:00:17.400> pyruvate<00:00:28.099> so<00:00:29.099> these<00:00:29.340> are<00:00:29.550> intermediate

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
of pyruvate so these are intermediate

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.680 
of pyruvate so these are intermediate
molecules<00:00:31.309> pyruvate<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:34.940> these<00:00:35.940> chemical

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
molecules pyruvate and these chemical

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.360 
molecules pyruvate and these chemical
reactions<00:00:37.640> produce<00:00:38.640> one<00:00:39.149> molecule<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.870> ATP

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
reactions produce one molecule of ATP

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:48.799 
reactions produce one molecule of ATP
here<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:42.440> one<00:00:43.440> molecule<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:44.989> ATP<00:00:47.629> here<00:00:48.629> and

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
here and one molecule of ATP here and

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.470 
here and one molecule of ATP here and
we'll<00:00:48.989> put<00:00:49.230> our<00:00:49.350> money<00:00:49.649> sign<00:00:50.070> beside<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.270> we

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
we'll put our money sign beside it so we

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.060 
we'll put our money sign beside it so we
know<00:00:51.629> how<00:00:51.809> important<00:00:52.350> they<00:00:52.530> are<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:55.070> these

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
know how important they are and these

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.400 
know how important they are and these
reactions<00:00:56.820> would<00:00:57.120> not<00:00:57.360> happen<00:00:57.660> without<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
reactions would not happen without the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.080 
reactions would not happen without the
oxidizing<00:00:59.100> power<00:00:59.670> of<00:01:00.199> NAD+<00:01:01.199> which<00:01:02.090> gets

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
oxidizing power of NAD+ which gets

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:13.039 
oxidizing power of NAD+ which gets
turned<00:01:03.539> into<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:06.350> D<00:01:07.350> H<00:01:09.770> and<00:01:11.540> the<00:01:12.540> same<00:01:12.750> thing

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
turned into in a D H and the same thing

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.130 
turned into in a D H and the same thing
happens<00:01:13.470> down<00:01:13.650> here<00:01:14.659> but<00:01:15.659> I'm<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:15.810> going<00:01:15.990> to

draw<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.590> once<00:01:18.140> now<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.200> goal<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.770> lactic<00:01:20.250> acid

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
draw it once now the goal in lactic acid

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.660 
draw it once now the goal in lactic acid
fermentation<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.659> make<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.200> lot<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.280> ATP

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
fermentation is to make a lot of ATP

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.420 
fermentation is to make a lot of ATP
which<00:01:24.270> means<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.229> split<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.890> lot<00:01:26.310> of

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
which means you have to split a lot of

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.510 
which means you have to split a lot of
glucose<00:01:26.970> which<00:01:27.590> means<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.799> need<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.070> steady

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
glucose which means you need a steady

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.429 
glucose which means you need a steady
supply<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:30.329> nad<00:01:30.780> plus<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:33.720> only<00:01:33.869> way<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
supply of nad plus and the only way the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.780 
supply of nad plus and the only way the
cell<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:34.979> manage<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:36.030> recycle<00:01:36.710> the

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
cell can manage that is to recycle the

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:46.100 
cell can manage that is to recycle the
NADH<00:01:39.470> back<00:01:40.470> into<00:01:41.450> nad<00:01:42.619> plus<00:01:44.630> so<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.810> can<00:01:46.020> be

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
NADH back into nad plus so it can be

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.039 
NADH back into nad plus so it can be
used<00:01:46.320> again<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.250> again<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.149> again

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
used again and again and again

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.130 
used again and again and again
and<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:50.790> only<00:01:50.970> way<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.240> accomplish<00:01:51.659> this

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
and the only way to accomplish this

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.719 
and the only way to accomplish this
recycling<00:01:52.829> trick<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:54.329> convert<00:01:55.049> pyruvate

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
recycling trick is to convert pyruvate

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:04.179 
recycling trick is to convert pyruvate
into<00:01:57.530> lactic<00:02:00.590> acid

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.540

which is a toxic product produced in

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.400 
which is a toxic product produced in
animal<00:02:09.030> cells<00:02:10.250> when<00:02:11.250> they<00:02:12.239> do<00:02:12.300> not<00:02:12.630> receive

of<00:02:17.910> intense<00:02:18.410> exercise<00:02:21.680> when<00:02:22.680> exercising

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
of intense exercise when exercising

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.850

vigorously your muscles cannot receive
enough<00:02:26.190> oxygen<00:02:26.780> so<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.989> cells<00:02:28.290> switch<00:02:28.830> over

NAD+ grabs an electron from glucose and
becomes<00:02:55.500> NADH
