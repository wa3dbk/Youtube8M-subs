00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
here my program there's a my block right

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.900 
here my program there's a my block right
over<00:01:37.510> here<00:01:38.490> which<00:01:39.490> I<00:01:40.380> will<00:01:41.380> open<00:01:41.530> up<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.820> you

the<00:02:04.220> general<00:02:04.640> program<00:02:05.090> which<00:02:06.020> is<00:02:06.170> basically<00:02:06.500> a

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
the general program which is basically a

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.060 
the general program which is basically a
few<00:02:06.950> loops<00:02:07.310> a<00:02:07.580> few<00:02:08.060> what<00:02:08.570> if<00:02:08.890> contained<00:02:09.890> within

built<00:02:30.220> okay<00:02:34.120> basically<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.420> two<00:02:35.690> green

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
built okay basically the two green

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.360 
built okay basically the two green
wheels<00:02:36.320> would<00:02:36.620> be<00:02:36.950> coming<00:02:37.220> here<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:39.190> here<00:02:40.190> and

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
wheels would be coming here and here and

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:50.170 
wheels would be coming here and here and
if<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.240> can<00:02:41.360> see<00:02:41.540> that<00:02:41.570> but<00:02:41.960> I<00:02:42.230> can<00:02:43.100> zoom<00:02:43.310> in

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.580 

the<00:02:51.180> green<00:02:51.450> wheels<00:02:51.690> will<00:02:51.960> get<00:02:52.200> caught<00:02:52.410> in

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
the green wheels will get caught in

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.300 
the green wheels will get caught in
these<00:02:52.710> gears<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.370> rotate<00:02:54.440> these<00:02:55.440> go<00:02:55.740> straight

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
these gears and rotate these go straight

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.800 
these gears and rotate these go straight
into<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:56.640> water<00:02:56.820> here<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:59.420> these<00:03:00.420> little

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
into the water here and these little

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.860 
into the water here and these little
things<00:03:00.840> here<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.320> stick<00:03:01.680> out<00:03:02.390> are<00:03:03.390> to

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
things here that stick out are to

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.380 
things here that stick out are to
prevent<00:03:04.200> some<00:03:04.560> stuff<00:03:05.520> lying<00:03:05.850> on<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.150> floor

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
prevent some stuff lying on the floor

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.170 
prevent some stuff lying on the floor
