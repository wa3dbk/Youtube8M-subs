00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.830
 Guys, we're making this video. 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.170
 here with some plan boxes for 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.349
 that you have a sense of what these 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:15.030
 boxes can save you, this is the 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:18.240
 box type 14 03 of the protector line 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.510
 are boxes that have a relief in the curves 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.119
 it is to give greater security in case of 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.560
 tightening of storage or even 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.560
 heavy transport 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.850
 this box 14 03 even though it seems 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.989
 small it holds the second largest 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.370
 area of â€‹â€‹common use in Brazil would be 838 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.670
 6 1/2 inches 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.510
 okay so if you have 18 38 6 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.809
 inches and 6 889 a ciclope a python 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.719
 these guns fit in here with cable 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.239
 of rubber or wood are the dimensions 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.219
 exact box you find on the page 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.190
 her on the site 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.710
 Our job here is to make the video for 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.110
 you see how it is used then there is 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.979
 people have a very dense foam and 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.280
 same time but I would wait here 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:16.560
 people have a second choice is the model 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.360
 10 137 who holds up to two 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.200
 average size so you can have a 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.360
 revolver 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.299
 You can have a gun with him. 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.549
 That revolver can come back here. 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.250
 You can for two snow two pistols. 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.950
 is at your discretion as you 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.810
 will keep the memory of what these 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.810
 weapons we're showing too 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.810
 is on sale on our website and our 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.240
 physical stores ok is properly 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.310
 legalized you can get the 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.409
 Do you already have a gun? 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.560
 our intention is to show and sell the 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.360
 box here we have 14 04 that 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.409
 also the protective line 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.240
 obviously taller higher 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.469

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.799
 site 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.990
 and this box already contains more than 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.530
 two or three or four years 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.429
 so you have the same system here 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.510
 foams 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.740
 but it has one more internal that is 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.130
 intended for 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.230
 for ammunition loaders is 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.590
 more rectangular things 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.420
 but it is possible for you for example 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:29.400
 put more guns in here 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:35.520
 Okay then you can see here what we 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:37.890
 we have three weapons and one free space 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:44.880

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:48.210

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.280
 here including that of 8 inches and 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:55.520
 three eighths of compliance 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:58.550
 we have in the latter the space until 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.550
 five o'clock 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.220
