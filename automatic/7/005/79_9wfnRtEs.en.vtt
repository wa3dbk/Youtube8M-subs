00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:18.360
 Automatically translated by the machine. This is my favorite casual hairstyle. 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.020
 At the moment, because it's fast and convenient, one looks like a cat's ear. 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.480
 Start brushing your teeth and split your hair into two parts. 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.220
 A small part of the hair above one side of the ear, which is brushed upwards. 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:40.220
 Twist slightly to the middle like this. 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.890
 It folds and twists back to sit on your head. 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.500
 The more you twist the top, the shape will be pointed into a small triangular ear. 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.100
 It helps to have slightly dirty hair, so it has a texture to keep the shape. 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.670
 Pin place a hairpin push front horizontal middle back plate 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.670
 So they form an X shape. Repeat on the other side. 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:27.050
 Twisted into the middle again, so it is the first opposite. 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.930
 Give them a good spray and let them stay where you are. 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.770
 So cute, it only takes about 5 minutes. Now release your inner kitten. 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.150

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.030
 Goodbye!
