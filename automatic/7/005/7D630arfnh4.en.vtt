00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.950
 random thought lasso for just 89 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.469
 rubles on the site about dota2.ru 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.960
 good range and low prices link 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.500
 In the description and Zdarova bandits at all 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.949
 anyway soon we will play with you 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.990
 fallout 4 is pretty cool like me 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.570
 generally fallout and but this one 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.170
 from the cult game series the game series which 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.820
 not bothered unlike many things in 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.600
 which I played in my childhood for example and 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.000
 jove there empires in childhood amused 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.829
 now absolutely not interested even 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.680
 there last parts all these there 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.340
 online variations like this don't cling 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.760
 Heroes 3 Yes, I also tried new heroes 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.550
 looked well for some reason here somehow in not 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.239
 goes is those same buccaneers in childhood 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.420
 in which I played wildly and it is very me 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.820
 like here now reinstall leg 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.410
 there are no variations like old 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.439
 it was relatively relatively 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.549
 old too somehow does not cling and 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:09.030
 perhaps the only childhood game 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.400
 which I have left and the game t-shirt 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.500
 with which I proudly opened ours 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.500
 there is a little secret t-shirt with 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:23.710
 logo logo and glorious toys 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.390
 This fallout 2 Fallout I climbed along and 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.040
 across 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.940
 1 fallout somehow a little past me 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.090
 I passed it 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.979
 I ran into it but somehow I was past 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.540
 at one time we just amused fallout 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.470
 tactics although he certainly was wild 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.990
 linear but he was also so mixed up 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.990
 nice but about treshki new vegas 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.240
 you know but it was impossible to make a fallout 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.390
 but the new fallout fallout am2 that is 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.470
 of course there is a lot of everything 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.030
 not at all, but nevertheless this 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.490
 the atmosphere in my opinion wasteland 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.340
 radioactive preserved because not 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.690
 looking at all these fake crafts 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.580
 despite all these variations up to which 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.190
 one way or another go so far on here 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.409
 these here are type fallout about game fallout 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.520
 remained himself this is the only thing 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.200
 perhaps just to burn 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.429
 apocalyptic universe which 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.940
 really interesting which is nice 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.830
 to play 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.300
 so I will wait very much for the four of me 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.709
 a bit confused by the price because two 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.650
 thousand rubles still for us now 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:21.720
 these are big well as someone above most 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.720
 for money well 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.410
 I'd like to hope that it will be 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.959
 something incredibly cool only 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.620
 that I would like some 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.569
 a collector to take but again you need it 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.209
 will order can be take and 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.240
 a collectible it will cost 120 bachey 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.250
 as they say i would like to this 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.660
 posters something here but fallout 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.100
 ska themes I would be very pleased 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.330
 someone thread figurine claw death or 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.480
 baby doll she would be very 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.820
 but such useless bullshit really 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.160
 I would like with regard to the game date well 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.959
 who was interested in those who know what will happen 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.550
 everything happens in boston 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.510
 cool enough i mean these are all 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.250
 moments there like capitol on in 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.690
 postapocalyptic version it is real 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.730
 very cool but all the more fallout she 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.820
 always wind apocalypse yes what is that 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.590
 the war is cool and elegant music by whispered 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.900
 all fallout soundtracks and all tracks 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.489
 who were taken for dubbing palau there 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.209
 is not specially written music but my 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:26.100
 and these are the tracks 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.620
 have long been known and popular and 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.329
 certain circles this is very cool then 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.880
 there is a fallout this game is atmospheric i 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:35.640
 really appreciate the music in the books in women 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.130
 you know some such ability to create 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.230
 atmosphere and fallout this is exactly the game 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.120
 which really captures me 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.310
 and despite the fact that I'm already old before 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.940
 so far the fallout played years probably with 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.430
 a dozen years ago as a child 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:54.299
 even though I'm already old 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.980
 man i'm really looking forward to fallout 4 i mean i 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.530
 Well, not one game, and so did not expect how 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.380
 new fallout so of course we will 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.930
 we will do something else a question what 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.710
 in terms of video how much will it be to you 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.610
 interesting again this is a question for you 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.050
 interesting it will look fallout on 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.630
 this channel and it will need to be moved 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.620
 as I started the tradition transfer 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.980
 to other channels 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.660
 maybe I have no principal 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.070
 that's it with Fallout I do not have 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.110
 principle is something I need a bunch 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.460
 views to type no I want me for 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.800
 I will play myself anyway 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.510
 shoot what's interesting i most likely 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.160
 I will stream it and what cool moments 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.080
 we can with you with those of this 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.840
 will certainly want to experience together therefore 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.480
 guys are all waiting for the fallout, I'm really looking forward 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.160
 fallout will be periodic public 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.760
 playin fallout i down to fallout in 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.310
 distributed but i will still play so 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.410
 be sure to wait here 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.150
 as for the character, last time 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.520
 when I was shooting a foul I was making characters 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.070
 similar to yourself maybe here will be 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:00.180
 the same but most likely I did 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:05.760
 the way your favorite model where when for 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:07.920
 many points 0 points this is very cool 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.120
 I love when a lot of points of movement 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.580
 in fact 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.230
 look anyway before that is 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.850
 asked for a fallout and if guys but i 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.010
 really looking forward i mean this is the game that i 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.810
 I 'm really really waiting for the last one 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.490
 in the last two years probably more 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.560
 of course, therefore of course we will 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.720
 play and see as for 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.490
 passing the old date basically i'm not 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.050
 I think that is very important now though 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.020
 can be on the stream too 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.020
 before the release of the new yes why not 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.020
 we'll see
