00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.869 
measure one and a half inch strips along
the<00:02:05.549> sides<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:06.210> our<00:02:06.750> braid<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.759> we're<00:02:08.759> going

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
the sides of our braid and we're going

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.749 
the sides of our braid and we're going
to<00:02:08.940> start<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.679> brai

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
to start to brai

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.119 
to start to brai
that<00:02:10.970> from<00:02:11.269> the<00:02:11.390> top<00:02:11.659> fold<00:02:12.260> that<00:02:12.439> down<00:02:12.500> and

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
that from the top fold that down and

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:15.759 
that from the top fold that down and
then<00:02:13.730> alternate<00:02:14.450> our<00:02:14.659> strips<00:02:15.200> along<00:02:15.470> the

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
then alternate our strips along the

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.649 
then alternate our strips along the
sides<00:02:16.010> I<00:02:16.250> use<00:02:16.489> a<00:02:16.519> ruler<00:02:17.000> and<00:02:17.209> just<00:02:17.420> measure

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
sides I use a ruler and just measure

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:21.030 
sides I use a ruler and just measure
that<00:02:17.989> out<00:02:18.170> or<00:02:18.409> you<00:02:18.530> can<00:02:18.560> just<00:02:18.769> eyeball<00:02:19.159> that<00:02:19.780> so

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
that out or you can just eyeball that so

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.910 
that out or you can just eyeball that so
one<00:02:22.040> and<00:02:22.189> a<00:02:22.250> half<00:02:22.459> inch<00:02:22.700> strips<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:24.620> can<00:02:24.650> use

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
one and a half inch strips you can use

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.330 
one and a half inch strips you can use
the<00:02:25.069> pizza<00:02:25.489> cutter<00:02:25.760> or<00:02:26.120> you<00:02:26.569> can<00:02:26.780> use<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.349> sharp

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
the pizza cutter or you can use a sharp

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.660 
the pizza cutter or you can use a sharp
knife<00:02:28.819> to<00:02:28.879> measure<00:02:29.450> those<00:02:30.190> along<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.400> sides

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
knife to measure those along the sides

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.080 
knife to measure those along the sides
and<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.030> go<00:02:32.209> in<00:02:32.510> about<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:33.620> half<00:02:34.579> an<00:02:34.700> inch<00:02:34.970> from

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
and you go in about a half an inch from

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.610 
and you go in about a half an inch from
the<00:02:35.420> center<00:02:35.989> of<00:02:36.170> our<00:02:36.769> braid<00:02:37.069> and<00:02:37.400> do<00:02:38.390> those

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
the center of our braid and do those

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:47.220 
the center of our braid and do those
equally<00:02:39.620> on<00:02:39.799> each<00:02:40.040> side<00:02:44.709> and<00:02:45.709> fill<00:02:46.040> those<00:02:46.220> up

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
equally on each side and fill those up

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.460 
equally on each side and fill those up
and<00:02:48.230> then<00:02:49.269> start<00:02:50.269> at<00:02:50.389> the<00:02:50.480> top<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:51.290> bottom

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
and then start at the top and the bottom

00:02:51.470 --> 00:03:03.839 
and then start at the top and the bottom
and<00:02:52.750> fold<00:02:53.750> those<00:02:54.019> down<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:55.810> fold<00:02:56.810> this<00:02:56.989> up

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.759 

okay<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.810> then<00:03:04.930> we're<00:03:05.079> just<00:03:05.109> going<00:03:05.409> to<00:03:05.439> start

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
okay and then we're just going to start

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:12.869 
okay and then we're just going to start
and<00:03:06.040> go<00:03:06.760> left<00:03:07.480> over<00:03:07.959> right<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:11.609> right<00:03:12.609> over

left and continue all the way to the
bottom<00:03:15.879> of<00:03:16.030> this<00:03:16.269> braid<00:03:16.569> when<00:03:17.560> we<00:03:17.709> get<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.249> the

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
bottom of this braid when we get to the

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.890 
bottom of this braid when we get to the
bottom<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:18.849> the<00:03:18.939> braid<00:03:19.239> we're<00:03:19.510> going<00:03:19.629> to<00:03:19.689> take

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
bottom of the braid we're going to take

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.390 
bottom of the braid we're going to take
our<00:03:20.079> last<00:03:20.349> two<00:03:20.650> strips<00:03:21.159> and<00:03:21.540> fold<00:03:22.540> those

now<00:03:37.990> I've<00:03:38.230> made<00:03:38.440> this<00:03:38.590> recipe<00:03:39.190> with<00:03:39.400> our<00:03:39.580> wheat

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
now I've made this recipe with our wheat

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.120 
now I've made this recipe with our wheat
rolls<00:03:40.420> too<00:03:40.780> and<00:03:41.020> it<00:03:41.110> turns<00:03:41.350> out<00:03:41.500> really<00:03:41.770> good

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
rolls too and it turns out really good

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.920 
rolls too and it turns out really good
with<00:03:42.819> the<00:03:42.970> wheat<00:03:43.120> product<00:03:43.510> if<00:03:43.630> you<00:03:43.720> want

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
with the wheat product if you want

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.110 
with the wheat product if you want
something<00:03:44.170> different<00:03:44.620> that<00:03:44.709> you<00:03:44.800> can<00:03:45.010> do<00:03:45.190> so

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
something different that you can do so

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.360 
something different that you can do so
come<00:03:46.360> to<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:46.630> end<00:03:46.810> and<00:03:47.230> take<00:03:47.650> those<00:03:47.800> last<00:03:48.130> two

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
come to the end and take those last two

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.170

strips<00:03:48.819> and<00:03:49.120> just<00:03:49.209> tuck<00:03:49.780> those<00:03:50.050> underneath

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
strips and just tuck those underneath

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.730 
strips and just tuck those underneath
we're<00:03:52.180> just<00:03:52.360> going<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.600> gently<00:03:52.870> put<00:03:53.319> this<00:03:53.500> on

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
we're just going to gently put this on

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.949 
we're just going to gently put this on
our<00:03:54.160> cookie<00:03:54.580> sheet<00:03:54.610> that<00:03:55.090> we<00:03:55.209> have<00:03:55.240> sprayed

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
our cookie sheet that we have sprayed

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:03.500 
our cookie sheet that we have sprayed
and<00:03:59.880> then<00:04:00.880> we're<00:04:01.360> going<00:04:01.510> to<00:04:01.540> brush<00:04:01.870> this<00:04:02.290> with

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
and then we're going to brush this with

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.050 
and then we're going to brush this with
one<00:04:04.510> egg<00:04:04.900> white<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:05.950> then<00:04:06.730> we're<00:04:06.880> going<00:04:07.000> to

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
one egg white and then we're going to

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.000 
one egg white and then we're going to
use<00:04:07.270> about<00:04:07.450> a<00:04:07.630> teaspoon<00:04:08.350> of<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.680> caraway

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
use about a teaspoon of the caraway

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.170 
use about a teaspoon of the caraway
seeds<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:09.550> that<00:04:09.610> kind<00:04:09.850> of<00:04:09.910> gives<00:04:10.060> you<00:04:10.150> that

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
seeds and that kind of gives you that

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.870 
seeds and that kind of gives you that
rye<00:04:10.600> bread<00:04:11.020> taste<00:04:11.440> over<00:04:12.310> the<00:04:12.430> top<00:04:12.640> of<00:04:12.790> this

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
rye bread taste over the top of this

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.750 
rye bread taste over the top of this
braid<00:04:14.100> so<00:04:15.100> brush<00:04:15.370> that<00:04:15.580> evenly<00:04:15.989> and<00:04:17.489> then<00:04:18.489> just

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.730 
braid so brush that evenly and then just
sprinkle<00:04:18.970> your<00:04:19.269> caraway<00:04:19.690> seeds<00:04:19.989> on<00:04:20.169> top<00:04:20.440> I

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
sprinkle your caraway seeds on top I

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.440 
sprinkle your caraway seeds on top I
