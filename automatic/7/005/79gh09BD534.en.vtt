00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 oh my god the aliens have brought 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:09.929
 this object on our planet 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:11.639
 all the brothers of will also die 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.650
 minecraft italy i am piece and today 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.470
 I'm here to present you a new model 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.720
 amodium to frost portable mining laser mod 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.430
 let's start immediately let's see what's there 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.920
 introduces this is a fashion this year 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.170
 very simple way is based on 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.390
 let's say more technical setting than 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.939
 minecraft can be associated as a way 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.470
 kraft industry and others recommend it 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.790
 especially for the people who 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.940
 love digging in a fast way to 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.920
 maybe concentrate more on 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.480
 for example not just adventure let's say 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.430
 so then let's see what is there 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.610
 introduces this new fashion introduces us 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.200
 a two block pml is vast what is needed 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.260
 this object meanwhile we are going to see 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.559
 crafting 6 iron ingot a goal a 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.899
 diamond and a rexton how it works 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.760
 then practically let's say 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.710
 under the ground because it is advisable 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.559
 use it at a sufficient distance 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.300
 low how this block works there 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.820
 we think of a party or any other 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.280
 what to support it and then on 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.869
 block this will be like radius of action 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.630
 meanwhile it works by clicking the button 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.509
 right we can change the direction in 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.720
 for which he shoots for example we begin to do it 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.130
 go from here ok as we can 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.170
 use his we use the red 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.960
 dawn there will be a line of about 2x1 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.450
 I think 16 knots more have increased the 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.890
 range has been increased a lot 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.200
 they are about exactly 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:42.240
 let's see why there was no more written at 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:43.890
 are from 62 to 62 to 32 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.930
 are about thirty blocks then with the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.520
 red stone splits about thirty blocks 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:54.090
 turn the position is here 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.759
 we use the iron ops I was wrong 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.700
 all wrong material 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.680
 wow or that I had the wrong material 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.860
 it was here we were wrong to 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.680
 take it 7 gold 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.879
 ok using the goal instead of the width 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.550
 varies greatly 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.410
 that is, the extent of destruction is 3 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.930
 for exactly 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:20.670
 I think three yes 3x3 of us are also 28 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:27.300
 this should be about thirty 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:30.150
 blocks from 28 to yes from 28 to minus 1 are 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.950
 yes 30 blocks so it makes a 3x3 wave of 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.940
 thirty blogs and therefore increases the range of 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.380
 destruction 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.760
 you see that we drop at the materials for 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.840
 example the airon that well found 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.330
 the agreement and therefore I recommend 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.760
 use it at very low heights for 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.830
 to be able to get a large number of 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.540
 minerals then try again with the aero 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.100
 because it seems strange to me that I saw 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.160
 than in the old functions in the old ones 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.810
 versions worked we try the heron 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.610
 sla peace however I know that the piece does not 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.600
 works at least in older versions 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:00.090
 it didn't work we stem from here 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.500
 we bring where it is under I believe it was 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.840
 brought below instead we bring it from here 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.550
 let's try to lapis you see the piece not 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.800
 therefore the lapis works as I had 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.960
 showed up now does not work the 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.030
 iron should work does not work 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.580
 will have a day and finally there is the 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:19.950
 so we said the ariston diamond 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:21.840
 makes 2x1 of thirty blocks the gold does 3x3 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.540
 of thirty blocks while the diamond 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:34.110
 now let's see how much the diamond does 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:36.890
 well 1 2 3 4 5 x 5 c of well part from 28 e 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.890
 arrives 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:46.560
 sorry I have the wrong game that fail 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:49.380
 starts at exactly 28 starts at 28 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.660
 and arrives at 97 here too about thirty 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.220
 blocks therefore only the height e varies 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.290
 the extent of the destruction however 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.930
 see the materials that I dopa 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.420
 so many look at that is got 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.250
 very much without doing anything practically 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.600
 we put it at the level of diamonds 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.880
 if we want diamonds we start a 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.100
 the tunnels can also be found there 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.870
 I do not know if it is highly recommended 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.480
 iron also because there is a need to have 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.310
 luck to find it anyway a 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.230
 there is also use in the redzone 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.910
 let's waste a lot of redstone 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.140
 the one we don't need to use 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.479
 this object in my opinion is one thing 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.070
 really but really useful then guys 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.200
 I remind you to put it like and 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.760
 subscribe to the channel and pass too 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.830
 on my channel if you are interested 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.660
 and here the tournament and we don't see each other in 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.170
 an upcoming video on minecraft italia 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.170
