00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.860
 apr 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.860
 the school 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.860
 O 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.580

 Cup that people using music 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.220
 the first one was the biggest sun but it goes 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.260
 try to transform at a time when 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:29.920
 I put it on the table afterwards is the greatest gift there 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.959
 smaller is larger 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:39.220
 after that which is greater the seventh 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:46.180
 smaller of the recon is after sun more here 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:49.900
 It's just a repetition, now we're going 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.580
 teach here the rhythm of music're aa 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.769
 music has a pop rock rhythm 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:04:00.300
 to perform then it's going to be a pop rock 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:04:00.300
 bullet vision and not so okay with 234 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.720
 I'm going to attack a little slower to 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.720
 if you train a little more at home 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.160

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.810
 now I'll show you how it 's the 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.700
 The rhythm here of our turn is in 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.170
 music basically has two faces 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.760
 when we will repeat the verse 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.640
 question when we will enter the 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.920
 japan is the first of the adverse verse you 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:40.420
 will always touch the setbacks 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.420

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.880
