00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.580
 Hello I am with Kempinski and invite you today to the hearty vegetables 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.700
 Kitchen too too Marta Chen potato meatballs 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.060
 I'm already cooked potatoes with shell a little tip from me 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.500
 if you want to flavor them while cooking, just wait a bit Norbert 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.269
 Clément 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:21.320
 and at the very bottom and the potatoes taste great right from the start 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.359
 we have to be a bit tormented 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.500
 and shows her how to express MACZIOL the fastest 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:30.500
 It's a bit difficult when you're just using the blade 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:33.810
 here the peel off 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.450
 here we see that, too 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.180
 the whole thing together 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.330
 come in addition 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.860
 something 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.860
 Garlic and onions I sweated with butter 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.160
 so easy 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.160
 roasted and chopped pumpkin seeds 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.710
 chopped parsley 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.200
 Seitz 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.830
 spice it up vigorously 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.650
 hit 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.560
 and of course 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.560
 In the US state Georgia Kaindlstorfer weight fell 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.170
 I should follow Stammbar every one of them should have at home 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.890
 not too coarse crush all the nonsense 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.470
 and if everything did not understand so well, let it rest for 30 minutes 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.920
 our side dish the watercress salad still 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.470
 a little less to say 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.500
 as well as the first white wine vinegar 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.280
 and some water 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.280
 it is important that we make such a start, namely the spices Seitz 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.090
 and hits 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.610
 were to be dissolved 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.780
 otherwise 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.890
 would be the picture 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.050
 as an example of that I stand 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.860
 the judge has no chance to read 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.230
 that's the case if we slowly add some grapeseed oil 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.230
 Starting shot to a homogeneous mass 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.840
 and want to return two teaspoons 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.629
 Bouquet no one dares to be later 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:22.259
 which is One Grasser himself 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:25.259
 Adailton maybe creates the fresh flavor 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:29.799
 In addition, Centrica Berlin and just half of the plaster 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.189
 watercress 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.779
 it's just washed 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:34.179
 just like here 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.099
 roughly ripped off the leaves 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.889
 no witchcraft 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:41.589
 as I said, he paid half or the Mixa what to handle safely 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:46.669
 or 50 grams of fighter station 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:55.619
 a little bit later 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:59.609
 the whole 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.609
 short mixed relay 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.489
 in the meantime season with some sugar again 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.829
 Rheine Lance Schüsschen Cyrus Kernöl 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.859
 to blur the whole thing again 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.849
 after 30 minutes if the mass is well grote 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.299
 Applicants should be considered a great honor that makes us this wonderfully easy 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:27.649
 the same size 

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:30.959
 nobody comes too short Kurt part 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.239
 want something again 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.879
 and then press the meatballs to have shape 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.269
 I've already prepared my little dad for me station 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.639
 Wels the whole short mail 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.899
 in shortened eggs 

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:47.119
 Dustin beautiful coat transforms 

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:50.199
 drain something and again 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:52.659
 in breadcrumbs 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.709
 wonderful 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.269
 such already Palmer prepared and gives it all now in a trap with hot 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.199
 oil 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:05.199
 and what our potato meatballs now 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.889
 Bake both sides for two to three minutes until golden brown 

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:10.949
 Golf pro in the world 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:13.269
 I drained on a kitchen crepe 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.859
 the psyche just such a record 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.989
 from our Monk to salad over it 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.249
 nice and quiet 

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:23.580
 that gives freshness 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.659
 the prepared less z 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:27.949
 directly on the salad 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.620
 not too economical 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.370
 Kompa equipped 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.490
 pumpkin seeds 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.530
 there should also be something for the vegetable muffle among them that it is hearty 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.289
 strong and for the gentlemen among them fits quite a beer 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:40.950
 Enjoy your meal
