design we strive to design a new car

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.220 
design we strive to design a new car
from<00:00:11.099> our<00:00:11.250> vision<00:00:11.670> from<00:00:12.120> our<00:00:12.330> perspective<00:00:12.990> and

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
from our vision from our perspective and

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.829 
from our vision from our perspective and
make<00:00:13.889> sure<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.490> this<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.849> exactly<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.660> way

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
make sure that this is exactly the way

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.769 
make sure that this is exactly the way
we<00:00:16.020> see<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> BMW<00:00:16.770> for<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.010> future<00:00:17.390> we<00:00:18.390> want<00:00:18.570> to

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
we see a BMW for the future we want to

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.170 
we see a BMW for the future we want to
make<00:00:18.930> sure<00:00:19.100> that<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.340> vision<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:21.090> the

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
make sure that the vision that the

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.420 
make sure that the vision that the
customer<00:00:21.689> at<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.840> end<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.109> day<00:00:22.260> sees<00:00:22.590> is

customer at the end of the day sees is

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.060 
customer at the end of the day sees is
exactly<00:00:24.029> what<00:00:24.210> we<00:00:24.359> intended<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.050> be<00:00:25.199> that's

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
exactly what we intended it to be that's

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.640 
exactly what we intended it to be that's
why<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.730> process<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.330> creating<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.990> car<00:00:28.289> design

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
why the process of creating a car design

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.950 
why the process of creating a car design
is<00:00:28.859> highly<00:00:29.609> personal<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.480> very<00:00:31.199> emotional<00:00:32.960> so

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
is highly personal and very emotional so

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.229 
is highly personal and very emotional so
doing<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.350> concept<00:00:34.739> car<00:00:34.980> for<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.520> design<00:00:35.910> team<00:00:35.940> is

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
doing a concept car for a design team is

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.319 
doing a concept car for a design team is
always<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> big<00:00:37.079> challenge<00:00:37.110> also<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.800> big

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
always a big challenge also a big

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.360 
always a big challenge also a big
motivation<00:00:39.329> we<00:00:39.930> have<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.410> short<00:00:40.770> time<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.340> make

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
motivation we have a short time to make

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.340 
motivation we have a short time to make
the<00:00:41.670> car<00:00:41.910> but<00:00:42.180> we<00:00:42.300> know<00:00:42.480> we<00:00:42.750> have<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.020> make<00:00:43.170> it

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
the car but we know we have to make it

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.410 
the car but we know we have to make it
in<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.559> very<00:00:43.739> perfect<00:00:44.250> way<00:00:44.399> we<00:00:45.000> have<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.149> small

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
in a very perfect way we have a small

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.029 
in a very perfect way we have a small
team<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:45.930> have<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> lot<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.289> coordination

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
team we have a lot of coordination

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.580 
team we have a lot of coordination
within<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.520> people<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.379> getting<00:00:49.379> together

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
within the people and getting together

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.830 
within the people and getting together
makes<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.370> big<00:00:50.640> difference<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.270> such<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> short

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
makes a big difference in such a short

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.000 
makes a big difference in such a short
time<00:00:51.960> process<00:00:56.420> when<00:00:57.420> we<00:00:57.570> design<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> car<00:00:58.289> we

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
time process when we design a car we

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.700 
time process when we design a car we
start<00:00:59.340> by<00:00:59.550> drawing<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.420> car<00:01:00.719> we<00:01:01.260> want<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.559> make

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
start by drawing the car we want to make

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.160 
start by drawing the car we want to make
sure<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.640> first<00:01:02.910> vision<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.780> we<00:01:03.960> have

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
sure that the first vision that we have

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.399 
sure that the first vision that we have
of<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.409> car<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.979> translated<00:01:05.760> onto<00:01:06.119> paper<00:01:06.409> with

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
of the car is translated onto paper with

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.609 
of the car is translated onto paper with
basically<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.159> movement<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.479> pencil<00:01:09.930> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
basically the movement of the pencil the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.710 
basically the movement of the pencil the
movement<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.490> hand<00:01:11.729> describes<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.479> line

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
movement of the hand describes the line

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.620 
movement of the hand describes the line
and<00:01:12.990> we<00:01:13.560> make<00:01:13.740> sure<00:01:13.770> then<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.549> exactly<00:01:15.450> what

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
and we make sure then that exactly what

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.630 
and we make sure then that exactly what
we<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:15.930> as<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> vision<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.619> translated<00:01:17.400> into

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
we have as a vision is translated into

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.480 
we have as a vision is translated into
two<00:01:17.939> dimensions<00:01:18.409> these<00:01:19.409> two<00:01:19.680> dimensions<00:01:20.159> are

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
two dimensions these two dimensions are

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.390 
two dimensions these two dimensions are
drawings<00:01:21.210> when<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:21.990> design<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> car<00:01:22.680> we<00:01:22.979> focus

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
drawings when we design a car we focus

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.320 
drawings when we design a car we focus
on<00:01:23.640> very<00:01:24.299> high<00:01:24.780> quality<00:01:24.950> aesthetics<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:26.729> make

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
on very high quality aesthetics we make

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.539 
on very high quality aesthetics we make
sure<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> way<00:01:28.110> we<00:01:28.259> draw<00:01:28.500> cars<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.220> also

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549
