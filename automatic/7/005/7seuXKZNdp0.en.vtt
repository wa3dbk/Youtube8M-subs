00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
the kids talk and I learned from them

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.030 
the kids talk and I learned from them
and<00:01:18.200> seeing<00:01:19.200> where<00:01:19.409> they<00:01:19.560> are<00:01:19.619> going<00:01:19.799> with<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
and seeing where they are going with the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.649 
and seeing where they are going with the
piece<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.310> literature<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.939> think<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.509> real

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
piece of literature I think the real

that day I would go home and do
recordings<00:02:13.760> with<00:02:13.910> using<00:02:14.150> Jing<00:02:14.420> giving<00:02:15.020> them

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
recordings with using Jing giving them

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.350 
recordings with using Jing giving them
some<00:02:15.470> too<00:02:15.650> very<00:02:15.920> directed<00:02:16.400> feedback<00:02:16.760> so<00:02:17.270> what

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
some too very directed feedback so what

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.290 
some too very directed feedback so what
we<00:02:17.480> changed<00:02:17.810> this<00:02:17.960> illustration<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:18.920> book

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
we changed this illustration to the book

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.910

are<00:02:20.300> just<00:02:20.570> as<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:21.020> state<00:02:21.170> as<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.470> color<00:02:21.650> star

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
are just as the state as the color star

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.890

having a brief no real hidden meaning

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.800 
having a brief no real hidden meaning
because<00:02:24.380> we<00:02:24.620> said<00:02:24.920> that<00:02:25.820> then<00:02:26.330> it<00:02:26.420> ties<00:02:26.630> it

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
because we said that then it ties it

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.690 
because we said that then it ties it
into<00:02:26.960> the<00:02:27.050> medium<00:02:27.500> of<00:02:27.680> a<00:02:27.740> graphic<00:02:28.130> novel<00:02:28.520> which

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.070 
into the medium of a graphic novel which
is<00:02:28.730> what<00:02:28.970> you're<00:02:29.120> talking<00:02:29.240> about<00:02:29.420> here<00:02:29.930> in

is what you're talking about here in

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.380 
is what you're talking about here in
your<00:02:30.680> evidence<00:02:31.160> on<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.640> computer<00:02:32.030> screen<00:02:32.150> you

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
your evidence on the computer screen you

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.110 
your evidence on the computer screen you
can<00:02:32.540> see<00:02:32.660> your<00:02:32.780> paper<00:02:33.020> it's<00:02:33.740> kind<00:02:33.920> of<00:02:33.980> like

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
can see your paper it's kind of like

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.220 
can see your paper it's kind of like
their<00:02:35.120> witness<00:02:35.570> tree<00:02:35.780> but<00:02:35.959> you're<00:02:36.050> not

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
their witness tree but you're not

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.840 
their witness tree but you're not
reading<00:02:36.620> comments<00:02:37.160> is<00:02:37.280> one<00:02:37.430> thing<00:02:37.670> but

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
reading comments is one thing but

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.400 
reading comments is one thing but
hearing<00:02:38.240> it<00:02:38.330> from<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.600> teacher<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:38.990> like<00:02:39.230> the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
hearing it from the teacher and like the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.840 
hearing it from the teacher and like the
way<00:02:39.560> she<00:02:39.830> says<00:02:40.100> it<00:02:40.130> is<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.340> different<00:02:40.790> thing

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
way she says it is a different thing

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.790 
way she says it is a different thing
there's<00:02:41.360> only<00:02:41.480> so<00:02:41.720> much<00:02:41.840> time<00:02:41.900> that<00:02:42.530> you<00:02:42.650> can

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
there's only so much time that you can

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.170 
there's only so much time that you can
spend<00:02:42.830> with<00:02:43.100> each<00:02:43.280> bus<00:02:43.550> so<00:02:43.760> this<00:02:43.910> is<00:02:44.060> just

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
spend with each bus so this is just

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.390 
spend with each bus so this is just
another<00:02:44.450> way<00:02:44.660> to<00:02:45.350> reach<00:02:45.500> us<00:02:45.530> outside<00:02:45.890> a<00:02:46.100> class

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
another way to reach us outside a class

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.640 
another way to reach us outside a class
that<00:02:46.790> helps<00:02:47.270> us<00:02:47.420> develop<00:02:47.570> our<00:02:47.870> papers<00:02:48.290> at<00:02:48.530> the

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
that helps us develop our papers at the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.460 
that helps us develop our papers at the
end<00:02:48.830> of<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.190> six<00:02:49.400> weeks<00:02:49.489> I<00:02:49.910> mean<00:02:50.480> that<00:02:51.290> it's

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.390 
end of the six weeks I mean that it's
mind-blowing<00:02:52.130> how<00:02:52.970> different<00:02:53.630> they<00:02:53.750> are<00:02:53.780> and

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.370 
mind-blowing how different they are and
in<00:02:55.400> how<00:02:55.700> in-depth<00:02:56.390> they<00:02:56.570> list<00:02:56.810> all<00:02:57.020> right<00:02:57.140> ask

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380
