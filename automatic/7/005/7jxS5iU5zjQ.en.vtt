up in-game no sound I'm like what what's

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.550 
up in-game no sound I'm like what what's
going<00:00:23.130> on<00:00:23.250> so<00:00:23.850> this<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.510> what<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.810> did<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.109> fix<00:00:25.260> it

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
going on so this is what I did to fix it

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.269 
going on so this is what I did to fix it
I<00:00:26.160> think<00:00:26.490> it's<00:00:26.939> something<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.449> do<00:00:27.630> with

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
I think it's something to do with

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.460 
I think it's something to do with
resolution<00:00:29.279> types<00:00:29.490> on<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.699> TV<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.289> think

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
resolution types on the TV this I think

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.080 
resolution types on the TV this I think
has<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.859> different<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.520> different

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
has a different to the different

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.630 
has a different to the different
resolution<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:34.050> one<00:00:34.200> at<00:00:34.320> my<00:00:34.680> house<00:00:34.890> but

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640
