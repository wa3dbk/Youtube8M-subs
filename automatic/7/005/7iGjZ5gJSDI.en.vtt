00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.330
 hello hello very good everyone here 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.139
 we are back with the tutorials 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.900
 about scoreboard score board and blocks 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.660
 of commands and tricks to improve 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.420
 our adventure map here I bring you 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.480
 Oh, you can see it behind 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.730
 if stores stores that are used for currency 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.430
 what you have here on the right that is 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.900
 gold or any variable that you want 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.900
 Now let's explain how they work 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.199
 well here you have good this 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.629
 you have here are the other tutorials 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.640
 that I have made swords sale the 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.949
 living poster of normal swords and 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.960
 multiplayer in the multiplayer for the 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.969
 for any map and the normal 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.309
 only when he is a player now 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.210
 I will explain why it does not happen is that this 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.670
 simplifies a bit the 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.399
 the command that you have to use from 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.670
 button and let's see it like that so that it 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.379
 see well I take off this I give him and he gives me 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.940
 a sword and it takes away two fingers and another 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.850
 once you take off two more gold you can 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.370
 see it on the right so for each sword 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.630
 Meditated gold 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.270
 you have to do it so that when you have 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.350
 to see that everything now when you have 0 of 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.450
 gold 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.329
 it does not give me anything and it does not lower the gold 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.840
 very good because this works of this 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:26.000
 way he 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.600
 and the button activates the arrest that the 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.230
 native arrest this command block and 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.690
 right after but not at the same time 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.660
 this other block of commands and that 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.970
 we have in this block because it gives a 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.590
 iron sword to the player 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.439
 pe 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.380
 but checking that the variable gold 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.570
 have a minimum value of 2 because if 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.369
 has for example the value 10 not you 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.460
 you can buy swords because you do not have 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.020
 gold 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.840
 this is important it seems silly 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.700
 but it's important and this is the idea of 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.700
 the sword and the value 1 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.750
 right after a tick then it would jump 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.660
 this block of commands that what does 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:14.240
 is score board says to the player 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.800
 whose minimum value by law has to 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.750
 put through what the minimum value 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.610
 equal to 2 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.850
 Well, yes, it would activate us forever 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.920
 minimum value of gold 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:29.010
 you take away 2 the variable gold and that's 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.060
 What it does is take your money 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.280
 basically 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.959
 and this would work in much the same way 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.110
 what happens is that by being multiplayer 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.580
 you have to make sure that he will charge you 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.280
 who is closest to the block of 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.220
 commands 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.840
 and have enough now then 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.209
 you need to put exactly the same 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.660
 commands except that you have to put a 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.580
 radius of action in the command block 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.590
 it means that this would only work 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.090
 when people are three blocks 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.670
 distance from this command block 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.010
 from start 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.200
 and exactly the same in the block of 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.790
 commands behind except that instead of 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.890
 equal to three we put the opponent to five 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.790
 because it 's two blocks further back to 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.830
 I also arrive then 1234 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.300
 would come perfectly here and could 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.290
 give him this button if he had gold to 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.290
 study to put me gold 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.630
 I have 10 gold and I give if I give from 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.520
 very far surely the functions 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.730
 works effectively but if I 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.620
 I move a little bit there, it gives me the sword and 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.230
 it charges me 20 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:42.090
 and this would be basically the explanation 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.090
 of the fastest time 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.050
 word vale 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.569
 good of equal because we have a position 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.329
 the same 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.810
 the flight for a good player to another 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:05.099
 explanation other important things is 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.620
 explain in another chapter how it is done 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:10.560
 to sell objects because it's not so 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.409
 you should make a simple 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:17.310
 hopper to drop things and I would give you 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:19.440
 money according to what you release and other things 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.470
 that I can tell you there are objects that 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.450
 example can not be given 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.370
 with a gray bar command for example 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.460
 enchanted objects for example swords 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.750
 delighted they would give of the following 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.040
 way to win is over the sea ​​that does not 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.540
 I have prepared but it is fast 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.580
 well the case would be a block of 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.370
 commands in which you give this 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.220
 exactly 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.330
 you give him the sword then you take off 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.600
 the money and then that too 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.080
 you put 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.080
 would be 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.030
 p the player of manacor 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.080
 equal to 2 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.860
 and you put 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.230
 the air of en chan you want that to be 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.720
 you can see in the mini craft wiki that each 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.060
 enchantment has an idea I would look 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.860
 for example the edge 5 or it would put like this 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.050
 what would be I do not know what can be one 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.610
 maybe it's probably the one and he puts it and 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.260
 then put on the value five then 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.050
 I would love the sword that you just gave 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:26.600
 with a 5 edge that could be achieved 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:29.330
 buy enchanted swords 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:33.670
 this he told me he told me how he 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.670
 I could do another youtube called 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:43.429
 for chivas cauliflower if I'm not mistaken 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:43.429
 from sure good I will put you 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.580
 the description of your channel 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.320
 I wonder how it could be done and 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.450
 I explained that way of doing it there are other 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.890
 ways to do it with a dispenser that 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.200
 what happens is that of course they would not be 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.940
 infinite until the 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.740
 objects of the dispenser but good is 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.850
 another idea to put a dispenser to some 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.950
 height so that people can not 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:06.000
 reach it and let him loose one was 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.000
 delighted with whatever you want 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.910
 In the next chapter I will explain how 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:14.970
 It works how you can do it to sell 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:17.660
 objects that is also curious in several 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.660
 tricks and other 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.880
 until another
