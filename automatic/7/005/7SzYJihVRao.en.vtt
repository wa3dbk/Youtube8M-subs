 Shepherd good milk used to see a room of animal origin 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.070
 between the veal calves of the calves a getaway to take place that takes

 adn 1 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.270
 this increases especially by the ideal form 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.740
 you can do community automatic bowling brother alan we prefer 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.690
 cut which was manual 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.520

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.780
 insured 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.160
 approximately 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.220
 and then you have to encourage pasta 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.570
 the abandonment 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.060
 in the hand of pasta 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.140
 the raval morally percent that means 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.990
 g is removed 20% I usually 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.570
 that is replaced 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.360
 then the heating continues to stir 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.820
 assis in that way softens much more disadvantaged 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.820
 shovel in the hand you have to heat the cheese 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.900
 have been 30 am up to 30 and up to 39 degrees 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.830
 it heats the pasta is stirred 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.200
 and once it has enough power on its side it is removed to the ground and 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.250
 are placed 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.580

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.050
 approximately 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.350
 then 9 is removed on 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.860
 a cdt brine 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.229
 already in the litter 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.710
 maturation 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.280
 the dryer here 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.310
 a centimeter that are the ones that has taken from the waters that has been denied 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.790
 Seed up the weight until you have enough in case you save a 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.360
 I greet about 45 days 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.039
 when you have the time 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.339
 ana the cheeses understood 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:16.279
 good this one that is spent cured as soon as there was ripening time about 45 150 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:16.909
 days 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:17.920
 and good 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.420
 we have taken out of camera 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.419
 to deliver to the no 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:24.249
 and the process ends 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:27.809
 if the wine arrives in order of about 24 hours in wine 

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:31.659
 tomorrow clarify us understand that colon more or less 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:35.340
 serene 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.639
 tomorrow last 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:38.029
 and the cidh is packaged 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:41.029
 and is ready to follow 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:46.790
 but the play 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.729
 cases like the one of the wine of the hand of the weight 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:52.379
 i am well to the weight 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.299
 essence and wine 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.489
 it is already but I would accept color that surely yes 

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:01.060
 I take it out 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.060
 I put another one that supports white 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.869
 for this event 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:10.869
 loved to take out in that you get to some color kiss 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.789
 this dependence on the 1994 natural compressed 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.089
 in a 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:21.059
 which ends German eliminated untouchable pasta 

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:23.329
 for this case 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.329
 and I'm going to remove it, I'm going to put another one that is 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:31.509
 that have less for about 24 hours 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:35.179
 and after crashing it would end 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.769
 and labels in san mateo and bet to go to the market 

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:43.199
 We have seen the whole process of making Murcian cheese to wine 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:45.270
 and the murcia cheese cured 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.530
 let's find out what are the main characteristics of the 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.129
 cheeses that we have at this time prepared 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:53.149
 on the one hand 

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:55.669
 we have the murcia cheese to the wine 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:59.369
 that easily recognizable by its bark that has violet color 

00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:01.919
 characteristic of red wine 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.199
 and as soon as its paste we can say that it is a paste of color ivory 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.859
 it is a closed pass that is practically without eyes 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.779
 i is a paste that to the touch gives us the Latin feeling greasy sensation 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:17.229
 and with a certain degree of the pools 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.400
 as for the smell is a cheese 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.420
 that has a smell a pleasant mild aroma slightly acid 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.939
 and what blindly frece notes above all of butter and succeeded in milk 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:31.259
 of goat 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:36.020
 as soon as its texture has a very characteristic texture why it is 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.320
 of a cheese or very creamy very fundamental that practically we 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:43.059
 melts in your mouth when you eat it 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:47.620
 and the flavors and aromas that it brings in the mouth despite being soft 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.659
 they do not stop being per cent certainly persistent and north garden I remember 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:57.430
 what is the fresh butter miguel c of goat 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.710
 in this case of being a pure decade prisoner 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.050
 the murcia cheese cured 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.740
 It's a cheese day d 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.219
 two three months of healing 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:10.339
 and change in the south 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:12.839
 sensory aspects for example the color 

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:16.139
 we can appreciate that it is a more yellowish color a color that we define as 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:17.979
 a stereo yellow color 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.309
 it is a case that has a paste with eyes as we can appreciate 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:23.559
 and smell 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:28.179
 it is a case since it carries a series of characteristic notes of the cases 

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:29.080
 cured 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.080
 may appear alomar notes of nuts 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:36.580
 this one in particular seems to give 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.309
 a souvenir like almond hazelnuts 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:43.129
 the smell of goat milk as it goes down in intensity with respect to the previous 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:46.800
 Well, these are the main characteristics 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.379
 of these cases 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.379
 of goat's milk made in the region of Murcia 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.990
 and recognized 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.449
 with the endorsement of the denomination of origin of the people
