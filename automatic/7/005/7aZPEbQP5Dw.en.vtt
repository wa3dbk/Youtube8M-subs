00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.800
- I HAVE A QUESTION
FOR EVERYONE HERE.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.566
ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME
ON TWITTER?

00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.300
audience: YES.
- OKAY.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.900
I DIDN'T HEAR AS MANY YESES
AS I'D LIKE.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.166
BUT ANYWAY, THANKS TO THOSE
PEOPLE WHO ARE FOLLOWING ME--

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:14.300
IMAGINE IF THE REST
OF YOU WERE.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.466
NOW MY TWITTER ACCOUNT
HAS PASSED

00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:20.266
THE TWITTER ACCOUNT.

00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.566
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO EXPLAIN THAT,

00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.000
BUT I HAVE MORE FOLLOWERS
ON TWITTER

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.300
THAN TWITTER ITSELF.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.433
AND I DON'T KNOW--

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:26.866
I THINK IT MEANS
I OWN TWITTER.

00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:30.000
[cheers and applause]

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.866
THANK--THANK YOU ALL
FOR FOLLOWING ME,

00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.600

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.933

AT THE DOG PARK

00:01:33.033 --> 00:01:34.433
"TELL HIS DOG, 'NO!'

00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:36.766
AND THEN MORE QUIETLY,
