00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.919
 mathias lauda 23 years and formula 3000 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.320
 pilot he tests for engine vision 5 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:29.349
 sports car on the saxon ring porsche 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.129
 gt3 lamborghini gallardo lotus exige 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:36.239
 ferrari 575 m maranello and today the 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.239
 aston martin vanquish 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.500
 the wish that james bond auto 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.199
 the sound should be burned to cd 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.159
 The banker has twelve heads and almost 6 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.710
 liter displacement 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.320
 the 460 ps booked that two tons 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.320
 ship in 5 seconds at 100 speed 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.490
 hellinger is real business though 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.940
 that's really fun in the border area 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.940
 to talk 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.460
 The fish mouth is just awesome 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.049
 You have to pay 236 1460 euro for this 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.019
 transfer power package 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:27.870
 but there is top speed 306 km h but 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:31.970
 no esp the cockpit is actually quite 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.319
 okay the steering wheel in the picture too thick 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.420
 reverse is a celeb but has to be the 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.820
 Knock here and push until first 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.320
 But the walk in it is positive 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.640
 a dare of course is the sand in 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.640
 start the hand 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.590
 what we still encourage a dare is 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.099
 the leatherworking could be better 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.750
 and what I understand is that one at the aston 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.090
 martin installs the buttons of one 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:25.000
 normal before, for example, without too 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:27.190
 Amazon here so it's the 5,142 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.890
 newtonmeter lifts the first on the 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.069
 but only relatively late at 5,000 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.069
 tour 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.790
 the dare is not 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.069
 bad you can switch as one of 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.700
 1 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.700
 the circuit 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.690
 what I like when downshifting is 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.440
 that he's going with intergas 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.310
 switched 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.150
 do that 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.150
 clean us off 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.700
 stay out 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.150
 schmidt one wants a printer something 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.840
 do better 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.840
 in my view 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:22.319
 the courses are in my opinion 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:24.810
 education too long but you can in 

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:28.259
 Raise a cash up to 7000 revolutions 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.300
 and the suction motor of this in a v12 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:33.050
 Distance should be at least once 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.050
 have experienced 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.190
 The border area in this car starts 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:47.270
 late but then you need for lack of esp 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.270
 watch reflexes 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.090
 I want to say next picture 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.810
 too soft and you fall you do not have that 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:01.930
 right feeling he's in a curve because 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:08.330
 he was passionate about steering 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:10.550
 the more and more to a normal dare the 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.349
 Steering could give more feedback 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.870
 above all, English conveys one thing 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:16.870
 I am a very heavy car 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:29.530
 a steering something 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:29.530
 direct driving is hard to drive 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.160
 Driving is because I thought so 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.500
 his sports car but he is mine 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.890
 opinion too much too lazy and too soft 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.170
 for the pension the english is a gran 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:57.480
 turismo with which you are very comfortable and 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.480
 very powerful on a big tour can go 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.840
 wet track 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:15.820
 Merkel keep dare very much then weighs 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:22.080
 when braking and in turns recognized that 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:22.080
 all the tanker's cars 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.350
 the conclusion of a vague announce the 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.210
 Dare is so nice but for the 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.130
 race track is not very well suited 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.610
 just too hard because a lot of it 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.010
 sluggish 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.230
 the engine does not pull out from below 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.150
 not really good the most common picture 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:47.260
 too long he is of course beautiful dare 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:50.180
 on the track is not really 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.639
 well you must not forget that 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.639
 mathias lauda super direct and agile 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:57.080
 We are used to the formula 3000 cars 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:59.960
 that the english real understatement 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:02.200
 Apart from maybe the ford 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.200
 mouth
