them is at the fact they don't have any
question<00:00:37.610> that's<00:00:38.610> slightly<00:00:38.879> different<00:00:39.329> to

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
question that's slightly different to

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.950 
question that's slightly different to
defense<00:00:39.840> before<00:00:40.079> um<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:41.760> fence<00:00:42.420> gate<00:00:42.660> itself

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
defense before um the fence gate itself

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.650 
defense before um the fence gate itself
which<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.350> right<00:00:43.530> here<00:00:43.910> had<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> different<00:00:45.539> and

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
which is right here had a different and

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.299 
which is right here had a different and
strange<00:00:45.780> collision<00:00:46.590> mass<00:00:46.770> where<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.219> would

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
strange collision mass where you would

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.610 
strange collision mass where you would
actually<00:00:47.370> walk<00:00:47.879> into<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.390> stop<00:00:48.750> now<00:00:49.559> you

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
actually walk into it and stop now you

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.959 
actually walk into it and stop now you
can<00:00:49.920> walk<00:00:50.100> along<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.370> fence<00:00:50.579> quite<00:00:50.820> easily

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
can walk along the fence quite easily

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.950 
can walk along the fence quite easily
and<00:00:51.590> without<00:00:52.590> stopping<00:00:52.920> at<00:00:53.010> all<00:00:53.160> as<00:00:54.149> well<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
and without stopping at all as well the

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.139 
and without stopping at all as well the
transcripts<00:00:55.500> themselves<00:00:55.949> are<00:00:56.129> now<00:00:56.460> held<00:00:57.030> by

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
transcripts themselves are now held by

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.150 
transcripts themselves are now held by
redstone<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.199> can<00:00:58.469> now<00:00:58.620> turn<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.920> off<00:00:59.129> and

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
redstone so you can now turn it off and

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.910 
redstone so you can now turn it off and
on<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.670> some<00:01:00.570> crate<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.109> create<00:01:01.500> an

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
on and some crate and create an

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.979 
on and some crate and create an
automatic<00:01:02.370> gate<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:03.300> I've<00:01:03.539> got<00:01:03.690> one<00:01:03.780> over<00:01:03.899> here

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
automatic gate so I've got one over here

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.980 
automatic gate so I've got one over here
that's<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.619> double<00:01:05.270> door<00:01:06.270> set<00:01:06.600> up<00:01:06.720> like<00:01:06.840> this

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
that's a double door set up like this

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.359 
that's a double door set up like this
and<00:01:07.400> now<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.460> can<00:01:08.790> create<00:01:09.119> an<00:01:09.330> easy<00:01:10.369> redstone

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
and now you can create an easy redstone

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.810 
and now you can create an easy redstone
set<00:01:11.820> up<00:01:11.939> by<00:01:12.150> using<00:01:12.479> some<00:01:12.750> simple<00:01:12.960> redstone

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
set up by using some simple redstone

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.249 
set up by using some simple redstone
however<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.060> do<00:01:15.210> need<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.450> power<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.960> block

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
however you do need to power the block

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.950 
however you do need to power the block
either<00:01:16.560> directly<00:01:17.220> below<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.640> all<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.750> block

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
either directly below it all the block

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.859 
either directly below it all the block
behind<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.590> touching<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.640> get<00:01:20.790> itself<00:01:21.119> so

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
behind it touching to get itself so

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.649 
behind it touching to get itself so
you'll<00:01:22.080> do<00:01:22.229> will<00:01:22.799> need<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.250> power<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:24.450> like

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
you'll do will need to power it like

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.160 
you'll do will need to power it like
that<00:01:24.869> just<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.290> get<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.619> work<00:01:26.630> up<00:01:27.630> next<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.140> have

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
that just to get to work up next we have

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.679 
that just to get to work up next we have
some<00:01:28.560> farming<00:01:28.950> updates<00:01:29.360> this<00:01:30.360> was<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
some farming updates this was in the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.690 
some farming updates this was in the
snapshot<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.439> some<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.829> already<00:01:32.040> may<00:01:32.400> know

tilled and whatnot as well as that we

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.140 
tilled and whatnot as well as that we
have<00:02:09.000> some<00:02:09.920> updates<00:02:10.920> with<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.160> farmlands<00:02:11.879> you

know now you can now

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.540 
know now you can now
on<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:14.090> file<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.330> without<00:02:15.480> actually

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
on the file and without actually

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.640 
on the file and without actually
disturbing<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:17.820> however<00:02:18.690> still<00:02:19.140> jump<00:02:19.410> on<00:02:19.530> it

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
disturbing it however still jump on it

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.780 
disturbing it however still jump on it
it<00:02:19.860> still<00:02:20.840> breaks<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.650> disturbs<00:02:23.610> and

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
it still breaks the and disturbs and

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.920 
it still breaks the and disturbs and
picks<00:02:23.940> up<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.150> stuff<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:24.510> it's<00:02:24.630> still<00:02:24.780> so

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
picks up the stuff so it's still so

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.960 
picks up the stuff so it's still so
normal<00:02:25.200> whereas<00:02:26.130> before<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.610> kind<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:26.820> had<00:02:26.940> to

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
normal whereas before you kind of had to

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.180 
normal whereas before you kind of had to
like<00:02:27.210> shift<00:02:27.480> just<00:02:28.050> walk<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.530> what<00:02:28.680> not<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.890> get

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
like shift just walk and what not to get

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.390 
like shift just walk and what not to get
there<00:02:29.430> up<00:02:30.360> next<00:02:30.870> we<00:02:31.350> have<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.530> Magna<00:02:32.130> cubes

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
there up next we have the Magna cubes

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.760 
there up next we have the Magna cubes
the<00:02:32.670> magnum<00:02:33.000> cubes<00:02:33.270> now<00:02:33.360> drop<00:02:33.959> funny<00:02:34.470> enough

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
the magnum cubes now drop funny enough

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.550 
the magnum cubes now drop funny enough
magma<00:02:35.160> cream<00:02:35.780> Simona<00:02:36.780> cream<00:02:36.990> before<00:02:37.170> was

magma cream Simona cream before was

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.150 
magma cream Simona cream before was
achievable<00:02:37.920> by<00:02:38.310> using<00:02:38.520> blaze<00:02:38.940> powder<00:02:39.209> and

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
achievable by using blaze powder and

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.410 
achievable by using blaze powder and
some<00:02:41.160> slime<00:02:41.810> balls<00:02:42.980> so<00:02:43.980> now<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.880> can<00:02:45.150> on

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
some slime balls so now that you can on

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.110 
some slime balls so now that you can on
a<00:02:45.480> rare<00:02:45.810> occasion<00:02:45.870> if<00:02:46.410> you<00:02:46.500> can<00:02:46.650> get<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:46.890> right

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
a rare occasion if you can get it right

a rare occasion if you can get it right
actually<00:02:48.120> gather<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.170> magma<00:02:49.500> cream<00:02:49.709> if<00:02:50.550> we

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
actually gather the magma cream if we

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.610 
actually gather the magma cream if we
can<00:02:51.630> do<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:51.989> mixes<00:02:52.800> that's<00:02:52.980> what<00:02:53.100> yet<00:02:54.620> anyway

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
can do it mixes that's what yet anyway

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.740 
can do it mixes that's what yet anyway
they<00:02:55.739> did<00:02:55.890> drop<00:02:56.070> it<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:56.610> that's<00:02:56.850> one<00:02:57.030> thing<00:02:57.180> so

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
they did drop it so that's one thing so

themselves<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:32.810> new<00:03:33.810> addition<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.680> update

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
themselves a new addition to the update

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.740 
themselves a new addition to the update
which<00:03:35.160> is<00:03:35.310> quite<00:03:35.459> interesting<00:03:35.790> also<00:03:36.120> is<00:03:36.299> the

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
which is quite interesting also is the

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.479 
which is quite interesting also is the
fact<00:03:36.780> that<00:03:37.049> we<00:03:37.260> can<00:03:37.440> now<00:03:37.620> actually<00:03:37.890> obtain

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
fact that we can now actually obtain

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.940 
fact that we can now actually obtain
apples<00:03:38.970> without<00:03:39.810> going<00:03:39.959> through<00:03:40.140> dungeons<00:03:40.410> so

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
apples without going through dungeons so

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.280 
apples without going through dungeons so
apples<00:03:41.489> dropped<00:03:41.730> from<00:03:41.970> leaves<00:03:42.269> or<00:03:42.690> trees<00:03:43.019> a

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
apples dropped from leaves or trees a

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.610 
apples dropped from leaves or trees a
rate<00:03:44.100> of<00:03:44.299> 0.5<00:03:45.299> percent<00:03:45.750> so<00:03:45.900> it's<00:03:46.019> about<00:03:46.110> one<00:03:46.410> in

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
rate of 0.5 percent so it's about one in

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.900 
rate of 0.5 percent so it's about one in
200<00:03:47.420> leaves<00:03:48.420> broken<00:03:48.930> chance<00:03:49.530> I've<00:03:50.310> been<00:03:50.700> one

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
200 leaves broken chance I've been one

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.130 
200 leaves broken chance I've been one
