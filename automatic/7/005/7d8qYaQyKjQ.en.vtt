00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:13.259
 hello cuckoo fans we find you 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.929
 live from cholet and we propose you 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.090
 a new idea that of presenting a 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.830
 video products a week and that 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.260
 start today with our friend 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.689
 jean-charles way fire potato is gone 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.369
 I think it's important to send 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.689
 products that we know and 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.849
 reliable products when doing the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.850
 mail order and then we 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.850
 again become talking to our customers so we 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.469
 will present you very regularly 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.260
 than what we sell once a 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.260
 week as it said it's going 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.210
 start with this box so it's a 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.980
 strong brand box is a 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.890
 brand and not too well known in France 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.640
 1 This is a brand of Groell Group One 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.100
 fishing tackle dispenser 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.809
 Spanish with an office in France 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.359
 I'm doing a little bit of 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:05.760
 consulting for them to develop the 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:08.420
 range map and it was not good on 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.600
 knows since celine to fish with 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.030
 all season 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.600
 2013 they were distributed under a 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:20.350
 other brand but it's it has exactly 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.740
 the technical characteristics of a 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.780
 traitor is a group of readers so 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.930
 a stop button that's handy 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.430
 is it fast to forget about 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.500
 turn it off and go to its next 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.930
 session and both of them realizes that 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.930
 there is public so that's not me it's 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.610
 important 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.619
 well like all the good detector you 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.789
 have the three levels of settings 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:49.750
 main volume tone 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:53.039
 sensitivity we're going to count it would be a 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.039
 boyfriend in the store making cuckoo 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:10.929
 we will count the tones 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:13.540
 7 8 9 10 tone volume levels 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.540
 a hamlet of silence finally it's good 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.450
 that we came across sector and there is no 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:25.690
 more than the central receiving a 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:28.450
 hole of 3 4 5 6 7 7 volume levels 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.829
 nor what sensitivity 1 as I 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.540
 explained each time it's 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.980
 important when you fish in plan 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.430
 of water that has a lot of water will exist where 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.100
 good fishing in the river that for the 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.170
 current it avoids unwanted beeps 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:46.590
 wanted to adjust according to 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:52.390
 weather conditions so the sensitivity a 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:57.690
 returned to put the loud volume 1 2 3 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:06.910
 4 5 6 at its six levels of un 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:09.609
 sensitivity one two three heads 5 6 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.290
 sensitivity levels so the most 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:16.780
 sensitive 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:19.180
 a differentiation beyond the sound into 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.290
 function of the type of key 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.109
 it's a flea here it's more of a 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.599
 departure francs here you have also a 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.790
 night watch 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:34.950
 that's great on the central one 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:38.590
 tone volume and then a vibrate mode 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.109
 what to say more than you talk about the sav 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.790
 you have a worry you will return to us 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:46.239
 the detector ouzou returns right away 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:51.430
 What there know is it's own 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:54.220
 it's fast so here we go 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.079
 develop a growing range 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.090
 at home at vortex with 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.319
 quality rate products i'll get you 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.379
 in talking about it there are frames that are 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.000
 really awesome we will test them at 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:07.169
 waterside there is also a range 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.780
 of accessories so a very good brand 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:12.790
 we are quite happy with 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.060
 distribute because quality report 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.269
 price 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.340
 you will see them on the site is enough 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.859
 interesting 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.720
 that's it for this vortex box is what 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.159
 I forgot something these lines there 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.210
 I think you were perfect 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:33.030
 jean-charles does not add red 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.030
 and the next video has very quickly 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.900
 perfect perfect céline dion yes in 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.950
 charge her forgot something all to 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.510
 the time I 'm not going to throw the stone 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.790
 since I will admit that I did not 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.750
 thought no more and we forgot about 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.639
 essential thing 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.490
 I see it playing there is you see 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:53.760
 exactly the famous crash test like that 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:58.310
 when they art movies and ben we go 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.310
 take a detector hop hooray the libé 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:07.770
 there is the central who is there go 1 2 3 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.550
 aulas too good it's absolutely not 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:14.640
 made for 1 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:19.919
 in addition he is lit stack is what he 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:21.930
 works at pekin michel good if ever 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.450
 it happens to you that they fall there we 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.060
 test is to know if they have a good 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.300
 level of tightness and which is resistant to 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.290
 rain 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.000
 they are not made to go under water 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:36.479
 if it happens to you at all a 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.800
 then you take off the pile tact 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:42.180
 at home to peace I believe of course 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:48.140
 you take off the pile you shake a little 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:50.750
 stack after you turn off you put back 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:54.740
 batteries in the right direction 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:06:01.410
 it's better tac 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:03.150
 fed gave and here it works at the 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.550
 perfection the small plant 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.130
 it shows well here it is a 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.630
 great product where I 'm not going their 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.500
 to say we fished with the season 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.340
 former 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.900
 we were really satisfied 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.350
 and here now that's done 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.350
 soon
