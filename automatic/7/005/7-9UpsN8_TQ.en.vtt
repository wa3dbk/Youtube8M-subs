00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
 hi loves as you can see today 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.200
 I bring the video that is in my portfolio 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.480
 I think I've never made this video 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.880
 I'm very sure because in Chile the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.670
 true that as I walked everywhere 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.770
 he did not use wallet then now that 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.230
 I am in the United States and I am alone 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.770
 and I have to go with various things to all 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.000
 parts 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.430
 I have a larger portfolio dating with 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.769
 more interesting things in and this 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.590
 wallet is super super old takes years 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.410
 with me and I 'm not sure about the brand 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.989
 because I do not see any kind of label 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.840
 that says the good mark this is my 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.120
 portfolio I love the color because it is 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.180
 as it is a brown but it is not opaque is 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.220
 brown as brick fascinates me 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.130
 and it's super super big I fit 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.710
 a lot of things so the first thing that 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.460
 I have in my portfolio is my key hanged 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.750
 here in the hole that he has because 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.460
 it's much easier than I 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.100
 find and I do not have to go messing 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.470
 my hand looking in the background for the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.390
 keys because it always took half an hour 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.300
 doing is the first thing I have in my 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.090
 wallet is my makeup bag that 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.570
 has not changed about a year ago 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.080
 and I know I have in my makeup bag 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.520
 on my other channel this obviously already 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.369
 has changed is not the same but this 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.890
 bag I love because I have the space 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.830
 here for my makeup and down I have 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.690
 space to put my brushes I use 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.520
 daily here are makeups that 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.560
 daily use so much easier to 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.580
 that I can grab or touch it 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.170
 during the day 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.509
 another thing that I have is obviously my 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.850
 wallet this good letter to my wallet 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.310
 this wallet is from aldo and I loved it 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.009
 the color seems to me to be super 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.920
 Sophisticated and beautiful here it broke 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.390
 what I had but still works here 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.229
 obviously I keep everything 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:59.550
 my cards I have a picture of my parents 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:03.090
 and I have memories here and my money 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.909
 and my coins as I live outside the 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.280
 country I have to walk with my passport and 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.259
 other documents and I keep them in this 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.020
 little book that is here and also here I 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.940
 like to keep my lenses and inside of me 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.960
 lens case that is super cute and 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.740
 dwelling 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.830
 I like to keep my normal lenses and 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.990
 My myth of contact lenses because 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.150
 sometimes during the day the contacts me 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.070
 they bother then if I take them away I want 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.260
 have my glasses there to be able to get 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.880
 I have my sunglasses that are 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.130
 these are tommy hilfiger that look 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.650
 well the truth I think they are glasses 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.780
 man but I love how I 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:48.100
 they remain and they are black so they combine with 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:51.910
 everything I have a pair of headphones two tangled 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.040
 I have two little butts and like five of these 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.110
 hooks I have my lip cream 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.140
 favorite for the moments that is this 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.500
 Carmen 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.709
 I love it and I also have a shine 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.660
 of lips and finally I have this 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.930
 my cell phone case because always 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.150
 I'm changing cases 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.799
 and if that's all there is in me 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.959
 portfolio obviously that there is also 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.640
 I keep my cell phone and my charger every 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.920
 I go out because as you know 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.980
 the iphone are not very good with the 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.409
 battery but if that's all I have 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.810
 I hope you liked the question 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:29.000
 of the day is that they have in their portfolio that 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.859
 it's rare they can also make me 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.079
 any question or doubt in the 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.540
 comments do not forget to subscribe 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.819

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.909
 They want to see more and follow me 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.200
 instagram that is barbie land ya to and 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:43.849
 I also wanted to ask you 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.099
 It seems to them that I should have a 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:49.129
 twitter because I'm not very good at using it 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:53.680
 but I think I should have one I do not know 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.680
 say see you in the next video chau
