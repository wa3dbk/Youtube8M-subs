automating<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.290> machine<00:01:16.650> let's<00:01:17.130> just<00:01:17.280> go

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
automating this machine let's just go

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.100 
automating this machine let's just go
over<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> quick<00:01:17.850> setup<00:01:18.090> right<00:01:18.330> here<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:19.049> I

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
over the quick setup right here so I

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.899 
over the quick setup right here so I
have<00:01:19.320> two<00:01:19.470> item<00:01:19.740> ducks<00:01:19.950> on<00:01:20.130> both<00:01:20.280> sides<00:01:20.610> and

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
have two item ducks on both sides and

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.910 
have two item ducks on both sides and
this<00:01:21.810> side<00:01:22.020> we're<00:01:22.200> going<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.350> wrench<00:01:22.590> when<00:01:22.830> we

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
this side we're going to wrench when we

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.590 
this side we're going to wrench when we
want<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.310> bring<00:01:23.640> some<00:01:23.850> cyanide<00:01:24.240> into<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
want to bring some cyanide into the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.800 
want to bring some cyanide into the
system<00:01:24.990> here<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:26.040> our<00:01:26.159> energy<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.810> back

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
system here we have our energy and back

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.330 
system here we have our energy and back
here<00:01:28.049> we<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.290> an<00:01:28.380> aqueous<00:01:28.650> accumulator

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
here we have an aqueous accumulator

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.240 
here we have an aqueous accumulator
pumping<00:01:29.759> water<00:01:29.939> into<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.479> reprocess<00:01:31.110> er<00:01:31.259> so

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
pumping water into the reprocess er so

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.429 
pumping water into the reprocess er so
if<00:01:32.490> we<00:01:32.610> go<00:01:32.729> ahead<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.030> flip<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.630> we're<00:01:34.320> going

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
if we go ahead and flip that we're going

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.920 
if we go ahead and flip that we're going
to<00:01:34.530> start<00:01:34.799> getting<00:01:35.070> cyanide<00:01:35.939> into<00:01:36.450> here<00:01:36.750> and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
to start getting cyanide into here and

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.170 
to start getting cyanide into here and
if<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.890> remember<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.280> said<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.759> takes<00:01:38.939> two

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
if you remember I said it takes two

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.510 
if you remember I said it takes two
syenite<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.750> make<00:01:39.900> one<00:01:40.049> plutonium<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:41.220> always

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
syenite to make one plutonium so always

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.800 
syenite to make one plutonium so always
make<00:01:41.670> sure<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.030> you're<00:01:42.150> putting<00:01:42.299> an<00:01:42.479> autumn

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
make sure that you're putting an autumn

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.069 
make sure that you're putting an autumn
