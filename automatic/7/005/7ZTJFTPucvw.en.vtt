hello everybody and welcome back to
another<00:00:02.700> episode<00:00:02.939> of<00:00:03.240> Minecraft

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
another episode of Minecraft

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.140 
another episode of Minecraft
myth-busting<00:00:04.529> this<00:00:05.040> episode<00:00:05.580> we<00:00:05.819> are<00:00:05.850> going

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
myth-busting this episode we are going

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.610 
myth-busting this episode we are going
to<00:00:06.330> look<00:00:06.509> into<00:00:06.720> something<00:00:06.990> which<00:00:07.379> isn't

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
to look into something which isn't

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.650 
to look into something which isn't
really<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:08.010> myth<00:00:08.400> but<00:00:08.610> was<00:00:08.790> suggested<00:00:09.389> in<00:00:09.510> the

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
really a myth but was suggested in the

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.810 
really a myth but was suggested in the
comments<00:00:10.050> on<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.320> last<00:00:10.349> video<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.610> think

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
comments on the last video and I think

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.400 
comments on the last video and I think
it<00:00:11.880> is<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.000> very<00:00:12.179> useful<00:00:12.389> thing<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.809> know<00:00:12.960> and

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
it is a very useful thing to know and

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.379 
it is a very useful thing to know and
that<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.590> what<00:00:14.070> blocks<00:00:14.370> can<00:00:14.639> we<00:00:14.759> place<00:00:15.000> above<00:00:15.330> a

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
that is what blocks can we place above a

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.840 
that is what blocks can we place above a
beacon<00:00:15.690> without<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.410> beam<00:00:16.619> breaking<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.730> is

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
beacon without the beam breaking that is

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.189 
beacon without the beam breaking that is
fairly<00:00:18.090> well<00:00:18.300> known<00:00:18.359> that<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:18.869> can<00:00:19.020> place

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
fairly well known that you can place

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.260 
fairly well known that you can place
glass<00:00:19.529> above<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.949> beacon<00:00:20.220> but<00:00:20.820> there<00:00:21.000> are<00:00:21.119> other

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
glass above a beacon but there are other

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.390 
glass above a beacon but there are other
blocks<00:00:21.570> as<00:00:21.750> well<00:00:21.779> for<00:00:22.230> example<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.800> stone<00:00:23.100> fence

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
blocks as well for example a stone fence

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.580 
blocks as well for example a stone fence
or<00:00:23.850> like<00:00:24.090> we<00:00:24.269> discovered<00:00:24.840> on<00:00:24.990> hermit<00:00:25.350> craft

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
or like we discovered on hermit craft

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.890 
or like we discovered on hermit craft
you<00:00:25.800> can<00:00:26.010> put<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.369> daylight<00:00:26.760> sensors<00:00:27.240> on<00:00:27.390> top

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
you can put the daylight sensors on top

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.019 
you can put the daylight sensors on top
of<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.109> beacons<00:00:28.500> as<00:00:28.769> well<00:00:29.039> but<00:00:29.609> what<00:00:29.760> we<00:00:29.849> want

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
of the beacons as well but what we want

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.580 
of the beacons as well but what we want
to<00:00:30.150> find<00:00:30.330> out<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.779> all<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.230> blocks<00:00:31.470> that

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
to find out is all of the blocks that

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.530 
to find out is all of the blocks that
don't<00:00:31.890> break<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.279> beacon<00:00:32.610> beam<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.360> only

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
don't break the beacon beam and the only

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.540 
don't break the beacon beam and the only
way<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.809> do<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.710> test<00:00:35.010> them<00:00:35.219> all<00:00:35.340> one

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
way to do that is to test them all one

00:00:35.550 --> 00:01:36.990 
way to do that is to test them all one
by<00:00:35.790> one

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.760 

we<00:01:38.000> have<00:01:38.119> now<00:01:38.270> tested<00:01:38.570> all<00:01:39.020> of<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.259> blocks<00:01:39.530> in

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
we have now tested all of the blocks in

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.410 
we have now tested all of the blocks in
the<00:01:39.830> game<00:01:40.189> and<00:01:40.430> that<00:01:40.460> did<00:01:40.700> not<00:01:40.729> take<00:01:41.090> as<00:01:41.240> long

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
the game and that did not take as long

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.660 
the game and that did not take as long
as<00:01:41.630> I<00:01:41.750> expected<00:01:42.289> however<00:01:42.740> my<00:01:42.950> idea<00:01:43.280> to<00:01:43.430> put<00:01:43.579> the

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
as I expected however my idea to put the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.609 
as I expected however my idea to put the
blocks<00:01:43.909> onto<00:01:44.149> these<00:01:44.360> two<00:01:44.600> platforms<00:01:44.869> have

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
blocks onto these two platforms have

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.620 
blocks onto these two platforms have
left<00:01:45.979> our<00:01:46.189> results<00:01:46.610> a<00:01:46.700> little<00:01:47.060> bit<00:01:47.180> clustered

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
left our results a little bit clustered

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.389 
left our results a little bit clustered
so<00:01:47.810> I<00:01:47.840> decided<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.320> reorganize<00:01:48.590> them<00:01:49.130> so<00:01:49.280> we

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
so I decided to reorganize them so we

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.340 
so I decided to reorganize them so we
could<00:01:49.549> have<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.700> look<00:01:49.909> at<00:01:50.539> what<00:01:50.840> blocks<00:01:51.140> the

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
could have a look at what blocks the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.169 
could have a look at what blocks the
beam<00:01:51.530> can<00:01:51.799> shine<00:01:52.070> through<00:01:52.340> so<00:01:52.520> as<00:01:52.909> you<00:01:53.060> would

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
beam can shine through so as you would

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.880 
beam can shine through so as you would
expect<00:01:53.270> glass<00:01:53.840> is<00:01:54.080> one<00:01:54.229> of<00:01:54.350> them<00:01:54.470> and<00:01:54.649> all<00:01:54.770> the

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
expect glass is one of them and all the

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.749 
expect glass is one of them and all the
different<00:01:55.039> types<00:01:55.250> of<00:01:55.490> stained<00:01:55.729> glass

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
different types of stained glass

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.690 
different types of stained glass
including<00:01:56.479> the<00:01:56.720> panes<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:57.200> also<00:01:58.039> carpets<00:01:58.520> the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
including the panes and also carpets the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.789 
including the panes and also carpets the
beam<00:01:58.880> can<00:01:59.149> shine<00:01:59.390> through<00:01:59.450> it<00:01:59.960> can<00:02:00.140> also<00:02:00.409> go

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
beam can shine through it can also go

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.410 
beam can shine through it can also go
through<00:02:00.830> another<00:02:01.429> beacon<00:02:01.850> block<00:02:02.060> so<00:02:02.240> you<00:02:02.299> can

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
through another beacon block so you can

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.940 
through another beacon block so you can
just<00:02:02.600> place<00:02:02.780> one<00:02:02.990> on<00:02:03.020> top<00:02:03.319> like<00:02:03.500> that<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:03.770> it

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
just place one on top like that and it

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.309 
just place one on top like that and it
will<00:02:04.039> go<00:02:04.190> through<00:02:04.220> as<00:02:05.209> the<00:02:05.479> item<00:02:05.780> frames<00:02:06.080> the

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
will go through as the item frames the

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:08.680 
will go through as the item frames the
signs<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.130> mob<00:02:07.340> heads<00:02:07.610> now<00:02:08.149> this<00:02:08.330> one<00:02:08.539> is

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
signs and the mob heads now this one is

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.479 
signs and the mob heads now this one is
a<00:02:08.720> little<00:02:09.019> bit<00:02:09.170> earlier<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.799> beam<00:02:09.979> can<00:02:10.250> shine

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
a little bit earlier the beam can shine

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.370 
a little bit earlier the beam can shine
through<00:02:10.549> lava<00:02:11.090> but<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.540> can't<00:02:11.780> shine<00:02:12.080> through

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
through lava but it can't shine through

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.140 
through lava but it can't shine through
water<00:02:12.650> and<00:02:13.040> I've<00:02:13.370> got<00:02:13.549> a<00:02:13.580> feeling<00:02:14.030> that's

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
water and I've got a feeling that's

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.240 
water and I've got a feeling that's
because<00:02:14.510> water<00:02:14.660> adjust<00:02:15.260> light<00:02:15.709> levels<00:02:15.739> but

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
because water adjust light levels but

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.130 
because water adjust light levels but
there's<00:02:16.459> a<00:02:16.519> an<00:02:16.790> interesting<00:02:17.420> result<00:02:17.810> right

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
there's a an interesting result right

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.110 
there's a an interesting result right
there<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.920> beam<00:02:19.130> can<00:02:19.370> shine<00:02:19.580> through<00:02:19.880> fences

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
there the beam can shine through fences

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.670 
there the beam can shine through fences
it<00:02:20.540> can<00:02:20.690> shine<00:02:20.930> through<00:02:20.989> the<00:02:21.319> Kaba<00:02:21.560> walls

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
it can shine through the Kaba walls

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.880 
it can shine through the Kaba walls
without<00:02:22.549> Pistons<00:02:23.260> trapdoor<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.739> two

these now there are a few blocks that I
was<00:02:53.900> expecting<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.560> shine<00:02:54.829> free<00:02:55.070> which<00:02:55.220> it

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
was expecting it to shine free which it

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.030 
was expecting it to shine free which it
didn't<00:02:55.700> that<00:02:55.850> is<00:02:56.269> ice<00:02:56.570> and<00:02:56.870> glowstone<00:02:57.590> should

didn't that is ice and glowstone should

didn't that is ice and glowstone should
break<00:02:58.220> that<00:02:58.430> before<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.819> turns<00:02:59.030> into<00:02:59.239> water

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
break that before it turns into water

cobwebs and leaves I just wanted to

cobwebs and leaves I just wanted to
clarify<00:03:02.420> that<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:02.959> beam<00:03:03.140> wouldn't<00:03:03.470> go

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
clarify that the beam wouldn't go

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.360 
clarify that the beam wouldn't go
through<00:03:03.799> any<00:03:04.190> of<00:03:04.459> those<00:03:04.640> block<00:03:04.970> types<00:03:06.069> so<00:03:07.069> sigh

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
through any of those block types so sigh

through any of those block types so sigh
guy<00:03:07.579> Ryan<00:03:07.880> has<00:03:08.180> looked<00:03:08.450> into<00:03:08.569> the<00:03:08.780> game<00:03:09.079> code

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
guy Ryan has looked into the game code

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.930 
guy Ryan has looked into the game code
and<00:03:09.620> he's<00:03:09.769> found<00:03:10.040> out<00:03:10.220> that<00:03:10.430> what<00:03:10.549> a<00:03:10.579> beacon

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
and he's found out that what a beacon

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.550 
and he's found out that what a beacon
does<00:03:11.150> is<00:03:11.389> it<00:03:11.540> checks<00:03:11.750> all<00:03:12.019> of<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.319> blocks

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
does is it checks all of the blocks

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.920 
does is it checks all of the blocks
above<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.100> beam<00:03:13.310> to<00:03:13.819> see<00:03:14.030> if<00:03:14.239> any<00:03:14.420> of<00:03:14.600> them<00:03:14.750> are

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
above the beam to see if any of them are

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.840 
above the beam to see if any of them are
opaque<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:15.620> if<00:03:15.739> they<00:03:15.889> are<00:03:16.010> it<00:03:16.220> cancels<00:03:16.700> the

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
opaque and if they are it cancels the

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.460 
opaque and if they are it cancels the
beam<00:03:17.030> so<00:03:17.600> that<00:03:17.720> means<00:03:17.930> that<00:03:18.079> all<00:03:18.139> of<00:03:18.260> these

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
beam so that means that all of these

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.349 
beam so that means that all of these
block<00:03:18.739> types<00:03:19.010> right<00:03:19.220> here<00:03:19.459> are<00:03:19.609> classified<00:03:20.150> as

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
block types right here are classified as

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.569 
block types right here are classified as
opaque<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:20.959> all<00:03:21.470> of<00:03:21.620> these<00:03:21.769> ones<00:03:22.069> are<00:03:22.280> not

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
opaque and all of these ones are not

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.160 
opaque and all of these ones are not
which<00:03:22.790> is<00:03:22.940> interesting<00:03:23.329> because<00:03:23.750> it's<00:03:24.049> the

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
which is interesting because it's the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.170 
which is interesting because it's the
same<00:03:24.350> mechanic<00:03:24.799> that<00:03:24.980> a<00:03:25.010> zombie<00:03:25.190> uses<00:03:25.700> when

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
same mechanic that a zombie uses when

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.910 
same mechanic that a zombie uses when
it's<00:03:26.329> burning<00:03:26.720> in<00:03:26.900> daylight<00:03:27.350> so<00:03:27.620> it<00:03:27.799> will

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
it's burning in daylight so it will

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.500 
it's burning in daylight so it will
check<00:03:28.130> above<00:03:28.519> itself<00:03:28.850> to<00:03:29.060> see<00:03:29.209> if<00:03:29.299> there<00:03:29.480> are

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
check above itself to see if there are

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.870 
check above itself to see if there are
any<00:03:29.630> opaque<00:03:30.079> blocks<00:03:30.410> and<00:03:30.650> if<00:03:31.130> that<00:03:31.280> is<00:03:31.430> so<00:03:31.670> it

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
any opaque blocks and if that is so it

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.699 
any opaque blocks and if that is so it
will<00:03:32.000> not<00:03:32.180> be<00:03:32.359> set<00:03:32.569> on<00:03:32.690> fire<00:03:32.959> which<00:03:33.170> means<00:03:33.200> if<00:03:33.620> a

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
will not be set on fire which means if a

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.770 
will not be set on fire which means if a
zombie<00:03:34.069> is<00:03:34.220> underneath<00:03:34.940> any<00:03:35.180> of<00:03:35.269> these<00:03:35.450> blocks

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
zombie is underneath any of these blocks

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.750 
zombie is underneath any of these blocks
for<00:03:35.989> example<00:03:36.019> lava<00:03:36.680> or<00:03:36.949> a<00:03:36.979> chest<00:03:37.400> it<00:03:37.639> can

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
for example lava or a chest it can

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.199 
for example lava or a chest it can
actually<00:03:37.880> burn<00:03:38.329> in<00:03:38.840> daylight

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
actually burn in daylight

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.699 
actually burn in daylight
so<00:03:41.209> we've<00:03:41.420> learned<00:03:41.599> all<00:03:41.840> we<00:03:41.870> set<00:03:42.200> out<00:03:42.319> to<00:03:42.530> learn

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
so we've learned all we set out to learn

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.470 
so we've learned all we set out to learn
this<00:03:42.920> episode<00:03:43.489> and<00:03:43.790> now<00:03:43.939> I<00:03:43.969> want<00:03:44.180> to<00:03:44.269> share

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
this episode and now I want to share

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.660 
this episode and now I want to share
with<00:03:44.569> you<00:03:44.719> a<00:03:44.780> suggestion<00:03:45.530> that<00:03:45.709> I<00:03:45.739> saw<00:03:46.040> in<00:03:46.280> the

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
with you a suggestion that I saw in the

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.099 
with you a suggestion that I saw in the
comments<00:03:47.030> on<00:03:47.150> one<00:03:47.390> of<00:03:47.420> my<00:03:47.569> videos<00:03:47.900> that<00:03:48.079> I

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
comments on one of my videos that I

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:49.599 
comments on one of my videos that I
thought<00:03:48.349> was<00:03:48.469> fantastic<00:03:48.680> and<00:03:49.219> this<00:03:49.340> was<00:03:49.489> the

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
thought was fantastic and this was the

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.220 
thought was fantastic and this was the
perfect<00:03:49.790> opportunity<00:03:50.120> to<00:03:50.629> share<00:03:50.870> it<00:03:50.959> with<00:03:51.049> you

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
perfect opportunity to share it with you

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.709 
perfect opportunity to share it with you
if<00:03:51.650> we<00:03:51.829> put<00:03:52.010> a<00:03:52.040> stained<00:03:52.519> colored<00:03:52.939> glass<00:03:53.239> on<00:03:53.540> top

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:53.719 
if we put a stained colored glass on top

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:55.839 
if we put a stained colored glass on top
of<00:03:53.840> a<00:03:53.930> beacon<00:03:54.140> then<00:03:54.920> it<00:03:55.159> could<00:03:55.370> change<00:03:55.609> the

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
of a beacon then it could change the

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:57.339 
of a beacon then it could change the
beacon<00:03:56.180> beam<00:03:56.390> color<00:03:56.750> now<00:03:57.019> that<00:03:57.200> is<00:03:57.319> a

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
beacon beam color now that is a

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.289
