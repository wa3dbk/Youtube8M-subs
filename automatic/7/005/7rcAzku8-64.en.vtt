here<00:00:00.659> we're<00:00:00.810> asked<00:00:01.110> to<00:00:01.140> subtract<00:00:01.650> some

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
here we're asked to subtract some

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.379 
here we're asked to subtract some
negative<00:00:02.370> numbers<00:00:02.700> what<00:00:02.939> we're<00:00:03.060> going<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.300> do
