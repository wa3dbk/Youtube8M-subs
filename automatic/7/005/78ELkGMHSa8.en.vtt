I<00:03:40.310> think<00:03:40.850> we're<00:03:41.360> getting<00:03:41.750> a<00:03:41.840> little

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
I think we're getting a little

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.370 
I think we're getting a little
sidetracked<00:03:42.500> here<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:44.480> point<00:03:44.810> I<00:03:45.170> was<00:03:45.320> trying

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
sidetracked here the point I was trying

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.500 
sidetracked here the point I was trying
to<00:03:45.740> make<00:03:46.010> is<00:03:46.280> that<00:03:46.310> we<00:03:46.670> can<00:03:46.880> get<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.240> process

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
to make is that we can get the process

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
to make is that we can get the process
rolling<00:03:47.960> by<00:03:48.890> paying<00:03:49.610> it<00:03:50.030> forward<00:03:50.290> you<00:03:51.290> mean

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
rolling by paying it forward you mean

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.760 
rolling by paying it forward you mean
like<00:03:51.890> a<00:03:51.920> savings<00:03:52.760> account<00:03:52.990> no<00:03:53.990> more<00:03:54.470> like<00:03:54.740> a

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
like a savings account no more like a

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.850 
like a savings account no more like a
checkbook<00:03:55.610> you<00:03:56.210> give<00:03:56.540> out<00:03:56.780> without<00:03:57.230> getting

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
checkbook you give out without getting

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.130 
checkbook you give out without getting
anything<00:03:58.250> in<00:03:58.580> return

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
anything in return

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.690 
anything in return
sounds<00:04:00.140> like<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:00.530> reasoning<00:04:01.070> behind<00:04:01.220> most

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
sounds like the reasoning behind most

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.810 
sounds like the reasoning behind most
taxes<00:04:02.480> so<00:04:03.410> this<00:04:03.740> is<00:04:03.950> how<00:04:04.130> we're<00:04:04.370> supposed<00:04:04.580> to

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
taxes so this is how we're supposed to

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.000 
taxes so this is how we're supposed to
pay<00:04:04.970> it<00:04:05.000> forward<00:04:05.510> seems<00:04:06.500> more<00:04:06.740> like<00:04:06.980> a

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
pay it forward seems more like a

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.900 
pay it forward seems more like a
backdoor<00:04:07.730> policy<00:04:08.390> to<00:04:08.570> me<00:04:08.750> can<00:04:09.590> we<00:04:09.620> please<00:04:10.340> stop
