is there a Tron rivet the intact it
definitely<00:04:09.700> seems<00:04:10.030> to<00:04:10.240> be<00:04:10.500> becoming<00:04:11.500> mobile

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
definitely seems to be becoming mobile

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.040 
definitely seems to be becoming mobile
although<00:04:12.730> it<00:04:12.850> would<00:04:13.000> seem<00:04:13.210> impossible<00:04:13.360> where

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
although it would seem impossible where

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
we could see the factories you can see

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.539 
we could see the factories you can see
the<00:04:16.209> movement<00:04:16.420> in<00:04:16.810> this<00:04:17.020> leg<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:17.560> even<00:04:18.400> put

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
tightness as who does this there is

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.290 
tightness as who does this there is
definitely<00:04:23.860> something<00:04:24.220> happening<00:04:24.850> the

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300
