00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.640
 Hello 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:17.160
 It is a game of 0 manipulative hospital director sun sinking in the pain numbness professional tailoring in Osaka 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:19.010
 This time I would like to tell you about effective muscle training for lumbar spondylosis 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.930
 I will 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:29.330
 Lumbar spondylosis has a need to train the abdominal muscles 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:36.560
 Normal abs training is dangerous because it places a heavy load on the lower back 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:37.760
 Training with dumbbells and barbell windows places an excessive burden on the waist, so your own 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.960
 I used my weight 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.399
 It is recommended to do a double toe new 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.399
 Let's do it 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.519
 First of all 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.519
 Blue authority sleeps 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:01:02.980
 Then I bend my knees and open my palm along the front of two things 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:07.720
 And eyes is the image by pulling the left jaw 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:10.170
 While watching the navel has lifted slowly the upper body 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.310
 At this time one second later 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:18.560
 Please come just got until about Week of the knee I 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.560
 It keeps for 5 seconds in this state 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.410
 I keep it for 5 seconds and slowly return it over 2 seconds 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:33.550
 And I will continue to do this 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.550
 I will raise it again for one second 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.700
 Keep for 5 seconds here 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.200
 Press 2 seconds Once you keep your head 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.970
 The point is 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:54.500
 Looking At The fact that see the os 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:59.120
 And the back is that the honorific bone is raised to the point where it leaves the ground a little 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.640
 Because it will put a burden on the waist if you lift the entire body completely 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:06.390
 About 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.390
 Please do keep in about come until about the top of it knee is Te 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:21.340
 Try to do approximately 10 times your current abs workout 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:25.719
 It's pretty tight, so if you can't do it 10 times you can do it 5 times or 6 times 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:29.760
 I think that there are individual differences in each, so once by myself 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:29.760
 Please check how much you can do 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:40.880
 The abs training I mentioned this time is running or the same station, but the width is small 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:47.040
 I can train my abs very much 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:55.560

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:58.730
