00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:39.489
 Next, I write the law of hammering on the water that corresponds to the melody , 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:45.370
 The following 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:47.650

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:53.309
 I'll try playing.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:03.659
 And lead, grasp the four applications in the contemporary sound of hammering in the temple ring finger 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:09.599
 Hammering and pulling off by using the following
