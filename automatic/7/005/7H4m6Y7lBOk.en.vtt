I really don't know how to pronounce his
name<00:00:13.410> yes<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:14.700> this<00:00:14.969> basically<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.389> minigame

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
name yes so this basically a minigame

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.439 
name yes so this basically a minigame
where<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.800> flood<00:00:17.130> or<00:00:17.430> trying<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.029> hunt<00:00:18.150> on<00:00:18.300> the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
where the flood or trying to hunt on the

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.750 
where the flood or trying to hunt on the
humans<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.320> it's<00:00:19.439> simple<00:00:19.680> enough<00:00:19.740> right<00:00:20.100> aside

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
humans so it's simple enough right aside

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.400 
humans so it's simple enough right aside
from<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.029> fact<00:00:21.060> off<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.779> bat<00:00:21.960> you'll<00:00:22.230> have

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
from the fact off the bat you'll have

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.349 
from the fact off the bat you'll have
one<00:00:22.680> flood<00:00:22.949> spawn<00:00:23.310> right<00:00:23.699> behind<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.240> and

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
one flood spawn right behind you and

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.000 
one flood spawn right behind you and
this<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.600> very<00:00:24.810> important<00:00:25.289> because<00:00:25.650> it's<00:00:25.949> a

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
this is very important because it's a

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.800 
this is very important because it's a
float<00:00:26.310> if<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.000> guys<00:00:27.119> don't<00:00:27.269> start<00:00:27.539> running

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
float if you guys don't start running

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.300 
float if you guys don't start running
the<00:00:27.960> flood<00:00:28.199> will<00:00:28.380> pick<00:00:28.560> one<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.890> off<00:00:29.070> and

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
the flood will pick one of you off and

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.640 
the flood will pick one of you off and
this<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:30.150> very<00:00:30.510> bad<00:00:30.750> for<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.990> humans<00:00:31.380> as<00:00:31.500> is

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
this is very bad for the humans as is

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.370 
this is very bad for the humans as is
this<00:00:31.830> mix<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.369> flood<00:00:33.360> job<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.719> hell<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.260> lot

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
this mix the flood job a hell of a lot

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.680 
this mix the flood job a hell of a lot
more<00:00:34.410> easier<00:00:34.800> no<00:00:35.760> yeah<00:00:35.940> for<00:00:36.420> those<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.630> you
