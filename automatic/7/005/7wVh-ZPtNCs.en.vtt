I think that you know at one point he

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.710 
I think that you know at one point he
was<00:02:32.890> up<00:02:33.220> in<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.430> top<00:02:33.670> ten<00:02:33.910> he<00:02:34.030> had<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.150> bad<00:02:34.390> start

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
he went down the first Tony works up

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.280 
he went down the first Tony works up
then<00:02:36.700> he<00:02:36.790> crashes<00:02:37.180> he<00:02:37.480> goes<00:02:37.630> off<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:38.020> track

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
then he crashes he goes off the track

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.110 
then he crashes he goes off the track
and<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.860> know<00:02:38.950> for<00:02:39.160> him<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.310> battle<00:02:39.580> back<00:02:39.880> and

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
and you know for him to battle back and

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.520 
and you know for him to battle back and
finish<00:02:40.450> up<00:02:40.570> fourth<00:02:40.840> I<00:02:40.989> thought<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:41.350> was<00:02:41.500> a

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
finish up fourth I thought that was a
