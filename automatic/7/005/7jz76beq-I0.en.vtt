00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.179 

whole<00:00:04.420> time<00:00:04.630> I've<00:00:04.750> worked<00:00:04.960> here<00:00:05.140> we've<00:00:05.980> heard

00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:06.189 
whole time I've worked here we've heard

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:08.250 
whole time I've worked here we've heard
about<00:00:06.279> the<00:00:06.460> network<00:00:06.790> of<00:00:06.939> tunnels<00:00:07.170> under<00:00:08.170> the

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:08.260 
about the network of tunnels under the

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.820 
about the network of tunnels under the
building<00:00:08.880> so<00:00:09.880> tonight<00:00:10.470> while<00:00:11.470> the<00:00:11.500> building

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830 
building so tonight while the building

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:12.990 
building so tonight while the building
is<00:00:11.920> relatively<00:00:12.370> empty

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000 
is relatively empty

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.300 
is relatively empty
I<00:00:13.200> thought<00:00:14.200> we'd<00:00:14.380> go<00:00:14.470> find<00:00:14.740> out<00:00:14.890> about<00:00:15.040> those

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:15.310 
I thought we'd go find out about those

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.410 
I thought we'd go find out about those
network<00:00:15.670> of<00:00:15.790> tunnels<00:00:17.939> and<00:00:18.939> see<00:00:19.119> what<00:00:19.270> they're

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
network of tunnels and see what they're

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:37.509 
network of tunnels and see what they're
like

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:37.519 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:42.619 

that's<00:00:38.519> just<00:00:38.789> a<00:00:38.879> dead<00:00:39.059> end<00:00:39.269> down<00:00:39.480> there<00:00:41.629> it's

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
that's just a dead end down there it's

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.040 
that's just a dead end down there it's
hard<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.899> tell<00:00:43.110> really<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.820> can't<00:00:44.820> say<00:00:45.050> that

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
hard to tell really I can't say that

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.860 
hard to tell really I can't say that
they<00:00:46.199> are<00:00:46.320> legitimately<00:00:46.890> tunnels<00:00:47.660> they<00:00:48.660> are

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
they are legitimately tunnels they are

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.530 
they are legitimately tunnels they are
way<00:00:49.170> too<00:00:51.050> way<00:00:52.050> large<00:00:52.320> or<00:00:52.680> narrow<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:54.089> fit<00:00:54.120> me

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
way too way large or narrow to fit me

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:14.760 
way too way large or narrow to fit me
through<00:00:55.640> supposedly<00:00:56.640> they<00:00:57.360> interconnect

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:25.410 

there's<00:01:16.060> something<00:01:17.060> down<00:01:17.180> there<00:01:21.730> all<00:01:22.730> right

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.040 

order<00:01:26.420> back<00:01:26.860> let's<00:01:27.860> go<00:01:28.040> back<00:01:28.780> see<00:01:29.780> what<00:01:29.930> there

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
order back let's go back see what there

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.460 
order back let's go back see what there
is<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.170> see<00:01:32.920> they<00:01:33.920> do<00:01:33.980> have<00:01:34.310> series<00:01:34.900> of<00:01:35.900> lights

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
is to see they do have series of lights

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.120 
is to see they do have series of lights
that<00:01:37.040> I<00:01:37.190> don't<00:01:37.400> know<00:01:37.490> how<00:01:37.610> to<00:01:37.730> turn<00:01:37.880> on/off<00:01:38.270> and

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
that I don't know how to turn on/off and

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.270 
that I don't know how to turn on/off and
we're<00:01:40.130> about<00:01:40.340> to<00:01:40.520> find<00:01:40.760> out<00:01:40.940> if<00:01:41.090> that's<00:01:41.240> a<00:01:42.280> dead

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
we're about to find out if that's a dead

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:53.670 
we're about to find out if that's a dead
end<00:01:43.310> or<00:01:47.619> cigarette<00:01:48.619> butts<00:01:49.780> so<00:01:51.369> are<00:01:52.369> we<00:01:52.610> moral

end or cigarette butts so are we moral
more<00:01:54.680> of<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:54.860> warm<00:01:55.100> have<00:01:55.310> we<00:01:55.460> discovered<00:01:55.880> a

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
more of a warm have we discovered a

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.340 
more of a warm have we discovered a
long-lost<00:01:57.800> student<00:01:58.430> smoking<00:01:58.910> hideout<00:01:59.350> well

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
long-lost student smoking hideout well

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.880 
long-lost student smoking hideout well
they'll<00:02:00.500> be<00:02:00.650> a<00:02:01.030> similar<00:02:02.030> pile<00:02:02.330> of<00:02:02.540> her<00:02:02.890> use

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
they'll be a similar pile of her use

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.790 
they'll be a similar pile of her use
contraceptive<00:02:04.700> her<00:02:05.290> whiskey<00:02:06.290> bottles<00:02:06.680> or

something<00:02:08.979> glad<00:02:09.979> I<00:02:10.010> couldn't<00:02:10.369> figure<00:02:10.459> out<00:02:10.580> her

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
something glad I couldn't figure out her

something glad I couldn't figure out her
turn<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:10.940> lights<00:02:11.120> on<00:02:11.270> this<00:02:11.570> wouldn't<00:02:11.840> be

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
turn the lights on this wouldn't be

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.720 
turn the lights on this wouldn't be
nearly<00:02:12.110> as<00:02:12.200> interesting<00:02:12.470> here's<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.550> lights

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
nearly as interesting here's the lights

nearly as interesting here's the lights
are<00:02:13.880> on<00:02:14.000> I'd<00:02:14.150> be<00:02:14.180> crawling<00:02:14.480> in<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.720> dirt<00:02:14.930> ditch

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
are on I'd be crawling in a dirt ditch

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.790 
are on I'd be crawling in a dirt ditch
that's<00:02:16.430> way<00:02:16.580> it's<00:02:16.610> cool<00:02:17.380> so<00:02:18.380> you'll<00:02:18.530> be<00:02:18.650> on<00:02:18.769> a

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
that's way it's cool so you'll be on a

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.949 
that's way it's cool so you'll be on a
junction<00:02:19.280> that's<00:02:20.239> looking<00:02:20.510> back<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.810> way<00:02:20.930> we

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
junction that's looking back the way we

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:27.850 
junction that's looking back the way we
came<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:23.620> shooting<00:02:24.620> down<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:27.500> length<00:02:27.709> of

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
came and shooting down the length of

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.920 
came and shooting down the length of
home<00:02:28.070> AK<00:02:28.660> underneath<00:02:29.660> biology<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:31.930> probably

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
home AK underneath biology and probably

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.740 
home AK underneath biology and probably
to<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:33.170> boiler<00:02:33.560> room<00:02:33.790> whether<00:02:34.790> my<00:02:35.330> guess<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:35.720> a

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
to the boiler room whether my guess is a

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.470 
to the boiler room whether my guess is a
nice<00:02:35.959> little<00:02:36.170> door<00:02:36.610> no<00:02:37.610> much<00:02:37.880> fun<00:02:38.090> as<00:02:38.209> a<00:02:38.239> trap

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
nice little door no much fun as a trap

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.900 
nice little door no much fun as a trap
door<00:02:38.769> and<00:02:39.769> here<00:02:40.010> we<00:02:40.130> are<00:02:40.160> still<00:02:40.610> going

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
door and here we are still going

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:52.450 
door and here we are still going
straight<00:02:41.239> out<00:02:41.620> towards<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.709> library

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.449 

cool

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.759 

so<00:02:56.030> that<00:02:56.180> I<00:02:56.209> would<00:02:56.359> be<00:02:56.480> looking<00:02:56.810> straight

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
so that I would be looking straight

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.229 
so that I would be looking straight
towards<00:02:58.069> the<00:02:58.129> library<00:02:58.280> wall<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:59.120> you<00:02:59.209> can

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
towards the library wall that you can

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.259 
towards the library wall that you can
see<00:02:59.329> in<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.629> background<00:02:59.810> there<00:03:00.140> and<00:03:00.950> then

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
see in the background there and then

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.179 
see in the background there and then
around<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.420> corner

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:03.189 
around the corner

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.729 
around the corner
my<00:03:04.189> guess<00:03:04.430> is<00:03:04.459> another<00:03:04.790> run<00:03:05.469> changing<00:03:06.469> behind

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
my guess is another run changing behind

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.610 
my guess is another run changing behind
the<00:03:06.799> lines<00:03:06.980> are<00:03:07.219> going<00:03:07.370> down<00:03:07.670> there

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
the lines are going down there

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.910 
the lines are going down there
the<00:03:09.620> library<00:03:10.099> was<00:03:10.340> never<00:03:11.060> a<00:03:11.180> place<00:03:11.560> that<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.590> was

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
the library was never a place that I was

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.860 
the library was never a place that I was
told<00:03:13.159> that<00:03:13.340> you<00:03:13.489> can<00:03:13.639> get<00:03:13.760> into<00:03:14.000> these<00:03:14.120> there

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
told that you can get into these there

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.679 
told that you can get into these there
are<00:03:15.049> many<00:03:15.379> places<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:15.769> can<00:03:15.889> get<00:03:16.069> into<00:03:16.280> these

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:16.689 
are many places you can get into these

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:20.199 
are many places you can get into these
and<00:03:17.689> there's<00:03:17.840> really<00:03:17.959> only<00:03:18.079> one<00:03:19.060> that<00:03:20.060> the

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
and there's really only one that the

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.339 
and there's really only one that the
students<00:03:20.629> are<00:03:20.750> aware<00:03:20.989> of<00:03:21.879> and<00:03:22.879> can<00:03:23.120> see<00:03:23.359> though

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
students are aware of and can see though

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:25.860 
students are aware of and can see though
they<00:03:24.500> probably<00:03:24.739> don't<00:03:24.980> know<00:03:25.099> what<00:03:25.340> they're

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
they probably don't know what they're

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
looking at at any given day it's not a

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:46.559 
looking at at any given day it's not a
pleasant<00:03:33.379> walk<00:03:33.739> down<00:03:34.040> here<00:03:45.219> ain't<00:03:46.219> sort<00:03:46.459> of

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
pleasant walk down here ain't sort of

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.959 
pleasant walk down here ain't sort of
walk<00:03:47.569> totally<00:03:48.019> bend<00:03:48.260> over<00:03:48.590> and<00:03:49.519> then<00:03:49.700> use<00:03:49.849> the

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:49.969 
walk totally bend over and then use the

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:53.800 
walk totally bend over and then use the
camera<00:03:50.419> to<00:03:50.680> actually<00:03:51.680> see<00:03:52.329> where<00:03:53.329> I'm<00:03:53.450> going

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
camera to actually see where I'm going

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.080 
camera to actually see where I'm going
guess<00:03:54.019> there's<00:03:54.230> no<00:03:54.760> steam<00:03:55.760> lines<00:03:56.090> in<00:03:56.719> this<00:03:56.930> one

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
guess there's no steam lines in this one

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.869 
guess there's no steam lines in this one
going<00:03:59.090> down<00:03:59.209> this<00:03:59.479> way<00:03:59.720> I'm<00:03:59.930> not<00:04:00.079> gonna<00:04:00.199> get<00:04:00.440> my

going down this way I'm not gonna get my

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:08.319 
going down this way I'm not gonna get my
shoulders<00:04:01.879> between<00:04:02.090> these<00:04:02.479> mines<00:04:07.000> my<00:04:08.000> camera

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
shoulders between these mines my camera

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:12.240 
shoulders between these mines my camera
keeps<00:04:08.449> shutting<00:04:08.720> off<00:04:09.939> it's<00:04:10.939> hot<00:04:11.120> down<00:04:11.359> in<00:04:11.540> here

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
keeps shutting off it's hot down in here

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.289 
keeps shutting off it's hot down in here
I'm<00:04:13.250> gonna<00:04:13.370> crawl<00:04:13.669> down<00:04:13.879> to<00:04:14.030> that<00:04:14.889> creeping

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
I'm gonna crawl down to that creeping

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.890 
I'm gonna crawl down to that creeping
wall<00:04:17.299> that<00:04:17.780> I<00:04:17.870> can<00:04:18.049> just<00:04:18.650> see<00:04:18.889> probably<00:04:19.280> can't

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
wall that I can just see probably can't

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.180 
wall that I can just see probably can't
find<00:04:20.900> out<00:04:21.970> what<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.090> grooving<00:04:23.389> is<00:04:24.009> and<00:04:25.009> that

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
find out what the grooving is and that

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.589 
find out what the grooving is and that
should<00:04:25.400> be<00:04:25.520> crawling<00:04:25.970> straight<00:04:26.240> towards

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:26.599 
should be crawling straight towards

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:33.110 
should be crawling straight towards
biology<00:04:27.370> we'll<00:04:28.370> see<00:04:28.580> it's<00:04:28.729> there

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.870 

here<00:04:34.120> we<00:04:34.210> get<00:04:34.390> somewhere<00:04:35.550> that<00:04:36.550> you<00:04:36.730> would

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
here we get somewhere that you would

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.140 
here we get somewhere that you would
wanted<00:04:37.360> to<00:04:37.450> see<00:04:37.630> for<00:04:37.870> a<00:04:37.900> long<00:04:38.080> long<00:04:38.290> time<00:04:38.350> and

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
wanted to see for a long long time and

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.110 
wanted to see for a long long time and
it<00:04:40.150> arisen<00:04:40.720> to<00:04:40.870> some<00:04:41.170> sort<00:04:41.410> of<00:04:41.850> very<00:04:42.850> cool

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
it arisen to some sort of very cool

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.960 
it arisen to some sort of very cool
status<00:04:43.630> in<00:04:44.020> your<00:04:44.200> brain<00:04:44.850> that's<00:04:45.850> these<00:04:46.120> things

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
status in your brain that's these things

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.180 
status in your brain that's these things
crawl<00:04:48.970> space<00:04:49.270> there<00:04:49.960> aren't<00:04:50.110> tunnels<00:04:50.830> under

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
crawl space there aren't tunnels under

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.180 
crawl space there aren't tunnels under
the<00:04:51.280> school<00:04:51.550> there's<00:04:52.450> a<00:04:52.510> crawl<00:04:52.720> space<00:04:53.190> under

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
the school there's a crawl space under

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.750 
the school there's a crawl space under
the<00:04:54.310> school

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
the school

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.190 
the school
it<00:04:54.910> ain't<00:04:55.060> quite<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.330> same<00:04:57.000> so<00:04:58.000> that<00:04:58.630> far<00:04:58.930> wall

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
it ain't quite the same so that far wall

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.170 
it ain't quite the same so that far wall
is<00:04:59.560> biology<00:05:00.160> well<00:05:00.540> let's<00:05:01.540> see

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
is biology well let's see

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.450 
is biology well let's see
we're<00:05:04.180> probably<00:05:04.390> under<00:05:05.050> just<00:05:05.530> under<00:05:05.920> biology

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
we're probably under just under biology

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.640 
we're probably under just under biology
right<00:05:06.640> now<00:05:06.820> so<00:05:07.570> that<00:05:07.660> far<00:05:07.930> wall<00:05:08.170> would<00:05:08.530> be

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
right now so that far wall would be

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.490 
right now so that far wall would be
under<00:05:08.890> the<00:05:08.980> biology<00:05:09.400> labs<00:05:10.170> so<00:05:11.170> you'd<00:05:11.290> have<00:05:11.320> the

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
under the biology labs so you'd have the

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.220 
under the biology labs so you'd have the
piping<00:05:11.890> to<00:05:12.310> handle<00:05:12.670> all<00:05:12.790> of<00:05:12.820> the<00:05:13.150> sinks<00:05:13.540> in

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
piping to handle all of the sinks in

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:20.340 
piping to handle all of the sinks in
biology<00:05:14.560> labs<00:05:17.670> so<00:05:18.670> it<00:05:18.760> was<00:05:18.910> down<00:05:19.120> it<00:05:19.960> turns<00:05:20.140> a

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
biology labs so it was down it turns a

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.110 
biology labs so it was down it turns a
left<00:05:20.910> but<00:05:23.460> you<00:05:24.460> know<00:05:24.580> I've<00:05:24.730> been<00:05:24.850> crawling

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
left but you know I've been crawling

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.990 
left but you know I've been crawling
under<00:05:25.450> here<00:05:25.660> for<00:05:25.810> a<00:05:25.870> while<00:05:26.050> now

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.810 

yeah<00:05:30.630> the<00:05:31.440> cribbing<00:05:31.680> turns<00:05:31.980> out<00:05:32.720> all<00:05:33.720> that<00:05:33.990> was

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
yeah the cribbing turns out all that was

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:42.490 
yeah the cribbing turns out all that was
he<00:05:35.820> starts<00:05:36.540> to<00:05:36.720> nail<00:05:38.480> conduit<00:05:39.480> to<00:05:40.070> and<00:05:41.070> it's

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
he starts to nail conduit to and it's

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:52.340 
he starts to nail conduit to and it's
extra<00:05:43.500> phone<00:05:43.740> lines<00:05:44.010> and<00:05:44.480> whatnot<00:05:51.140> it's<00:05:52.140> just

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
extra phone lines and whatnot it's just

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.840 
extra phone lines and whatnot it's just
one<00:05:52.530> of<00:05:52.590> those<00:05:52.650> things<00:05:55.010> the<00:05:56.010> reality<00:05:56.190> didn't

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
one of those things the reality didn't

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:02.420 
one of those things the reality didn't
play<00:05:57.030> out<00:05:59.270> it's<00:06:00.270> just<00:06:00.420> not<00:06:00.750> as<00:06:00.900> cool<00:06:01.080> as<00:06:01.430> one

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
play out it's just not as cool as one

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:15.929 
play out it's just not as cool as one
would<00:06:02.580> hope
