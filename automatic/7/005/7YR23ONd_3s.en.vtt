00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
striking I well I think positionally

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.120 
striking I well I think positionally
this<00:04:51.840> case<00:04:52.080> to<00:04:52.110> say<00:04:52.440> that<00:04:52.590> was<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:52.800> best<00:04:52.950> shot

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
this case to say that was the best shot

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
of the evening so far yeah because we

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.470 
of the evening so far yeah because we
saw<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.490> angle<00:04:56.880> and<00:04:56.940> there<00:04:57.060> wasn't<00:04:57.210> much<00:04:57.450> of

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
saw the angle and there wasn't much of

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.420 
saw the angle and there wasn't much of
one<00:04:59.960> that's<00:05:00.960> why<00:05:01.140> I<00:05:01.170> used<00:05:01.440> extra<00:05:01.770> force<00:05:02.010> to<00:05:02.220> try

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
one that's why I used extra force to try

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.150 
one that's why I used extra force to try
and<00:05:03.050> make<00:05:04.050> more<00:05:04.290> things<00:05:04.530> happen<00:05:04.770> with<00:05:04.860> the<00:05:04.950> cue

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160

and make more things happen with the cue
ball<00:05:05.600> 35<00:05:06.600> obvious<00:05:07.230> reason<00:05:07.530> here<00:05:07.710> why<00:05:07.740> you

ball 35 obvious reason here why you

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:21.610 
ball 35 obvious reason here why you
shouldn't<00:05:08.280> win<00:05:08.370> the<00:05:08.460> frame<00:05:08.670> now<00:05:10.850> 36

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.340 

and<00:05:22.190> eventually<00:05:22.490> Neal<00:05:22.910> Murphy<00:05:23.780> is<00:05:23.900> being<00:05:24.169> made

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
and eventually Neal Murphy is being made

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.719 
and eventually Neal Murphy is being made
to<00:05:24.500> pay<00:05:24.710> for<00:05:24.979> that<00:05:25.010> lapse<00:05:25.400> of<00:05:25.550> concentration

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
to pay for that lapse of concentration

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:27.850 
to pay for that lapse of concentration
because<00:05:26.660> that's<00:05:26.840> what<00:05:27.020> it<00:05:27.110> was<00:05:27.290> when<00:05:27.740> he

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
because that's what it was when he

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
because that's what it was when he
missed<00:05:28.040> the<00:05:28.100> blue<00:05:29.169> yea<00:05:30.169> indeed<00:05:30.350> he<00:05:30.880> wouldn't

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
missed the blue yea indeed he wouldn't

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.730 
missed the blue yea indeed he wouldn't
want<00:05:32.330> to<00:05:32.449> have<00:05:32.660> to<00:05:32.690> rely<00:05:33.020> on<00:05:33.050> top<00:05:33.320> in<00:05:33.410> the<00:05:33.500> brown

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
want to have to rely on top in the brown

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.250 
want to have to rely on top in the brown
I<00:05:34.060> don't<00:05:35.060> see<00:05:35.240> it<00:05:35.330> being<00:05:35.510> that<00:05:35.780> difficult<00:05:36.229> to

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
I don't see it being that difficult to

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.170 
I don't see it being that difficult to
get<00:05:36.470> on<00:05:36.620> if<00:05:37.400> he<00:05:37.490> could<00:05:37.639> have<00:05:37.760> played<00:05:37.850> on<00:05:38.090> the

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
get on if he could have played on the

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.310 
get on if he could have played on the
flat<00:05:38.419> e<00:05:38.449> here<00:05:38.720> then<00:05:38.840> he<00:05:38.930> wouldn't<00:05:39.139> need<00:05:39.199> it<00:05:41.320> but

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
flat e here then he wouldn't need it but

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.800 
flat e here then he wouldn't need it but
fortunately<00:05:43.220> he's<00:05:43.490> not<00:05:43.669> on<00:05:43.790> it<00:05:43.940> so<00:05:44.150> it<00:05:44.300> he<00:05:44.570> will

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
fortunately he's not on it so it he will

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.260 
fortunately he's not on it so it he will
need<00:05:44.990> the<00:05:45.169> brown<00:05:45.580> long<00:05:46.580> has<00:05:46.699> got<00:05:46.820> an<00:05:46.910> angle<00:05:47.180> on

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
need the brown long has got an angle on

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.580 
need the brown long has got an angle on
the<00:05:47.419> green<00:05:47.600> in<00:05:47.630> a<00:05:47.810> couple<00:05:48.050> of<00:05:48.110> shots<00:05:48.320> time

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
the green in a couple of shots time

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:49.810 
the green in a couple of shots time
after<00:05:48.919> he<00:05:48.979> knocked<00:05:49.070> the<00:05:49.190> yellow<00:05:49.430> and<00:05:49.669> then

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
after he knocked the yellow and then

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:58.400 
after he knocked the yellow and then
it'll<00:05:49.940> be<00:05:50.030> okay

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:07.890

15<00:06:26.229> so<00:06:26.439> here<00:06:26.860> is<00:06:27.009> frame<00:06:27.310> Paul<00:06:27.610> which<00:06:28.169> he<00:06:29.169> looked

00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:29.379 
15 so here is frame Paul which he looked

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:30.749 
15 so here is frame Paul which he looked
at<00:06:29.500> the<00:06:29.560> score<00:06:29.770> but<00:06:29.919> he<00:06:30.009> is<00:06:30.189> fully<00:06:30.400> aware<00:06:30.550> that

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:30.759 
at the score but he is fully aware that

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:32.159 
at the score but he is fully aware that
he<00:06:30.939> doesn't<00:06:31.120> need<00:06:31.270> to<00:06:31.389> take<00:06:31.569> anything<00:06:31.810> further

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:32.169 
he doesn't need to take anything further

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:33.929 
he doesn't need to take anything further
we'll<00:06:32.409> just<00:06:32.530> see<00:06:32.650> this<00:06:32.800> in<00:06:33.039> may<00:06:33.430> play<00:06:33.669> up<00:06:33.789> on

00:06:33.929 --> 00:06:33.939 
we'll just see this in may play up on

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:36.209 
we'll just see this in may play up on

be the pot fix this plane here because

be the pot fix this plane here because
it's<00:06:43.210> a<00:06:43.330> chance
