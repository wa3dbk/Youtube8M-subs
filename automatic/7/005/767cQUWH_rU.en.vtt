for my money the most interesting car of
the<00:00:13.699> show<00:00:13.730> probably<00:00:14.299> the<00:00:14.359> most<00:00:14.480> exciting<00:00:14.900> car

the show probably the most exciting car

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:16.599 
the show probably the most exciting car
is<00:00:15.350> the<00:00:15.500> Lamborghini<00:00:15.680> of<00:00:16.010> stock<00:00:16.340> the

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
is the Lamborghini of stock the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.400 
is the Lamborghini of stock the
much-anticipated<00:00:16.930> four-door<00:00:17.930> Lamborghini

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
much-anticipated four-door Lamborghini

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.140 
much-anticipated four-door Lamborghini
totally<00:00:19.010> designed<00:00:19.250> in-house<00:00:19.730> that

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
totally designed in-house that

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.700 
totally designed in-house that
apparently<00:00:20.449> the<00:00:20.570> biggest<00:00:20.929> problem<00:00:21.560> was

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
apparently the biggest problem was

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.560 
apparently the biggest problem was
trying<00:00:21.890> to<00:00:22.009> balance<00:00:22.189> the<00:00:22.490> aggression<00:00:22.970> with

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
trying to balance the aggression with

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.999 
trying to balance the aggression with
the<00:00:23.720> elegance<00:00:24.140> you<00:00:24.230> don't<00:00:24.470> want<00:00:24.740> too<00:00:24.890> much

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:25.009 
the elegance you don't want too much

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.220 
the elegance you don't want too much
elegance<00:00:25.429> not<00:00:25.759> too<00:00:25.909> aggressive<00:00:26.029> did<00:00:26.989> a<00:00:27.050> really

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
elegance not too aggressive did a really

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.810 
elegance not too aggressive did a really
great<00:00:27.409> job<00:00:27.529> I<00:00:27.919> think<00:00:28.159> really<00:00:28.369> it<00:00:28.519> looks<00:00:28.579> like<00:00:28.789> a

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
great job I think really it looks like a

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.939 
great job I think really it looks like a

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
this low hood in the front it is a front

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.460 
this low hood in the front it is a front
mid-engine<00:00:40.910> so<00:00:41.450> it's<00:00:41.570> completely<00:00:41.840> behind<00:00:42.110> the

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470

and<00:00:44.330> the<00:00:44.840> whole<00:00:45.020> car<00:00:45.260> is<00:00:45.290> technically

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
and the whole car is technically

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.200 
and the whole car is technically
feasible<00:00:46.100> they<00:00:46.490> have<00:00:46.640> done<00:00:46.790> all<00:00:47.000> the

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
feasible they have done all the

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.270 
feasible they have done all the
engineering<00:00:47.840> work<00:00:48.140> for<00:00:48.380> that<00:00:48.560> so<00:00:48.890> what<00:00:49.190> you

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
engineering work for that so what you

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.490 
engineering work for that so what you
see<00:00:49.490> here<00:00:49.520> is<00:00:49.970> conceivable<00:00:50.510> to<00:00:50.960> be<00:00:51.050> built<00:00:51.290> as

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
see here is conceivable to be built as

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.860 
see here is conceivable to be built as
it<00:00:51.740> shows<00:00:52.010> and<00:00:52.310> I<00:00:53.000> for<00:00:53.270> one<00:00:53.300> would<00:00:53.480> love<00:00:53.630> to<00:00:53.720> see

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.710 
500 plus horsepower v-10 power you might
ask<00:01:49.010> why<00:01:49.430> do<00:01:49.700> a<00:01:49.729> four-door<00:01:50.180> Lamborghini<00:01:50.630> and

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
ask why do a four-door Lamborghini and

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.020 
ask why do a four-door Lamborghini and
it<00:01:51.049> is<00:01:51.170> a<00:01:51.200> good<00:01:51.440> question<00:01:51.860> but<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.549> brand<00:01:52.820> has

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
it is a good question but the brand has

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.760 
it is a good question but the brand has
been<00:01:53.180> the<00:01:53.390> resurgent<00:01:53.960> of<00:01:54.049> late<00:01:54.260> and<00:01:54.530> they<00:01:54.650> have

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
been the resurgent of late and they have

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:55.990 
been the resurgent of late and they have
promised<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:55.159> have<00:01:55.310> a<00:01:55.340> new<00:01:55.490> vehicle<00:01:55.700> every

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
promised to have a new vehicle every

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.210 
promised to have a new vehicle every
year<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:56.780> this<00:01:57.320> one<00:01:57.560> is<00:01:57.740> one<00:01:57.920> that<00:01:57.950> they

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
year and this one is one that they

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.429 
year and this one is one that they
reckon<00:01:58.580> can<00:01:58.850> expand<00:01:59.330> their<00:01:59.570> brand<00:01:59.659> of<00:02:00.049> pop<00:02:00.320> by

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
reckon can expand their brand of pop by

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.380 
reckon can expand their brand of pop by
about<00:02:00.680> doubling<00:02:01.100> sales<00:02:01.430> about<00:02:02.030> another<00:02:02.180> two

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
about doubling sales about another two

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.660 
about doubling sales about another two
thousand<00:02:02.780> of<00:02:02.840> these<00:02:02.960> a<00:02:02.990> year<00:02:03.439> so<00:02:03.890> obviously<00:02:04.520> if

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
thousand of these a year so obviously if

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.160 
thousand of these a year so obviously if
that<00:02:04.700> works<00:02:04.939> out<00:02:05.150> it'll<00:02:05.450> be<00:02:05.510> a<00:02:05.600> great<00:02:05.780> idea<00:02:05.990> for

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
that works out it'll be a great idea for

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.619 
that works out it'll be a great idea for
Lamborghini
