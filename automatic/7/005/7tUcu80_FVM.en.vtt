00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 good morning we are all here with one 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.109
 band i 650 s 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.370
 one of the checks you make 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.139
 periodically concerns the pads 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.980
 let's say the little eyes rolling into 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.289
 general but first the basilia 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.180
 brake because it is one of the wear parts 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.539
 in this case we are looking at 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.019
 back we have already been able to see from 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.199
 an advance I take a look at generic 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.700
 that the user of this bike uses more 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.680
 rear brake to fight hours yes 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.380
 sees from the wear of the disc and is banned 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.230
 the use of the pill here we have one 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.030
 good visibility on the pad 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:47.460
 right side but not on the left 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.680
 but already seeing the right we can 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.910
 now imagine that the left is not 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.680
 in perfect condition 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.930
 then the scupolo just like we do 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.370
 meanwhile to see the wear of the match 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.170
 here if you look carefully we say 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.460
 so between this is our bastille 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.460
 you have this is the pill 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.640
 we have an outer part that is 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.280
 simply a plate you see that 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.189
 you can lift is a plate that 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.509
 serves to disperse heat to no 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.340
 transmit all the heat of the 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.409
 pizza tablet 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.320
 then we have a central part more 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.259
 coarse that is the metal support e 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.000
 we have a part in contact with the disk 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.720
 which is that of wear, that is, that which is 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.740
 consumes 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.509
 we must see the thickness for 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.850
 experience I can tell you that one 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.159
 this tablet is less than half 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.649
 let's say a third of his of his 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.079
 global thickness so let's go to 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.470
 to take it apart we go to see it to assemble it 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.670
 we have to remove the little cap you see 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.369
 that this bike has not been washed 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.579
 often here are the dates how much 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.960
 dust of road debris that yes 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.350
 leads around 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.299
 and then we go to this is even more 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.010
 this with this pin is a screw with 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.780
 a head with a recessed hexagons 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.440
 Allen so to understand 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.360
 I'm going to look for the right one and the 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.940
 svitto will be a little more difficult 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.160
 why not he came quite well 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.870
 because when they are so encrusted it is done 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.700
 more difficult, however, let's say she came 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.260
 well enough to see that with the pivot e 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.520
 in very bad condition 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.380
 this is at least put to soak 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.070
 in the Swiss what kind 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.140
 because it actually encrusted parking 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.100
 but this we will provide before 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.720
 disassemble it to reassemble it for now 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.220
 let's see the pads keep in mind that 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.459
 here we are talking about a caliper 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.640
 single piston float however they are not 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.800
 all so every thrust every bike 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.220
 so its pincer its way 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.019
 we will then go to see it one by one 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.430
 during the live course we will face 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.790
 this topic now let's see 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.440
 the pills now I'm removing the 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.530
 left side than the one you see 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.410
 the less you see, there is still something to be understood 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.390
 this bastille can do judging from 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.049
 this is a game that has made 27 thousand 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.530
 kilometres 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.780
 obviously towards the end of his life 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.160
 it tends to be consumed faster though it is 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.880
 a madness that can still work 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.950
 quite well, however, I would say we keep 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.200
 eye that in two thousand three thousand kilometers 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.790
 we should take a look at it again and 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.769
 eventually replace it anyway 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.780
 we will enter the details of the plants 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.870
 braking during the live course 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.370
 held at the power bike on the 23rd of 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.370
 June 2013
