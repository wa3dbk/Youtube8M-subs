there<00:00:44.360> is<00:00:44.420> to<00:00:44.750> it<00:00:44.899> first<00:00:45.559> you<00:00:45.649> got<00:00:45.740> to<00:00:45.830> get<00:00:45.920> this

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
there is to it first you got to get this

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.430 
there is to it first you got to get this
gasket<00:00:46.400> this<00:00:46.760> base<00:00:46.970> gasket<00:00:47.480> off<00:00:47.630> you<00:00:48.170> can<00:00:48.290> take

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
gasket this base gasket off you can take

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.660 
gasket this base gasket off you can take
it<00:00:48.590> with<00:00:48.680> a<00:00:48.710> razor<00:00:48.950> blade<00:00:49.130> but<00:00:49.490> you<00:00:49.520> probably

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
it with a razor blade but you probably

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.640 
it with a razor blade but you probably
want<00:00:49.850> a<00:00:49.970> wire<00:00:50.390> wheel<00:00:50.870> it<00:00:51.080> which<00:00:51.230> is<00:00:51.350> what<00:00:51.500> I'm

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
want a wire wheel it which is what I'm

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.050 
want a wire wheel it which is what I'm
doing<00:00:52.100> now<00:00:52.510> you're<00:00:53.510> done<00:00:53.690> wire<00:00:53.990> wheeling<00:00:54.590> it

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060 
doing now you're done wire wheeling it

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.030 
doing now you're done wire wheeling it
you<00:00:56.060> can<00:00:56.270> go<00:00:56.750> to<00:00:56.840> the<00:00:56.930> piston<00:00:57.290> the<00:00:57.470> head

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
you can go to the piston the head

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.010 
you can go to the piston the head
gaskets<00:00:58.489> no<00:00:58.640> more<00:00:58.850> than<00:00:59.000> a<00:00:59.030> piece<00:00:59.300> of<00:00:59.480> aluminum

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
gaskets no more than a piece of aluminum

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.069 
gaskets no more than a piece of aluminum
I<00:01:00.820> didn't<00:01:01.820> measure<00:01:01.970> by<00:01:02.239> say<00:01:02.390> ten<00:01:02.630> thousand

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
I didn't measure by say ten thousand

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.270 
I didn't measure by say ten thousand
stick<00:01:03.350> you<00:01:03.500> could<00:01:03.620> literally<00:01:03.890> make<00:01:04.220> it

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
stick you could literally make it

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.210 
stick you could literally make it
yourself<00:01:05.229> so<00:01:06.229> once<00:01:06.380> you<00:01:06.439> got<00:01:06.530> that<00:01:06.710> barrel<00:01:07.070> off

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
yourself so once you got that barrel off

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.830 
yourself so once you got that barrel off
your<00:01:07.430> move<00:01:07.549> one<00:01:07.729> of<00:01:07.759> these<00:01:07.880> circlips<00:01:08.479> you<00:01:08.630> see

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
your move one of these circlips you see

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.609 
your move one of these circlips you see
here<00:01:09.110> remove<00:01:09.740> one<00:01:10.540> the<00:01:11.540> wrist<00:01:12.079> panel<00:01:12.409> just

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
here remove one the wrist panel just

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.569 
here remove one the wrist panel just
should<00:01:12.920> just<00:01:13.130> slide<00:01:13.369> out<00:01:14.710> clean<00:01:15.710> this<00:01:15.950> up<00:01:16.009> a

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
should just slide out clean this up a

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:19.179 
should just slide out clean this up a
little<00:01:17.360> scuffing<00:01:17.899> is<00:01:17.990> nothing<00:01:18.350> make<00:01:18.979> sure<00:01:19.100> you

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
little scuffing is nothing make sure you

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.039 
little scuffing is nothing make sure you
clean<00:01:19.429> out<00:01:19.520> those<00:01:19.729> ring<00:01:19.999> grooves<00:01:20.389> right<00:01:20.600> there

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
clean out those ring grooves right there

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.249 
clean out those ring grooves right there
so<00:01:21.979> insert<00:01:22.280> a<00:01:22.310> piston<00:01:22.759> ring<00:01:22.939> in<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:23.329> barrel

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
so insert a piston ring in the barrel

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.399 
so insert a piston ring in the barrel
and<00:01:24.439> push<00:01:24.649> it<00:01:24.770> down<00:01:24.920> with<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.130> piston<00:01:25.609> so<00:01:25.850> it's

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
and push it down with the piston so it's

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.929 
and push it down with the piston so it's
where<00:01:27.409> it<00:01:27.499> should<00:01:27.560> be<00:01:27.770> push<00:01:28.490> it<00:01:28.609> down<00:01:28.729> about

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
where it should be push it down about

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.499 
where it should be push it down about
halfway<00:01:29.409> little<00:01:30.409> lessen<00:01:30.679> halfway<00:01:31.209> okay<00:01:32.209> then

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
halfway little lessen halfway okay then

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.300 
halfway little lessen halfway okay then
you<00:01:32.749> got<00:01:33.049> the<00:01:33.259> ring<00:01:33.439> down<00:01:33.679> there<00:01:33.859> you<00:01:34.039> can<00:01:34.159> see

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
you got the ring down there you can see

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.749 
you got the ring down there you can see
that<00:01:34.340> very<00:01:35.270> small<00:01:35.899> ring<00:01:36.200> gap<00:01:36.439> which<00:01:36.709> tells<00:01:37.579> us

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
that very small ring gap which tells us

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.160 
that very small ring gap which tells us
we're<00:01:37.939> in<00:01:38.060> good<00:01:38.179> shape<00:01:38.240> I'm<00:01:38.689> not<00:01:38.840> even<00:01:39.020> going

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
we're in good shape I'm not even going

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.980 
we're in good shape I'm not even going
to<00:01:39.200> bother<00:01:39.380> to<00:01:39.619> measure<00:01:39.889> it<00:01:40.159> I<00:01:40.929> don't<00:01:41.929> know

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
to bother to measure it I don't know

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.419 
to bother to measure it I don't know
what<00:01:42.109> the<00:01:42.170> spec<00:01:42.439> is<00:01:42.590> anyhow<00:01:42.889> my<00:01:43.039> guess<00:01:43.279> is

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
what the spec is anyhow my guess is

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:45.910 
what the spec is anyhow my guess is
about<00:01:43.549> five<00:01:43.880> thousandths<00:01:44.529> see<00:01:45.529> the<00:01:45.679> little

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
about five thousandths see the little

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.639 
about five thousandths see the little
pin<00:01:46.130> there<00:01:46.369> and<00:01:46.520> there's<00:01:46.639> one<00:01:46.759> on<00:01:46.880> top<00:01:47.649> those

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
pin there and there's one on top those

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.499 
pin there and there's one on top those
pins<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:50.270> ringing<00:01:50.679> gap<00:01:51.679> goes<00:01:52.369> on<00:01:52.579> either<00:01:52.819> side

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
pins the ringing gap goes on either side

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.859 
pins the ringing gap goes on either side
of<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:54.139> pin<00:01:54.909> that<00:01:55.909> goes<00:01:55.939> for<00:01:56.299> that<00:01:56.389> little<00:01:56.659> oil

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
of the pin that goes for that little oil

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.209 
of the pin that goes for that little oil
scraper<00:01:57.289> I<00:01:57.409> showed<00:01:57.649> you<00:01:57.799> -<00:01:59.770> that's<00:02:00.770> for<00:02:01.099> the

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
scraper I showed you - that's for the

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.410 
scraper I showed you - that's for the
oil<00:02:01.729> groove<00:02:02.569> which<00:02:02.869> is<00:02:03.049> the<00:02:03.229> second<00:02:03.920> groove

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
oil groove which is the second groove

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.269 
oil groove which is the second groove
you<00:02:05.420> don't<00:02:05.599> see<00:02:05.719> that<00:02:05.869> very<00:02:05.929> often<00:02:06.349> but<00:02:07.130> you

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:07.279 
you don't see that very often but you

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:09.550 
you don't see that very often but you
put<00:02:07.459> that<00:02:07.579> in<00:02:07.789> first<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:08.929> then<00:02:09.080> put<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.380> ring

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
put that in first and then put the ring

side or the other of these rings if you

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.500 
side or the other of these rings if you
see<00:02:18.650> one<00:02:18.860> then<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.190> dot<00:02:19.400> goes<00:02:19.640> up<00:02:19.910> we<00:02:20.360> don't

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
see one then the dot goes up we don't

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.960 
see one then the dot goes up we don't
see<00:02:20.780> one<00:02:20.990> however<00:02:21.590> there<00:02:21.920> is<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:22.040> green<00:02:22.459> it

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
see one however there is a green it

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.050 
see one however there is a green it
might<00:02:23.180> show<00:02:23.390> up<00:02:23.540> here<00:02:23.780> on<00:02:24.099> that<00:02:25.099> and<00:02:25.370> I'm<00:02:25.730> just

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
might show up here on that and I'm just

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
might show up here on that and I'm just
going<00:02:26.269> to<00:02:26.299> assume

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
going to assume

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.970 
going to assume
the<00:02:27.230> green<00:02:27.470> is<00:02:27.740> for<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.040> oil<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:30.680> that's<00:02:30.890> how

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
the green is for the oil and that's how

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.940 
the green is for the oil and that's how
I'm<00:02:31.100> going<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.310> put<00:02:31.460> it<00:02:31.550> together<00:02:31.670> so<00:02:32.060> there

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
I'm going to put it together so there

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.680 
I'm going to put it together so there
and<00:02:33.950> I<00:02:34.100> can't<00:02:34.370> see<00:02:34.520> a<00:02:34.550> lick<00:02:34.820> of<00:02:34.940> difference<00:02:34.970> on

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
and I can't see a lick of difference on

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.560 
and I can't see a lick of difference on
them<00:02:36.290> so<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.470> not<00:02:36.920> sure<00:02:37.220> why<00:02:38.120> that<00:02:38.390> one<00:02:38.540> is

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
them so I not sure why that one is

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.890 
them so I not sure why that one is
marked<00:02:39.140> green<00:02:39.470> all<00:02:40.130> right<00:02:40.340> now<00:02:40.820> the<00:02:41.390> Rings<00:02:41.600> are

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
marked green all right now the Rings are

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.650 
marked green all right now the Rings are
expanded<00:02:42.560> their<00:02:42.770> you<00:02:42.980> know<00:02:43.010> loose<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:44.540> if

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
expanded their you know loose so if

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.390 
expanded their you know loose so if
you're<00:02:44.780> not<00:02:44.930> careful<00:02:45.230> it<00:02:45.620> will<00:02:45.710> rotate<00:02:45.980> right

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
you're not careful it will rotate right

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.220 
you're not careful it will rotate right
