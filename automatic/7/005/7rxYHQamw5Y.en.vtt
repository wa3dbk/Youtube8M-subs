00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:09.700
 [music] 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:13.770
 [applause] 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.770
 [music] 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.920
 friends today we take a plot on 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.360
 slope 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.450
 plot on the slope is enough 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.000
 difficult areas but with due 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.430
 approach to processing can be achieved 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.230
 very good results he is now we 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.780
 see how to develop a plot for 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.430
 laid on the northern slope it is not 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.640
 the best location is certainly better 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.769
 southern slope that put under sunset 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.230
 creates a very nice atmosphere 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.690
 but, all the same, he has 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.120
 a place to be here on it is good morning 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.309
 the sun and here are the people on through the fact that 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.469
 clean the bushes 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:54.409
 remove the vegetation layer and done 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.819
 below is the first parking for a car that 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.909
 it was possible to come and start 

00:00:55.819 --> 00:01:00.199
 develop this area but further 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:02.269
 of course have to resort 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.820
 terracing of the plot because 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.280
 such a sloping plot built a house 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.600
 very difficult to move difficult 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.850
 so the only way to do 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.870
 such a plot is comfortable 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.880
 organization of a shooting gallery 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:18.860
 here is an example of how the plot is arranged 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:25.060
 the slope of the lower barter part of the zone 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:31.820
 walks and rest further made average 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:34.010
 terrace on which the house is now 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.310
 we will go ahead and see how 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.620
 arranged looks like terrace terrace 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:43.130
 This is when you are shooting from a flat slope 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.960
 part of the land doing the ledges in this way 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.550
 so that you get a few exactly 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.550
 sites like here on this 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.480
 plot you see this here is the middle 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.010
 the level on it is the house and higher still 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.010
 where is the highest level 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.280
 the road is parking right there 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:04.400
 made them the stairs and the lowest 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.670
 the curtain part where it flows to become and 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.879
 all the water is organized drains 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.810
 and drainage wells for collecting water and 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:16.730
 water leaves the channel 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.090
 she goes on relief month 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:25.340
 laziness of the terrain down like this 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:28.340
 it is made here birch by the way very 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.109
 well help drain the area because 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.390
 that birch evaporates very large 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:35.480
 the amount of moisture through its leaves 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.519
 one birch can root system 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.260
 take moisture from a plot of 20 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:46.540
 lower terrace go middle 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:50.450
 terrace up we go up 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:54.109
 wooden steps as visible road 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.879
 fits top and in this part top 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:59.379
 parts of the plot are also organized 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:02.000
 several terraces with retaining walls about 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.700
 which planted various decorative 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.950
 plant 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.489
 descent from the top of the road section 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.400
 wanders under such a wonderful twisted 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:17.599
 the staircase that leads to the main residential 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:21.979
 zone to the middle terrace is such a staircase 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:24.430
 it is cast from reinforced concrete and have 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:24.430
 handrails 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.680
 this is the middle part of the terrace 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:43.040
 Here is a section from the road we see 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.040
 the house is located on the middle terrace and 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.590
 stairs leading down 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:57.460
 general form 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:01.950
 terraced plot here only 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.950
 yet to master 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.920
 new plot but i have no doubt that 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.349
 if you put enough effort and labor 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.180
 you will get a very beautiful section of us 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:15.030
 this is how the markup is made 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.840
 terracing will be organized 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.380
 several terraces on the plot 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.380
 on the slope 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:29.449
 thus terracing is 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:33.509
 perhaps the only way to device 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:38.639
 convenient for living and recreation area on 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:41.570
 slope we wish success building 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:47.160
 your plot 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:47.160
 [music] 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.160
 [music] 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:59.029
 by which 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.029
