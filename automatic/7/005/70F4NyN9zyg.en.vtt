00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:25.299
 a beautiful same melancholy but 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.299
 Goalkeeper criticism responded brilliantly 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.630
 we actually played coined 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.759

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.630
 analyzed it similarly pm and aptly 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.119
 because they came to the penalty room very much 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.119
 good but there was often endstation 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:52.179
 a beautiful solo run of matthias 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.179
 aebischer could the defensive bastion because 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:57.789

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.880
 free kick at the penalty area border 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:04.130

 traces the schorsch of bringing already 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.760
 Maybe that's what it's like 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.890
 I have much more specialty I can 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.390
 yes not working sometimes it will fit 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.720
 from in such a nice weather all the more 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.340
 the fc national council had slightly more 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.940
 ball possession in this balanced 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.940
 game 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.849
 in the penalty room theater here many king 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.220
 the same at the next action 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:46.019
 involved was an ingenious pass on 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:51.069
 martin schranz was the template for the 22 16 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:53.129

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.129
 points 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:02.180
 four engines different and a lot of feeling 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.180
 martin black sped the ball into 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:12.050
 2000 we are 2 1 in arrears 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.230
 and they call that a mature achievement 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.540
 that makes us very happy 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.890
 There is still something to do, I believe 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.470
 this place is not decided yet 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.480
 and we will give everything I am looking forward to 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.709
 me that we lead 2 2 1 through the 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.560
 two great goals 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.270
 but I have something to take care of 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.280
 second half we still have to 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.420
 significantly increase the victory 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.730
 can bring home 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.500
 yes, the fc national council wanted the 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.390
 balancing right after the break 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.610
 first warning shot from christian 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.290
 water fall 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:47.420
 the game remained balanced 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.420
 on both sides there was through 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.650

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.600
 to achieve the compensation 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.960

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.250
 sunk 2 to 2 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:56.610
 then the game was over and the 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.800
