that the losing youtuber would actually

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.130 
that the losing youtuber would actually
have<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.579> write<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.030> opposing<00:00:42.480> clan<00:00:42.719> name<00:00:42.960> on

decided to attack through the bottom
which<00:01:11.610> wasn't<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.119> bad<00:01:12.360> idea<00:01:12.689> but<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.619> thing<00:01:13.799> is

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.350 
which wasn't a bad idea but the thing is
with<00:01:14.010> his<00:01:14.130> golems<00:01:14.580> are<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.880> they<00:01:14.970> got<00:01:15.090> to

shooting those buildings since they

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.490 
shooting those buildings since they
weren't<00:01:21.600> taken<00:01:21.930> care<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.350> beginning

castle troops my skeleton traps and
let's<00:01:29.040> go<00:01:29.159> ahead<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.400> see<00:01:29.549> how<00:01:29.880> he's<00:01:30.030> gonna<00:01:30.119> be

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
let's go ahead and see how he's gonna be

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.880 
let's go ahead and see how he's gonna be
able<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.509> wrap<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.869> up<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.500> looks<00:01:31.710> like

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
able to wrap this up so it looks like

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.130 
able to wrap this up so it looks like
the<00:01:32.040> king<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.460> going<00:01:32.790> down<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.299> he<00:01:33.479> only<00:01:33.750> has

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
the king is going down and he only has

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.740 
the king is going down and he only has
the<00:01:34.320> Queen<00:01:34.650> left<00:01:35.100> but<00:01:35.759> unfortunately<00:01:36.540> his

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
the Queen left but unfortunately his

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.480 
the Queen left but unfortunately his
Queen<00:01:37.020> was<00:01:37.290> smart<00:01:37.590> enough<00:01:37.680> not<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.009> shoot<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
Queen was smart enough not to shoot the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.179 
Queen was smart enough not to shoot the
wall<00:01:38.729> which<00:01:39.030> seems<00:01:39.960> never<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.350> be<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.950> case

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
wall which seems never to be the case

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.280 
wall which seems never to be the case
with<00:01:41.400> my<00:01:41.610> queen<00:01:41.970> but<00:01:42.210> he<00:01:42.360> shot<00:01:42.570> down<00:01:42.630> my<00:01:43.020> town

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
with my queen but he shot down my town

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.410 
with my queen but he shot down my town
hall<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.649> he<00:01:44.250> did<00:01:44.460> have<00:01:44.610> four<00:01:44.850> wizards<00:01:45.060> left

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
hall and he did have four wizards left

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.520 
hall and he did have four wizards left
which<00:01:45.630> definitely<00:01:45.930> could<00:01:46.140> have<00:01:46.170> turned<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
which definitely could have turned the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.080 
which definitely could have turned the
tide<00:01:46.560> just<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.009> little<00:01:47.250> bit<00:01:47.399> but<00:01:47.579> he<00:01:47.700> held<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:48.060> to

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
tide just a little bit but he held on to

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.120 
tide just a little bit but he held on to
those<00:01:48.299> until<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.049> very<00:01:49.200> end<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.619> he<00:01:49.740> decided

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
those until the very end and he decided

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.730 
those until the very end and he decided
dropping<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.909> decided<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.570> drop<00:01:51.780> those<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
dropping to decided to drop those on the

dropping to decided to drop those on the
very<00:01:52.920> top<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.250> base<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.579> see<00:01:53.729> if<00:01:53.759> he<00:01:53.909> could

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
very top of the base to see if he could

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.660 
very top of the base to see if he could
get<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.299> 50<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:55.079> overall<00:01:55.350> only<00:01:55.829> one<00:01:56.070> star<00:01:56.399> and

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
get to 50 so overall only one star and

get to 50 so overall only one star and
in<00:01:56.759> general<00:01:56.939> inside<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.479> our<00:01:57.570> clan<00:01:57.810> if<00:01:57.960> your

in general inside of our clan if your

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.899 
in general inside of our clan if your
base<00:01:58.259> gets<00:01:58.560> one<00:01:58.770> star<00:01:59.040> that's<00:01:59.250> seen<00:01:59.490> as<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.670> too

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
base gets one star that's seen as a too

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.850 
base gets one star that's seen as a too
worried<00:02:00.119> about<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:01.170> was<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> pretty

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
worried about that and it was a pretty

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.770 
worried about that and it was a pretty
solid<00:02:02.130> attack<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.520> think<00:02:02.670> he'd<00:02:03.000> put<00:02:03.420> his<00:02:03.450> goals

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
solid attack I think he'd put his goals

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.940 
solid attack I think he'd put his goals
a<00:02:03.930> little<00:02:04.079> bit<00:02:04.170> farther<00:02:04.350> outside<00:02:04.560> he<00:02:04.860> would

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
a little bit farther outside he would

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.200 
a little bit farther outside he would
have<00:02:05.040> been<00:02:05.130> able<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.340> get<00:02:05.490> two<00:02:05.670> stars<00:02:05.909> when<00:02:06.119> we

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
have been able to get two stars when we

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.520 
have been able to get two stars when we
couldn't<00:02:06.360> show<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.630> guys<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.990> attack<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.380> had

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
base I actually took a pretty good long

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.450 
base I actually took a pretty good long
look<00:02:12.810> at<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.170> didn't

the<00:02:20.390> buildings<00:02:20.600> on<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:20.960> top<00:02:21.110> of<00:02:21.260> his<00:02:21.380> base

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
the buildings on the top of his base

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.230 
the buildings on the top of his base
were<00:02:21.800> outside<00:02:22.250> of<00:02:22.370> any<00:02:22.520> of<00:02:22.670> his<00:02:22.760> defenses

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
were outside of any of his defenses

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.820 
were outside of any of his defenses
range<00:02:23.510> i<00:02:23.750> knew<00:02:24.170> i<00:02:24.200> was<00:02:24.320> going<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.500> be<00:02:24.590> able<00:02:24.680> to

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
range i knew i was going to be able to

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.620 
range i knew i was going to be able to
get<00:02:24.950> probably<00:02:25.250> a<00:02:25.370> free<00:02:25.610> six<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.060> ten<00:02:26.270> percent

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
get probably a free six to ten percent

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.780 
get probably a free six to ten percent
just<00:02:26.960> using<00:02:27.260> those<00:02:27.350> archers<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:28.010> because<00:02:28.760> of

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
just using those archers and because of

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.490 
just using those archers and because of
that<00:02:28.940> i<00:02:29.270> knew<00:02:29.540> i<00:02:29.570> was<00:02:29.750> pretty<00:02:29.960> much<00:02:30.110> free<00:02:30.380> to

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
that i knew i was pretty much free to

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.780 
that i knew i was pretty much free to
just<00:02:30.650> go<00:02:30.800> straight<00:02:31.070> to<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.220> town<00:02:31.490> hall<00:02:31.730> and

just go straight to the town hall and

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.490 
just go straight to the town hall and
worst<00:02:32.330> case<00:02:32.570> i<00:02:32.810> would<00:02:32.930> be<00:02:33.020> able<00:02:33.080> to<00:02:33.230> get<00:02:33.350> two

face but I did drop one of my free

spells instead of my lightning spell
which<00:03:05.930> sort<00:03:06.140> of<00:03:06.200> cost<00:03:06.380> me<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:06.770> he<00:03:07.130> had<00:03:07.280> this

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
they brought it back to 10 and then in

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.960 
they brought it back to 10 and then in
the<00:04:08.750> end<00:04:08.780> 71<00:04:09.410> 257<00:04:10.070> so<00:04:10.730> a<00:04:10.760> 14<00:04:11.240> *<00:04:11.510> victory<00:04:11.930> we<00:04:12.260> used

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
the end 71 257 so a 14 * victory we used

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.910 
the end 71 257 so a 14 * victory we used
65<00:04:13.970> attacks<00:04:14.270> they<00:04:14.510> use<00:04:14.720> 70<00:04:15.200> average

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
65 attacks they use 70 average

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.140 
65 attacks they use 70 average
