rip that bandage right off which is

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.169 
rip that bandage right off which is
probably<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.500> best<00:00:13.799> thing<00:00:13.889> Spectre<00:00:14.820> armor

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
probably the best thing Spectre armor

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.150 
probably the best thing Spectre armor
has<00:00:15.330> lost<00:00:15.570> 8<00:00:15.809> defense<00:00:16.289> in<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.560> process<00:00:16.920> making

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
you a somewhat more squishy mage which

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.470 
you a somewhat more squishy mage which
can<00:00:19.740> be<00:00:19.830> quite<00:00:20.160> annoying<00:00:20.580> but<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.029> defense<00:00:21.180> of

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
can be quite annoying but in defense of

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.300 
can be quite annoying but in defense of
the<00:00:21.630> nerve<00:00:21.869> issues<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.769> still<00:00:22.800> have<00:00:23.220> to

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
you back up they didn't take five

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.460 
you back up they didn't take five
percent<00:00:27.359> from<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.599> healing<00:00:27.960> they<00:00:28.080> simply

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
percent from the healing they simply

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.689 
percent from the healing they simply
made<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:28.949> every<00:00:29.400> time<00:00:29.550> your

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
made it so that every time your

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.849 
made it so that every time your
projectile<00:00:30.269> hits<00:00:30.539> after<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:31.410> first<00:00:31.650> hit

projectile hits after the first hit

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.479 
projectile hits after the first hit
it'll<00:00:32.430> heal<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.759> less<00:00:33.230> which<00:00:34.230> makes<00:00:34.469> sense<00:00:34.680> so

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
it'll heal you less which makes sense so

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.830 
it'll heal you less which makes sense so
you're<00:00:35.640> still<00:00:35.880> be<00:00:35.969> getting<00:00:36.239> full<00:00:36.420> heels<00:00:36.660> on

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
you're still be getting full heels on

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.810 
you're still be getting full heels on
the<00:00:36.960> first<00:00:37.200> projectile<00:00:37.739> at<00:00:37.860> least<00:00:38.070> they<00:00:38.700> also

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
the first projectile at least they also

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.000 
the first projectile at least they also
lowered<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.329> fence<00:00:39.510> on<00:00:39.660> turtle<00:00:40.079> armour<00:00:40.440> from

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
lowered the fence on turtle armour from

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.869 
lowered the fence on turtle armour from
71<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.840> 65<00:00:42.840> which<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.770> all<00:00:43.890> honesty<00:00:44.460> matters

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
71 to 65 which in all honesty matters

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.970 
71 to 65 which in all honesty matters
little<00:00:45.120> but<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.570> can<00:00:45.899> come<00:00:46.170> back<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.680> bite<00:00:46.800> you

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
little but it can come back to bite you

little but it can come back to bite you

NASA bait seeing as they changed the

was<00:00:52.860> lowered<00:00:53.160> slightly<00:00:53.610> now<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.120> can<00:00:54.239> still

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
was lowered slightly now you can still

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.479 
was lowered slightly now you can still
easily<00:00:54.719> cut<00:00:55.140> down<00:00:55.350> hordes<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.890> moms<00:00:56.160> with<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
easily cut down hordes of moms with the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.400 
easily cut down hordes of moms with the
vampire<00:00:56.850> knives<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.329> we<00:00:57.750> had<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.140> see<00:00:58.320> it

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
vampire knives and we had to see it

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.439 
vampire knives and we had to see it
coming<00:00:58.620> knives<00:00:59.609> were<00:00:59.820> pretty<00:01:00.120> out<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.329> control

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
coming knives were pretty out of control

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.380 
coming knives were pretty out of control
and<00:01:00.899> now<00:01:01.109> they're<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> teensy<00:01:02.070> bit<00:01:02.250> less<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.760> so

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
and now they're a teensy bit less so so

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.570 
and now they're a teensy bit less so so
it<00:01:03.539> wasn't<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.080> big<00:01:04.229> deal<00:01:04.290> really<00:01:04.739> people<00:01:05.430> were

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
it wasn't a big deal really people were

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.160 
it wasn't a big deal really people were
getting<00:01:05.880> really<00:01:06.119> afraid<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.810> vampire

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
getting really afraid that the vampire

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.200 
getting really afraid that the vampire
knives<00:01:07.560> would<00:01:07.799> just<00:01:07.979> be<00:01:08.100> terrible<00:01:08.700> after<00:01:09.030> this

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
knives would just be terrible after this

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.020 
knives would just be terrible after this
but<00:01:09.450> they're<00:01:09.630> still<00:01:09.750> super<00:01:10.560> viable<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.790> spawn

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
but they're still super viable the spawn

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.880 
but they're still super viable the spawn
chance<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.510> dungeon<00:01:12.840> spirits<00:01:13.170> has<00:01:13.380> also<00:01:13.650> been

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
chance of dungeon spirits has also been

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.590 
chance of dungeon spirits has also been
lowered<00:01:14.220> making<00:01:14.549> expect<00:01:14.909> her<00:01:15.000> armor<00:01:15.299> harder

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
lowered making expect her armor harder

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.510 
lowered making expect her armor harder
to<00:01:15.750> get<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> good<00:01:16.799> change<00:01:17.070> because<00:01:17.400> it

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
to get this is a good change because it

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.370 
to get this is a good change because it
was<00:01:17.670> by<00:01:17.820> far<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.150> easiest<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.960> endgame

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
was by far the easiest of the endgame

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.490 
was by far the easiest of the endgame
arms<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.860> get<00:01:20.360> like<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.540> was<00:01:21.659> almost<00:01:21.869> trivial

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
arms to get like it was almost trivial

arms to get like it was almost trivial

the chance for an eclipse to happen has
now<00:01:31.049> been<00:01:31.380> up<00:01:31.560> slightly<00:01:31.829> but<00:01:32.310> only<00:01:32.610> after<00:01:32.759> you

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
now been up slightly but only after you

kill one of the mechanical bosses and

kill one of the mechanical bosses and
this<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.490> quite<00:01:35.700> an<00:01:35.820> interesting<00:01:36.119> change<00:01:36.509> hard

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140

ray<00:04:34.530> will<00:04:34.740> no<00:04:34.950> longer<00:04:34.980> happen<00:04:35.639> as<00:04:35.790> you'll

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
ray will no longer happen as you'll

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.150 
ray will no longer happen as you'll
simply<00:04:36.180> run<00:04:36.540> out<00:04:36.570> of<00:04:36.780> mana<00:04:36.980> so<00:04:37.980> it's

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
simply run out of mana so it's

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.879 
simply run out of mana so it's
definitely<00:04:38.940> less<00:04:39.240> useful<00:04:39.540> now<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:40.500> leaf<00:04:40.680> can

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
definitely less useful now the leaf can

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.620 
definitely less useful now the leaf can
also<00:04:41.100> actually<00:04:41.400> takes<00:04:41.790> formatted<00:04:42.330> to<00:04:42.450> fire

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
also actually takes formatted to fire

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.450 
also actually takes formatted to fire
now<00:04:42.810> but<00:04:43.050> in<00:04:43.169> all<00:04:43.380> honesty<00:04:43.889> you<00:04:43.919> can<00:04:44.130> easily

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
now but in all honesty you can easily

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.340 
now but in all honesty you can easily
keep<00:04:44.820> your<00:04:45.030> mana<00:04:45.210> pool<00:04:45.330> in<00:04:45.540> shape<00:04:45.810> if<00:04:46.020> you're

you can spam a lot of shots before you

you can spam a lot of shots before you

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
even go near exhausting your mana pool

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.470 
even go near exhausting your mana pool
and<00:04:55.440> you<00:04:56.250> can<00:04:56.370> now<00:04:56.490> finally<00:04:56.790> attack<00:04:57.180> the<00:04:57.300> cloth
