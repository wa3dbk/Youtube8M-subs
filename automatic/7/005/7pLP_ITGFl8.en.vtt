00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 we created a good day another stage of our 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.230
 walk and and santiago 11 to inss more 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.940
 Write a Review 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.370
 now with the participation of the friend joÃ£o 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.110
 good antino as combined I stayed that 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.410
 comment on the first question our 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.330
 side and today's theme is no 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.430
 fell in the bidding for 2012 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.010
 the cameras are 2013 for analyst 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.539
 So I think it's wise to study this. 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.180
 since we are studying with a 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.189
 certain advance bidding contract is 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.590
 the potential theme for our test the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.630
 good being brief and objective for 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.820
 solve our issue 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.730
 This is a traditional issue. 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.480
 at least severe 5 6 times 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.969
 any less 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.930
 good I have a value of a work of 10 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.129
 one thousand reais 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.770
 the first thing I have to think about 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.719
 a city hall carrying out a work of 10 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.579
 thousand reais in small amount 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.390
 So you have to at the time of the test 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.460
 think and analyze whether this is a 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.460
 case of waiver of bidding 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.500
 if you are Article 24 subsection in our 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.660
 law of bids contracts you go 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.080
 realize that the bidding there is 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.840
 for the contracting of works and 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.020
 engineering of up to 15 thousand reais 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.170
 that is, I am within that limit being 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.140
 so the administration has two options or 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.860
 she makes a bid or she hires 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.869
 layoff since the bidding waived 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.860
 depends on the convenience analysis of the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.020
 administration 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.530
 the administrator is going to decide the 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.110
 beauty of face has already been eliminate all 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.890
 alternatives that talks about should tender 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.950
 is not free is you bidding is 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.590
 dispensable then licit if I want 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.110
 I was good and I want to quote you 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.890
 What is the most 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.930
 proper 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.509
 Then I'll have to get Article 23 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.430
 subsection 1 of the law 8 666 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.860
 What does this device do for us? 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.649
 for the contracting of works and engineering 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.700
 and up to 150 thousand reais 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.680
 the most appropriate modality is the invitation 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.950
 then you conjugate with Article 23 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.979
 paragraph 4 and you will realize that I can 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.270
 visit the price-conscious invitation or 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.450
 competition 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.849
 So this is our tip today and the 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.970
 bidding can be dispensed with. 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.370
 carried out by invitation pp or a 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.030
 Start a hug, guys, to our 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.030
 next day
