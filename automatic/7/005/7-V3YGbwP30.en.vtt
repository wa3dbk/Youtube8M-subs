00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.660
 good the movie is a very project 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.059
 simply complex 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.680
 There is much to talk about because it also 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.380
 it means many things 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.410
 after 30 movies that I've done in 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.560
 30 feature films 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.560
 and this movie that is like under 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.820
 budget let's say it like that 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.420
 the fact of having scarce resources and 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.220
 has schuster and that led to how to 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.100
 translate the project into a proposal 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.879
 aesthetics yes 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.559
 since the script was written alonso 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.510
 everyone and Carlos Moreno who are the 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.579
 screenwriters thought a lot about the actors 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.430
 that these actors would have had a 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.890
 experience in a dramaturgical process 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.890
 in a creative process and that is 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.140
 coming back as a collective creation 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.439
 being the script very well written as 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.799
 the actors remain very involved 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.009
 of that process of that trip that there is of 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.899
 literary pretext that is the script to 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:23.130
 photographic text so it's the movie 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:25.140
 then for me that I have a training 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.229
 theatrical or that the study was a lot of drama 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:34.740
 dramatic art I'm too expressive 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:38.310
 gestural movement have much much 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.240
 kinesis and that for the cinema is a bit 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:46.620
 complicated this movie took me to 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.980
 do as very austere 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:54.170
 in the handling of the gestuality a 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:57.300
 character that is very still very dull 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.720
 peasant that everything you tell as with 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:06.290
 the heart and its look 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:11.590
 which is also disc precisely by the 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:15.400
 world so complicated that it touches him and how 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.930
 a subject as complicated as is the 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.400
 violence as in the position of 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.769
 dead 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.930
 Carlos Moreno, with his humility and 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:28.060
 wisdom 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:32.730
 leads to take the aesthetic appeal of 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:36.480
 theatrical elements elements 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.750
 as tragi-comic of realistic elements 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.580
 of elements of the absurd if it is a 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.860
 movie that I up to this moment the 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.209
 protagonist can already know what he 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:52.230
 belongs but it 's that search with a 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:55.860
 so raw issue with so much dead take it 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:01.760
 that aesthetic artistic level that 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:05.459
 come back happy and that it becomes the 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.620
 fundamental purpose of art in 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.459
 words of berto break that is the 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:15.390
 funny then he has very things 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:19.349
 very complex pleasures besides the 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.959
 photography that's why he had a prize 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.530
 photography at the sundance festival is 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.300
 that with natural light 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.600
 that when I thought that was more 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.330
 easy it is more complicated to maintain 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.810
 continuity then it 's a very team 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.120
 I like the same actors that all 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.410
 we had done theater we had had 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.500
 experiences within the language 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.440
 cinematographic and we had the freedom 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.489
 of the proposal that made us Carlos 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:53.360
 Moreno is very clear in his 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:56.950
 intentions but it gives us a lot of freedom 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.470
 as for going to run 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.470
 the character is how I say you have things 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.569
 very pleasant has become very universal I 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.690
 I had opportunity to say many 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:10.540
 trips to holland probes and in all 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.569
 parties has given me that this story 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.460
 of the bunch of dead is not only 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.430
 In colombia 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.830
 the referents that assume the different 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.280
 cultures let's say of your state in europe 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:26.550
 In U.S.A 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.310
 they account for the interventions that 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.880
 this is something through the history of 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.620
 humanity in the world war 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.310
 then conflict a set this 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.300
 there were mountains of dead recently 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:46.080
 in the war in Libya all these countries 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:49.050
 Arab mountains of dead in all that 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.320
 life there have been mountains of the dead and 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.310
 then everywhere there is a way 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.470
 to see 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.230
 and how to live those circumstances 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.750
 are so complex that in the case of 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:09.400
 savior that the protagonist as well as 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:12.970
 that remains and unruly to the horror good the 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.190
 his character was diverted to work the 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:19.180
 land and you come across a lot of 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:22.690
 corpses and from that what is 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:25.450
 he said something so tragic arises all 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:28.180
 that comedy where nobody wants 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:31.810
 make responsible for the dead that you 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:35.350
 we have to wait a day because it's Sunday and 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.900
 it touches him and in a lot of things that 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:40.900
 how closely they resemble the reality of 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.150
 colombia that can go so far 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.530
 or it has happened and that a farmer 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.640
 raise a day consider a lot of 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:52.290
 dead and nothing gallup 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:52.290
 do not pigeon regions that happened 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.940
 the actual starting point 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.700
 that is to say Carlos Moreno and Alonso Torres 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:05.340
 which is very paradoxical we are 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.569
 administrator of a rumba place 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.960
 in Cali 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:11.879
 which is called the Cuban winery keep 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.430
 that the rumba keeps the alcohol but 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:17.970
 do not drink 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:21.060
 the musical heart but he does not like the 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:23.510
 liquor he likes literature he likes 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:27.030
 write and is passionate about cinema 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:30.390
 in this context they learn of a 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:33.180
 journalist who comes to comment on this 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:36.540
 case who were originally 12 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.520
 dead yes it is day before the 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.610
 election appeared in a village and in the 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.310
 north of the valley the mayor when that 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:47.340
 pod order to move to another place 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:50.010
 the current candidate for directives of the 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.980
 village was also in four villages 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:56.730
 different nations those corpses 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:58.990
 and in the end eight appeared in a 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:03.310
 army battalion 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:06.160
 already when the human rights committee 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:08.080
 international because it took to life from 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.810
 many parties and they started doing the 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.450
 follow up and if we find many 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:16.720
 dead then this story with the 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:18.449
 indolence that entails therefore what 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:22.110
 I these 

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:23.990
 authors and Carlos to tell us with this 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:28.400
 we have to do something 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:30.770
 it's like with this crudeness to translate it to a 

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.800
 aesthetic fact is what most calls me the 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.800
 Attention
