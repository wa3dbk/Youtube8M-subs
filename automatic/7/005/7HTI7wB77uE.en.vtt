00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
made this this students presentation she

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.530 
made this this students presentation she
did<00:02:11.879> because<00:02:12.270> she<00:02:12.450> was<00:02:12.750> going<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.050> use<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
did because she was going to use the

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.589 
did because she was going to use the
and<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:15.129> she<00:02:15.159> made<00:02:15.489> a<00:02:15.519> bunch<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.909> papers<00:02:16.569> that

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
and so she made a bunch of papers that

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.770 
and so she made a bunch of papers that
were<00:02:16.989> written<00:02:17.170> in<00:02:17.439> black<00:02:17.739> ink<00:02:18.069> and<00:02:18.750> when<00:02:19.750> I

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
were written in black ink and when I

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.869 
were written in black ink and when I
showed<00:02:20.079> her<00:02:20.290> this<00:02:20.500> particular<00:02:21.099> item<00:02:21.640> it

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
showed her this particular item it

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.330 
showed her this particular item it
actually<00:02:22.299> became<00:02:22.680> something<00:02:23.680> she<00:02:23.950> was<00:02:24.099> more

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
actually became something she was more

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.830 
actually became something she was more
interested<00:02:24.640> in<00:02:24.969> because<00:02:25.299> she<00:02:25.420> wanted<00:02:25.599> to<00:02:25.659> do

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
interested in because she wanted to do

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.399 
interested in because she wanted to do
multiple<00:02:26.079> examples<00:02:27.870> let's<00:02:28.870> go<00:02:29.079> to<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.260> next

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
multiple examples let's go to the next

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:34.800 
multiple examples let's go to the next
slide<00:02:29.560> I<00:02:33.180> thought<00:02:34.180> I'd<00:02:34.329> start<00:02:34.599> with<00:02:34.689> a

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
slide I thought I'd start with a

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.780 
slide I thought I'd start with a
screenshot<00:02:35.260> of<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.890> working<00:02:36.280> palette<00:02:36.670> that

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
screenshot of the working palette that

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.000 
screenshot of the working palette that
you<00:02:36.939> have<00:02:37.150> when<00:02:37.450> you<00:02:37.540> come<00:02:37.780> in<00:02:37.959> after<00:02:38.349> you

continue to add video audio to what i'm
doing<00:03:13.900> on<00:03:14.079> my<00:03:14.470> annotation<00:03:15.400> page<00:03:15.669> for<00:03:16.389> each

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
doing on my annotation page for each

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.990 
doing on my annotation page for each
slide<00:03:17.040> this<00:03:18.040> is<00:03:18.250> pretty<00:03:18.489> much<00:03:18.579> all<00:03:18.879> the

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
slide this is pretty much all the

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.699 
slide this is pretty much all the
different<00:03:19.359> kind<00:03:19.540> of<00:03:19.599> export<00:03:20.109> choices<00:03:20.560> you

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
different kind of export choices you

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.649 
different kind of export choices you
have<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:21.190> of<00:03:21.669> course<00:03:21.699> the<00:03:22.060> home<00:03:22.209> button<00:03:22.449> to

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:22.659

have and of course the home button to
get<00:03:22.810> back<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.229> where<00:03:23.440> we<00:03:23.650> were<00:03:23.680> when<00:03:24.069> we<00:03:24.099> began

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
get back to where we were when we began

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.270 
get back to where we were when we began
on<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.250> next<00:03:28.000> slide<00:03:28.540> i'm<00:03:28.989> going<00:03:29.109> to<00:03:29.169> use<00:03:29.680> this

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
on the next slide i'm going to use this

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.369 
on the next slide i'm going to use this
it's<00:03:30.639> actually<00:03:30.940> going<00:03:31.060> to<00:03:31.150> be<00:03:31.180> blown<00:03:31.479> up<00:03:31.510> i'm

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
it's actually going to be blown up i'm

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:33.899 
it's actually going to be blown up i'm
going<00:03:32.470> to<00:03:32.650> have<00:03:32.829> this<00:03:33.010> in<00:03:33.190> my<00:03:33.220> far<00:03:33.639> background

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
going to have this in my far background

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.659 
going to have this in my far background
so<00:03:34.840> that<00:03:34.870> you<00:03:35.049> can<00:03:35.229> see<00:03:35.530> what<00:03:35.859> these<00:03:36.099> different

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:36.669 
so that you can see what these different

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.059 
so that you can see what these different
tools<00:03:36.909> will<00:03:37.209> actually<00:03:37.599> do<00:03:37.810> for<00:03:38.079> you<00:03:38.199> that<00:03:38.829> give

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
tools will actually do for you that give

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.099 
tools will actually do for you that give
you<00:03:39.220> more<00:03:39.459> flexibility<00:03:40.120> than<00:03:40.239> show<00:03:40.720> me<00:03:40.930> or

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
you more flexibility than show me or

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.479 
you more flexibility than show me or
screenshot<00:03:43.799> okay<00:03:44.799> so<00:03:44.859> I<00:03:45.040> thought<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.459> best

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
screenshot okay so I thought the best

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.219 
screenshot okay so I thought the best
way<00:03:45.819> to<00:03:45.970> demonstrate<00:03:46.239> this<00:03:46.840> would<00:03:47.079> be

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:47.229 
way to demonstrate this would be

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:50.099 
way to demonstrate this would be
actually<00:03:47.470> to<00:03:47.889> use<00:03:48.099> the<00:03:48.940> explain<00:03:49.720> everything

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
actually to use the explain everything

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.610 
actually to use the explain everything
app<00:03:50.440> at<00:03:50.979> the<00:03:51.099> same<00:03:51.340> time<00:03:51.609> and<00:03:51.940> so<00:03:52.810> what<00:03:53.530> I'm

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
app at the same time and so what I'm

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.309 
app at the same time and so what I'm
going<00:03:53.739> to<00:03:53.799> do<00:03:53.949> is<00:03:54.220> I<00:03:54.629> went<00:03:55.629> in<00:03:55.780> and<00:03:55.870> I<00:03:56.019> cropped

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
going to do is I went in and I cropped

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.890 
going to do is I went in and I cropped
and<00:03:56.560> you<00:03:56.680> can<00:03:56.829> see<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.040> cropping<00:03:57.370> tool<00:03:57.549> is<00:03:57.900> so

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
and you can see the cropping tool is so

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.080 
and you can see the cropping tool is so
poor<00:03:59.769> compared<00:04:00.310> to<00:04:00.370> everything<00:04:00.579> else<00:04:00.790> this

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
poor compared to everything else this

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.679 
poor compared to everything else this
app<00:04:01.449> has<00:04:01.769> but<00:04:02.769> this<00:04:03.430> app<00:04:03.790> does<00:04:03.819> have<00:04:04.329> a<00:04:04.389> slide

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:04.689 
app has but this app does have a slide

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:08.219 
app has but this app does have a slide
sorter<00:04:05.019> just<00:04:05.409> like<00:04:05.590> in<00:04:05.739> a<00:04:05.799> PowerPoint<00:04:06.510> you<00:04:07.510> see

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:08.229 
sorter just like in a PowerPoint you see

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:09.990 
sorter just like in a PowerPoint you see
