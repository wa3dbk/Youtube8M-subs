lady<00:01:28.170> at<00:01:28.320> Sally's<00:01:28.740> actually<00:01:29.130> told<00:01:29.310> me<00:01:29.490> that

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
lady at Sally's actually told me that

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.850 
lady at Sally's actually told me that
cream<00:01:30.540> would<00:01:30.689> be<00:01:30.750> better<00:01:31.110> because<00:01:31.380> would<00:01:31.710> be<00:01:31.829> a

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
cream would be better because would be a

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.249 
cream would be better because would be a
thicker<00:01:32.130> consistency<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:33.240> easier<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.689> apply

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
thicker consistency and easier to apply

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.740 
thicker consistency and easier to apply
and<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.799> wouldn't<00:01:35.130> drip<00:01:35.520> as<00:01:35.729> much<00:01:36.030> as<00:01:36.240> maybe<00:01:36.630> a

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
and it wouldn't drip as much as maybe a

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.569 
and it wouldn't drip as much as maybe a
liquid<00:01:37.110> would<00:01:37.290> I'm<00:01:37.770> not<00:01:37.890> sure<00:01:38.040> if<00:01:38.100> that's<00:01:38.250> true

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
liquid would I'm not sure if that's true

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.800 
liquid would I'm not sure if that's true
but<00:01:38.909> that's<00:01:39.630> what<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:39.960> ended<00:01:40.140> up<00:01:40.259> using<00:01:41.689> next<00:01:42.689> i

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
but that's what I ended up using next i

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.639 
but that's what I ended up using next i
poured<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.290> three<00:01:43.560> scoops<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.610> powder

Lightner halfway through doing my hair I

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.569 
Lightner halfway through doing my hair I
ended<00:01:49.590> up<00:01:49.649> having<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:50.040> do<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.340> all<00:01:50.520> over

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
ended up having to do this all over

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.280 
ended up having to do this all over
again<00:01:50.909> because<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.420> wasn't<00:01:51.750> enough<00:01:51.990> but

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
again because it wasn't enough but

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.840 
again because it wasn't enough but
anyways<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.770> started<00:01:53.100> off<00:01:53.189> with<00:01:53.340> three<00:01:53.579> scoops

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
anyways I started off with three scoops

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:03.760 
anyways I started off with three scoops
of<00:01:54.149> powder<00:01:55.049> lightener

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.590 

you

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.650 

and<00:02:08.229> then<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:09.220> poured<00:02:09.910> in<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.680> cream<00:02:11.680> developer

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
and then I poured in the cream developer

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.260 
and then I poured in the cream developer
and<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:14.680> basically<00:02:15.100> just<00:02:15.220> poured<00:02:15.790> in<00:02:15.910> a<00:02:16.000> little

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
and I basically just poured in a little

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.780 
and I basically just poured in a little
bit<00:02:16.360> at<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.510> time<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:17.740> then<00:02:17.860> mixed<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.610> then

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
bit at a time and then mixed it and then

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.520 
bit at a time and then mixed it and then
poured<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.270> little<00:02:19.480> more<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:20.050> then<00:02:20.170> mixed

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
poured it a little more and then mixed

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.770 
poured it a little more and then mixed
it<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:20.920> import<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.400> a<00:02:21.459> little<00:02:21.670> more<00:02:21.910> until<00:02:22.750> I

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
it and import it a little more until I

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.660 
it and import it a little more until I
got<00:02:23.020> a<00:02:23.320> nice<00:02:23.680> creamy<00:02:24.220> thick<00:02:24.850> consistency<00:02:25.840> um

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
got a nice creamy thick consistency um

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.130 
got a nice creamy thick consistency um
since<00:02:27.670> I'm<00:02:28.030> using<00:02:28.570> cream<00:02:29.080> rather<00:02:29.740> than<00:02:30.130> liquid

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
since I'm using cream rather than liquid

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.650 
since I'm using cream rather than liquid
like<00:02:32.140> I<00:02:32.260> said<00:02:32.500> um<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:33.340> might<00:02:33.970> be<00:02:34.209> a<00:02:34.240> little

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
like I said um it might be a little

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.230 
like I said um it might be a little
thicker<00:02:35.200> than<00:02:35.350> maybe<00:02:36.010> if<00:02:36.160> you<00:02:36.280> had<00:02:36.459> used<00:02:36.790> a

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
thicker than maybe if you had used a

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.720 
thicker than maybe if you had used a
liquid<00:02:38.020> developer<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:40.480> yeah<00:02:40.660> I<00:02:40.690> waited<00:02:41.290> until

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
liquid developer so yeah I waited until

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.620 
liquid developer so yeah I waited until
it<00:02:42.730> got<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.510> be<00:02:43.890> nice<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.250> creamy<00:02:45.850> so<00:02:46.420> now<00:02:46.570> that

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
it got to be nice and creamy so now that

started<00:04:50.270> doing<00:04:50.449> the<00:04:50.690> same<00:04:50.720> thing<00:04:51.199> all<00:04:51.470> over

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
started doing the same thing all over

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.459 
started doing the same thing all over
again<00:04:51.860> just<00:04:52.310> basically<00:04:53.300> apply<00:04:53.840> a<00:04:53.870> little<00:04:54.349> bit

00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:54.469 
again just basically apply a little bit

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:56.709 
again just basically apply a little bit
of<00:04:54.710> bleach<00:04:55.009> with<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.610> brush<00:04:55.879> and<00:04:56.210> then<00:04:56.509> move

00:04:56.709 --> 00:04:56.719 
of bleach with the brush and then move

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:58.839 
of bleach with the brush and then move
it<00:04:56.840> through<00:04:57.020> with<00:04:57.139> my<00:04:57.289> hands<00:04:57.770> and<00:04:57.919> apply<00:04:58.490> a

00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:58.849 
it through with my hands and apply a

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:06.740 
it through with my hands and apply a
little<00:04:59.509> more<00:04:59.659> bleach<00:05:00.139> with<00:05:01.099> the<00:05:01.610> brush

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.070 

as<00:05:07.740> you<00:05:07.980> can<00:05:08.100> see<00:05:08.310> I<00:05:08.340> put<00:05:08.820> up<00:05:09.000> that<00:05:09.360> side<00:05:09.690> in

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
as you can see I put up that side in

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.490 
as you can see I put up that side in
foil<00:05:10.650> which<00:05:11.100> I<00:05:11.310> shouldn't<00:05:11.820> have<00:05:11.940> done<00:05:12.500> and

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
foil which I shouldn't have done and

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.040 
foil which I shouldn't have done and
you'll<00:05:13.680> see<00:05:13.920> why<00:05:14.100> later<00:05:14.310> anyways<00:05:15.270> so<00:05:15.720> I<00:05:15.750> got

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
you'll see why later anyways so I got

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.560 
you'll see why later anyways so I got
started<00:05:16.380> with<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:17.130> left-hand<00:05:17.790> side<00:05:18.030> and<00:05:18.390> did

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
started with the left-hand side and did

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.120 
started with the left-hand side and did
the<00:05:18.750> same<00:05:18.960> thing<00:05:19.020> all<00:05:19.470> over<00:05:19.500> again

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
the same thing all over again

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.410 
the same thing all over again
actually<00:05:20.610> I'll<00:05:20.730> just<00:05:20.760> tell<00:05:21.060> you<00:05:21.180> right<00:05:21.360> now

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
actually I'll just tell you right now

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.050 
actually I'll just tell you right now
why<00:05:21.840> I<00:05:22.170> shouldn't<00:05:22.560> have<00:05:22.680> put<00:05:23.010> up<00:05:23.160> the<00:05:23.820> right

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
why I shouldn't have put up the right

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.350 
why I shouldn't have put up the right
side<00:05:24.390> and<00:05:24.810> foil<00:05:25.470> yet<00:05:25.740> because<00:05:26.250> if<00:05:26.670> you<00:05:27.060> want<00:05:27.270> to

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
side and foil yet because if you want to

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.420 
side and foil yet because if you want to
make<00:05:27.510> sure<00:05:27.540> that<00:05:28.050> both<00:05:28.350> sides<00:05:28.590> are<00:05:28.980> even

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
make sure that both sides are even

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.970 
make sure that both sides are even
then<00:05:30.270> you<00:05:30.510> should<00:05:30.720> leave<00:05:30.900> the<00:05:31.260> foil<00:05:31.560> for<00:05:31.920> the

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
then you should leave the foil for the

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
then you should leave the foil for the
end<00:05:32.390> so<00:05:33.390> I<00:05:33.450> ended<00:05:33.630> up<00:05:33.750> taking<00:05:33.960> the<00:05:34.080> foil<00:05:34.410> out

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
end so I ended up taking the foil out

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.820 
end so I ended up taking the foil out
later<00:05:36.000> on<00:05:36.090> in<00:05:36.330> this<00:05:36.450> video<00:05:36.780> just<00:05:37.380> so<00:05:37.680> that<00:05:37.800> I

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
later on in this video just so that I

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.460 
later on in this video just so that I
can<00:05:38.070> make<00:05:38.220> sure<00:05:38.250> that's<00:05:39.000> the<00:05:39.240> bleach<00:05:39.660> on<00:05:39.900> both

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
you're done moving the bleach throughout

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.350 
you're done moving the bleach throughout
your<00:06:28.260> hair<00:06:28.470> evenly<00:06:29.040> you<00:06:29.640> can<00:06:29.790> put<00:06:30.030> up<00:06:30.150> both

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
your hair evenly you can put up both

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.320 
your hair evenly you can put up both
sections<00:06:30.930> into<00:06:31.410> foil<00:06:31.740> so<00:06:32.550> I<00:06:32.580> went<00:06:33.030> from<00:06:33.150> having

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.330 
sections into foil so I went from having

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.390 
sections into foil so I went from having
four<00:06:33.720> sections<00:06:34.200> to<00:06:34.440> having<00:06:34.710> two<00:06:34.919> sections

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
four sections to having two sections

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.969 
four sections to having two sections
basically<00:06:36.180> pigtails<00:06:37.020> in<00:06:37.320> foil<00:06:37.950> and<00:06:39.979> then

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:40.979 
basically pigtails in foil and then

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:43.040 
basically pigtails in foil and then
after<00:06:41.280> that<00:06:41.400> I<00:06:41.760> left<00:06:42.000> it<00:06:42.210> on<00:06:42.300> for<00:06:42.600> I<00:06:42.810> think

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
after that I left it on for I think

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.840 
after that I left it on for I think
about<00:06:44.540> 30<00:06:45.540> to<00:06:45.750> 50<00:06:45.870> minutes<00:06:46.380> maybe<00:06:46.890> like<00:06:47.130> 45<00:06:47.400> 50

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:47.850 
about 30 to 50 minutes maybe like 45 50

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.150 
about 30 to 50 minutes maybe like 45 50
minutes<00:06:48.360> because<00:06:49.020> my<00:06:49.350> hair<00:06:49.530> is<00:06:49.560> black<00:06:49.950> it

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 
minutes because my hair is black it

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.650 
minutes because my hair is black it
takes<00:06:50.340> more<00:06:50.580> time<00:06:50.790> to<00:06:50.910> develop<00:06:51.180> through<00:06:51.540> my

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660 
takes more time to develop through my

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.340
