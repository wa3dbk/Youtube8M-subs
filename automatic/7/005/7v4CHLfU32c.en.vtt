00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
what's even worse is that our main

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.690 
learned a lot more than just I'm
important<00:05:03.350> or<00:05:03.590> knowing<00:05:04.190> his<00:05:04.340> self-worth

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
important or knowing his self-worth

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.940 
important or knowing his self-worth
that's<00:05:05.480> one<00:05:05.720> of<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:05.930> many<00:05:06.140> lessons<00:05:06.410> that<00:05:06.710> he's

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
that's one of the many lessons that he's

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.890 
that's one of the many lessons that he's
learned<00:05:07.280> and<00:05:07.700> if<00:05:07.850> you<00:05:07.970> look<00:05:08.150> at<00:05:08.270> this<00:05:08.420> list<00:05:08.690> you

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
learned and if you look at this list you

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.360 
learned and if you look at this list you
can<00:05:09.050> see<00:05:09.230> that<00:05:09.380> he<00:05:09.470> isn't<00:05:09.710> just<00:05:09.890> learning<00:05:10.100> the

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
can see that he isn't just learning the

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.820 
can see that he isn't just learning the
same<00:05:10.580> thing<00:05:10.940> every<00:05:11.270> time<00:05:11.300> if<00:05:11.930> I<00:05:12.350> were<00:05:12.530> to<00:05:12.650> boil

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
same thing every time if I were to boil

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.800 
same thing every time if I were to boil
down<00:05:13.040> Spike's<00:05:13.400> character<00:05:13.970> I<00:05:14.150> would<00:05:14.300> say<00:05:14.630> that

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
down Spike's character I would say that

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.510 
down Spike's character I would say that
he's<00:05:14.900> always<00:05:15.050> learning<00:05:15.440> about<00:05:15.710> interactions

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
he's always learning about interactions

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.970 
he's always learning about interactions
rather<00:05:16.820> than<00:05:17.090> self-worth<00:05:17.690> like<00:05:18.260> how<00:05:18.470> not<00:05:18.740> to

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
rather than self-worth like how not to

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.310 
rather than self-worth like how not to
repay<00:05:19.280> a<00:05:19.310> friend<00:05:19.640> how<00:05:20.000> to<00:05:20.060> deny<00:05:20.570> peer<00:05:21.020> pressure

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
some friends can handle themselves the

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.810 
some friends can handle themselves the
