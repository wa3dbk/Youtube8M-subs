 the Clermontans are unbeaten and hope 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.070
 stay at the ocean stage but that 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.840
 looks complicated against a team from 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.939
 haven that is counting on his 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.680

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.760
 still not there 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.920
 the harbor has the favor of the prognosis 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.989
 still need to take the direction of 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.850
 operations which promises to be complicated 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.000
 against a team of Clermont who seems 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.140
 to gain confidence at the beginning of the season 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.649
 thierry goudet knows the match is not going 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.649
 not be simple 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.340
 there are opportunities to find 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.489
 openings in the surface with play

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.280
 but the defense of clermont resists 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.799
 perfectly few opportunities for 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.750
 Le Havre and Carmelites did better than 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.210

 second period 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:21.360
 the haven wants to turn everything upside down and 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.080
 the high-Norman tries to speed up the 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.519
 tempo of the match but face a 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.780
 well organized opponent and who against

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.800
 goal 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.800

 he is replaced by thierry goudet but 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.440
 it does not change much 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.450
 the people of Le Havre still have a lot of trouble 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.940

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.769
