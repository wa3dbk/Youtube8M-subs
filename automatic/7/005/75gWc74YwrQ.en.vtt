00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello, daughters, how are you? 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.109
 always me bringing you these videos 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.929
 quickies but I hope they are effective 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.650
 and that it serves them now on this occasion 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.470
 I bring you this video about what 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.730
 is the stylistic technique and design this 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.529
 graphic style that is what I have 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.769
 I need to buy another one because this one 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.750
 see wrong treatment with acetone and in the 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.720
 moving I dropped a phial that 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.769
 I had little acetone and I mistreated but 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.739
 same works perfectly this when 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.550
 started this technique that will be like 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.710
 a year or a little more than a year started 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.140
 much to use this technique for 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.260
 Chinese ink nails and graph style 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.090
 and I had no way of getting it but 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.460
 for me I also like drawing a lot 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.410
 and I really like painting in one of 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.760
 those that I was watching a tutorial and that 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.530
 it's the boy who was giving it and 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.600
 he said he had bought this in the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.510
 stationery then 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.640
 for neither more nor lazy nor it takes longer see 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.150
 that sometimes not always looking for what 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.540
 be 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.020
 that works for you that is more economical 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:17.400
 I went to the stationery shop and bought this one that 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.730
 it came out at 30 pesos 35 pesos and I bought 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.120
 the Chinese ink this mark there are other 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.860
 I think they are peric 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.500
 but I bought these and each one comes out 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.440
 like 20 or 25 pesos the songs that 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.300
 can you work if you want 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.240
 work this design that is very nice 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.630
 the effect it gives is very beautiful 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.000
 work that does this I recommend you 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.920
 run to the stationery and buy your 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.010
 style and buy their Chinese inks 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.100
 and they start to practice already 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.260
 the ideal thing for this is to have these fabrics 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.270
 print from some friends that the 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.650
 merge and on facebook you are going to 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.720
 serve a lot since having this one these 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.670
 copies then one can practice here one 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.670
 of the designs the way in which 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.400
 work one is like a super pen 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.550
 easy 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:15.190
 very very very easy 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:17.150
 and it's getting the graphic style wetting it 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.250
 at the tip 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.320
 taking away the excess 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.320
 and you can start doing your 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.260
 designs 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.540
 and if you need a little more 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.200
 different because you do not wet a little more 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.200
 if you are grabbing 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.040
 as you need 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:03:01.680
 and you can make effects like lace 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:06.010
 you can even make dots 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:09.959
 in the nails you work very well 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.959
 while you have this design here 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.220
 less easy how easy it is 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:27.250
 work with this technique 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.250
 it's so precise it's very accurate 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.799
 and they can make this different designs 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.989
 see what father is and now also here 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:44.300
 you can put some swarovski and you're done 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.690
 finished design you can do this 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.780
 of line 2 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.120
 all types 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.510
 after putting up the dots 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.989
 small dots as well as in the 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.989
 pointer 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.770
 but logically with this they are going to be 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.670
 super finite 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:16.260
 You can do all kinds of design all 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:16.260
 type of drawing including butterflies 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.170
 and you stay super finite 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.360
 is this technique very godfathers I tell you 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.220
 it's just a matter of grabbing a little leaf 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.400
 this is so print are on the internet 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.720
 they can look for them and they can hold on 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.720
 doing his 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.720
 designs 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:57.159
 just that they always have to be 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:57.159
 wetting 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:06.460
 your graph style to start doing 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.460
 designs of all kinds 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.600
 it's like a pen that has to 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.600
 practice as if it were a pen 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.720
 it's very simple it's very easy 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.979
 they can make their hearts 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.449
 It is very simple 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:43.720
 even in letters 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.720
 good lyrics 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:50.870
 they always have to have it open 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.950
 what I do is put him in a 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:57.330
 in a 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:06:00.090
 it is called the tray I put little idea and 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:05.060
 I'm winning like an ink I say 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:05.060
 as if they were freehand paint 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:15.090
 it's very simple I tell you nothing more this 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:15.090
 grip in heat 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:21.719
 the graph style 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:23.549
 and bulnes to practice immediately from 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:25.199
 see so I advise you go and buy 

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:27.209
 a stationery look for it in the 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:29.999
 stationery stores where they sell to make 

00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:32.399
 this art anything that is safe 

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:34.379
 they will be economical and there 

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:38.099
 different prices clear is of 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:40.409
 different mergers but this one is going to 

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:43.139
 work a lot if they do not have the 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:46.769
 enough to invest in one as with 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:49.349
 little stones and little drawings and like everything 

00:06:46.769 --> 00:06:51.869
 they sell you can buy one of these and 

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:54.869
 they will work as I send them a 

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:58.229
 I kiss a greeting and I really hope that 

00:06:54.869 --> 00:07:01.879
 all my heart that this video serves them 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:01.879
 a kiss goodbye
