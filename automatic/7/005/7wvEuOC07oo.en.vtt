00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:02.310
Hello everybody!

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.620
My name is Fumiyoshi Kamo.
My occupation is a professional guitarist, about the online guitar lessons
I have set a Guinness world record.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:13.389
Half of this video, methodology improve your picking of the guitar without spending money is included.

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:22.859
And the other half, I want to tell you that you have related book you have my writing to "R.A.S. Picking Method". This method is also the trademark registration in Japan.

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:31.349
"R.A.S. Picking Method" has become a book that has been nominated for Best chart in Japan. Many people, in order to have to wear this method of picking reasonable, I have developed a pick for practice more.

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.800
The name of the pick, I say "BREAK THROUGH".
It is the first product that specializes in "R.A.S. Picking Method".

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:41.350
I think in the second half of this video, because there is the demonstration and explanation of the "BREAK THROUGH", and if you can enjoy to the end this video by all means.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:49.940
Let's get started! The first half of this video, without spending the money, I would like to talk about how to improve your guitar picking.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:01:04.820
What have you been prepared for you is just easy come easy! What you get is available in only two, and scissors, is a nylon bag. No problem like a garbage bag.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:14.910
You start from where you use the scissors, go off the bag which had been prepared. Let's get started!

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:23.380
Use the scissors and cut the bag which had been prepared. Debris were cut let off so that the shape of the pick.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:02:00.560
Does not require any special technique. Just cut it so that the shape of the pick simply!Please try it together, too!

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:12.839
Pick of homemade that I cut was completed. I will not be a very clean shape is not good at using scissors, but it is fine for a practice of picking.

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:17.330
And perhaps you'd prefer to use a "pick made by cutting the bag with scissors" before, went to practice picking.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.940
I will explain the concept of "R.A.S. Picking Method". Anyone, or do not have experience in the days of beginner you are thinking of starting out a guitar, did the "Air Guitar"?

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:37.649
If some people have never done air guitar, you have a chance to try with me! 
How is it? 
Is not it a very comfortable work? To air resistance other than, There is nothing to interfere with the operation of picking everyone.

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:47.559
However, if you play the guitar actually, is often for the resistance of the string occurs, pick get stuck in string. This is the will of most of the stress on to play the guitar.

00:02:47.559 --> 00:03:05.449
"R.A.S. Picking Method" is not a how to play just to play the speed. 
The important thing, is the comfort than speed. Methodology for in the comfort like playing the air guitar, and picking actually is the "R.A.S. Picking Method".
 If you are interested, read all means of instruction book I have a more detailed description has been released in Japan in relation to "R.A.S. Picking Method".

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:16.289
Pick that had made earlier in everyone is not useful here! Money is not it does not depend essentially on this pick.

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:31.649
It describes the benefits of practice with this pick. To picking time, many of the stress that you feel is the "resistance of the string". 
However, "free pick" this you made no response to the resistance of the string!
 Therefore, it is possible to get used to letting you hit the string remains the pick of comfort as if playing the air guitar.

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:48.529
First of all, to create a state of air guitar, and the practice swing. 
Do not forget to "sense of arms and fingers" at the time of the practice swing, and then repeat the exercise to shed the string actually preserving its sense. 
This is a practice very effective in order to obtain the relaxed sense of picking time!

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:58.079
This practice method is the effective practice in order to strip the body remember the sense of relaxation, but it has limitations. 
It, in order to pick too much bending, the actual sound is not heard from the guitar. 
So there is a weakness that you can not practice phrase.

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:11.039
So, it would be performed on a range of confirmation of the feeling of relaxation to the last practice this way. 
As a next step, go to step while doing this exercise, will continue to thicken the pick and gradually.

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:26.219
I will examine theoretically. 
Start your practice from free pick made from the bag, everyone is if we pick a thick and gradually, 
"The feeling that pick is caught in string" is born somewhere someday. 
What thickness of pick at that time what was in, there the first Let's grasp.

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:31.550
Shape of the tip of the pick is also related to the ease of play. 
However, the tip of the pick will have a significant impact on the sound. 
As opposed to the priority shredding Simply aim is to focus on comfort at the time of the performance and sound of the guitar.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:41.509
Pick even if I stuck to the string, please do not do that will now be described.
 "Be picking force by fixing the power the wrist", it is "that you play with all my power by moving the whole arm". 
In exchange for speed and shred temporary, since these will cause and cut off the string, a cause of injury, such as tendonitis, is not recommended from the point of view professional.

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:49.509
Remember feel relaxed air guitar. 
To practice while maintaining the sense this is the way to improve the picking of the guitar. 
It can be applied to any music genre! This is an introductory explanation of the "R.A.S. Picking Method". 
Please read the instruction book of my If you are interested in more detailed story.

00:04:49.509 --> 00:05:05.460
It is the second half of the video from here. 
We've developed a practice pick to make it easier to do a "comfortable picking" you have to talk until now, please look at the demonstration of me by all means!

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:14.469
Did we have a weakness pick you made to cut the bag in the first half of the video is not subject to resistance of the string, but that you can not practice the phrase sound does not sound really. 
But pick that we developed is also developing escape while the resistance of the strings, the sound of attack feeling actually to sound.

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:25.639
So, with this pick, you are not there a "practice of phrase actually" while "Verifying the feeling of relaxation".
This is a pick that I can recommend it with confidence and those beginners who are trying to start a guitar now, towards the guitarist you've fallen into a slump, the guitar teacher you are trying to teach the picking on students.

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:28.779
I will explain how to practice with a pick that we have named this "BREAK THROUGH".

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:35.190
First, let the practice of Strumming Technique. Without relying on the guitar string, in the air, I can make Strumming Technique.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.230
While so as to strip the body remember "there is no resistance, comfortable feel" on at that time, we will close the string the pick.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:49.509
If you can do this exercise with pick developed by us "BREAK THROUGH" and notice that the sense of when you shook in the air, a sense of when the pick hits the string actually come together almost I think.

00:05:49.509 --> 00:06:12.509
You can do Strumming Technique from beginning to end in a relaxed state. Everyone is using this pick, if you can store the state of the body you are in a relaxed, and I am very happy!

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:27.009
Is not only Strumming Technique, "BREAK THROUGH" is also useful when you play a single note! Please incorporate a "practice swing operation" when I practice the single note. 
And, so always try to put a pick to string that maintains its sense.

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:53.740
Stress is reduced considerably if I use the "BREAK THROUGH" even when playing the shredding! 
When you playing by the full picking, I do not feel the stress almost! It is not suitable to Strumming Technique Many of the "pick to practice shredding" is often, but also single-note chord and you can play the "BREAK THROUGH".

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:57.649
Let's work of picking the "practice swing"!

00:06:57.649 --> 00:07:04.649
Let performed alternately "Operation shed to pick the string actually" and "practice swing operation"!

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:27.909
The hardening the arm, I do not mean that to deny completely how to play play with all my force to the whole arm. 
However, it is also a difficult style to play quite a person or there is a case to hurt the arm, power is weak. 
And how to play the power play harden the entire arm, there is no doubt that there is a direction not suitable.

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:42.999
Even people strength is weak, with a view to play the guitar comfortable to relax, and, happily, I have developed a "R.A.S. Picking Method" and "BREAKTHROUGH".

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:44.550
It has started from the place, "Turn off the bag with scissors, to make the practice picks for homemade" and, with your description of "R.A.S. Picking Method", this video is your original practice pick we made of "BREAK THROUGH" We have a description.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:58.599
It was late age I started the guitar that 19-year-old, but by the practice to squeeze the point, I was able to do progress in a short period of time. 
And, I was able to update the record of "Largest Online Guitar Lesson", I become a new Guinness world record established person.

00:07:58.599 --> 00:08:05.430
I look really great guitarist who recorded before the "Mr.Steve Vai". 
Because it was able to update the record, I was determined to try to originate overseas, not only in Japan methodologies related to guitar lessons have me.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.590
Come and towards the world and you to use the "BREAK THROUGH", I am glad you find it comfortable playing the guitar!

00:08:12.369 --> 00:08:15.430
