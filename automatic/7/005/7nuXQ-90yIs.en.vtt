is a really good bike at committing this

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.660 
is a really good bike at committing this
bike<00:01:54.810> has<00:01:55.020> only<00:01:55.200> one<00:01:55.439> grouse<00:01:55.649> what<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.159> think<00:01:56.490> is

bike has only one grouse what I think is

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.690 
bike has only one grouse what I think is
that<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.420> has<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.630> really<00:01:58.020> short<00:01:58.649> shot<00:01:59.280> gearing

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
that it has a really short shot gearing

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.149 
that it has a really short shot gearing
this<00:02:00.180> makes<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.600> bike<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:01.110> really<00:02:01.710> like

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
this makes the bike I really like

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.580 
this makes the bike I really like
handful<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.270> highway<00:02:03.630> like<00:02:03.899> when<00:02:04.439> you're

plus the clock and your average speed

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.809 
plus the clock and your average speed
and<00:03:08.079> there<00:03:09.079> are<00:03:09.170> two<00:03:09.319> trips<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:09.860> that's<00:03:10.700> the

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
and there are two trips and that's the

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.670 
and there are two trips and that's the
RPM<00:03:11.269> and<00:03:11.450> even<00:03:11.659> a<00:03:11.720> shift<00:03:11.989> light<00:03:12.170> that<00:03:12.319> comes<00:03:12.470> on

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
RPM and even a shift light that comes on

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.050 
RPM and even a shift light that comes on
it<00:03:12.860> specific<00:03:13.190> point<00:03:13.430> and<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.700> gear<00:03:13.849> indicator

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
it specific point and the gear indicator

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.479 
it specific point and the gear indicator
so<00:03:14.810> this<00:03:14.989> makes<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.470> display<00:03:16.129> a<00:03:16.159> really

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
so this makes the display a really

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.610 
so this makes the display a really
comprehensive<00:03:16.790> and<00:03:17.269> that<00:03:17.810> this<00:03:18.290> is<00:03:18.440> what<00:03:18.590> I

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
comprehensive and that this is what I

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
I don't like is the stiffness you know

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.699 
I don't like is the stiffness you know
apart<00:03:29.569> from<00:03:29.629> the<00:03:29.810> shot<00:03:29.959> getting<00:03:30.109> the<00:03:30.319> bike<00:03:30.530> is

apart from the shot getting the bike is

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.589 
apart from the shot getting the bike is
really<00:03:30.829> steep<00:03:31.129> era<00:03:31.310> I<00:03:31.579> mean<00:03:32.090> it<00:03:32.239> has<00:03:32.389> got<00:03:32.569> a

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
really steep era I mean it has got a

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.129 
really steep era I mean it has got a
really<00:03:32.870> cool<00:03:33.200> USD<00:03:33.709> WP<00:03:34.579> suspension<00:03:34.849> but<00:03:35.420> it<00:03:35.989> is

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
really cool USD WP suspension but it is

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.020 
really cool USD WP suspension but it is
really<00:03:36.319> stiff<00:03:36.680> on<00:03:36.799> the<00:03:36.920> bad<00:03:37.099> roads<00:03:37.430> and<00:03:37.579> like

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
really stiff on the bad roads and like

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.030 
really stiff on the bad roads and like
my<00:03:38.180> ninja<00:03:38.480> I<00:03:38.510> mean<00:03:38.750> like<00:03:38.930> my<00:03:39.379> ninja<00:03:39.650> is<00:03:39.769> really

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
my ninja I mean like my ninja is really

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.220 
my ninja I mean like my ninja is really
stiff<00:03:40.310> but<00:03:40.459> when<00:03:40.670> I<00:03:40.760> write<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.180> Duke<00:03:41.389> after<00:03:41.989> I

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
stiff but when I write the Duke after I

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.619 
stiff but when I write the Duke after I
had<00:03:42.440> Duke<00:03:42.739> and<00:03:42.980> then<00:03:43.310> I<00:03:43.430> right<00:03:43.609> ninja<00:03:43.970> I<00:03:44.269> feel

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
had Duke and then I right ninja I feel

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.050 
had Duke and then I right ninja I feel
like<00:03:44.810> a<00:03:45.109> ninja<00:03:45.590> is<00:03:45.859> really<00:03:46.159> plush<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:46.639> that's

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
like a ninja is really plush and that's

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.339 
like a ninja is really plush and that's
not<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.269> case<00:03:47.510> because<00:03:47.629> ninja<00:03:47.989> is<00:03:48.079> one<00:03:48.200> of<00:03:48.290> the

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
not the case because ninja is one of the

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.530 
not the case because ninja is one of the
stiffer<00:03:48.560> bikes<00:03:48.829> around<00:03:48.980> so<00:03:49.819> imagine<00:03:50.090> how<00:03:50.299> city

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
stiffer bikes around so imagine how city

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.250 
stiffer bikes around so imagine how city
of<00:03:50.599> the<00:03:50.690> Duke<00:03:50.840> is<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.950> Duke<00:03:52.220> has<00:03:52.790> a<00:03:53.260> underbelly

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
of the Duke is the Duke has a underbelly

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.039 
of the Duke is the Duke has a underbelly
of<00:03:54.349> sauce<00:03:54.739> that<00:03:55.040> helped<00:03:55.310> in<00:03:55.370> masters

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
of sauce that helped in masters

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.909 
of sauce that helped in masters
centralization<00:03:57.049> which<00:03:57.230> helps<00:03:57.470> in<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.650> Indian

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:57.919 
centralization which helps in the Indian

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:01.020 
centralization which helps in the Indian
traffic<00:03:58.280> because<00:03:59.319> in<00:04:00.319> my<00:04:00.440> opinion<00:04:00.560> the

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
traffic because in my opinion the

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.369 
traffic because in my opinion the
smaller<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:02.150> bike<00:04:02.299> in<00:04:02.449> the<00:04:02.540> Indian<00:04:03.079> traffic

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
smaller the bike in the Indian traffic

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.610 
smaller the bike in the Indian traffic
the<00:04:03.620> better<00:04:04.150> so<00:04:05.150> here's<00:04:05.750> a<00:04:05.810> dupe<00:04:06.049> guy<00:04:06.230> is<00:04:06.290> a

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
the better so here's a dupe guy is a

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.770 
the better so here's a dupe guy is a
beautiful<00:04:06.980> motorcycle<00:04:07.160> I<00:04:07.639> really<00:04:08.269> enjoy<00:04:08.629> it

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
beautiful motorcycle I really enjoy it

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.990 
beautiful motorcycle I really enjoy it
and<00:04:08.930> I<00:04:09.829> think<00:04:10.220> it's<00:04:10.340> going<00:04:10.459> to<00:04:10.549> be<00:04:10.669> a<00:04:10.699> good
