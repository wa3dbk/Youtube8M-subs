Bluth blueprint that I got just the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
other day I got this off a crisis

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.250 
other day I got this off a crisis
education<00:00:26.789> calm<00:00:27.330> which<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.750> hadn't<00:00:28.019> heard<00:00:28.109> of

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
education calm which I hadn't heard of

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.759 
education calm which I hadn't heard of
before<00:00:28.410> but<00:00:29.539> this<00:00:30.539> was<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.810> seven<00:00:31.500> dollar

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
before but this was a seven dollar

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.780 
before but this was a seven dollar
product<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:33.239> it's<00:00:33.420> fairly<00:00:33.630> short<00:00:34.760> it's<00:00:35.760> about

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
product and it's fairly short it's about

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.670 
product and it's fairly short it's about
30<00:00:36.180> pages<00:00:37.100> but<00:00:38.100> it's<00:00:38.219> pretty<00:00:38.430> well<00:00:38.730> done<00:00:39.059> I

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
30 pages but it's pretty well done I

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.260 
30 pages but it's pretty well done I
would<00:00:40.680> actually<00:00:40.860> recommend<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.910> especially

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
would actually recommend this especially

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.680 
would actually recommend this especially
given<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.719> price<00:00:42.930> point<00:00:43.789> this<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:45.059> basically

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
given the price point this is basically

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.799 
given the price point this is basically
a<00:00:45.840> plan<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.980> do<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> small<00:00:47.789> vertical<00:00:48.390> garden

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
a plan to do a small vertical garden

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.720 
a plan to do a small vertical garden
it's<00:00:49.020> wise<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.320> four-foot<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.489> basically

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
it's wise to four-foot you can basically

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.260 
it's wise to four-foot you can basically
grow<00:00:51.860> probably<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:53.039> about<00:00:53.160> all<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.640> need<00:00:53.879> if

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
grow probably just about all you need if

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.520 
grow probably just about all you need if
for<00:00:55.110> two<00:00:55.320> people<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.360> 4-foot<00:00:57.899> area<00:00:58.260> and

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
for two people in a in a 4-foot area and

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.139 
for two people in a in a 4-foot area and
you<00:00:58.590> can<00:00:58.710> do<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.920> indoors<00:00:59.160> or<00:00:59.460> outdoors

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
you can do it indoors or outdoors

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.119 
you can do it indoors or outdoors
so<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:00.899> gives<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.350> pretty<00:01:01.770> darn<00:01:02.010> good

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
so this gives you a pretty darn good

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.140 
so this gives you a pretty darn good

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
aquaponics lately that seems to be the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.109 
aquaponics lately that seems to be the
hot<00:01:26.040> thing<00:01:26.540> for<00:01:27.540> these<00:01:27.689> guys<00:01:27.900> now<00:01:28.259> and

hot thing for these guys now and

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.280 
hot thing for these guys now and
aquaponics<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.240> really<00:01:30.450> complicated<00:01:31.140> like

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
aquaponics is really complicated like

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.350 
aquaponics is really complicated like
they<00:01:31.740> make<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.009> sound<00:01:32.130> easy<00:01:32.369> but<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:33.060> really

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
they make it sound easy but it's really

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.200 
they make it sound easy but it's really
not<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.869> gotta<00:01:34.079> have<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.490> there's<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.579> fish<00:01:35.850> tank

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
not you gotta have a there's a fish tank

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.960 
not you gotta have a there's a fish tank
that<00:01:36.570> connects<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> hydroponic<00:01:38.400> system

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
that connects to a hydroponic system

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.289 
that connects to a hydroponic system
there's<00:01:39.869> pumping<00:01:40.290> involved<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.299> they're

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
there's pumping involved and they're

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.550 
there's pumping involved and they're
really<00:01:42.509> cool<00:01:42.659> once<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:42.899> get<00:01:43.049> them<00:01:43.140> going<00:01:43.290> but

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
really cool once you get them going but

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.789 
really cool once you get them going but
they're<00:01:43.680> not<00:01:43.829> easy<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.000> really<00:01:45.390> easy

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
they're not easy and this is really easy

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.190 
they're not easy and this is really easy
and<00:01:47.000> you<00:01:48.000> know<00:01:48.030> even<00:01:48.360> though<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:48.600> short<00:01:48.930> I

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
and you know even though it's short I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.410 
and you know even though it's short I
find<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.860> I'm<00:01:50.009> liking<00:01:50.579> these<00:01:50.790> shorter

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
find that I'm liking these shorter

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.100 
find that I'm liking these shorter
products<00:01:52.020> better<00:01:52.759> when<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.790> buy<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.090> big<00:01:54.479> 100

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
products better when I buy the big 100

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.389 
I just don't use them they're just too
too<00:02:03.750> complex<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.829> actually<00:02:05.280> very

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
too complex and this is actually very

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.210 
too complex and this is actually very
