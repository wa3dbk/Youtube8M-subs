a<00:01:08.710> healthy<00:01:09.010> watershed<00:01:09.340> benefits<00:01:10.150> us<00:01:10.390> in<00:01:10.630> just

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
a healthy watershed benefits us in just

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.900 
a healthy watershed benefits us in just
about<00:01:11.260> every<00:01:11.590> way<00:01:11.770> there<00:01:12.010> is<00:01:12.190> first<00:01:12.670> of<00:01:12.820> all

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
about every way there is first of all

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.790 
about every way there is first of all
clean<00:01:13.210> water<00:01:13.480> is<00:01:13.690> incredibly<00:01:14.170> important<00:01:14.620> for

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
clean water is incredibly important for

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.160 
clean water is incredibly important for
watering<00:01:15.100> our<00:01:15.340> crops<00:01:15.610> seventy<00:01:16.600> percent<00:01:16.810> of

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
watering our crops seventy percent of

watering our crops seventy percent of
all<00:01:17.380> fresh<00:01:17.710> water<00:01:18.010> that's<00:01:18.370> used<00:01:18.490> by<00:01:18.820> people<00:01:18.880> is

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
all fresh water that's used by people is

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.150 
all fresh water that's used by people is
used<00:01:19.570> to<00:01:19.720> irrigate<00:01:19.990> everything<00:01:20.560> that<00:01:20.710> we<00:01:20.860> eat

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
used to irrigate everything that we eat

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.580 
used to irrigate everything that we eat
the<00:01:22.060> second<00:01:22.420> is<00:01:22.540> that's<00:01:22.900> where<00:01:23.170> our<00:01:23.260> drinking

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
the second is that's where our drinking

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.280 
the second is that's where our drinking
water<00:01:23.650> comes<00:01:24.160> from<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:25.210> cleaner<00:01:25.780> our<00:01:26.020> water

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
water comes from the cleaner our water

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.860 
water comes from the cleaner our water
is<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:27.070> better<00:01:27.460> it<00:01:27.670> is<00:01:27.700> for<00:01:27.850> us<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.450> cheaper

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
is the better it is for us the cheaper

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.290 
is the better it is for us the cheaper
it<00:01:28.900> is<00:01:29.230> for<00:01:29.560> us<00:01:29.680> to<00:01:29.860> buy<00:01:30.040> that<00:01:30.310> water<00:01:30.580> as<00:01:30.850> well

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
it is for us to buy that water as well

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.380 
it is for us to buy that water as well
and<00:01:31.590> third<00:01:32.590> it's<00:01:33.010> important<00:01:33.640> because<00:01:33.790> there's

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
and third it's important because there's

and third it's important because there's
all<00:01:34.630> sorts<00:01:34.900> of<00:01:34.960> reasons<00:01:35.110> we<00:01:35.440> love<00:01:35.650> clean<00:01:36.070> water

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
all sorts of reasons we love clean water

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.520 
all sorts of reasons we love clean water
we<00:01:36.910> love<00:01:37.120> to<00:01:37.270> get<00:01:37.390> out<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:37.720> canoeing<00:01:38.140> it<00:01:38.290> fish

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
in it swim in it so a healthy watershed

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.960 
in it swim in it so a healthy watershed
is<00:01:41.530> just<00:01:41.740> a<00:01:41.830> wonderful<00:01:42.400> thing<00:01:42.550> to<00:01:42.610> be<00:01:42.700> able<00:01:42.820> to

have in an unhealthy watershed the rain

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.800 
have in an unhealthy watershed the rain
comes<00:01:47.560> down<00:01:47.860> it<00:01:48.130> hits<00:01:48.250> a<00:01:48.430> hard<00:01:48.700> surface<00:01:49.090> like<00:01:49.600> a
