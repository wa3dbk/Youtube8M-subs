this<00:00:12.320> is<00:00:12.500> the<00:00:12.650> third<00:00:12.920> dimension<00:00:14.200> 5:21

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
this is the third dimension 5:21

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:29.080 
this is the third dimension 5:21
got<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:19.310> DPD<00:00:20.310> cried<00:00:20.840> you<00:00:21.840> slide<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:24.290> switch

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.120 

front<00:00:30.090> pops<00:00:30.360> off<00:00:30.930> and<00:00:31.290> you<00:00:31.470> can<00:00:31.650> take<00:00:31.920> out<00:00:32.099> your

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
front pops off and you can take out your

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.510 
front pops off and you can take out your
drive<00:00:33.170> you<00:00:34.170> can<00:00:34.350> see<00:00:34.559> all<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.860> drive<00:00:35.129> bays

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
drive you can see all the drive bays

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.840 
drive you can see all the drive bays
there<00:00:38.330> so<00:00:39.330> I'm<00:00:39.750> gonna<00:00:40.080> check<00:00:40.710> open<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.640> up

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
there so I'm gonna check open this up

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.960 
there so I'm gonna check open this up
and<00:00:42.059> check<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:43.080> see<00:00:43.110> why<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:44.040> isn't<00:00:44.690> ejecting<00:00:45.690> I

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
and check to see why it isn't ejecting I

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.060 
and check to see why it isn't ejecting I
have<00:00:47.970> problem<00:00:48.449> ejecting<00:00:49.699> the<00:00:50.699> tray<00:00:51.120> from<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
have problem ejecting the tray from the

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.399 
have problem ejecting the tray from the
DVD<00:00:53.070> drive<00:00:55.460> popping<00:00:56.460> popping<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.600> top<00:00:58.110> cover

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409 
DVD drive popping popping the top cover

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:01.460 
DVD drive popping popping the top cover
off<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.159> challenge<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.080> put<00:01:01.290> your

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
off is a challenge you have to put your

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:09.289 
off is a challenge you have to put your
screwdrivers<00:01:02.309> here<00:01:02.750> here<00:01:04.400> and<00:01:05.400> also<00:01:08.150> you<00:01:09.150> know

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
screwdrivers here here and also you know

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.640 
screwdrivers here here and also you know
underneath<00:01:10.010> you<00:01:11.010> know<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:12.479> clip<00:01:12.780> need<00:01:13.380> to

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
underneath you know the clip need to

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.770 
underneath you know the clip need to
stick<00:01:14.490> your<00:01:14.610> screwdriver<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.390> then<00:01:15.720> push<00:01:16.049> it

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
stick your screwdriver and then push it

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.029 
stick your screwdriver and then push it
you<00:01:18.780> can<00:01:19.260> have<00:01:19.440> access<00:01:20.030> to<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.180> inside<00:01:22.039> so

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
you can have access to the inside so

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:31.789 
you can have access to the inside so
it's<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.820> bit<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.210> challenge<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:30.530> was<00:01:31.530> so

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
it's a bit of a challenge I was so

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.779 
it's a bit of a challenge I was so
generously<00:01:33.530> it<00:01:34.530> wouldn't<00:01:34.859> eject<00:01:35.280> because

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
generously it wouldn't eject because

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:48.440 
generously it wouldn't eject because
this<00:01:36.630> magnetism<00:01:37.229> here<00:01:37.740> supposedly<00:01:47.450> too

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
this magnetism here supposedly too

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.620 
this magnetism here supposedly too
strong<00:01:49.039> and<00:01:50.039> you<00:01:50.399> have<00:01:50.429> to<00:01:50.880> reduce<00:01:51.359> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
strong and you have to reduce the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.489 
strong and you have to reduce the
magnetism<00:01:53.329> somewhat<00:01:54.409> for<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.710> trade<00:01:57.140> to<00:01:58.140> eat

00:01:58.489 --> 00:01:58.499 
magnetism somewhat for the trade to eat

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:01.279 
magnetism somewhat for the trade to eat
check<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.609> that's<00:02:00.329> what<00:02:00.509> I'm<00:02:00.630> gonna<00:02:00.840> do<00:02:01.109> I'm

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
check so that's what I'm gonna do I'm

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.399 
check so that's what I'm gonna do I'm
gonna<00:02:01.409> try<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.770> do<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.869> by<00:02:03.869> adding<00:02:04.109> this

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
gonna try to do that by adding this

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.520 
gonna try to do that by adding this
small<00:02:05.249> piece<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.600> paper<00:02:07.429> that's<00:02:08.429> the

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
small piece of paper that's the

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.170 
small piece of paper that's the
instruction<00:02:10.530> given<00:02:10.890> by<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.000> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
instruction given by the a of the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:21.960 
instruction given by the a of the
YouTube<00:02:14.420> person

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.680 

so<00:02:22.540> this<00:02:22.810> is<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.140> inside<00:02:23.560> of<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.800> drive<00:02:24.690> and

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
so this is the inside of the drive and

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.260 
so this is the inside of the drive and
this<00:02:26.140> is<00:02:26.320> the<00:02:26.890> tree<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.430> is<00:02:27.580> supposed<00:02:27.970> to

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
this is the tree that is supposed to

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.020 
this is the tree that is supposed to
come<00:02:28.570> up<00:02:29.400> apparently<00:02:31.590> this<00:02:32.590> thing<00:02:32.650> easier<00:02:33.430> has

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
come up apparently this thing easier has

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.990 
come up apparently this thing easier has
a<00:02:34.060> magnet<00:02:34.600> inside<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.650> when<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.610> magnet

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
a magnet inside and when the magnet

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.070 
a magnet inside and when the magnet
becomes<00:02:37.330> becomes<00:02:38.200> too<00:02:38.740> strong<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:40.480> won't

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
becomes becomes too strong it won't

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.220 
becomes becomes too strong it won't
allow<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.470> tree<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:41.890> open<00:02:42.460> them<00:02:42.610> so<00:02:43.480> what<00:02:44.080> was

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
allow the tree to open them so what was

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.950 
allow the tree to open them so what was
recommended<00:02:44.640> is<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.700> put<00:02:46.300> a<00:02:46.330> piece<00:02:46.570> of<00:02:46.780> paper

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
recommended is to put a piece of paper

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.210 
recommended is to put a piece of paper
here<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.620> reduce<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.820> magnetism<00:02:49.300> so

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
here to reduce the magnetism so

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.770 
here to reduce the magnetism so
basically<00:02:51.220> what<00:02:51.460> you<00:02:51.610> do<00:02:51.820> is<00:02:52.060> you<00:02:52.300> just<00:02:52.330> glue

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
basically what you do is you just glue

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.650 
basically what you do is you just glue
down<00:02:53.020> the<00:02:53.080> paper<00:02:53.700> use<00:02:54.700> whatever<00:02:55.090> glue<00:02:55.450> you

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
down the paper use whatever glue you

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.910 
down the paper use whatever glue you
have<00:02:56.460> and<00:02:57.460> glue<00:02:58.270> it<00:02:58.330> down<00:02:58.510> I<00:02:58.840> just<00:02:59.320> use<00:02:59.500> a<00:02:59.530> grain

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
have and glue it down I just use a grain

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.890 
have and glue it down I just use a grain
of<00:03:00.130> rice<00:03:00.160> I<00:03:00.640> didn't<00:03:00.880> have<00:03:00.970> an<00:03:01.090> equal<00:03:01.390> on<00:03:01.630> hand

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
of rice I didn't have an equal on hand

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.020 
of rice I didn't have an equal on hand
so<00:03:02.170> that's<00:03:02.380> what<00:03:02.620> I'm<00:03:02.770> doing

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.470 

hey<00:03:07.030> it<00:03:07.330> actually<00:03:07.810> works

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.310 

before<00:03:14.370> when<00:03:15.370> I<00:03:15.400> want<00:03:15.670> to<00:03:15.790> open<00:03:16.330> it<00:03:16.450> I<00:03:16.690> have<00:03:17.170> to

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
before when I want to open it I have to

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.160 
before when I want to open it I have to
stick<00:03:17.620> a<00:03:17.830> pin<00:03:18.820> in<00:03:19.210> this<00:03:19.480> hole<00:03:19.780> here<00:03:20.140> to

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
stick a pin in this hole here to

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.310 
stick a pin in this hole here to
manually<00:03:20.950> open<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.460> and<00:03:21.930> then<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:23.140> doesn't

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
manually open it and then it doesn't

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.250 
manually open it and then it doesn't
really<00:03:23.500> work<00:03:23.920> well
