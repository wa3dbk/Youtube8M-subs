other new item is a transmutation

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.530 
other new item is a transmutation
splitter<00:01:34.400> which<00:01:35.400> will<00:01:35.610> return<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.119> original

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
existing transmitted item all items will

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.130 
existing transmitted item all items will
remain<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.460> bound<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.329> I'll<00:01:42.600> buy<00:01:42.780> one<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:42.990> these

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
remain so bound so I'll buy one of these

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.069 
remain so bound so I'll buy one of these
up<00:01:43.350> just<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.100> see<00:01:44.280> exactly<00:01:44.549> how<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.630> works<00:01:45.840> I

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
up just to see exactly how it works I

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.350 
up just to see exactly how it works I
imagine<00:01:46.979> it'll<00:01:47.130> be<00:01:47.280> fairly<00:01:47.610> straightforward

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
imagine it'll be fairly straightforward

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.550 
imagine it'll be fairly straightforward

we'll<00:01:56.310> go<00:01:56.549> ahead<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.850> use<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:58.340> dragon<00:01:59.340> item

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
we'll go ahead and use that dragon item

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.109 
we'll go ahead and use that dragon item
here<00:02:00.200> which<00:02:01.200> will<00:02:01.380> give<00:02:01.619> me<00:02:01.820> it<00:02:02.820> even

and a Ruby orb let's split note that
they<00:02:12.390> are

they are

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.339 
they are
consumable<00:02:13.830> so<00:02:14.310> one<00:02:14.940> for<00:02:14.970> one<00:02:15.420> type<00:02:15.870> deal<00:02:16.140> you

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
consumable so one for one type deal you

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.729 
consumable so one for one type deal you
can't<00:02:16.560> buy<00:02:16.739> them<00:02:16.890> in<00:02:17.040> bulk<00:02:17.069> I<00:02:17.519> believe<00:02:18.530> one<00:02:19.530> for

let's go ahead and split that you can
see<00:02:27.450> we've<00:02:27.629> got<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:28.110> Rubio<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.970> rest<00:02:29.970> will<00:02:30.090> be

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
see we've got the Rubio the rest will be

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.330 
see we've got the Rubio the rest will be
hiding<00:02:30.599> somewhere<00:02:30.840> we<00:02:31.080> got<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.709> skin<00:02:32.099> and

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
hiding somewhere we got the skin and

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.160 
hiding somewhere we got the skin and
we've<00:02:32.760> got<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.090> original<00:02:33.450> item<00:02:33.569> so<00:02:33.959> i<00:02:33.989> can

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
we've got the original item so i can

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.309 
we've got the original item so i can
happily<00:02:34.440> throw<00:02:34.709> that<00:02:34.860> back<00:02:35.010> on<00:02:35.160> there<00:02:35.190> and

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
happily throw that back on there and

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.640 
happily throw that back on there and
have<00:02:37.319> my<00:02:37.500> draconic<00:02:37.950> gauntlets<00:02:38.550> back<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.500> if<00:02:40.500> I

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
have my draconic gauntlets back and if I

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.190 
have my draconic gauntlets back and if I
so<00:02:40.920> wish<00:02:41.099> I<00:02:41.130> could<00:02:41.370> then<00:02:41.790> put<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:42.720> radiant

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
so wish I could then put the radiant

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.710 
so wish I could then put the radiant
skin<00:02:43.319> back<00:02:43.860> onto<00:02:44.099> them<00:02:44.370> but<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.910> think<00:02:45.569> we'll

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
skin back onto them but I think we'll

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.720 
skin back onto them but I think we'll
wait<00:02:45.930> for<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.290> little<00:02:46.440> while<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:47.040> then<00:02:47.580> the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
wait for a little while so then the

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.030 
wait for a little while so then the
