00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
let's just do a quick test so if we do

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.620 
let's just do a quick test so if we do
this<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.200> this<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.530> then<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.759> also

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
this and this and then this and also

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.780 
this and this and then this and also
bring<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.170> down<00:01:55.439> Oh

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
bring this down Oh

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
and then disregarding the top bit yeah I

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.700 
and then disregarding the top bit yeah I
think<00:02:00.510> I<00:02:00.810> think<00:02:01.050> it<00:02:01.140> needs<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.320> go<00:02:01.440> like<00:02:01.560> that

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
think I think it needs to go like that

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.020 
think I think it needs to go like that
yeah<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:01.980> definitely<00:02:02.100> thinking<00:02:02.580> he's<00:02:02.730> got<00:02:02.880> that
