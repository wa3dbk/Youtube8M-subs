00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.119 
and that's how it works I will show you
proof<00:02:05.189> because<00:02:05.540> well<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.960> video<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.259> saw<00:02:07.950> this

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
proof because well the video I saw this

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.020 
proof because well the video I saw this
from<00:02:08.280> yes<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.179> not<00:02:09.390> either

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
from yes this is not either

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.120 
from yes this is not either
not<00:02:10.149> find<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.600> sketches<00:02:11.080> all<00:02:11.319> over<00:02:11.650> YouTube

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
not find the sketches all over YouTube

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.949 
not find the sketches all over YouTube
but<00:02:12.850> I<00:02:12.880> figured<00:02:13.240> I<00:02:13.360> put<00:02:13.569> on<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.780> glitch<00:02:13.930> just

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
but I figured I put on the glitch just

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.340 
but I figured I put on the glitch just
because<00:02:14.500> I<00:02:14.530> like<00:02:14.770> using<00:02:15.100> it<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:15.880> I<00:02:16.180> saw<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.260> on

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
because I like using it so I saw it on

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.570 
because I like using it so I saw it on
YouTube<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.830> person<00:02:18.130> didn't<00:02:18.340> show<00:02:18.459> me

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
YouTube and the person didn't show me

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.460 
YouTube and the person didn't show me
any<00:02:18.610> proof<00:02:18.940> I'm<00:02:19.180> figuring<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:20.110> didn't<00:02:20.380> even

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
any proof I'm figuring I didn't even

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.340 
any proof I'm figuring I didn't even
believe<00:02:20.770> it<00:02:20.950> until<00:02:21.040> I<00:02:21.190> tried<00:02:21.430> it<00:02:21.610> so<00:02:22.230> I'm<00:02:23.230> just

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
believe it until I tried it so I'm just

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.020 
believe it until I tried it so I'm just
going<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.560> show<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.680> some<00:02:23.860> proof<00:02:24.040> now<00:02:24.790> if<00:02:24.910> you

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
going to show you some proof now if you

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.729 
going to show you some proof now if you
look<00:02:25.180> there<00:02:25.810> should<00:02:25.959> be<00:02:26.050> three<00:02:26.350> screens

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
look there should be three screens

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:33.000 
look there should be three screens
playing<00:02:27.810> scene<00:02:28.810> three<00:02:29.050> screens<00:02:31.739> well<00:02:32.739> thank

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
playing scene three screens well thank

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.530 
playing scene three screens well thank
