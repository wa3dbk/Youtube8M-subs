00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.020 
already that's a good start is that
stepping<00:02:44.200> you<00:02:44.620> or<00:02:45.010> like<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:46.109> mob<00:02:47.109> behind<00:02:47.530> me<00:02:48.030> um

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
stepping you or like a mob behind me um

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.780 
stepping you or like a mob behind me um
it's<00:02:49.359> probably<00:02:49.780> me<00:02:50.220> because<00:02:51.220> if<00:02:51.400> I<00:02:51.519> turned

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.110 
it's probably me because if I turned
around<00:02:51.879> and<00:02:52.120> it's<00:02:52.299> like<00:02:52.510> Michael<00:02:52.989> Jackson<00:02:54.120> it

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120
