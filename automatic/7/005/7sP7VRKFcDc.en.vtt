but<00:04:19.200> they<00:04:19.290> just<00:04:19.470> sort<00:04:19.560> of<00:04:19.620> have<00:04:19.770> to

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
but they just sort of have to

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.150 
but they just sort of have to
to<00:04:20.180> drive<00:04:20.389> that<00:04:20.600> for<00:04:20.900> it<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.769> marketing

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
to drive that for it the the marketing

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.790 
to drive that for it the the marketing
is<00:04:22.360> definitely<00:04:23.360> even<00:04:23.600> in<00:04:23.900> that<00:04:24.050> regard<00:04:24.380> yet<00:04:24.560> so

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
is definitely even in that regard yet so

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.310 
is definitely even in that regard yet so
taking<00:04:25.100> on<00:04:25.130> Apple<00:04:25.490> but<00:04:25.639> it's<00:04:26.300> I<00:04:26.750> think<00:04:27.139> it's

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
taking on Apple but it's I think it's

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.960 
taking on Apple but it's I think it's
better<00:04:27.560> than<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:27.860> priests<00:04:28.280> marketing<00:04:28.760> which

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
better than the priests marketing which

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.120 
better than the priests marketing which
which<00:04:29.330> really<00:04:29.660> failed<00:04:30.110> miserably<00:04:30.350> in<00:04:30.889> a<00:04:30.950> lot

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
which really failed miserably in a lot

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.370 
which really failed miserably in a lot
of<00:04:31.160> face<00:04:31.400> showing<00:04:31.970> you<00:04:32.510> know<00:04:32.630> what<00:04:32.990> this<00:04:33.139> boat

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
of face showing you know what this boat

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.320 
of face showing you know what this boat
could<00:04:33.620> do<00:04:33.800> I<00:04:34.040> think<00:04:34.610> this<00:04:34.850> reason<00:04:35.210> the

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
could do I think this reason the

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.460
