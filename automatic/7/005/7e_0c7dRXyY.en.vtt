hi everybody and welcome for today's
video<00:00:03.540> we're<00:00:03.929> gonna<00:00:04.020> look<00:00:04.319> at<00:00:04.620> another

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
video we're gonna look at another

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.540 
video we're gonna look at another
calculation<00:00:05.220> training<00:00:06.210> exercise<00:00:07.309> I've<00:00:08.309> been

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
calculation training exercise I've been

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.540 
calculation training exercise I've been
trying<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:09.170> think<00:00:10.170> of<00:00:10.380> some<00:00:10.620> videos<00:00:11.280> that

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
trying to think of some videos that

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.549 
trying to think of some videos that
would<00:00:11.670> be<00:00:11.820> more<00:00:12.030> accessible<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.139> broader

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
would be more accessible to a broader

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.490 
would be more accessible to a broader
range<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:14.070> people<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.849> in<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.929> past<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.379> number

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
range of people and in the past a number

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.439 
range of people and in the past a number
of<00:00:16.740> people<00:00:17.010> have<00:00:17.160> complained<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:17.970> the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
of people have complained that the

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.230 
of people have complained that the
exercises<00:00:19.289> are<00:00:19.500> too<00:00:19.680> difficult<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.490> I'm

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
exercises are too difficult so I'm

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.790 
exercises are too difficult so I'm
trying<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.539> bridge<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.080> gap<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.320> little<00:00:22.500> bit

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
trying to bridge the gap a little bit

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.420 
trying to bridge the gap a little bit
and<00:00:23.869> I've<00:00:24.869> picked<00:00:25.109> out<00:00:25.260> an<00:00:25.439> example<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.130> feel

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
and I've picked out an example I feel

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.460 
and I've picked out an example I feel
like<00:00:26.730> most<00:00:27.000> people<00:00:27.180> ought<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.960> be<00:00:28.080> able<00:00:28.170> to

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
like most people ought to be able to

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.919 
like most people ought to be able to
solve<00:00:28.880> with<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> little<00:00:30.390> bit<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.630> careful

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
solve with a little bit of careful

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.950 
solve with a little bit of careful
thought<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.769> it's<00:00:31.920> white<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.369> play<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:33.059> when

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
thought so it's white to play and when

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.170 
thought so it's white to play and when
there's<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.380> forcing<00:00:35.000> continuation<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
there's a forcing continuation the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.069 
there's a forcing continuation the
results<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:36.809> mate<00:00:37.640> and<00:00:41.690> let's<00:00:42.690> just<00:00:42.870> take

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
results in mate and let's just take

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.250 
results in mate and let's just take
stock<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.590> position<00:00:44.100> before<00:00:44.520> we<00:00:45.110> start<00:00:46.110> to

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
stock of the position before we start to

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.170 
stock of the position before we start to
analyze<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.129> detail<00:00:47.550> we<00:00:47.730> can<00:00:47.879> see<00:00:48.000> that

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
analyze this in detail we can see that

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.100 
analyze this in detail we can see that
this<00:00:48.500> LightSquared<00:00:49.500> Bishop<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.129> white<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.640> d3

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
this LightSquared Bishop of white on d3

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.689 
this LightSquared Bishop of white on d3
it's<00:00:52.110> kind<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.350> hemmed<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.770> by<00:00:52.800> its<00:00:53.160> own<00:00:53.340> pawns

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
it's kind of hemmed in by its own pawns

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.029 
it's kind of hemmed in by its own pawns
but<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.360> controlling<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.770> useful

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
but it's controlling this useful

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.610 
but it's controlling this useful
diagonal<00:00:56.820> towards<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.329> black<00:00:57.539> King<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
diagonal towards the black King the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.610 
diagonal towards the black King the
white<00:00:58.829> rook<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.719> in<00:01:00.719> danger<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.379> being

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
white rook is in danger of being

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.329 
white rook is in danger of being
captured<00:01:02.359> but<00:01:03.359> it's<00:01:03.899> still<00:01:04.170> controlling<00:01:04.860> some

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
captured but it's still controlling some

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.149 
captured but it's still controlling some
very<00:01:05.610> useful<00:01:05.880> squares<00:01:06.479> on<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.840> edge<00:01:06.990> file<00:01:07.409> so

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
very useful squares on the edge file so

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.030 
very useful squares on the edge file so
it's<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.369> good<00:01:08.580> attacking<00:01:09.180> unit<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.409> Queen<00:01:10.710> is

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
it's a good attacking unit the Queen is

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.149 
it's a good attacking unit the Queen is

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
as you need and try to start just

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.580 
as you need and try to start just
calculating<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.590> forcing<00:02:08.069> lines<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:09.590> see

calculating the forcing lines and see

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.180 
calculating the forcing lines and see
see<00:02:11.160> how<00:02:11.430> far<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:12.000> can<00:02:12.030> get<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.780> see<00:02:12.959> if

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
see how far you can get and see if

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.810 
see how far you can get and see if
can<00:02:13.310> find<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:15.470> key<00:02:15.710> move<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.370> winning<00:02:16.700> this

can find the key move to winning this

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.730 
can find the key move to winning this
position<00:02:17.390> it's<00:02:17.630> not<00:02:17.780> as<00:02:17.900> difficult<00:02:18.110> as<00:02:18.680> you

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740

on<00:03:41.680> g7<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:43.010> g8<00:03:43.930> but<00:03:44.930> at<00:03:45.769> this<00:03:46.040> point<00:03:46.370> we<00:03:46.970> see

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
on g7 to g8 but at this point we see

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.660 
on g7 to g8 but at this point we see
that<00:03:47.630> there's<00:03:47.900> nowhere<00:03:48.350> for<00:03:48.430> white<00:03:49.430> to

that there's nowhere for white to

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.570 
that there's nowhere for white to
continue<00:03:50.390> his<00:03:50.570> attack<00:03:50.989> there's<00:03:51.890> two<00:03:52.130> squares

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
continue his attack there's two squares

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.750 
continue his attack there's two squares
from<00:03:53.000> which<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:53.660> White<00:03:53.870> Queen<00:03:54.500> on<00:03:54.860> f8<00:03:55.370> could

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
from which the White Queen on f8 could

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.050 
from which the White Queen on f8 could
deliver<00:03:56.090> check<00:03:56.450> and<00:03:56.870> those<00:03:57.440> are<00:03:57.739> f6<00:03:58.700> and<00:03:59.709> h6

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
deliver check and those are f6 and h6

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.509 
deliver check and those are f6 and h6
both<00:04:02.060> of<00:04:02.300> which<00:04:02.480> are<00:04:02.959> covered<00:04:03.290> by<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.709> black

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
both of which are covered by the black

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:09.430 
both of which are covered by the black
Queen<00:04:04.850> on<00:04:05.330> the<00:04:05.630> g5<00:04:06.260> square<00:04:07.810> and<00:04:08.810> sometimes

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
Queen on the g5 square and sometimes

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.890 
Queen on the g5 square and sometimes
when<00:04:09.650> we're<00:04:09.830> trying<00:04:09.950> to<00:04:10.100> construct<00:04:10.640> these

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
when we're trying to construct these

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.400 
when we're trying to construct these
combinations<00:04:13.510> you've<00:04:14.510> you<00:04:14.900> kind<00:04:15.140> of<00:04:15.230> look

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
combinations you've you kind of look

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.650 
combinations you've you kind of look
through<00:04:15.650> a<00:04:15.739> series<00:04:16.370> of<00:04:16.400> forced<00:04:16.850> moves<00:04:17.269> and

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
through a series of forced moves and

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.680 
through a series of forced moves and
then<00:04:17.720> you<00:04:17.900> find<00:04:18.830> a<00:04:19.220> reason<00:04:19.940> why<00:04:20.150> it's<00:04:20.480> not

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
then you find a reason why it's not

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.430 
then you find a reason why it's not
possible<00:04:21.260> and<00:04:21.620> if<00:04:21.770> then<00:04:22.010> you<00:04:22.160> can<00:04:22.340> eliminate

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
possible and if then you can eliminate

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.480 
possible and if then you can eliminate
the<00:04:24.440> piece<00:04:24.680> that's<00:04:24.979> causing<00:04:25.250> you<00:04:25.610> the

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
the piece that's causing you the

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.510 
the piece that's causing you the
then<00:04:27.020> by<00:04:28.020> playing<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.650> moves<00:04:28.830> in<00:04:29.010> a<00:04:29.130> different

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
then by playing the moves in a different

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.260 
then by playing the moves in a different
order<00:04:29.790> then<00:04:31.040> you<00:04:32.040> kind<00:04:32.280> of<00:04:32.340> find<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.820> key<00:04:33.060> to

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
order then you kind of find the key to

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.510 
order then you kind of find the key to
winning<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.170> position<00:04:34.650> and<00:04:34.830> forcing<00:04:35.340> that

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
winning the position and forcing that

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.290 
winning the position and forcing that
the<00:04:36.470> correct<00:04:37.470> attacking<00:04:38.010> sequence<00:04:38.520> so<00:04:39.240> I'm

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
the correct attacking sequence so I'm

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.700 
the correct attacking sequence so I'm
just<00:04:39.420> gonna<00:04:39.510> walk<00:04:39.810> through<00:04:40.080> that<00:04:40.170> sequence

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
just gonna walk through that sequence

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.180 
just gonna walk through that sequence
just<00:04:41.070> so<00:04:41.190> it's<00:04:41.340> clear<00:04:41.760> we<00:04:42.570> go<00:04:42.810> Queen<00:04:43.350> to<00:04:43.620> d8

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
these checking squares particularly edge

these checking squares particularly edge
six<00:05:09.750> which<00:05:09.990> would<00:05:10.140> be<00:05:10.320> deadly<00:05:10.560> is<00:05:11.310> covered<00:05:11.820> by

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
six which would be deadly is covered by

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.540 
six which would be deadly is covered by
the<00:05:12.060> black<00:05:12.390> Queen<00:05:12.750> so<00:05:13.680> if<00:05:13.800> we<00:05:13.890> go<00:05:14.010> back<00:05:14.040> to<00:05:14.460> the

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
the black Queen so if we go back to the

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.060 
the black Queen so if we go back to the
starting<00:05:14.940> position<00:05:15.410> we'll<00:05:16.410> see<00:05:16.590> if<00:05:16.680> we<00:05:16.800> can

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
starting position we'll see if we can

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:22.930 
starting position we'll see if we can
find<00:05:17.340> a<00:05:17.520> way<00:05:17.840> to<00:05:19.910> deflect<00:05:20.910> the<00:05:21.420> Queen<00:05:22.230> aware

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
find a way to deflect the Queen aware

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.350 
find a way to deflect the Queen aware
from<00:05:24.650> the<00:05:25.650> defense<00:05:26.070> of<00:05:26.310> the<00:05:26.430> edge<00:05:26.610> six<00:05:27.030> square

from the defense of the edge six square
if<00:05:28.170> we<00:05:28.290> can<00:05:28.560> do<00:05:28.740> that<00:05:28.950> we<00:05:29.130> can<00:05:29.340> find<00:05:29.670> the<00:05:30.060> way<00:05:30.270> to

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
if we can do that we can find the way to

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.810 
if we can do that we can find the way to
win<00:05:30.720> this<00:05:30.900> position<00:05:31.410> so<00:05:32.130> let's<00:05:32.250> go<00:05:32.400> back<00:05:32.640> to
