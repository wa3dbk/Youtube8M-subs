00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060

here so basically when you put your
iPhone<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:31.950> you're<00:01:32.220> not<00:01:32.370> gonna<00:01:32.490> scratch<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.850> up

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
iPhone in you're not gonna scratch it up

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.730 
iPhone in you're not gonna scratch it up
which<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.780> good<00:01:33.990> because<00:01:34.140> if<00:01:34.440> you<00:01:34.590> could

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
which is good because if you could

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.920 
which is good because if you could
imagine<00:01:34.830> if<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.430> was<00:01:35.640> brushed<00:01:36.240> metal<00:01:36.540> on<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
imagine if this was brushed metal on the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.900 
imagine if this was brushed metal on the
inside<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.560> would<00:01:37.650> probably<00:01:37.860> scratch<00:01:38.280> you

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
inside that would probably scratch you

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.030 
inside that would probably scratch you
back<00:01:39.390> glass<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.990> your<00:01:40.110> iPhone<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.710> would<00:01:40.860> not

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
back glass of your iPhone that would not

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.330 
back glass of your iPhone that would not
be<00:01:41.250> nice<00:01:41.720> so<00:01:42.720> what<00:01:43.110> we're<00:01:43.260> gonna<00:01:43.350> do<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.770> take

very snug fit as you can see right there
I<00:01:56.490> did<00:01:56.729> have<00:01:56.940> to<00:01:57.090> push<00:01:57.320> quite<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> bit<00:01:58.830> right

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
I did have to push quite a bit right

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.969 
I did have to push quite a bit right
there<00:01:59.880> we<00:01:59.970> go<00:02:00.150> so<00:02:00.420> there<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> challenge

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
there we go so there is a challenge

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.650 
there we go so there is a challenge
putting<00:02:02.490> on<00:02:02.580> this<00:02:02.700> case<00:02:02.940> you<00:02:02.970> have<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.390> put<00:02:03.570> it

putting on this case you have to put it

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.020 
putting on this case you have to put it
