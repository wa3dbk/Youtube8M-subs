00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
our what's up everyone do came 23 here

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.909 
our what's up everyone do came 23 here
and<00:00:06.569> I'm<00:00:06.690> finally<00:00:07.230> bringing<00:00:07.500> you<00:00:07.740> another

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
and I'm finally bringing you another

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.100 
and I'm finally bringing you another
halo<00:00:08.519> reach<00:00:08.790> racetrack<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.660> this<00:00:09.780> one<00:00:09.990> is

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
halo reach racetrack and this one is

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.640 
halo reach racetrack and this one is
called<00:00:10.349> vault<00:00:10.740> MX<00:00:11.400> by<00:00:11.759> improbable<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.960> a

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
called vault MX by improbable and a

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.880 
called vault MX by improbable and a
rabid<00:00:14.099> tourist<00:00:14.639> now<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:16.109> only<00:00:16.350> thing<00:00:16.529> I

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
rabid tourist now the only thing I

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.010 
rabid tourist now the only thing I
really<00:00:17.340> don't<00:00:17.580> like<00:00:17.670> about<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.240> map<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.510> the

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
really don't like about this map is the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.800 
really don't like about this map is the
starting<00:00:19.410> gate<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:20.070> like<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:21.210> gate<00:00:21.420> itself

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
starting gate the like the gate itself

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.230 
starting gate the like the gate itself
is<00:00:22.050> fine<00:00:22.320> it's<00:00:22.890> just<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.220> time<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.730> takes<00:00:23.910> for

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
is fine it's just the time it takes for

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.660 
is fine it's just the time it takes for
the<00:00:24.420> pieces<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.500> guess<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.859> spawn<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.519> can

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
the pieces I guess to spawn so you can

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.250 
the pieces I guess to spawn so you can
actually<00:00:26.789> start<00:00:27.180> driving<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.720> don't<00:00:28.199> like

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
actually start driving I don't like

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.439 
actually start driving I don't like
waiting<00:00:28.590> 20<00:00:29.189> seconds<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.730> be<00:00:29.849> able<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.060> race<00:00:30.210> in

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
waiting 20 seconds to be able to race in

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.939 
waiting 20 seconds to be able to race in
another<00:00:30.779> problem<00:00:31.170> with<00:00:31.349> waiting<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.920> long

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
another problem with waiting that long

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.729 
another problem with waiting that long
is<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.600> people<00:00:33.600> get<00:00:33.719> very<00:00:33.780> impatient<00:00:34.110> and

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
is that people get very impatient and

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.170 
is that people get very impatient and
then<00:00:34.860> they'll<00:00:35.010> start<00:00:35.370> like<00:00:35.550> trying<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.940> cheat

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
then they'll start like trying to cheat

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.240 
then they'll start like trying to cheat
the<00:00:36.210> starting<00:00:37.050> gate<00:00:37.200> which<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.559> may<00:00:37.710> have<00:00:37.739> I

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
the starting gate which you may have I

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.280 
the starting gate which you may have I
guess<00:00:39.090> teleporters<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.870> everything<00:00:40.170> like

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
guess teleporters and everything like

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.680 
guess teleporters and everything like
that<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.739> keeps<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.700> from<00:00:41.910> doing<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.480> but

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
that that keeps you from doing that but

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.750 
that that keeps you from doing that but
still<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.350> know<00:00:43.469> people<00:00:43.860> get<00:00:43.980> very<00:00:44.040> impatient

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
still you know people get very impatient

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.819 
still you know people get very impatient
including<00:00:45.300> myself<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:46.289> don't<00:00:46.739> like

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
including myself I just don't like

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.100 
including myself I just don't like
sitting<00:00:47.100> there<00:00:47.250> for<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.670> long<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.809> part

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
sitting there for that long on this part

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.450 
sitting there for that long on this part
right<00:00:49.140> here<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.559> have<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.739> be<00:00:49.860> very<00:00:50.129> careful

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
right here you have to be very careful

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.420 
right here you have to be very careful
about<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:51.149> do<00:00:51.270> like<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.840> idea<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:53.010> having

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
about I do like the idea of it having

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.299 
about I do like the idea of it having
you<00:00:53.610> know<00:00:53.730> very<00:00:54.030> bumpy<00:00:54.360> section<00:00:55.010> but<00:00:56.010> maybe

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
you know very bumpy section but maybe

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.610 
you know very bumpy section but maybe
since<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.090> more<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.480> fast-paced<00:00:58.170> race

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
since this is more of a fast-paced race

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.650 
since this is more of a fast-paced race
maybe<00:00:59.280> they<00:00:59.460> could<00:00:59.640> have<00:00:59.789> lowered<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.449> down

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
maybe they could have lowered that down

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.869 
maybe they could have lowered that down
just<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.289> little<00:01:01.500> bit<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:02.430> where<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.640> doesn't

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
just a little bit to where it doesn't

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.240 
just a little bit to where it doesn't
affect<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.270> quite<00:01:03.629> as<00:01:03.870> much<00:01:04.140> but<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.159> know

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
affect you quite as much but you know

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.740 
affect you quite as much but you know
it's<00:01:05.430> still<00:01:05.640> if<00:01:05.820> that's<00:01:06.060> what<00:01:06.240> they<00:01:06.330> intended

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
it's still if that's what they intended

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.090 
it's still if that's what they intended
on<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.049> where<00:01:07.200> you're<00:01:07.409> going<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.920> slow

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
on to where you're going to have to slow

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.700 
on to where you're going to have to slow
down<00:01:08.280> then<00:01:08.780> that's<00:01:09.780> their<00:01:09.990> choice<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.530> their

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
down then that's their choice it's their

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.910 
down then that's their choice it's their
map<00:01:10.920> but<00:01:11.790> every<00:01:12.360> single<00:01:12.510> jump<00:01:12.869> works<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.650> here

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
map but every single jump works on here

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.710 
map but every single jump works on here
as<00:01:14.040> long<00:01:14.310> as<00:01:14.490> you're<00:01:14.610> going<00:01:14.820> full<00:01:15.119> speed<00:01:15.299> and

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
as long as you're going full speed and

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.539 
as long as you're going full speed and
of<00:01:16.320> course<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.680> hit<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.040> jump<00:01:17.250> right<00:01:17.400> you

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
of course you hit the jump right you

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.249 
of course you hit the jump right you
can't<00:01:17.759> hit<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.210> jump<00:01:18.450> going<00:01:18.689> sideways<00:01:18.930> and

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
can't hit the jump going sideways and

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.219 
can't hit the jump going sideways and
stuff<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.130> it's<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.119> very<00:01:21.150> competitive<00:01:21.540> map<00:01:22.049> as

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
stuff and it's a very competitive map as

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.990 
stuff and it's a very competitive map as
you<00:01:22.380> see<00:01:22.619> right<00:01:22.650> there<00:01:23.100> even<00:01:23.670> though<00:01:23.790> my

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
you see right there even though my

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.899 
you see right there even though my
friend<00:01:24.270> Eli<00:01:24.509> Whitney<00:01:24.900> was<00:01:25.500> way<00:01:26.100> behind<00:01:26.340> me<00:01:26.700> he

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
friend Eli Whitney was way behind me he

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.940 
friend Eli Whitney was way behind me he
was<00:01:27.150> able<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.540> catch<00:01:27.689> up<00:01:27.900> because<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.229> did<00:01:28.530> screw

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
was able to catch up because I did screw

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.060 
was able to catch up because I did screw
up<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.390> he<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.420> screws<00:01:30.930> up<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.259> think<00:01:31.320> up<00:01:31.799> here

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
up and he is screws up I think up here

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.440 
up and he is screws up I think up here
in<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.220> little<00:01:32.430> bit<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.909> then<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.299> know<00:01:33.420> I

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
in a little bit and then you know I

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.590 
in a little bit and then you know I
passed<00:01:33.990> him<00:01:34.170> up<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.560> everything<00:01:34.890> but<00:01:35.729> overall

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
passed him up and everything but overall

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.960 
passed him up and everything but overall
this<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.110> an<00:01:37.409> absolutely<00:01:37.920> great<00:01:38.400> map<00:01:38.729> like

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
this is an absolutely great map like

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.940 
this is an absolutely great map like
right<00:01:39.180> there<00:01:39.390> he<00:01:39.689> went<00:01:39.900> off<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.320> jump<00:01:40.799> a

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
right there he went off of that jump a

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.190 
right there he went off of that jump a
little<00:01:41.100> bit<00:01:41.280> sideways<00:01:41.579> he<00:01:42.420> didn't<00:01:42.720> make<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
little bit sideways he didn't make the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.380 
little bit sideways he didn't make the
downside<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.369> jump<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.180> caused

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
downside of the jump and so it caused

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.810 
downside of the jump and so it caused
him<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.659> wreck<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:47.130> know<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.250> got<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.520> pull

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
him to wreck and you know I got to pull

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.359 
him to wreck and you know I got to pull
through<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.810> know<00:01:48.930> got<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.409> huge<00:01:49.799> lead<00:01:50.159> now

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
through and you know got a huge lead now

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.060 
through and you know got a huge lead now
because<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.140> but<00:01:52.140> every<00:01:52.500> jump<00:01:52.799> works

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
because of that but every jump works

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.620 
because of that but every jump works
really<00:01:53.310> nice<00:01:53.549> i<00:01:53.729> would<00:01:53.939> have<00:01:54.030> really<00:01:54.270> liked<00:01:54.479> a

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
really nice i would have really liked a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.060 
really nice i would have really liked a
few<00:01:54.840> more<00:01:55.049> aesthetics<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.680> some<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:55.979> these

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
few more aesthetics in some of these

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.950 
few more aesthetics in some of these
little<00:01:56.430> areas<00:01:56.610> if<00:01:57.030> they<00:01:57.240> had<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.540> money<00:01:57.750> in

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
little areas if they had the money in

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.200 
little areas if they had the money in
pieces<00:01:58.409> i'm<00:01:58.590> not<00:01:58.770> sure<00:01:59.009> if<00:01:59.100> they<00:01:59.250> did<00:01:59.490> because

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
pieces i'm not sure if they did because

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.569 
pieces i'm not sure if they did because
this<00:02:00.570> does<00:02:00.780> look<00:02:00.960> like<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.350> used<00:02:01.890> up<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.189> lot<00:02:02.399> of

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
this does look like it used up a lot of

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.990 
this does look like it used up a lot of
money<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:02.880> pieces<00:02:03.329> but<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.490> was<00:02:05.670> certain

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
money in pieces but in that was certain

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.760 
money in pieces but in that was certain
area<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.420> starting<00:02:06.810> gate<00:02:06.960> area<00:02:07.290> would<00:02:07.649> have

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
area the starting gate area would have

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.839 
area the starting gate area would have
been<00:02:07.890> nice<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.220> have<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.369> little<00:02:08.429> bit<00:02:08.729> more

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
been nice to have a little bit more

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.460 
been nice to have a little bit more
aesthetics<00:02:09.300> kind<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:09.869> this<00:02:10.110> all<00:02:10.319> around

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
aesthetics kind of like this all around

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.949 
aesthetics kind of like this all around
right<00:02:10.860> here<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.700> looks<00:02:11.940> really<00:02:12.270> nice<00:02:12.569> i<00:02:12.750> love

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
right here it looks really nice i love

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.670 
right here it looks really nice i love
the<00:02:13.080> teleport

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the teleport

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.619 
the teleport
and<00:02:13.950> stuff<00:02:14.129> right<00:02:14.340> there<00:02:14.400> they<00:02:15.299> do<00:02:15.359> a<00:02:15.510> very

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
and stuff right there they do a very

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.910 
and stuff right there they do a very
good<00:02:16.019> job<00:02:16.230> of<00:02:16.769> making<00:02:16.890> this<00:02:17.519> map<00:02:17.760> look<00:02:18.180> good<00:02:18.420> in

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
good job of making this map look good in

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.229 
good job of making this map look good in
probably<00:02:19.920> about<00:02:20.010> ninety-five<00:02:20.730> percent<00:02:20.939> of

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
probably about ninety-five percent of

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.780 
probably about ninety-five percent of
the<00:02:21.390> sections<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.409> that's<00:02:22.859> a<00:02:22.980> really<00:02:23.010> good<00:02:23.459> job

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
the sections so that's a really good job

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.140 
the sections so that's a really good job
on<00:02:23.849> that<00:02:25.010> there's<00:02:26.010> not<00:02:26.219> too<00:02:26.459> much<00:02:26.609> else<00:02:26.879> to<00:02:27.000> say

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
on that there's not too much else to say

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.869 
on that there's not too much else to say
besides<00:02:27.359> it's<00:02:28.049> just<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.590> great<00:02:29.159> motocross

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
besides it's just a great motocross

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.050 
besides it's just a great motocross
track<00:02:30.239> I<00:02:31.109> like<00:02:31.560> how<00:02:31.709> it<00:02:31.829> goes<00:02:31.859> into<00:02:32.159> terrain

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
track I like how it goes into terrain

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.599 
track I like how it goes into terrain
and<00:02:33.450> also<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:34.019> know<00:02:34.139> goes<00:02:34.439> into<00:02:34.950> stuff<00:02:35.459> like

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
and also you know goes into stuff like

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.280 
and also you know goes into stuff like
this<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:35.909> don't<00:02:35.939> know<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.389> guess<00:02:36.719> this<00:02:36.959> will<00:02:37.139> be

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
this I don't know I guess this will be

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.369 
this I don't know I guess this will be
more<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.769> Supercross<00:02:38.549> right<00:02:38.819> here<00:02:39.109> but<00:02:40.109> it's<00:02:40.290> a

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
more of Supercross right here but it's a

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.229 
more of Supercross right here but it's a
little<00:02:40.650> bit<00:02:40.769> of<00:02:40.889> mix<00:02:41.099> of<00:02:41.280> both<00:02:41.430> but<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:41.849> do<00:02:41.969> like

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
little bit of mix of both but I do like

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.619 
little bit of mix of both but I do like
the<00:02:42.450> terrain<00:02:42.750> stuff<00:02:43.280> terrain<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.549> provides<00:02:45.269> at

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
the terrain stuff terrain it provides at

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.240 
the terrain stuff terrain it provides at
least<00:02:45.659> a<00:02:46.019> little<00:02:46.200> bit<00:02:46.349> of<00:02:46.590> things<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.159> you

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
least a little bit of things that you

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.300 
least a little bit of things that you
wouldn't<00:02:47.489> I<00:02:47.909> guess<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.569> can't<00:02:48.780> predict

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
wouldn't I guess you can't predict

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.920 
wouldn't I guess you can't predict
because<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.609> the<00:02:50.700> grass<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.389> the<00:02:51.419> hills<00:02:51.689> and

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
because of the grass and the hills and

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.319 
because of the grass and the hills and
everything<00:02:52.319> like<00:02:52.439> that<00:02:52.609> not<00:02:53.609> the<00:02:53.730> grass<00:02:54.000> the

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
everything like that not the grass the

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.020 
everything like that not the grass the
hills<00:02:54.569> and<00:02:54.780> stuff<00:02:55.019> aren't<00:02:55.409> as<00:02:55.739> I<00:02:56.250> guess<00:02:56.489> equal

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
hills and stuff aren't as I guess equal

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.259 
hills and stuff aren't as I guess equal
aren't<00:02:57.629> as<00:02:58.189> you<00:02:59.189> know<00:02:59.310> it's<00:02:59.579> they're<00:02:59.969> not<00:03:00.090> the

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
aren't as you know it's they're not the

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.449 
aren't as you know it's they're not the
same<00:03:00.299> you<00:03:01.019> can't<00:03:01.260> create<00:03:01.590> them<00:03:01.769> to<00:03:02.129> be<00:03:02.280> the

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
same you can't create them to be the

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.770 
same you can't create them to be the
same<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:02.909> stuff<00:03:03.120> so<00:03:03.299> you're<00:03:03.510> going<00:03:03.599> to<00:03:03.689> have

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
same and stuff so you're going to have

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.659 
same and stuff so you're going to have
to<00:03:03.900> really<00:03:04.109> decide<00:03:04.409> on<00:03:04.590> which<00:03:04.799> side<00:03:05.099> of<00:03:05.129> like<00:03:05.639> a

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:05.669 
to really decide on which side of like a

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:07.280 
to really decide on which side of like a
certain<00:03:06.030> he'll<00:03:06.239> you<00:03:06.389> may<00:03:06.510> want<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.780> go<00:03:06.930> on<00:03:07.079> to

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
certain he'll you may want to go on to

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.869 
certain he'll you may want to go on to
make<00:03:07.680> sure<00:03:07.829> you<00:03:07.919> get<00:03:08.040> enough<00:03:08.219> speed<00:03:08.609> for<00:03:08.669> the

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
make sure you get enough speed for the

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.839 
make sure you get enough speed for the
next<00:03:09.209> jump<00:03:09.510> stuff<00:03:10.200> like<00:03:10.349> that<00:03:10.379> but<00:03:11.280> this<00:03:11.579> track

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
next jump stuff like that but this track

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.259 
next jump stuff like that but this track
is<00:03:12.000> overall<00:03:12.450> it's<00:03:12.659> a<00:03:12.780> very<00:03:12.810> great<00:03:13.379> track<00:03:13.709> I

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
is overall it's a very great track I
