00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 very good to all how are you people 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.240
 welcome once again to the 'great' 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.160
 marian and well I will try to explain 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.620
 perfectly or good I will try 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.360
 explain as much as possible the tutorial or 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.630
 how do you want to call it how to download 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.160
 the software of our ps3 console to 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.529
 through our pc instead of going 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.080
 directly to the console is pretty 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.060
 simple the truth and good is not either 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.010
 nothing too special, so I do not think 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.810
 last too long tutorial and come on we're 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.849
 on the playstation dot com os page 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.900
 I will leave the English description we have 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.790
 what to do well then this is the page 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.030
 main is what we have to do 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.129
 is to go exploring, no need to give 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.140
 click simply put the cursor 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.200
 over and the consoles will come out 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.420
 even ps3 games as you see forgiveness with 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.129
 ps3 ps games four times even 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.370
 store inaccuracies we are going to 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.129
 rendering 3 now if we click and 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.680
 we will leave the section playstation3 here 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.079
 we are going down completely 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.760
 true around here because you have games that 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.410
 you can buy when putting here download 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.230
 for example you will see it right now here 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.550
 read from littlebigplanet 3 for example 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.490
 and you can buy directly 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.040
 from the page but well let's what 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.710
 that matters to us and below all 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.510
 we will find three fun sections 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.010
 in family great blablabla adventures 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.540
 system software updates 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.010
 this is what interests us here you have 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.800
 also the help section the typical 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.270
 help section of the pages and good 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.120
 your ps3's software is updated 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.490
 download the latest version this is 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.260
 the option that gives us to be able 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.820
 download through our pc the 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.180
 software is worth any of you 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.180
 As I said in the previous video, not the 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.230
 another that many had told me 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.240
 who have problems when it comes to 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.310
 download the console and they wanted 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.840
 Download software through the PC 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.060
 but they did not know how to do it remember that 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.340
 the last one is 4.75 and well already this and 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.990
 I explained it we were already here and well 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.780
 we are going to update through 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.980
 internet and here we are going to see this 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.270
 Download the update data 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.310
 directly in the system from 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.710
 internet the latest update 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.420
 it is downloaded automatically select 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.950
 system update settings 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.869
 select update via internet 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.830
 Download the update data 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.090
 more recent 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.410
 Internet follows the instructions that 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.500
 appear on the screen to complete the 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.260
 operation we click on download and how 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.770
 you see us a file called 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.870
 strip of what we have to do apart 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.660
 obviously it is to have a usb a pendrive 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.720
 I have already prepared the formatted 9 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.490
 right now and I have created two folders that 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.200
 are the ones that we have to create a 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:39.600
 species three is the let's say the one that is 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.130
 let's say inside we have the debt already out 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.360
 the ps3's worth it was not coming out 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.130
 and good in very important in the 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.260
 debt we will put the file that we are 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.640
 download and good now when it 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.800
 download I put it and we go 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.050
 directly to the console so far 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.180
 well we are already the console we are in the 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.470
 ps3 remember that it is not the same 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.700
 update for pc 4 that are 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.530
 different that I'll explain more 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.570
 forward is also different for 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.950
 obviously little prince and good that I've 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.080
 fact that I have done nothing what 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.430
 you saw at the beginning when I was 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.580
 has downloaded the file I have put 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.830
 inside the update folder nothing more 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.620
 I mean the file you just put it in there 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:21.250
 safely or not as you want the usb 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.010
 you connect it to your ps3 console and you will see 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.380
 as now that I have connected it I get 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.320
 here usb device which is the one that I have 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.760
 put which I have connected and good that 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.680
 we have to do to download or to 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.380
 use the file that is the same as 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.000
 we have in the usb so let's go 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.920
 always basically the same as if 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.490
 you were to update from your 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.220
 console 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.050
 we give you here and instead of giving you instead 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.790
 to give her forgiveness update through 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.110
 internet what we do because 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.540
 most 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.920
 normal then we give in update 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.120
 using a storage medium 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.490
 which in this case can be a hard drive 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.070
 or in this case a USB flash drive you 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.650
 We give the X, scan and as you see 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:03.610
 we have a version which is the last 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.920
 gentlemen 4.75 usb device location and 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.200
 well I'm not going to give the 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.580
 install because as you can read me 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.050
 says have found data from 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.090
 application of the same version of the 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.980
 current version of the system software 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.900
 and now he asks me do you want to install the 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.730
 same version obviously I'm not going to 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.590
 do because I already have the latest version 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.180
 installed but in this case this 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.530
 tutorial is to help those who do not 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.300
 you have the latest version and you do not know 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.310
 how to do it or do not let you do it from 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.080
