to get past the passwords now not always

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.279 
to get past the passwords now not always
you<00:00:21.060> remember<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.510> don't<00:00:21.630> always<00:00:21.869> remember

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
to ask for the password so this is a

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.880 
to ask for the password so this is a
good<00:00:24.539> way<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.900> actually<00:00:25.350> resetting<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
good way of actually resetting the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.040 
good way of actually resetting the
password<00:00:26.010> well<00:00:26.880> maybe<00:00:27.090> it's<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.330> friend's<00:00:27.660> PC

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.349 
password well maybe it's a friend's PC
or<00:00:28.170> something<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.590> nature<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.220> he<00:00:30.179> said

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
or something of that nature and he said

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.910 
or something of that nature and he said
you<00:00:30.480> could<00:00:30.630> use<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.199> forgot<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.710> give

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
you could use it and you forgot to give

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.700 
you could use it and you forgot to give
you<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.160> password<00:00:32.669> for<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.000> again<00:00:33.500> ok<00:00:34.500> or
