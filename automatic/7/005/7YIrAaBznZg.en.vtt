00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:10.660
 tag was created by ana viana in 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.730

 they want to know and the tag is called no 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.170
 I will not have to choose several 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.869
 products that I do not change and diesel 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.650
 because checking this tag continues 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.650
 watching the video 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.850
 There a base you do not exchange I do not 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:43.510

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.449
 it was my color and mc 35 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.070
 I'm in love with this base she has 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:49.899
 a certain tone of my skin and I 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.920
 I came to shop with only the name of the base in 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.469
 mac store 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.960
 I said I want this base and it was still there 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.570
 got the blame so much on 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.489
 If so perfectly that but 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.710
 it was love at first sight're almost done 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.230
 everything to buy a concealer that you 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.900
 Do not change the corrective that I do not change. 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.340
 It's also this one from Mac 's studio. 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.060
 fish 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.820
 nor my rw color of 5 is also the case 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.670
 superb any foot and covers very well 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.009
 for you to see how I do not change already 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.380
 I have another name here that have not 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.829
 It's over and now it's appearing 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.770
 now has begun to look like a 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:31.060
 I found it but I already have another one here. 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.670
 Keeper just waiting to be finished to use 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.549
 a lipstick that you do not trade will look like 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.470
 but it is also a mac lipstick and 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.439
 I know it's a good brush, it's already mine. 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:45.219
 second i love him because he is a tem 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:48.520
 a very soft color he is rosinha half color 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:52.000
 mouth-half with the coral is beautiful to stay 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.890
 beautiful applied and I'm in love without 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.590
 that the product has no 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.820
 if it's an excellent pick you want 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.229
 does not trade 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.970
 I think the palette is almost a 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.570
 unanimity among the majority of girls 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.060
 and mine is the one here is the law that is 2 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.890
 I'm in love with this 40 every time 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.690
 that the trip to where I was I take 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:17.290
 because it has super usable colors to 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.060
 doing several groups is very neutral to do 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.880
 both the eye well marked because it has a 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.040
 black while the neutral eye 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.140
 I'm in love with this pretension. 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.450
 always control 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.880
 the perfume that you do not exchange 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.910
 I actually have a perfume or two 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.390
 because I always using the two that is 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.720
 chanel number 5 where already at the end and 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.600
 I do not know if it's my third book then 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.070
 It is running and when it 's gone I even 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.660
 to finish the show I have already seen several 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.459
 perfume at one time did not recall the 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:03:00.820
 Portuguese wants to end when he's done 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:03:03.459
 exchange and always buy one or 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.750
 two later I have home is alone 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.110
 hoping that they had finished the 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.549
 open and when it's over I already have 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.590
 another chanel that closed close 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.269
 interweaving in slippers and today the gift 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.360
 are these two unique perfumes that I 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.640
 I use a facial primer that you do not trade 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.370
 Actually, I'm not much of a fan of the beach. 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.049
 I do not think I would have to use more 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.810
 Time was forgetting when I already 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:31.630
 I found the base and then the first one ends 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.620
 I bought it here from the apothecary of 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.570
 make b 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.110
 and I really liked it though not 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:40.390
 use a lot because we realize the 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.100
 The difference you passed and in time you see 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.430
 that the poor close 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:49.090
 while the smell which is excellent 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.680
 I have two or three at the most 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.280
 and among those three 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.640
 wounded is the one that I do not change a blush 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.030
 that you do not exchange your passion for anything 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.569
 this blush here in the analysis that is a 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.159
 orgasm 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.599
 it has a hill and can be used 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.359
 both in summer and winter because 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:15.590
 his color is very soft is a medium coral 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.370
 with particles of brightness is this beautiful 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.269
 blush 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.370
 I love it and this one also does not exchange the 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.990
 make-up remover that you do not exchange 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.550
 in fact anyone who knows me who 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.520
 accompanies know that I do not use much 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.960
 Before I even have this one, it's very 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.389
 close to Libya 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.349
 already at the end, but who uses it is June 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:38.509
 hardly use my one and striking 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:41.990
 that shampoo johnson is already in the 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:44.630
 endzinho and this video here where 750 ml 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.479
 I use so much to remove the makeup 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.150
 When I talked about the brushes 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:52.849
 So this one is a make-up remover and I 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.340
 I would not trade for anything in the world a 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:57.229
 hair product that you do not trade 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.020
 I'm wearing it the moment I'm 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:02.409
 really liking is this spray decision 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.970
 before the flora is actually a 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:07.539
 motivational technician is a thermal protector 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.880
 And we use a drier and the hat. 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:12.889
 then you can not stop using 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.680

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.659

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.099

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.919

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:33.909
 Body product you do not change the 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:33.909
