but these seem to be different than

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.319 
but these seem to be different than
ultra-wide<00:00:46.559> super<00:00:47.039> view<00:00:47.219> because<00:00:47.760> not<00:00:48.300> only

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
ultra-wide super view because not only

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.970 
ultra-wide super view because not only
do<00:00:48.660> we<00:00:48.719> have<00:00:48.750> ultra<00:00:49.110> wide<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.440> box<00:00:49.680> when<00:00:49.890> we

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
do we have ultra wide on the box when we

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.740 
do we have ultra wide on the box when we
also<00:00:50.129> have<00:00:50.399> 1080p<00:00:51.030> Super<00:00:51.300> view<00:00:51.600> which

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.689 
also have 1080p Super view which
actually<00:00:51.899> use<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.320> its<00:00:52.469> own<00:00:52.680> settings<00:00:53.010> so

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
actually use it its own settings so

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.810 
actually use it its own settings so
again<00:00:54.059> we<00:00:54.840> can<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:55.050> 1440p<00:00:55.710> up<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.219> 30<00:00:56.489> frames<00:00:56.699> a

one second all the way up to 60 seconds
similar<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.420> lot<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.990> standard<00:01:34.350> GoPros

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
similar to a lot of the standard GoPros

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.069 
similar to a lot of the standard GoPros
out<00:01:35.100> there<00:01:35.310> now<00:01:35.970> while<00:01:36.180> having<00:01:36.570> all<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.750> this

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
out there now while having all of this

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.390 
out there now while having all of this
quality<00:01:37.409> will<00:01:37.560> actually<00:01:37.890> have<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.100> ability

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
quality will actually have the ability

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.520 
quality will actually have the ability
to<00:01:38.430> enable<00:01:39.090> pro<00:01:39.390> tunes<00:01:39.659> however<00:01:40.170> it's<00:01:40.320> not

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
to enable pro tunes however it's not

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.830 
to enable pro tunes however it's not
quite<00:01:40.829> clear<00:01:40.860> what<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.909> bitrate<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.329> going<00:01:42.750> to

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
quite clear what the bitrate is going to

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.960 
quite clear what the bitrate is going to
be<00:01:43.020> when<00:01:43.229> protune<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.829> enabled<00:01:44.280> but<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.700> does

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
be when protune is enabled but it does

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.670 
be when protune is enabled but it does
lead<00:01:45.750> us<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.990> believe<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.229> we<00:01:46.439> will<00:01:46.649> have

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
lead us to believe that we will have

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.700 
lead us to believe that we will have
some<00:01:47.159> control<00:01:47.399> over<00:01:48.200> adjusting<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> camera

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
some control over adjusting the camera

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.200 
some control over adjusting the camera
and<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.950> way<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.250> camera<00:01:50.640> will<00:01:50.670> actually

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
and the way this camera will actually

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.940 
and the way this camera will actually
adjust<00:01:51.540> these<00:01:51.840> controls<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.500> either<00:01:52.680> through

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
adjust these controls is either through

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.090 
adjust these controls is either through
the<00:01:53.070> Smart<00:01:53.430> Remote<00:01:53.579> or<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.439> iphone<00:01:55.860> app

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
the Smart Remote or the the iphone app

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.069 
the Smart Remote or the the iphone app
for<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.340> android<00:01:56.430> app<00:01:56.880> basically<00:01:57.450> using<00:01:57.990> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
for the android app basically using the

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.929 
for the android app basically using the
GoPro<00:01:58.409> app<00:01:58.619> you'll<00:01:58.860> connect<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.399> has<00:01:59.610> built-in

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
GoPro app you'll connect it has built-in

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.219 
GoPro app you'll connect it has built-in
Wi-Fi<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.600> can<00:02:00.719> connect<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.200> your

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
Wi-Fi so you can connect it to your

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.020 
Wi-Fi so you can connect it to your
phone<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.710> change<00:02:02.310> all<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.579> settings<00:02:02.610> that

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
phone and change all the settings that

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.249 
phone and change all the settings that
way<00:02:03.149> because<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.420> doesn't<00:02:03.750> appear<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.960> have<00:02:04.079> an

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
way because it doesn't appear to have an

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.469 
way because it doesn't appear to have an
LCD<00:02:04.590> screen<00:02:05.189> anywhere<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:06.119> fact<00:02:06.299> it's

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
LCD screen anywhere on it in fact it's

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.169 
LCD screen anywhere on it in fact it's
only<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.719> one<00:02:07.110> button<00:02:07.320> touch<00:02:07.759> device<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.060> I'm

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
only a one button touch device so I'm

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.609 
only a one button touch device so I'm
assuming<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:09.599> one<00:02:09.810> button<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.379> start

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
assuming it's one button to start

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.930 
assuming it's one button to start
recording<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:11.220> then<00:02:11.310> if<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.489> hold<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.879> down

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
recording and then if you hold it down

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.510 
recording and then if you hold it down
that<00:02:12.840> will<00:02:13.080> turn<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.800> off<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:13.950> maybe<00:02:14.250> if<00:02:14.430> we

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
that will turn it off and maybe if we

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.040 
that will turn it off and maybe if we
double<00:02:14.819> tap<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.180> that'll<00:02:15.390> switch<00:02:15.540> modes<00:02:15.810> but

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
double tap it that'll switch modes but

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.540 
double tap it that'll switch modes but
that's<00:02:16.230> really<00:02:16.470> all<00:02:16.739> subject<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.220> change

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
that's really all subject to change

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.430 
that's really all subject to change
again<00:02:17.760> we're<00:02:18.030> going<00:02:18.150> kind<00:02:18.569> of<00:02:18.720> off<00:02:18.870> leaked

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
again we're going kind of off leaked

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.010 
again we're going kind of off leaked
information<00:02:19.920> we<00:02:20.910> do<00:02:21.030> have<00:02:21.060> highlight<00:02:21.599> tagging

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
information we do have highlight tagging

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.559 
information we do have highlight tagging
so<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.349> is<00:02:22.819> reasonable<00:02:23.819> to<00:02:23.849> think<00:02:24.030> that<00:02:24.270> while

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
so it is reasonable to think that while

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:25.940 
so it is reasonable to think that while
we're<00:02:24.750> recording<00:02:25.080> if<00:02:25.349> we<00:02:25.470> press<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.830> record

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
we're recording if we press the record

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.400 
we're recording if we press the record
button<00:02:26.220> again<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:27.270> will<00:02:27.450> highlight<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.959> tag

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
button again that will highlight a tag

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.070 
button again that will highlight a tag
but<00:02:28.770> again<00:02:28.980> not<00:02:29.640> 100%<00:02:30.180> sure<00:02:30.239> just<00:02:30.599> guessing<00:02:30.959> in

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
but again not 100% sure just guessing in

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.229 
but again not 100% sure just guessing in
and<00:02:31.260> then<00:02:31.590> we<00:02:31.650> have<00:02:31.769> Auto<00:02:31.980> light<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.519> super

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
and then we have Auto light and super

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.180 
and then we have Auto light and super
view<00:02:33.390> modes<00:02:33.629> in<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.530> box<00:02:34.739> we're<00:02:34.980> going<00:02:35.099> to

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
view modes in the box we're going to

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.460 
view modes in the box we're going to
have<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.400> gopro<00:02:35.760> hero4<00:02:36.150> session<00:02:36.599> we're<00:02:37.349> also

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
have the gopro hero4 session we're also

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.690 
have the gopro hero4 session we're also
going<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.680> have<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:37.920> mounting<00:02:38.280> frame<00:02:38.459> then<00:02:38.640> i

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
going to have the mounting frame then i

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.250 
going to have the mounting frame then i
talked<00:02:38.940> about<00:02:39.150> some<00:02:39.720> flat<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.140> curved

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
talked about some flat and curved

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.259 
talked about some flat and curved
adhesives<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.069> a<00:02:41.129> new<00:02:41.250> ball<00:02:41.519> joint<00:02:41.849> mount<00:02:42.060> and

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
adhesives and a new ball joint mount and

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.869 
adhesives and a new ball joint mount and
it's<00:02:42.660> also<00:02:42.810> compatible<00:02:43.680> with<00:02:44.069> up<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.340> 64

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
it's also compatible with up to a 64

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.210 
it's also compatible with up to a 64
gigabyte<00:02:45.300> card<00:02:45.569> and<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.410> requires<00:02:46.739> at<00:02:46.980> least<00:02:47.010> a

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
gigabyte card and it requires at least a

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.300 
gigabyte card and it requires at least a
class<00:02:47.430> 10<00:02:47.760> or<00:02:47.910> UHS<00:02:48.420> 1<00:02:48.510> micro<00:02:49.319> SD<00:02:49.709> card<00:02:49.980> so<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.220> is

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
class 10 or UHS 1 micro SD card so it is

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.820 
class 10 or UHS 1 micro SD card so it is
going<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.519> run<00:02:50.640> off<00:02:50.760> Mike<00:02:50.970> Rusty's<00:02:51.650> GoPro<00:02:52.650> is

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
going to run off Mike Rusty's GoPro is

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.900 
going to run off Mike Rusty's GoPro is
touting<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.280> it's<00:02:53.489> going<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.670> be<00:02:53.790> the

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
touting that it's going to be the

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.670 
touting that it's going to be the
smallest<00:02:54.209> lightest<00:02:54.690> GoPro<00:02:55.080> which<00:02:55.230> isn't

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
smallest lightest GoPro which isn't

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.229 
smallest lightest GoPro which isn't
really<00:02:55.739> a<00:02:55.980> surprise<00:02:56.190> considering<00:02:56.819> how<00:02:57.090> much

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
really a surprise considering how much

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.240 
really a surprise considering how much
smaller<00:02:57.599> in<00:02:57.810> such<00:02:58.349> a<00:02:58.379> different<00:02:58.650> form<00:02:58.950> factor

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
smaller in such a different form factor

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.070 
smaller in such a different form factor
it<00:02:59.340> is<00:02:59.430> compared<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.909> the<00:03:00.000> other<00:03:00.120> GoPros<00:03:00.569> it's

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
it is compared to the other GoPros it's

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.930 
it is compared to the other GoPros it's
going<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.290> weigh<00:03:01.409> a<00:03:01.440> 2.6<00:03:02.340> ounces<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.790> that's

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
going to weigh a 2.6 ounces and that's

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.309 
going to weigh a 2.6 ounces and that's
with<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.390> built-in<00:03:03.750> battery<00:03:03.959> now<00:03:04.260> the

saying you can get a two hour battery
life<00:03:08.670> but<00:03:09.330> we're<00:03:09.480> not<00:03:09.599> sure<00:03:09.629> if<00:03:09.870> that's<00:03:10.140> two

life but we're not sure if that's two

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.710 
life but we're not sure if that's two
hours<00:03:10.590> at<00:03:10.800> 1440p<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.790> more<00:03:12.000> likely<00:03:12.390> it's<00:03:12.599> at

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
hours at 1440p and more likely it's at

we have built-in Wi-Fi and we have a

dual microphone system to help reduce
wind<00:03:25.230> noise<00:03:25.379> but<00:03:25.709> we'll<00:03:25.830> actually<00:03:25.980> see<00:03:26.190> how

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
wind noise but we'll actually see how

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.100 
wind noise but we'll actually see how
that<00:03:26.670> is<00:03:26.819> once<00:03:27.090> we<00:03:27.150> can<00:03:27.360> get<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.569> in<00:03:27.690> our<00:03:27.780> hands

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
that is once we can get it in our hands

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.539 
that is once we can get it in our hands
and<00:03:28.260> that's<00:03:28.860> going<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.010> be<00:03:29.099> a<00:03:29.129> little<00:03:29.310> hard

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
and that's going to be a little hard

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:30.920 
and that's going to be a little hard
because<00:03:29.670> you<00:03:30.090> would<00:03:30.299> think<00:03:30.450> this<00:03:30.659> sort<00:03:30.840> of

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
because you would think this sort of

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.649 
because you would think this sort of
compact<00:03:31.680> GoPro<00:03:32.250> advice<00:03:32.489> maybe<00:03:32.790> is<00:03:33.030> more<00:03:33.269> for

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
compact GoPro advice maybe is more for

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:35.479 
compact GoPro advice maybe is more for
the<00:03:33.780> budget<00:03:34.080> market<00:03:34.379> but<00:03:34.500> it's<00:03:34.620> not<00:03:34.860> it's

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
the budget market but it's not it's

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.940 
the budget market but it's not it's
actually<00:03:35.580> retailing<00:03:36.209> at<00:03:36.330> three<00:03:36.709> 9999<00:03:37.709> and

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
again that is subject to change but

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.270 
again that is subject to change but
there<00:03:39.900> are<00:03:39.989> multiple<00:03:40.290> ads<00:03:40.590> out<00:03:40.830> right<00:03:41.129> now

up at their local stores for about the

up at their local stores for about the
same<00:03:45.989> price<00:03:46.519> so<00:03:47.519> one<00:03:47.640> of<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.790> last<00:03:47.909> big

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
same price so one of the last big

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.520 
same price so one of the last big
features<00:03:48.420> here<00:03:48.569> is<00:03:48.659> we'll<00:03:48.780> be<00:03:48.930> able<00:03:49.049> to<00:03:49.200> rotate

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
features here is we'll be able to rotate

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.140 
features here is we'll be able to rotate
the<00:03:49.860> camera<00:03:50.069> and<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.430> image<00:03:50.730> will<00:03:50.909> auto

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
the camera and the image will auto

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.360 
the camera and the image will auto
adjust<00:03:51.450> to<00:03:51.930> what<00:03:52.110> we're<00:03:52.260> recording<00:03:52.560> but<00:03:53.159> how

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
adjust to what we're recording but how

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.890 
adjust to what we're recording but how
far<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:53.909> how<00:03:53.939> much<00:03:54.180> will<00:03:54.390> be<00:03:54.450> able<00:03:54.780> to

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
far and how much will be able to

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.509 
far and how much will be able to
fine-tune<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.590> adjusting<00:03:56.010> has<00:03:56.129> yet<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.400> be

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
fine-tune that adjusting has yet to be

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.850 
fine-tune that adjusting has yet to be
seen<00:03:56.760> it<00:03:57.450> does<00:03:57.720> come<00:03:57.959> with<00:03:57.989> a<00:03:58.110> ball<00:03:58.349> mount<00:03:58.560> so<00:03:58.830> I

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
seen it does come with a ball mount so I

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.830 
seen it does come with a ball mount so I
am<00:03:59.040> optimistic<00:03:59.640> that<00:03:59.939> even<00:04:00.239> if<00:04:00.330> we<00:04:00.420> were<00:04:00.629> to

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
am optimistic that even if we were to

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.839 
am optimistic that even if we were to
just<00:04:01.019> tilt<00:04:01.290> it<00:04:01.409> maybe<00:04:01.620> five<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.280> 15<00:04:02.610> degrees

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
just tilt it maybe five to 15 degrees

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.729 
just tilt it maybe five to 15 degrees
off<00:04:03.030> might<00:04:03.599> digitally<00:04:03.989> auto<00:04:04.170> rotate<00:04:04.590> the

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
off might digitally auto rotate the

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.670 
off might digitally auto rotate the
image<00:04:04.890> to<00:04:05.280> be<00:04:05.400> center<00:04:06.239> however<00:04:06.959> it<00:04:07.230> might<00:04:07.470> just

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
image to be center however it might just

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.830 
image to be center however it might just
be<00:04:07.860> along<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:08.670> case<00:04:08.819> of<00:04:08.970> just<00:04:09.150> either<00:04:09.360> it's<00:04:09.599> at

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
be along the case of just either it's at

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.809 
be along the case of just either it's at
zero<00:04:09.870> or<00:04:10.379> it's<00:04:10.500> at<00:04:10.590> 90<00:04:10.860> degrees<00:04:10.920> or<00:04:11.310> it's<00:04:11.430> a<00:04:11.459> 180

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
zero or it's at 90 degrees or it's a 180

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:12.800 
zero or it's at 90 degrees or it's a 180
degrees<00:04:12.090> we<00:04:12.239> don't<00:04:12.390> really<00:04:12.569> know<00:04:12.689> if<00:04:12.720> it's

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
degrees we don't really know if it's

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.240 
degrees we don't really know if it's
going<00:04:13.019> to<00:04:13.080> do<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.290> increments<00:04:13.799> in<00:04:13.890> between

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
going to do the increments in between

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.039 
going to do the increments in between
but<00:04:14.790> again<00:04:14.970> since<00:04:15.209> it<00:04:15.299> has<00:04:15.420> that<00:04:15.599> ball<00:04:15.810> mount

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
but again since it has that ball mount

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.759 
but again since it has that ball mount
I'm<00:04:16.199> slightly<00:04:16.560> optimistic<00:04:18.350> as<00:04:19.350> far<00:04:19.530> as<00:04:19.620> the

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
I'm slightly optimistic as far as the

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.469 
I'm slightly optimistic as far as the
design<00:04:20.070> goes<00:04:20.280> again<00:04:20.609> it's<00:04:20.790> an<00:04:20.910> all<00:04:21.150> in<00:04:21.449> one

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
design goes again it's an all in one

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.870 
design goes again it's an all in one
