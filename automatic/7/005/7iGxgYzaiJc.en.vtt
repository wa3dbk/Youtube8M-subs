00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:09.900
 and I invite you to know the wall 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.440
 thermal or ecological panel a new 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.660
 option under construction when acquiring it 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.199
 are you helping the environment and 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.840
 to our economy our commitment to 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.630
 Mexico is transforming waste 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.080
 plastics in decent houses with the wall 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.300
 Thermal panel eco you ask 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.180
 why the Mexican Republic 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.090
 each of us produce close to 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.400
 one kilogram of garbage per day and this gives 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.780
 as a result around 100 thousand 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:45.280
 tons with that garbage every five days 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.890
 we would fill the Aztec stadium 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.140
 Mexico occupies one of the first places 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.660
 worldwide in the consumption of 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.320
 Disposable packaging products are 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.019
 they produce approximately 4 thousand 33 per day 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.750
 tons of plastic waste and 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:05.440
 this quantity is only recycled 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:09.369
 10 percent these are deposited in 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.740
 vacant lots canyons rivers and in the 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:15.040
 best of cases buried 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.649
 landfills thus contaminating the 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.710
 subsoil and consequently the mantos 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:23.950
 aquifers for a period of more than 500 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.890
 This gives rise to design by 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.100
 Mexican inventiveness of the ecological panel 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.740
 to build slab walls and a large 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.390
 diversity of useful elements for 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.740
 building 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:41.670
 the solution there are project programs 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.530
 laws and initiatives but 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.690
 unfortunately they are filed or are 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.320
 just for a day without being given a 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.840
 monitoring that of a real solution with 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.540
 each ecological panel would be 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.869
 reducing from 20 to 30 kilograms of 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.460
 plastic waste this is a 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.490
 reality 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.960
 with this Mexican technology 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.940
 we transform the harmful waste to 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.910
 the environment in an element 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.640
 constructive and useful for society and 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.709
 for mexico this is an opportunity to 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.620
 use construction materials 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.380
 modern best quality higher 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.989
 durability and that also deform to you 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.950
 and your children the ecological conscience of 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.770
 recycling 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.410
 It is worth mentioning that the water used 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.840
 during the industrial process it is water 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.629
 rainwater captured by the roof of the 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.959
 plant and stored in mobile warehouses 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:41.690
 which after serving the process 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.019
 recycling is conducted to be used 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.019
 in forage production to win 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.220
 We have thermal conductivity tests 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.530
 made by the institute of 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.110
 investigations in materials of the 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.630
 National Autonomous University of Mexico 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.860
 what advantages would acquire the panel 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:05.820
 ecological many is more resistant is 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.060
 acoustic thermal more economical 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.250
 lightweight than traditional systems 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.310
 Reduces installation time not 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.090
 requires specialized labor is 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.770
 more elastic in the presence of earthquakes 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.670
 resistant to saltpeter greater durability 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:26.520
 for its plastic components also 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.890
 Can cut according to the project or even 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.990
 for details presents the best 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.020
 adhesion to mortar that all 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.380
 panels can be reinforced with steel 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.940
 according to structural requirements 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.450
 allows to reduce the thickness of 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.280
 flattened into dividing walls is also 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.640
 you can apply textured 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.330
 directly on dividing walls less 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:55.070
 maneuvers less carry and elevations 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.720
 faster the only one that with using it 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.980
 we will be improving our environment 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.099
 ambient 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:05.159
 placement method will place thread and 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:08.790
 Lead the panel anchor to chain and 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:12.180
 castles the panel place castles and 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:15.410
 Chains flatten with sand cement with 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.000
 thickness of one centimeter letting it dry 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.150
 apply second layer of flattening 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.449
 optional according to the project of one or 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.669
 two centimeters this can be done to 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:30.960
 hand or with mortar launcher and 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:33.360
 receive any finish your installation 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.300
 This is done in a way 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.729
 simple since the panel is manufactured with 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.220
 two half- inch hollow ducts in the 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:44.570
 longitudinal direction to place the 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:48.270
 facilities if you so require 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:51.990
 ask your conduit panel what uses 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:56.120
 we can give the ecological panel many in 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:05:00.150
 walls slabs ruffled shoulder pads 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:04.870

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:12.070
 livestock and everything your imagination 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:16.570
 design thermal wall specifications 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:22.000
 ecological panel measures 1.22 meters 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:25.060
 by 2 points 44 meters of 23 and 4 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.420
 inches or more depending on your need 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.600
 the weight of the thermal wall without flattening is 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:35.800
 of 15 kilograms square meter in the 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:38.920
 3 inches its manufacture is subjected to 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:42.900
 an industrial recycling process that 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:45.490
 using addictive adhesives resins 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.610

 High strength steel structure 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:55.120
 gives rise to the ecological panel for a 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:57.630
 best environment for our country
