 what was happening I bring you a new video this 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.390

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.230
 gameplay of black ops 2 and good 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.790
 I put you situation was mobility

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.290
 seeks to destroy ica and the first 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.480
 so I said good since the last 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.619
 game has left me very good games 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.210
 I think it was going to be a division 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.330
 pretty good then says this has 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.360
 to be final and the second one is 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.750
 a powerful game a part to that 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.200
 like a part that can upload to the channel 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:45.530
 and well I said, look, I try hard 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:49.940
 is to see what goes there I do not know what happened 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:53.360

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.360
 let's do the first round no thanks to me 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.100
 I took care of two but they go here 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.210
 squeezed a second the captor starts 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.400
 now now 432 and well now you have to 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.310
 be mine now I do have to get 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.580
 I pick it up the disposed bomb 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.620
 to get 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.650
 the full team 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.170
 my partner always passes, people are 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.680
 that is going to sac I do not understand it anymore 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.680
 first fall 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.460
 is a this is a good position since 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.750
 see if some men come to you and they are a 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.940
 little I'm being the little connection 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.020
 better than you are going to kill happens to me 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.790
 our partner 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.720
 We have seen that you have been killed 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.180
 one takes the kill my partner see that 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.640
 I'll say I'm going to and still quiet 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.850
 I take away my position 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.740
 I'm the last one that 'is not good as 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.740
 shoot in the air so you know where 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.659
 I am to give away I'm sure this 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.179
 they would be in ve so I said good 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.920
 he gave me away and see if they come here I see 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.410
 what not 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.030
 with jovÃ© or 30 seconds left and I say 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:15.190
 good since putting the pump and 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.910
 at least that's the way they come so that 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.890
 that what he heard is placed lame he looked 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.520
 for if someone comes in shock 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.960
 now they were the now 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.560
 to see has to see over here I see the 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.930
 first that not the best is the way 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.780
 what you want but normally 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.040
 always that happens that always also 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.380
 I would have killed myself because I have a 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.750
 shit connection not now then no 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.960
 he was playing at home he was playing in 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:47.460
 a friend's house and good 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:51.300
 Well, that went out normally, it never happens to me 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.480
 this good thing here is also that it goes very 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.110
 all right 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.799
 third round we go 20 was already 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.390
 literally to fail 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:04.400
 of payment 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.150
 and I said I did good because now I will 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.130
 Saco does not kill me that shot in the head 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.970
 it was not shot in the head 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.410
 he ate it I say u and kill my partner 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.170
 triple low 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.360
 so if my gestures the trap hats x 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.150
 of fear in case I knew they had 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.590
 late left me bloodthirsty in search and 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.720
 destroy that is pretty enough 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.670
 complicated and the uncles is not that they are 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.580
 some cigars but good 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.910
 I see what's going on, said whitmer, is mine 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.580
 is mine last search and destroy 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.790
 the other one I do not know if it was a fort, I think one 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.410
 not kill him but good about me 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.880
 I left them alone has its merit forgiveness 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.410
 the bar downstairs but is that but 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.780
 I did not know at what point he has to advance 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.990
 Quick 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:55.480
 I take out all the streaks here I pass 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:58.660
 fast because the streak has been very 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.800
 painful because I went to sack enemy videos 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.380
 On the other hand, I thought that they are going to 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.680
 come then then kill so good 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.739
 he fucked up there's a little bit the game 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.840
 I was wrong there is forgiveness we can come 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.670
 but let's see, I think it was the first 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.219
 excuse the cinema mode and black ops 2 and 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.320
 it's not that I was an expert either, I know 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:18.230
 my partner back now I do not want 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.329
 then putting something together 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.699
 I went hand 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:26.810
 since I have the streak I'm going to throw 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:28.159
 the first ones more than anything to kill 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.310
 nobody but to know where are the 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:30.310
 enemies 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.770
 and my partner kills before the double 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:35.770
 low 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.770
 and goodbye my partner but that is not 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.660
 I know nobody was playing with some 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:47.200
 you know I had no idea 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.160
 just from x 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.820
 and well what do I do 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.950
 I do not know I do not know how many were left I look at it 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.480
 now 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:02.180
 there were two I think I see them there 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:04.490
 good one forgiveness one at least you 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.420
 killed I see that the other is there as the 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:11.950
 lightning on the glass this is not 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.950
 can but on the glass 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:18.239
 they are two but more than anything to launch 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:20.909
 the gusts to have a victory already 

00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:22.199
 assured man many will say was 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:24.329
 thrown by you have to have thrown 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.330
 when you're sure of that and do the 

00:05:24.329 --> 00:05:28.169
 jogging all 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.050
 was for 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.629
 for that they were there and to win the 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.509
 round and for better thanks 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:37.919
 Well, I'll get the bomb again, I say good 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:41.099
 whenever I catch the salt bomb to something 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:43.310
 so well this time I would not have 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:46.610
 see to see 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:49.280
 and already changing zone the enemies go 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.500
 I'm lame from behind but it's going to be 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.140
 it does not depend on what I liked 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.430
 mate, I do not see him anymore 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:06:00.220
 like it was not something for the chat 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.620
 is not uncle would be very bad or would be 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.990
 recharging whatever you want but never 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.290
 I had passed 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:09.420
 I'm a clown I do what I do 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:13.320
 I do what I do, I say good, I go to where 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:14.610
 I'm sure that instead I'm in a 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.660
 very open space 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:22.700
 surely they would kill 3 left I think yes the 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.700
 first dead enemy defeated 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:29.790
 I see there are two left 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:34.320
 asked me to do it's just 30 left 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:37.560
 seconds 29-28 ricargo because bring to the 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.300
 square but good that more is good 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.290
 after placing the pump I go back 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.290
 I say to see 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:48.310
 if any of me go 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:50.110
 from there I see that one comes first port 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.560
 I think the second one is shooting 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.789
 it almost killed me was there I pointed more 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:00.180
 that nothing and was wasting time 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:07:00.180
 so you do not know if it kills you 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:07.680
 and no time off the round and 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:09.249
 I played it but a lot but I thought 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.309
 I was going 

00:07:09.249 --> 00:07:16.899
 so I was going to be deactivating forgiveness 

00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:20.949
 and good of mate the truth is that almost 

00:07:16.899 --> 00:07:24.519
 last three a double low and destroy and 

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:26.469
 you're good had said nothing xD but you 

00:07:24.519 --> 00:07:29.810
 feel the objectives now so if 

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:32.870
 I do not care, we won 

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.460
 I do not care about everything, I'm really going to 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:38.740
 to play 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.740
 throws the tenth me looking at the drift 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:45.500
 miracle a little bit kills the first 

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:48.040
 comes towards the grenade 

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:51.100
 again bloodthirsty 

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:55.020
 and attentive to the moment I'm not there and 

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:55.020
 Suddenly they kill me what a pity 

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.660
 I'm so sorry that they are not life but 

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.020
 what a pity you can not see the 

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:04.960
 same repetition did not happen to me the camera and 

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:07.120
 here you see how the last 6-1 is loaded in 

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.800
 find and destroy a pretty round 

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.140
 quite a game quite pretty 

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.940
 powerful and good more than anything I hope that 

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.380
