let's talk about a few of the things
that<00:00:15.709> we<00:00:15.889> can<00:00:16.039> work<00:00:16.490> on<00:00:16.730> while<00:00:17.480> we're<00:00:17.630> in<00:00:17.750> free

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
that we can work on while we're in free

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.109 
that we can work on while we're in free
fall<00:00:18.169> let<00:00:18.860> me<00:00:18.919> cover<00:00:19.070> three<00:00:19.400> major<00:00:19.640> points

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
fall let me cover three major points

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.870 
fall let me cover three major points
slow<00:00:20.750> fall<00:00:21.250> forward<00:00:22.250> speed<00:00:22.520> and<00:00:23.020> stalls<00:00:24.880> so

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
slow fall forward speed and stalls so

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.299 
slow fall forward speed and stalls so
when<00:00:26.329> it<00:00:26.419> comes<00:00:26.540> to<00:00:26.750> slow<00:00:27.020> fall<00:00:27.290> that's<00:00:28.009> one<00:00:28.220> of

00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:28.309 
when it comes to slow fall that's one of

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:30.159 
when it comes to slow fall that's one of
the<00:00:28.369> fun<00:00:28.610> that's<00:00:28.880> one<00:00:29.000> of<00:00:29.090> the<00:00:29.149> best<00:00:29.450> parts<00:00:29.779> of

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
the fun that's one of the best parts of

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.139 
the fun that's one of the best parts of
flying<00:00:30.680> a<00:00:30.770> wingsuit<00:00:30.860> we<00:00:31.489> all<00:00:31.640> want<00:00:31.880> to<00:00:31.939> chase

flying a wingsuit we all want to chase

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.360 
flying a wingsuit we all want to chase
that<00:00:32.180> magical<00:00:32.930> number<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:33.680> slowest<00:00:34.100> we<00:00:34.219> can

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
that magical number the slowest we can

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.540 
that magical number the slowest we can
possibly<00:00:34.520> go<00:00:34.940> so<00:00:35.690> let's<00:00:36.680> go<00:00:36.920> over<00:00:37.129> a<00:00:37.160> few<00:00:37.399> of

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
possibly go so let's go over a few of

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.910 
possibly go so let's go over a few of
the<00:00:37.610> body<00:00:37.850> positions<00:00:38.329> we<00:00:38.480> can<00:00:38.629> use<00:00:38.989> trying<00:00:39.860> to

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
the body positions we can use trying to

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.759 
the body positions we can use trying to
make<00:00:40.070> ourselves<00:00:40.190> fall<00:00:40.640> slower<00:00:41.469> we<00:00:42.469> want<00:00:42.679> to

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:42.769

so let's start in our normal flying

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:53.590 
so let's start in our normal flying
position<00:01:49.490> legs<00:01:50.420> open<00:01:50.899> arms<00:01:51.799> out<00:01:52.060> relaxed<00:01:53.060> this

position legs open arms out relaxed this
is<00:01:53.750> our<00:01:53.869> neutral<00:01:54.320> body<00:01:54.500> flying<00:01:54.979> position<00:01:55.460> that

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
is our neutral body flying position that

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.190 
is our neutral body flying position that
you<00:01:55.909> went<00:01:56.179> over<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:56.570> you<00:01:56.630> learn<00:01:56.840> when<00:01:57.079> you're

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
you went over and you learn when you're
