and<00:00:58.430> the<00:00:59.430> giant<00:00:59.820> defense<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.930> incomplete

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
and the giant defense is incomplete

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.579

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
without him you know as a starter so i

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.219
