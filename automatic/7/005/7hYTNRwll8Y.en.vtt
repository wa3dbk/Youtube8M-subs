like it is now to take a take an

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
accurate shot and then in the back this

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.130 
accurate shot and then in the back this
is<00:02:08.220> super<00:02:08.640> critical<00:02:08.849> is<00:02:09.239> where<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.840> put<00:02:10.020> this

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
is super critical is where you put this

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.530 
is super critical is where you put this
when<00:02:10.379> we<00:02:10.440> want<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.649> put<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.860> kind<00:02:11.069> of<00:02:11.129> high<00:02:11.540> you

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
when we want to put it kind of high you

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.880 
when we want to put it kind of high you
know<00:02:12.629> don't<00:02:12.900> want<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.080> be<00:02:13.140> down<00:02:13.319> here<00:02:13.349> be

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
know don't want to be down here be

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.430 
know don't want to be down here be
cuz<00:02:14.040> bolt<00:02:14.970> guns<00:02:15.210> are<00:02:15.420> inherently<00:02:15.900> top-heavy

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
cuz bolt guns are inherently top-heavy

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.980 
cuz bolt guns are inherently top-heavy
so<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.430> needs<00:02:17.819> to<00:02:18.090> be<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.360> if<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.510> look<00:02:18.690> at<00:02:18.870> it

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
so it needs to be and if you look at it

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.030 
so it needs to be and if you look at it
really<00:02:19.140> what<00:02:19.380> you're<00:02:19.500> doing<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.890> you're

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
really what you're doing is you're

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.400 
really what you're doing is you're
putting<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.459> QD<00:02:21.390> mounts<00:02:21.810> on<00:02:21.990> kind<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.319> the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
putting the the QD mounts on kind of the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.130 
putting the the QD mounts on kind of the
same<00:02:22.709> plane<00:02:23.370> if<00:02:23.700> you<00:02:23.880> will<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.450> mean<00:02:24.990> you<00:02:25.050> don't

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
same plane if you will I mean you don't

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.559 
same plane if you will I mean you don't
have<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.410> measure<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.830> but<00:02:26.430> but<00:02:26.819> basically<00:02:27.060> the

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
have to measure it but but basically the

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.660 
have to measure it but but basically the
same<00:02:27.780> plane<00:02:27.990> that<00:02:28.230> way<00:02:28.890> when<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:29.220> do<00:02:29.370> put<00:02:29.580> this

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
same plane that way when you do put this

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.130 
same plane that way when you do put this
thing<00:02:29.850> on<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.090> front<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.540> back<00:02:30.570> whatever

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
thing on the front the back whatever

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.630 
thing on the front the back whatever
you're<00:02:31.320> climbing<00:02:31.530> with<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.280> gonna<00:02:32.430> lay

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
you're climbing with it it is gonna lay

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.480 
you're climbing with it it is gonna lay
flat<00:02:32.940> just<00:02:33.270> like<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.510> side<00:02:33.870> mounted<00:02:34.370> sling<00:02:35.370> on

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
flat just like a side mounted sling on

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.449 
flat just like a side mounted sling on
an<00:02:35.610> m4<00:02:35.940> would<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:37.350> last<00:02:37.560> thing<00:02:37.830> about<00:02:38.070> about

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
an m4 would the last thing about about

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.100 
an m4 would the last thing about about
Schreck<00:02:38.820> sling<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.300> have<00:02:39.450> them<00:02:39.600> on<00:02:39.660> all<00:02:39.750> my<00:02:39.900> guns

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110

and<00:02:40.620> one<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.010> reasons<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.310> like<00:02:41.489> them<00:02:41.730> is

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
and one of the reasons I like them is

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.059 
and one of the reasons I like them is
I'll<00:02:42.239> take<00:02:42.510> this<00:02:42.720> out<00:02:42.930> I'll<00:02:43.260> unhook<00:02:43.500> either

I'll take this out I'll unhook either

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.890 
I'll take this out I'll unhook either
the<00:02:44.220> front<00:02:44.370> or<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.580> back<00:02:44.610> depending<00:02:45.330> on<00:02:45.450> the

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
situation but I'll take this wrap it

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.470 
situation but I'll take this wrap it
around<00:02:48.239> a<00:02:48.570> tree<00:02:48.600> limb<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:49.470> fence<00:02:50.340> post<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:51.360> know

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
flush cups when you use that jb weld and

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.910 
flush cups when you use that jb weld and
put<00:03:09.630> them<00:03:09.720> in<00:03:09.780> there<00:03:09.900> they<00:03:09.930> are<00:03:10.230> not<00:03:10.500> coming

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
out I mean these things are bomber so

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.100

it's<00:03:14.700> it's<00:03:15.000> kind<00:03:15.060> of<00:03:15.239> a<00:03:15.330> permanent<00:03:15.630> mod<00:03:15.900> and

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
it's it's kind of a permanent mod and

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.790 
it's it's kind of a permanent mod and
it's<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.290> good<00:03:16.440> one

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
it's a good one

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.190

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
we've pretty much figured out we could

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.699 
we've pretty much figured out we could
probably<00:03:24.239> do<00:03:24.780> this<00:03:24.989> for<00:03:25.230> about<00:03:25.320> nine<00:03:25.680> hundred

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709
