00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
three favorites so when you click it

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.509 
three favorites so when you click it
even<00:02:38.440> register<00:02:38.830> it<00:02:38.920> is<00:02:39.010> your<00:02:39.160> favorite

destination<00:02:40.410> now<00:02:41.410> when<00:02:41.560> you<00:02:41.650> do<00:02:41.800> that<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.250> said

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
destination now when you do that it said

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.309 
destination now when you do that it said
it<00:02:42.670> what<00:02:42.970> it<00:02:43.090> does<00:02:43.239> actually<00:02:43.450> is<00:02:43.780> halves<00:02:44.110> the

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
it what it does actually is halves the

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.890 
it what it does actually is halves the
cost<00:02:44.560> of<00:02:44.769> teleport<00:02:45.190> in<00:02:45.340> there<00:02:45.519> so<00:02:46.510> to<00:02:46.540> do<00:02:46.870> that

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
cost of teleport in there so to do that

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.210 
cost of teleport in there so to do that
just<00:02:47.230> interact<00:02:47.590> with<00:02:47.680> them<00:02:47.800> like<00:02:47.920> I<00:02:48.040> say<00:02:48.160> you

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
just interact with them like I say you

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.520 
just interact with them like I say you
can<00:02:48.370> have<00:02:48.459> up<00:02:48.580> to<00:02:48.640> three<00:02:49.350> obviously<00:02:50.350> you<00:02:50.410> can

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
can have up to three obviously you can
