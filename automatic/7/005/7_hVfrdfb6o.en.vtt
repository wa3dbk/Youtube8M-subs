00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.050
 hello today to do the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.179
 swatch apples king lip gloss from 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.559
 shehem murat so you promised to 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.599
 do the video so I'm doing it at the 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.330
 after that it's done 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.820
 I will not read you to do it so it's 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.140
 party I make you the swatch of cetti 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.449
 product so you have to know that it was 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.180
 league the bone that are receding per year so 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.369
 who tears a lot and who stings so if 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.140
 you do not have that ankle sensation 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.210
 and that kind of product maybe it's 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.700
 not ideal for you so really the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.930
 feeling like having lips like that 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.300
 what but after visual I do not think so 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.059
 finally I do not think so I'm going 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.070
 start with both actually I have 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.160
 two who are my pie they are there so 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.480
 it is from here a nude and a 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.420
 orange orange 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.239
 so did they denounced small 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.890
 yeah so here's me that's what manages 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.799
 with the sienna who has small 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:10.670
 golden glitter that to orange and that's it 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:13.290
 I do not know if you can see that's 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.390
 so it's the languages ​​or moussin that 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.560
 are very very very long I do not know if 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.590
 you realize in relation to my 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:24.090
 hand it's just hyper a so I you 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:28.920
 do the swatch so it's really great 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.290
 super mega pigmented so that's it 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.060
 really gives the rendering of the tube so 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.079
 that's cool I do not know if you can 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.329
 capture the little glitter and then 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.979
 we have the nude so that is a nude with 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:46.290
 sequins of golden glitter and 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.149
 so compared to the other news 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.329
 see it's a little brighter more 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:56.759
 go for it so it's there so this one 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:02:00.060
 it's the beef chip here it is here 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.640
 so it's a news to semmar sounded so 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.030
 I think it's not bad for the 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.390
 clear skin 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.610
 summer is for otherwise matte skins 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.539
 winter it can be no we have one who 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.270
 is a little bit of the cre is so 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.230
 this one was a little if I had seen 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.390
 like that I think I would not have taken 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:21.959
 the pearly with bluish reflections I 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:25.050
 find it's the ping sugar that's what 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.930
 give see he is he has reflections 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.459
 in fact we will continue with the roses 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.459
 this is the show king pink 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:40.620
 that 's who has a petulant pink he's 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.790
 totally wrong this one and I mean 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.280
 that they hold quite well anyway 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.030
 I tested one the other time to see 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.130
 rendering all that they come pretty well 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.690
 so that's what gives the ve 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.690
 fuchsia end purple fuchsia 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.970
 then you have a blazing red 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.560
 here and just at the point 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:18.290
 then we have a rose the spoiler the candy 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:18.290
 pink so that's what he's ton 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.650
 and to finish I finish with the nude 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.270
 which is simply called nude 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.220
 who really use it very very clear 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.670
 i love this kind of better for winter 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.670
 Who is here 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.440
 So that's it for these little cares 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.570
 of sailboats it is hyper hyper pigmented 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.550
 for kids you can wear them 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:50.240
 all by itself actually like a red to 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.500
 lips that holds pretty well it does not stick 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.940
 that I do not think it sticks 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.100
 more than that by against the effect replu the 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.960
 bread is really super surprising so 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.410
 if you do not have that I do not recommend 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.230
 to take these cds these kids but otherwise 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:07.790
 beyond that I like a lot 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.990
 here they are really super beautiful here 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.880
 so I hope this little video 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.380
 could have helped you that you liked 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.970
 I make you very very big kisses and 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.970
 I tell you very soon ciao
