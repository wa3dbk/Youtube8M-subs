Gord let me go ahead and restart this so

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:36.520 
Gord let me go ahead and restart this so
we<00:00:34.790> basically<00:00:34.940> shoot<00:00:35.570> one<00:00:35.750> of<00:00:35.840> these<00:00:35.930> statues

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
we basically shoot one of these statues

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.220 
we basically shoot one of these statues
to<00:00:36.829> determine<00:00:37.640> our<00:00:37.760> level<00:00:38.600> I<00:00:38.660> just<00:00:38.930> picked

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
to determine our level I just picked

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.110 
to determine our level I just picked
expert<00:00:39.950> or<00:00:40.100> I<00:00:40.250> don't<00:00:40.610> know<00:00:40.670> what<00:00:40.820> I<00:00:40.850> picked

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
actually but the whole point of this is

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.950 
actually but the whole point of this is
to<00:00:42.950> run<00:00:43.250> around<00:00:43.280> and<00:00:43.700> blast<00:00:44.000> up<00:00:44.300> these<00:00:44.480> little

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
to run around and blast up these little

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.260 
to run around and blast up these little
these<00:00:45.590> little<00:00:45.920> monsters<00:00:46.399> that<00:00:46.760> come<00:00:46.940> running

some some of the the most difficult the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.710 
some some of the the most difficult the
insane<00:01:05.990> level<00:01:06.350> is<00:01:06.440> incredibly<00:01:07.070> hard<00:01:07.479> but<00:01:08.479> very

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
fun game that's the first game we have

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.450 
fun game that's the first game we have
the<00:01:10.520> next<00:01:10.790> game<00:01:10.970> is<00:01:11.000> mr.<00:01:11.600> off<00:01:11.890> mr.<00:01:12.890> all<00:01:13.040> the

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
the next game is mr. off mr. all the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.730 
the next game is mr. off mr. all the
objective<00:01:13.970> is<00:01:14.060> this<00:01:14.270> is<00:01:14.479> to<00:01:14.659> swing<00:01:14.990> basically

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
objective is this is to swing basically

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.450 
objective is this is to swing basically
into<00:01:16.610> jump<00:01:16.939> onto<00:01:17.270> new<00:01:17.420> platform<00:01:18.220> so<00:01:19.220> you'll

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
into jump onto new platform so you'll

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.340 
into jump onto new platform so you'll
automatically<00:01:20.090> start<00:01:20.509> swinging<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:21.200> whole

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
automatically start swinging the whole

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.870 
automatically start swinging the whole
point<00:01:21.530> is<00:01:21.710> to<00:01:21.740> get<00:01:21.920> as<00:01:22.070> close<00:01:22.250> to<00:01:22.400> the<00:01:22.700> bullseye

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
point is to get as close to the bullseye

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.710 
point is to get as close to the bullseye
as<00:01:23.330> you<00:01:23.509> can<00:01:24.520> through<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:25.549> level<00:01:26.119> though<00:01:26.360> you

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
as you can through the level though you

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.490 
as you can through the level though you
get<00:01:27.820> gravity<00:01:28.820> changes<00:01:29.090> up<00:01:29.540> the<00:01:29.780> wind<00:01:30.049> changes

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
get gravity changes up the wind changes

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.130 
get gravity changes up the wind changes
up<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:31.150> it<00:01:32.150> actually<00:01:32.420> gets<00:01:32.720> incredibly

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
up and it actually gets incredibly

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.560 
up and it actually gets incredibly
difficult<00:01:33.619> through<00:01:34.430> some<00:01:34.729> of<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:34.970> higher

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
difficult through some of the higher

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.230 
difficult through some of the higher
levels<00:01:35.930> so<00:01:36.049> there<00:01:36.200> we<00:01:36.380> had<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.680> wind<00:01:37.119> and<00:01:38.119> I'll

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
levels so there we had the wind and I'll

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.609 
levels so there we had the wind and I'll
play<00:01:38.450> it<00:01:38.479> so<00:01:38.750> you<00:01:38.810> can<00:01:38.990> see<00:01:39.170> a<00:01:39.200> little<00:01:39.470> bit

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
play it so you can see a little bit

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.679 
play it so you can see a little bit
that's<00:01:40.220> that<00:01:40.430> was<00:01:40.729> a<00:01:40.759> perfect<00:01:41.210> right<00:01:41.299> there<00:01:41.360> so

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
that's that was a perfect right there so

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.210 
that's that was a perfect right there so
you<00:01:41.780> get<00:01:41.930> a<00:01:41.960> thousand<00:01:42.439> points<00:01:42.590> for<00:01:42.860> landing

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
you get a thousand points for landing

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.350 
you get a thousand points for landing
right<00:01:43.369> in<00:01:43.400> the<00:01:43.670> bullseye<00:01:45.939> and<00:01:46.939> play<00:01:47.210> a<00:01:47.240> few

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
right in the bullseye and play a few

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.210 
right in the bullseye and play a few
more<00:01:47.810> of<00:01:47.960> these<00:01:48.140> so<00:01:48.500> you<00:01:48.530> can<00:01:48.860> see<00:01:49.070> what

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
more of these so you can see what

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:56.670 
more of these so you can see what
happens<00:01:49.670> when<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:49.939> gravity<00:01:50.149> changes<00:01:50.630> up

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.620 

very<00:01:57.680> easy<00:01:58.039> pick<00:01:58.759> up<00:01:58.909> and<00:01:59.060> place<00:01:59.210> so<00:01:59.420> there's

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
very easy pick up and place so there's

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.959 
very easy pick up and place so there's
the<00:01:59.810> gravity<00:02:00.289> now<00:02:00.939> and<00:02:03.039> again<00:02:04.039> it<00:02:04.280> just<00:02:04.520> gets

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
the gravity now and again it just gets

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:06.850 
the gravity now and again it just gets
progressively<00:02:05.149> harder<00:02:05.780> through<00:02:06.200> oops<00:02:06.590> in

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
progressively harder through oops in

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.130 
progressively harder through oops in
that<00:02:07.009> one<00:02:07.219> I<00:02:07.520> died<00:02:08.149> so<00:02:08.420> you<00:02:08.479> just<00:02:08.720> start<00:02:08.959> back

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
that one I died so you just start back

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.930 
that one I died so you just start back
to<00:02:09.349> where<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:09.619> were<00:02:09.739> so<00:02:10.310> that's<00:02:10.459> the<00:02:10.580> second

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
to where you were so that's the second
