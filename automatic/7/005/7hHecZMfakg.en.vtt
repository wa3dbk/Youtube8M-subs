00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.710
 ah 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:18.910
 hello in this tutorial you will learn how to make 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:21.310
 a box hype is a very nice box is 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.590
 very easy to do in this case because I 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.570
 I made it small 5 x 5 centimeters 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.300
 but you can make it much bigger 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.390
 and fill it chocolates for example 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.710
 whatever you want me in this case 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.000
 I have put a bear and a 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.430
 chocolate and tablet because others 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.520
 chocolates and a super big bun you 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.950
 you can use a smaller bow and it's 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.079
 decorating it as you want is so striking 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.240
 as you want or very simple because 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.960
 it's a super nice little box 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:55.469
 we are going to need pencil or pencil 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.469
 we will need scissors also rule 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.050
 papelillo 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.870
 obviously we need chocolate is a 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.330
 chocolate 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.240
 the little detail you want to add in this 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.240
 case I just quote 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.240
 drill 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.120
 stickers if you want to decorate 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.170
 a big magic bun or you can use 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.610
 tape make your own moi or paper 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.290
 decorative that you can download from the 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.210
 information of the video or in the name 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.020
 this video there is a url address for 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.899
 download it 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.460
 and cardboard in this case a square of 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.460
 15 x 15 centimeters 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.720
 the decorative paper is for this 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.610
 measure for the 15 x 15 then yes 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.630
 you want to make it bigger because the paper 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.939
 It will not work 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.820
 also if you want you can use paper 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.500
 cellophane stamped me the truth not what 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.110
 use but if you want you can do it 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.149
 the first thing we are going to do is good the 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.630
 square of you have cut out of 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:05.840
 15 x 15 centimeters with the rule you will 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.850
 mark every 5 centimeters that is to say 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.850
 5 and 10 centimeters 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.740
 likewise on the other side 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:23.070
 perfect now let's double 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.960
 in this way in this case I have 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.180
 a very thick cardboard so that 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.180
 I must mark the folds very well 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:36.490
 here mark a vertical line 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.890
 and I will do the same 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:43.380
 with this part 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.380
 at 5 centimeters memories 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.700
 this way I'm going to do it in all the 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:48.700
 cardboard 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.460
 remember to mark the folds very well 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.140
 when you have finished you will have two 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.680
 vertical lines and two horizontal lines of 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.519
 this way 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.049
 for the following pay close attention 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.370
 I will again mark the folds 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.930
 as I told you I have a cardboard 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.280
 pretty thick then it's my turn 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.740
 mark them very well 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.780
 and we are going to do the following you are going to take 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.740
 the corner and the classrooms of the next 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.250
 way 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.890
 you are going to form a kind of triangle 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:32.470
 look at it from this force 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.750
 you take the corner and bend it escassi 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.860
 you see that a triangle is formed and there you go 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.860
 to mark the bend 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.890
 It is very easy 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.890
 let's see it again in slow motion 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:52.400
 you take the corner 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:55.310
 and press the square together the two 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.569
 the other two squares and it's going to 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.430
 form a triangle 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:03.689
 you arrange everything so that it is 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:07.370
 perfectly straight and once you have 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:10.519
 the triangle marks in the doubles 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.659
 and ready to do with all with all 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.659
 the corners the same 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:26.539
 very good now I'm going to use 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.340
 the decorative paper here because I already have 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:30.340
 marked all folds very well 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:38.330
 and the decorative paper I want to clarify 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.330
 I printed it on adhesive paper 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.110
 then you have no paper 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.710
 adhesive you can print a plain paper 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:50.020
 a normal sheet with glue in bar 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.250
 you help and stick it on the square 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.250
 15 x 15 centimeters 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.229
 Once you've stuck marks 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.229
 again all the folds 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.330
 ready now I will do with the 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.580
 drilling the holes where it goes to 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.210
 pass the chair that is going to make the 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.200
 box 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.980
 stay closed 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:24.410
 and it should be this way 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.040
 here he has already put paper and I with 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.040
 the sweets 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:36.120
 the bear 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:38.520
 and I'm going to close it with this bun 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.320
 Passing it through the holes and at the end 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.889
 I'm going to tie the bow to open the box 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.260
 you remain tied ready as you can see 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:49.020
 Well, it's very easy to do, I hope you 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.910
 I liked that you can like it 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.100
 this video share it with your friends 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.080
 and you can make all the decorations 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.270
 What do you want from this box if I want the 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.170
 can give much bigger and I hope that 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.170
 you liked bye 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.600
 Y
