 vansen produced that dry shot 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:11.409
 which meant he had the upper hand 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:14.810
 really really exciting but anyway 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:16.970
 they really deserve great big

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.570
 historic closes with a second place that 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.630
 if it is not a victory we are lacking 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.030
 really really a pinch and three 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:39.220
 wins a second place lottery a 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.449
 follow and not counting the very first

 performance of five years ago make of 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.740
 this case really a decline that enters 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.800
 in history the notes are clear 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.440
 honor of the chronicle goes only to the 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.020
 winner but always this mare 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.370
 we had said fabrizio decided it 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.460
 to come and run 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.820
 the tavern and one that never moves 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.490
 random 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.700
 and so was roberto andreghetti 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:08.400
 he once again had to be the 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.350
 executioner of the thesis of the horse that 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.690
 it probably gave him the biggest ones 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:16.620
 satisfactions but this is the law of 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:19.770
 true sport what what between me and 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.920
 he didn't help before and let's remember 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:27.410
 like a good soccer player who makes room for 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.410
 the opposing team did not exult
