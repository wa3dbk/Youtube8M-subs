00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
mashed potatoes because so every time

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.740 
mashed potatoes because so every time
you<00:03:21.660> take<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:21.959> bite<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.410> get<00:03:22.560> a<00:03:22.620> different

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.770 
you take a bite you get a different
flavor<00:03:24.750> so<00:03:25.260> it's<00:03:25.410> not<00:03:25.560> only<00:03:26.220> one

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780
