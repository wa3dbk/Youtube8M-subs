00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
a little bit because now those 30 40 50

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.970 
a little bit because now those 30 40 50
kindergarteners<00:02:12.700> instead<00:02:13.240> of<00:02:13.330> only<00:02:13.480> riding

half the time will now be able to ride
all<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.500> time<00:02:17.530> so<00:02:17.860> it<00:02:17.950> it<00:02:18.400> will<00:02:18.610> increase<00:02:19.209> the
