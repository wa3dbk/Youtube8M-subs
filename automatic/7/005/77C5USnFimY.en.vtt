00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 the lower layers of the atmosphere of 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.540
 Jupiter and Saturn can contain 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.730
 huge diamonds while in their 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.040
 Top layers can rain down diamonds 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.380
 due to the very high pressure 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.440
 on those giant planets and the heat of 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.779
 his insides so some think 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.760
 astronomers who have spoken in the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.650
 annual paleontological meeting of the 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.710
 American astronomical society held 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.599
 in denver for a long time the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.130
 scientists have assumed that 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.399
 entrails of the giant planets 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.469
 could contain giant diamonds whose 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.140
 size could reach that of a large 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.719
 iceberg it's still not clear if you're 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.760
 jewels are in the atmosphere of 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.160
 the gas giants of our system 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.170
 solar since its training requires 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.030
 a special combination of high 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.399
 temperature and pressure so that the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.649
 immense diamond will remain stable and 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.690
 I can keep growing 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.239
 lipsky monk of the institute of 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.520
 california technology and kevin baines 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.340
 from the University of Wisconsin Madison 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.530
 believe that those precious stones are 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.870
 present in the lower layers of the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.270
 atmosphere of jupiter and saturn 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.190
 they came to this conclusion after analyzing 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.810
 the data on density the 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.360
 temperature and pressure of 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.720
 atmospheres of those planets collected in 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.390
 the last five years as explained by the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.640
 scientists in the upper layers of 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.010
 the atmosphere of those great planets to 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.530
 often there are storms during which a 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.810
 part of the hydrocarbons becomes 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.790
 in graphite or carbon black 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.860
 this material falls to the bottom of 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.050
 the atmosphere of the giants where 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.720
 is influenced by a combination 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.210
 of temperature and pressure is transformed 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.390
 in micro diamonds and continues to move 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.730
 towards the nucleus of the giants there 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.620
 melt and it becomes the liquid one 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.690
 part of which can float towards the 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.730
 atmosphere of Saturn and Jupiter and 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.350
 become large diamonds that 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.570
 can grow thanks to new 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.970
 incorporations from the nucleus 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.370
 of the planets that's why the scientists 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.230
 they defend their hypothesis that the heavens 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:08.300
 of hydrocarbons of Jupiter and Saturn 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.300
 They can be full of diamonds
