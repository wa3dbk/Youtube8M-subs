get<00:00:24.480> into<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.920> basically<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.430> what<00:00:26.519> you

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
get into it basically this is what you

get into it basically this is what you
want<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.849> do<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.410> like<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.650> grab<00:00:28.859> my<00:00:29.189> zoom<00:00:29.820> h1<00:00:30.029> and

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
want to do I like to grab my zoom h1 and

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.580 
want to do I like to grab my zoom h1 and
I'm<00:00:31.230> fix<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.980> with<00:00:32.160> standard<00:00:33.120> sm58<00:00:33.899> windscreen

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
I'm fix it with standard sm58 windscreen

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.959 
I'm fix it with standard sm58 windscreen
this<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> windscreen<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.730> goes<00:00:35.850> on

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
this is a windscreen that goes on

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.750 
this is a windscreen that goes on
general<00:00:36.809> microphones<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:38.100> reason<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.460> use

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
general microphones the reason I use

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.549 
general microphones the reason I use
this<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.210> because<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.690> does<00:00:39.870> reduce<00:00:40.320> some<00:00:40.530> of

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
this is because it does reduce some of

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.290 
this is because it does reduce some of
the<00:00:40.680> harshness<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.550> high<00:00:41.760> end<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
the harshness of the high end that the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.440 
the harshness of the high end that the
zoom<00:00:42.480> h1<00:00:42.660> seems<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.440> record<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:45.000> that's

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
zoom h1 seems to record that that that's

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.440 
zoom h1 seems to record that that that's
that<00:00:46.320> very<00:00:46.800> high<00:00:47.039> end<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.670> also<00:00:47.820> does<00:00:48.210> help

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
that very high end and it also does help

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.330 
that very high end and it also does help
reduce<00:00:48.690> some<00:00:49.110> just<00:00:49.590> general<00:00:49.800> wind<00:00:50.160> noise

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
reduce some just general wind noise

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.160 
reduce some just general wind noise
handling<00:00:50.820> noise<00:00:51.000> like<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:51.690> moving<00:00:52.079> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
handling noise like this just moving the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.500 
handling noise like this just moving the
mics<00:00:52.379> over<00:00:52.910> back<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.120> forth<00:00:54.300> like<00:00:54.449> that

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
mics over back and forth like that

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.930 
mics over back and forth like that
actually<00:00:54.930> will<00:00:55.800> pick<00:00:56.010> up<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.399> mics<00:00:56.579> are<00:00:56.699> very

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
actually will pick up the mics are very

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.540 
actually will pick up the mics are very
sensitive<00:00:57.469> next<00:00:58.469> we<00:00:58.590> grab<00:00:58.800> our<00:00:58.949> little<00:00:59.039> camera
