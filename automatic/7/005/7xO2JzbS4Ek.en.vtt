00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:04.640
 Hello and welcome to Thursday Swette Dhabi and death begins 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.260
 to come to Better Cotton and Robert Beyer Spunk and the affiliated 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.579
 Peter Eichhorn 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:13.160
 with the news that there was no big change however on Thursday in the 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:16.619
 On the fifth day, at least for a while Aachen will not separate Aachen 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:17.090
 modification 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.180
 they happen on the fourth of October but afterwards more of them 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.600
 the only problem is what limits the sunshine duration than he does 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.099
 traditional 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.429
 Art and solar the sunshine duration forecast but supposedly fantastic 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.210
 nice sponsor and solar power expert 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.720
 with the party 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.710
 and it is almost everywhere nine to twelve hours should be new to where 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.420
 Fog fields are active and cool almost everywhere in the cellars 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.810
 There are a few fog fields 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.220
 However, there is needed in the south as plant locations 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.640
 and partly even Upper Bavaria percent to then the Danube 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.900
 In Bavaria also areas where the fog and high fog keeps longer because of here too 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.200
 no 4 to 8 hours but as I said that 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.960
 only applies to the valleys on top of the mountain in the home are it from the front 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.489
 purely 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.280
 twelve hours, then 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.210
 the maximum is already the whole is explained Don the sun shines more 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.250
 Fog high fog way or there and fog high fog are not even 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.330
 there are 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.460
 the temperatures in Spenge so far different there 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.570
 in the south is no longer the warmest because just this warm 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.820
 Air can no longer enforce to one hundredfold 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.640
 there partly under 20 degrees turn fog haze keeps longer 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.790
 and otherwise the highest temperatures in MÃ¼hlried with the southeast of Eifel 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.670
 and Sauerland with up to 27 degrees in parts of north Rhine-Westphalia and the wind 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.830
 over Baselbiet northern and Baltic Sea for a long time even under 20 degrees 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.330
 and now the thing with the 15 day trend 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.250
 that I have developed a bit further is the realization that it is after all 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.010
 this fall in temperature around the fourth fifth of October we remain so 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.240
 until the third unfortunate of the very warm air and then came this one 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.300
 dramatic fall in temperature Fourth fifth of October at 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.920
 and after that we are well below normal for at least two days 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.520
 Season and then the department comes back here 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.670
 everything goes between cold record and heat record more or less everything 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.470
 that means that on the sixth of the seventh of October you can not do that at all 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.590
 say what happens but as said GC would have distributed the sticking cards 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.969
 or at least 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:26.210
 on Twitter and here on Facebook we are on the go more 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.450
 Often there will be informed about where and how they are there 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.740
 there all the best and now
