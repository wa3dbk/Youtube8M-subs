 russia and not against it zero from none 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.700
 interested in the new split of europe we 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.190
 want to build security together with 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.809
 Russia, Moscow should contribute to 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.579
 solution to the crisis in Ukraine 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.469
 military ways we can not 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.020
 decide therefore steps need to be taken 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.210
 aimed at the implementation of the Minsk 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.430

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.110
 including negotiations in Kiev and Moscow is very 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.890
 glad to be here today 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.890
 President Poroshenko 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.790
 after yesterdayâ€™s talks in Moscow with 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.340
 President of France Francois Holland I 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.020
 I must say that we still do not know 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.450
 will they bring success but this visit 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.180
 made sense it was our duty by 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.500
 towards people who suffer 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.080
 next takes the head of mid Russia 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.570
 Sergey Lavrov emphasizes the conflict on 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.770
 Ukraine should be resolved 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.930
 diplomatically they are with weapons in 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.810
 hands and immediately reminds on each 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.940
 crisis stage and usa and europe only 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.030
 added fuel to the fire very difficult for us 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.220
 explain why in the minds of many of ours 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.320
 colleagues in Ukraine do not apply 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.810
 universal principles of regulation 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.450
 internal conflicts these principles 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.710
 suggest primarily 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.590
 inclusive and political dialogue between 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.160
 protagonist why case for example with 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.190
 Afghanistan and cancer and Yemen Ali 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.020
 southern sudan our partners persistently 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.580
 urge governments to negotiate with 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.750
 opposition from the rebels 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.010
 even with extremists in individual cases 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.050
 in relation to the Ukrainian crisis 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.790
 act differently actually indulging 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.350
 power operation of Kiev up to 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.350
 excuses or attempts to justify 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.910
 laurel cluster munitions 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.830
 also says Russia will continue 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.170
 seek cessation of hostilities 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.000
 start of direct negotiations with the condition 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.400
 preservation of territorial integrity 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.380
 Ukraine, he calls to evaluate the actions 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.580
 Kiev authorities objectively blind 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.160
 west support 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.840
 only aggravates the tragedy is not necessary 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.420
 hope it seems to me our Ukrainian 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.530
 colleagues on the fact that here it is 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.350
 reckless 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:53.100
 support which they receive from 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:56.150
 hand she will solve all the problems for me 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.890
 it seems that this support is absolutely 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.010
 devoid of any critical analysis 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.250
 what's going on this support is also circling 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.989
 head which is not also like her in 2008 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.910
 year turned a lord 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.980
 Saakashvili everyone knows that from this you went 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.500
 overseas guest usa vice president 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.660
 his speech began with praises europe he 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.180
 Considers the basis of US interaction with 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.760
 the whole world and then criticized 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.269
 russia said moscow is trying to split 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.920
 Ukraine 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.079
 Russian aggression a lot and 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.900
 temperamental told Peter Poroshenko 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:30.180
 with the skill of a magician Ukrainian or 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:35.129
 demonstrated by the attendant irrefutable 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:37.379
 evidence in military passport about food 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.209
 and I took with me passports and military 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.430
 Russian military tickets 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.500
 This is a clear proof of Russian 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.810
 Poroshenko told a lot of aggression 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.390
 the situation in the east of the country about the number 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.909
 victims and refugees urged to sit at the table 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.530
 negotiations and we are president of peace 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.170
 whether you are about and procurement 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.909
 I am the president of the world is not a war I am sure that 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.379
 only minsk memorandum and minsk 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.599
 protocol he would be the way 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.220
 settlement of the situation in Ukraine 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.379
 the end of the speech Poroshenko called 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.750
 the global community to assist in 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.250
 political economic and military 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.819
 the sphere 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.620
 sergey polyakov world 24 one more 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.659
 proposal made in the Ministry of Finance 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.970
 introduce peacekeeping in Ukraine 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:20.810
 contingent but Peter Poroshenko this idea is not 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.810
 supported
