00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:58.850
 there is a label with one 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:02:01.720
 on the glass, respectively, we are with him and that 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.720
 same side will glue 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:14.580
 align the smartphone to the bottom 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.769
 with her glass at the smartphone parallelism 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.440
 we will control two with two 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:24.980
 other fingers and press down 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:32.459
 part now quietly quietly 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:35.760
 start moving up here it is in such 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.500
 the form we begin to stick important 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.890
 so that air bubbles are not there 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.890
 remained 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:52.830
 everything is ready let's we now also 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:11.969
 we wipe our hands 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:12.900
 then try to run it as 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:14.400
 see everything perfect 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.200
 actually work with glasses 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.000
 much easier hour films because 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:23.670
 they are proud but fragile here in my hands 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.650
 such a glass now show how it is 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:31.680
 breaks about and all of the glass of your hands 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.049
 there is no time for it she is hard but fragile 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.900
 so be careful when laying 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.840
 big big stress she's kinked 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.989
 she couldn't take it anyway 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.209
 for another 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.189
 so now the next moment related 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.900
 glass but except that they can than 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:51.659
 it is easy to scratch quite calmly 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.689
 take the scissors there tools drive along 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:58.940
 nothing will be to glasses 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:04:05.729
 Another property is how to push a little 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:08.729
 then roll the charter 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:14.069
 view there is little or no ie 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:16.169
 here is a pretty serious oleophobic 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:19.169
 coating of this, he still 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:24.979
