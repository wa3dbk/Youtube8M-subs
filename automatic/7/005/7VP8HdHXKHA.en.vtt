00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.359
 I'm also here why everybody 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.830
 quite a long time 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:23.539
 I have no idea now comes 100 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.539
 years but then it's second 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.180
 old where does he come from now this is real 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.180
 I puke when I'm already running 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:43.320
 yes that is very useful again 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.980
 as red worthy of a me ever 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:55.400
 need, we have a was live 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:55.400
 I think it works better with him here 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.899
 because I know I have no bock education to 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:16.899
 now run into the micro 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:35.110
 good things were in shock that was not 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.110
 been clear 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.469
 be ok about it 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:06.810
 Danger 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:06.810
 he thought he had started me 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.620
 where I once had the preference 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.810
 so flies over the gate 23 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:49.140
 usually nothing is for that 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:03:08.240
 is it your whole nation 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:03:08.240
 moved up 30 13 but is more bad 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.830
 Moth factor is ok 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.830
 But all 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:58.799
 Duisburg 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.799
 40 1 you can leave that alone 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:17.580
 so currently adjusted to 41 1
