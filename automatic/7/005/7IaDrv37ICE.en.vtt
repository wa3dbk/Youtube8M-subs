at<00:00:26.670> first<00:00:26.699> there'll<00:00:27.359> be<00:00:27.390> an<00:00:27.570> annotation<00:00:27.779> link

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
at first there'll be an annotation link

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.070 
at first there'll be an annotation link
on<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.220> screen<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.789> go<00:00:30.210> check<00:00:30.510> out<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.689> video

on the screen to go check out that video
first<00:00:31.529> but<00:00:32.340> now<00:00:32.579> we're<00:00:33.120> going<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.329> do

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
first but now we're going to do

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.750 
first but now we're going to do
something<00:00:33.690> similar<00:00:34.230> but<00:00:34.620> using<00:00:35.070> some<00:00:35.100> triplet

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
something similar but using some triplet

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.880 
something similar but using some triplet
subdivisions<00:00:36.510> so<00:00:37.260> we're<00:00:37.380> going<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.530> start<00:00:37.770> off

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
subdivisions so we're going to start off

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.160 
subdivisions so we're going to start off
with<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.129> basic<00:00:38.370> pattern<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.149> on<00:00:39.450> beat<00:00:39.809> 4

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
with a basic pattern and on beat 4

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.260 
with a basic pattern and on beat 4
that's<00:00:40.649> our<00:00:40.860> second<00:00:41.280> snare<00:00:41.520> stroke<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.120> this

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
that's our second snare stroke in this

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.270 
that's our second snare stroke in this
pattern<00:00:42.540> we're<00:00:42.960> going<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.170> break<00:00:43.469> into<00:00:43.800> a

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
pattern we're going to break into a

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.979 
pattern we're going to break into a
sixteenth<00:00:44.760> note<00:00:44.879> triplet<00:00:45.539> which<00:00:45.719> will<00:00:45.840> then

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
sixteenth note triplet which will then

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.500 
sixteenth note triplet which will then
bring<00:00:46.260> us<00:00:46.500> back<00:00:46.739> around<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.610> loop<00:00:47.850> back<00:00:48.120> into

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
bring us back around to loop back into

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.529 
bring us back around to loop back into
beat<00:00:48.870> one<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.710> next<00:00:49.980> bar<00:00:50.239> sounds<00:00:51.239> more

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
beat one of the next bar sounds more

00:00:51.539 --> 00:01:22.730 
beat one of the next bar sounds more
complicated<00:00:51.719> than<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.469> here<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.100> go<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.990> so

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
complicated than it is here we go and so

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.920 
complicated than it is here we go and so
when<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.009> practice<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.670> make<00:01:24.330> sure<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.720> use

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
when you practice this make sure you use

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.960 
when you practice this make sure you use
a<00:01:24.960> metronome<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.830> don't<00:01:26.130> have<00:01:26.310> one<00:01:26.490> down<00:01:26.670> here

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
a metronome I don't have one down here

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.969 
a metronome I don't have one down here
in<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.180> room<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:28.110> I'm<00:01:28.200> just<00:01:28.409> going<00:01:28.680> off

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
in this room so I'm just going off

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.249 
in this room so I'm just going off
feeling<00:01:29.369> but<00:01:30.030> when<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.360> do<00:01:30.509> practice<00:01:30.810> this

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
feeling but when you do practice this

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.469 
feeling but when you do practice this
the<00:01:31.770> metronome<00:01:32.340> will<00:01:32.549> help<00:01:32.759> make<00:01:32.970> sure<00:01:33.000> that

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
the metronome will help make sure that

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.749 
the metronome will help make sure that
that<00:01:33.720> subdivision<00:01:34.110> switch<00:01:34.860> over<00:01:35.250> time<00:01:35.490> is

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
that subdivision switch over time is

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.530 
that subdivision switch over time is
nice<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:37.130> right<00:01:38.130> on<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.490> beat<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:39.420> other

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
nice and right on the beat and one other

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.270 
nice and right on the beat and one other
way<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.780> practice<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.470> just<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:40.920> its<00:01:41.070> most

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
way to practice is just in its most

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.450 
way to practice is just in its most
basic<00:01:41.430> form<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.509> just<00:01:42.930> go<00:01:43.170> on<00:01:43.320> from<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:44.130> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
basic form is just go on from the the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.069 
basic form is just go on from the the
straight<00:01:44.729> notes<00:01:44.970> into<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.420> triplets<00:01:45.869> and

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
straight notes into the triplets and

00:01:46.079 --> 00:02:00.840 
straight notes into the triplets and
again<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:46.920> with<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.280> metronome

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.490 

now<00:02:01.850> let's<00:02:02.090> work<00:02:02.270> on<00:02:02.569> there<00:02:02.840> is<00:02:02.929> triplets<00:02:03.380> at

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
now let's work on there is triplets at

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.199 
now let's work on there is triplets at
the<00:02:03.619> end<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:04.009> start<00:02:04.100> making<00:02:04.609> them<00:02:04.700> sound<00:02:04.999> a

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:05.209 
the end and start making them sound a

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:07.599 
the end and start making them sound a
little<00:02:05.420> bit<00:02:05.659> more<00:02:05.810> interesting<00:02:06.590> so<00:02:07.219> one<00:02:07.459> way

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609 
little bit more interesting so one way

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.070 
little bit more interesting so one way
to<00:02:07.640> do<00:02:07.909> this<00:02:08.090> is<00:02:08.330> to<00:02:08.539> spread<00:02:08.810> out<00:02:08.959> the

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
to do this is to spread out the

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.589 
to do this is to spread out the
different<00:02:09.470> strokes<00:02:09.860> between<00:02:10.310> snare<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.209> bass

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
different strokes between snare and bass

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:17.740 
different strokes between snare and bass
I'll<00:02:12.319> show<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.680> how<00:02:12.860> that<00:02:12.890> sounds<00:02:16.480> now<00:02:17.480> let's

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
I'll show you how that sounds now let's

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.630 
I'll show you how that sounds now let's
see<00:02:17.989> how<00:02:18.230> that<00:02:18.530> goes<00:02:18.830> with<00:02:19.099> the<00:02:19.220> rest<00:02:19.340> of<00:02:19.549> our

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
see how that goes with the rest of our

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:49.000 
see how that goes with the rest of our
groove<00:02:19.970> I<00:02:47.049> think<00:02:48.049> I'll<00:02:48.170> make<00:02:48.319> a<00:02:48.500> couple<00:02:48.799> of

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
groove I think I'll make a couple of

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.520 
groove I think I'll make a couple of
changes<00:02:49.579> the<00:02:49.970> last<00:02:50.180> stroke<00:02:50.629> of<00:02:50.810> our<00:02:50.989> group<00:02:51.379> of

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
changes the last stroke of our group of

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.440 
changes the last stroke of our group of
six<00:02:51.769> triplets<00:02:52.280> I'm<00:02:52.609> going<00:02:52.819> to<00:02:52.910> change<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.420> a

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
six triplets I'm going to change to a

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.690 
six triplets I'm going to change to a
snare<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.139> then<00:02:54.799> at<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.190> start<00:02:55.430> of<00:02:55.579> the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
snare and then at the start of the

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.210 
snare and then at the start of the
groove<00:02:55.970> our<00:02:56.209> second<00:02:56.870> sixteenth<00:02:57.380> note<00:02:57.620> is<00:02:57.859> also

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
groove our second sixteenth note is also

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:26.520 
groove our second sixteenth note is also
going<00:02:58.340> to<00:02:58.400> be<00:02:58.459> Stan

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.140 

so<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:27.680> change<00:03:27.950> that<00:03:28.130> I<00:03:28.220> made<00:03:28.400> to<00:03:28.550> the<00:03:28.670> triplet

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
so the change that I made to the triplet

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.730 
so the change that I made to the triplet
at<00:03:29.300> the<00:03:29.420> end<00:03:29.570> of<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.780> bar<00:03:29.960> if<00:03:30.200> you<00:03:30.260> didn't

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
at the end of the bar if you didn't

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.340 
at the end of the bar if you didn't
catch<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:30.980> sounds<00:03:31.940> like<00:03:32.120> this<00:03:32.420> when<00:03:32.870> I<00:03:32.900> slow<00:03:33.320> it

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
catch it sounds like this when I slow it

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:51.310 
catch it sounds like this when I slow it
down<00:03:48.940> so<00:03:49.940> now<00:03:50.120> let's<00:03:50.570> just<00:03:50.660> have<00:03:50.930> a<00:03:50.960> bit<00:03:51.170> of<00:03:51.200> a

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
down so now let's just have a bit of a

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.600 
down so now let's just have a bit of a
play<00:03:51.560> with<00:03:51.740> that<00:03:51.920> putting<00:03:52.340> in<00:03:52.460> that

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
play with that putting in that

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.790 
play with that putting in that
subdivision<00:03:52.940> break<00:03:53.570> at<00:03:53.780> different<00:03:54.230> places<00:03:54.500> in

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
subdivision break at different places in

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:23.500 
subdivision break at different places in
the<00:03:55.160> groove<00:04:21.970> so<00:04:22.970> if<00:04:23.030> you<00:04:23.120> want<00:04:23.270> to<00:04:23.330> start

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
the groove so if you want to start

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.270 
the groove so if you want to start
building<00:04:23.870> up<00:04:23.960> into<00:04:24.200> grooves<00:04:24.440> like<00:04:24.650> that<00:04:24.860> where

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
building up into grooves like that where

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.340 
building up into grooves like that where
do<00:04:25.340> you<00:04:25.400> practice<00:04:25.550> the<00:04:25.910> first<00:04:26.060> exercise<00:04:26.750> make

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
do you practice the first exercise make

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.990 
do you practice the first exercise make

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
sure that you're really using the

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.700 
sure that you're really using the
metronome<00:04:29.330> getting<00:04:29.750> those<00:04:29.930> transitions

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
metronome getting those transitions

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.680 
metronome getting those transitions
between<00:04:30.980> the<00:04:31.490> straight<00:04:31.790> sixteenths<00:04:32.330> and<00:04:32.540> this

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
between the straight sixteenths and this

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.350 
between the straight sixteenths and this
triplet<00:04:32.930> sixth<00:04:33.320> sense<00:04:33.500> nice<00:04:34.160> and<00:04:34.520> smooth<00:04:35.000> and

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
triplet sixth sense nice and smooth and

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.240 
triplet sixth sense nice and smooth and
that's<00:04:36.169> where<00:04:36.440> we'll<00:04:36.560> leave<00:04:36.740> it<00:04:36.950> for<00:04:37.160> this
