that size you want to get something

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.890 
that size you want to get something
that's<00:01:28.460> got<00:01:28.640> a<00:01:28.700> nice<00:01:28.910> arm<00:01:29.270> on<00:01:29.510> it<00:01:29.600> because<00:01:29.750> if

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
that's got a nice arm on it because if

not<00:01:30.050> the<00:01:30.350> weight<00:01:30.500> of<00:01:30.590> it<00:01:30.680> will<00:01:30.830> actually<00:01:30.950> start

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
not the weight of it will actually start
