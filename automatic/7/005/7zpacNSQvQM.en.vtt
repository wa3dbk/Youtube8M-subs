using it for a while now on the River
Trent<00:01:18.520> and<00:01:18.790> it<00:01:19.420> really<00:01:19.900> does<00:01:20.080> help<00:01:20.259> prevent<00:01:21.070> a

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
Trent and it really does help prevent a

lot of tangles and just let me show you

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.930 
lot of tangles and just let me show you
there's<00:01:26.020> four<00:01:26.380> main<00:01:26.619> components<00:01:26.860> you've<00:01:27.759> got

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940

on the end which two pieces sold almost
like<00:01:42.130> a<00:01:42.160> split<00:01:42.520> pin<00:01:42.850> they<00:01:43.149> just<00:01:43.390> pull<00:01:43.570> apart

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
like a split pin they just pull apart

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.660 
like a split pin they just pull apart
and<00:01:44.200> you<00:01:44.320> slide<00:01:44.800> your<00:01:45.009> let<00:01:45.190> over<00:01:45.369> there<00:01:47.520> as<00:01:48.520> you

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
and you slide your let over there as you

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.570 
and you slide your let over there as you
can<00:01:48.850> see<00:01:49.090> there<00:01:49.300> they<00:01:49.450> just<00:01:49.950> open<00:01:50.950> up<00:01:51.070> two<00:01:51.460> or

as I said which it just slides over

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.520 
as I said which it just slides over
there<00:02:03.070> makes<00:02:03.310> it<00:02:03.460> all<00:02:03.610> nice<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:03.880> neat<00:02:04.180> and<00:02:04.630> the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
there makes it all nice and neat and the

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.509

see<00:02:27.850> if<00:02:27.940> I<00:02:28.000> can<00:02:28.209> manage<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.510> feed<00:02:29.470> that<00:02:29.739> line

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
see if I can manage to feed that line

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.970 
see if I can manage to feed that line
through<00:02:30.250> there<00:02:31.590> second<00:02:32.590> time<00:02:32.799> maybe<00:02:33.100> no<00:02:34.980> there

let<00:03:29.060> go<00:03:29.389> I<00:03:33.099> like<00:03:34.099> to<00:03:34.430> snip<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.209> line<00:03:35.449> and<00:03:35.810> leave

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
let go I like to snip the line and leave

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.349 
let go I like to snip the line and leave
about<00:03:36.139> three<00:03:36.739> mil<00:03:36.980> there<00:03:37.219> don't<00:03:37.489> like<00:03:37.699> to<00:03:37.909> cut

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
about three mil there don't like to cut

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.619 
about three mil there don't like to cut
it<00:03:38.510> too<00:03:38.750> too<00:03:39.650> close<00:03:40.150> because<00:03:41.150> it's<00:03:41.359> all<00:03:41.540> going

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:41.629 
it too too close because it's all going

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.509 
it too too close because it's all going
to<00:03:41.750> be<00:03:41.810> tidy<00:03:42.230> anyway<00:03:42.560> by<00:03:42.799> the<00:03:42.889> time<00:03:43.189> you<00:03:43.340> put

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
to be tidy anyway by the time you put

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:52.990 
to be tidy anyway by the time you put
the<00:03:43.639> sleeve<00:03:43.939> over

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.490 

so<00:03:54.230> see<00:03:55.230> there<00:03:55.469> that<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:55.799> just<00:03:57.260> slips<00:03:58.260> over

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
so see there that that just slips over
