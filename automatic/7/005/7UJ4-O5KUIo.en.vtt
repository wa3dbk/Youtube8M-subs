00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.160
 Hello, today I want to share 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:10.080
 old recipes 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.889
 very tasty beautiful wholesome and 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.509
 undeservedly forgotten beet kvass 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.580
 unlike all other useful and 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.279
 vintage recipes it is really very 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.810
 delicious and beautiful place to him 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:33.059
 Well, I would say completely at his desk and so 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:41.460
 we will need 2 hours of beets 3 liters 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:45.750
 water 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.600
 who wants drunk on cool 4 and even 6 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.300
 tablespoons of sugar drink well and 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.980
 yeast 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.949
 I want to note that yeast should 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:01.500
 be just such a harsh kind 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:03.589
 otherwise it will be very tasteless build here 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.780
 he is so soft yeast and what marks 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:10.740
 sold somewhere you can find it in 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:15.119
 In principle, I have become so much further on. 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:18.799
 mean 6 seconds while you teach the cycle 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:23.869
 put the kettle 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:34.259
 to have in my kitchen of course the product 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:41.180
 I'm still not a chef and I love those 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:41.180
 a teacher thing 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.110
 kettle boils water should be 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.110
 be sure to boil 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:09.729
 Well , I'm a lazy man 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:13.920
 I clean this thing and we are easy and how 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.920
 everything would be simple and fast 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:28.150
 here from under 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:32.019
 readings went well here 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:37.140
 cycle polished tiberio 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:39.819
 straight hot water load here 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:44.319
 I already added sugar and added 4 spoons 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:46.329
 because i like drunk here you can 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.910
 man more drunk big there six 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.410
 spoons over there will be generally such for 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.690
 more sword holster medan 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.850
 mead will be well as a little beer 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:00.310
 so here Niklas neither there nor here on the loops 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:04.630

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:10.239

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:11.829
 color then hot hot wait while in 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.140
 him to leave at least 40 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:17.790
 30 degrees and after that it will be possible 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.790
 add our mega and yeast 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:25.849
 here 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:34.780
 you have reached 40 degrees like this 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:34.780
 nice just cut off the drocha 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.790
 no matter how much throw in principle 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.780
 friendly and equal analysis multiplies 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.250
 would be more than just throw requires less 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.069
 longer 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:57.530
 in general, as far as ready peony 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.530
