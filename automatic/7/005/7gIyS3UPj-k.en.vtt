00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.530 
don't want to place that on there right
now<00:03:10.310> because<00:03:10.760> that's<00:03:10.849> not<00:03:11.030> where<00:03:11.150> I<00:03:11.209> want<00:03:11.420> it

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
but you just take it and place them

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:14.680 
but you just take it and place them
where<00:03:13.670> you<00:03:13.760> want<00:03:13.879> them<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.150> then<00:03:14.269> you<00:03:14.420> hold

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
that over it for about 15 seconds and

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.080 
that over it for about 15 seconds and
there's<00:03:17.660> glue<00:03:18.019> underneath<00:03:18.590> that<00:03:18.980> stud<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.700> it

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
there's glue underneath that stud and it

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.300 
there's glue underneath that stud and it
melts<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:20.720> glue<00:03:20.959> and<00:03:21.380> it<00:03:21.590> adheres<00:03:21.739> to<00:03:22.190> the

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
melts the glue and it adheres to the

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.280 
melts the glue and it adheres to the
Jean<00:03:22.519> nice<00:03:22.910> and<00:03:23.209> I<00:03:23.269> can<00:03:23.480> wash<00:03:23.660> these<00:03:23.930> and<00:03:24.109> you

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:25.669 
can wash them what I recommend though

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.460 
can wash them what I recommend though
and<00:03:25.940> that's<00:03:26.060> a<00:03:26.329> question<00:03:26.569> that<00:03:26.750> joy<00:03:26.989> had<00:03:27.290> is

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
and that's a question that joy had is

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.259 
and that's a question that joy had is
what<00:03:27.620> do<00:03:27.680> we<00:03:27.739> do<00:03:27.950> after<00:03:28.130> we<00:03:28.280> bling<00:03:28.609> you<00:03:28.849> turn

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
what do we do after we bling you turn

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.210 
what do we do after we bling you turn
him<00:03:29.359> inside<00:03:29.540> out<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:30.260> do<00:03:30.709> not<00:03:30.859> put<00:03:31.040> them<00:03:31.130> in

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
him inside out and do not put them in

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.559 
him inside out and do not put them in
the<00:03:31.250> dryer<00:03:31.519> because<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:32.030> heat<00:03:32.239> from<00:03:32.389> the

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
the dryer because the heat from the

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.330 
the dryer because the heat from the
dryer<00:03:32.690> might<00:03:33.109> activate<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.859> glue<00:03:34.040> on<00:03:34.220> the

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
dryer might activate the glue on the

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.339 
dryer might activate the glue on the
studs<00:03:34.669> but<00:03:35.359> you<00:03:35.480> shouldn't<00:03:35.810> do<00:03:35.959> whether<00:03:36.169> you

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
studs but you shouldn't do whether you

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:37.659 
studs but you shouldn't do whether you
make<00:03:36.530> them<00:03:36.650> yourself<00:03:36.739> or<00:03:37.099> buy<00:03:37.220> them<00:03:37.370> anyway

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:37.669 
make them yourself or buy them anyway

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.030 
make them yourself or buy them anyway
okay<00:03:38.180> so<00:03:38.599> that's<00:03:38.780> one<00:03:39.019> technique<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.620> iron-on

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040
