00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.790
Upin! Ipin! Where do you think you're going?

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.440
Hurry, Upin! We're going to be late!

00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:11.509
Whoa!

00:00:25.434 --> 00:00:29.026
From the Heart.
Part 2.

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.345
After that, a lot of people came
to help put out the fire.

00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:48.194
Oh...

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.869
I was... in the house...

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:56.386
Then I got out...

00:00:57.231 --> 00:00:59.651
Everything was burning!

00:01:01.236 --> 00:01:03.574
I think you guys should go home...

00:01:05.151 --> 00:01:08.045
Ijat, we'll come back to see you later, okay?

00:01:09.473 --> 00:01:12.491
Yes, yes, yes.
Don't feel so sad.

00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:14.541
We're all here to help you.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.307
We'll be going now.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.957
Bye, Ijat...

00:01:20.214 --> 00:01:24.608
Good morning, Miss Jasmin!

00:01:24.608 --> 00:01:27.341
Good morning, everyone. Sit.

00:01:27.727 --> 00:01:31.491
Kids, a very special guest
is coming over today.

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:33.606
Who do you think it is?
- Who? Who?

00:01:33.606 --> 00:01:36.641
Is it Dr. Ravi?
- You're doomed, Mail!

00:01:36.641 --> 00:01:39.025
Good thing I brushed my teeth.

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:40.374
Who is it?

00:01:42.464 --> 00:01:45.214
Who's that, Ipin? She looks like Opah.

00:01:45.214 --> 00:01:48.388
Kids, this is Tan Sri Zaleha.

00:01:48.388 --> 00:01:51.715
She's here today to share something with us.

00:01:51.715 --> 00:01:54.186
What do you think, Ijat?

00:01:56.875 --> 00:01:59.095
How are you doing, children?

00:01:59.095 --> 00:02:03.216
We're fine, Tan Sri Zaleha!

00:02:03.216 --> 00:02:05.347
Just call me Tok Wan.

00:02:05.347 --> 00:02:07.748
We're fine, Tok Wan!

00:02:08.178 --> 00:02:09.608
Very good.

00:02:09.608 --> 00:02:11.067
Before I begin...

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.143
Wow, looks like Tok Wan got us some presents!

00:02:16.143 --> 00:02:18.444
Yay!
- Yay, presents!

00:02:19.254 --> 00:02:21.937
Me first! Me first!

00:02:21.937 --> 00:02:23.721
Here. One each.

00:02:24.532 --> 00:02:25.981
So pretty!

00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:28.666
These are for you.
- Thank you, Miss Jasmin.

00:02:28.666 --> 00:02:31.435
Miss Jasmin, can I have another one?
- You already have one, Ehsan.

00:02:31.435 --> 00:02:34.590
Kids, what do you say to Tok Wan?

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.435
Thank you, Tok Wan!

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.667
You're welcome.

00:02:38.667 --> 00:02:43.700
Children, today, we are going to talk about this.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.223
Wow, money!

00:02:45.951 --> 00:02:47.098
Ten cents!

00:02:47.098 --> 00:02:48.868
That's right.

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:51.193
Do any of you have ten cents?

00:02:51.586 --> 00:02:53.260
Wait, wait. I think I have it.

00:02:55.854 --> 00:02:57.985
I don't have ten cents.

00:02:57.985 --> 00:03:00.373
I have one Ringgit! Will this do?

00:03:00.373 --> 00:03:01.623
I have it!

00:03:05.281 --> 00:03:08.483
Oops, I forgot to bring it.
- Mei Mei.

00:03:09.781 --> 00:03:14.392
You can have mine. Here.
- Thank you!

00:03:14.392 --> 00:03:15.299
You're welcome.

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.359
What can you buy with ten cents?

00:03:19.055 --> 00:03:20.342
Sweets?

00:03:21.195 --> 00:03:27.629
If you must know, with this ten cents,
you can help people.

00:03:29.787 --> 00:03:32.787
Do you know how?
- How?

00:03:32.787 --> 00:03:37.788
Here's how. You just give
ten cents to people.

00:03:37.788 --> 00:03:41.353
Can you imagine? One person gives ten cents.

00:03:41.353 --> 00:03:43.194
If the whole class did the same thing,

00:03:43.194 --> 00:03:46.929
How much will you get?
- How much? Let's count.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.462
Wow!
- A lot, right?

00:03:58.462 --> 00:04:01.351
What if the whole village donated ten cents?

00:04:13.854 --> 00:04:16.172
What are you doing, Mail?

00:04:18.102 --> 00:04:19.805
What's up with Mail?
- Mail!

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.848
Hmph, dreaming about money again.
- Yeah, that's right.

00:04:27.966 --> 00:04:29.822
There's a saying about this.

00:04:29.822 --> 00:04:32.826
Even grains of sand, over time, will build a...

00:04:32.826 --> 00:04:35.374
Mountain!
- Good.

00:04:35.374 --> 00:04:38.744
Don't underestimate ten cents.

00:04:38.744 --> 00:04:41.421
All right, who wants to read this?

00:04:43.117 --> 00:04:44.301
Me! Me!

00:04:44.301 --> 00:04:46.301
Thank God for Mei Mei.

00:04:47.928 --> 00:04:49.848
Okay, listen carefully.

00:04:49.848 --> 00:04:51.411
Mail...

00:04:53.243 --> 00:04:55.019
Me again...

00:04:57.038 --> 00:05:03.413
It's all about sharing and caring for each other.

00:05:03.413 --> 00:05:07.279
To achieve peace and harmony in this world,

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:11.450
We have to begin as soon as possible.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.368
Every drop of water...

00:05:13.368 --> 00:05:16.199
Every cl... click...

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.031
Every cent will not be taken for granted.

00:05:19.031 --> 00:05:21.071
Thank you very much.

00:05:22.941 --> 00:05:24.460
Very good!

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.752
Do you know what that means?

00:05:27.442 --> 00:05:28.961
No, Tok Wan.

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:33.882
It means we have to look out
for each other.

00:05:33.882 --> 00:05:36.823
We have to share,
through good times and bad.

00:05:36.823 --> 00:05:38.972
That way, we'll have a peaceful world.

00:05:39.411 --> 00:05:42.053
So if you want a peaceful world,

00:05:42.053 --> 00:05:45.055
We have to start with children.

00:05:45.808 --> 00:05:47.163
You mean...

00:05:47.163 --> 00:05:48.447
Children like us?

00:05:48.447 --> 00:05:49.908
That's right.

00:05:50.524 --> 00:05:53.041
But where will all the money go?

00:05:53.989 --> 00:05:58.704
We will give all the money
to people who need them.

00:05:58.704 --> 00:06:03.156
Like people in accidents,
going through bad times,

00:06:03.156 --> 00:06:06.472
Disasters, fire...

00:06:06.472 --> 00:06:08.035
And everything else.

00:06:08.035 --> 00:06:12.923
It doesn't matter how much you give,

00:06:12.923 --> 00:06:16.436
As long as you're giving from the heart.

00:06:16.436 --> 00:06:18.877
Because the hand that gives

00:06:18.877 --> 00:06:22.070
Is better than the hand that receives.

00:06:25.503 --> 00:06:26.451
Take it.

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:29.910
Remember what Tok Wan said.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.960
All right, kids. Say thank you to Tok Wan.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.238
Thank you, Tok Wan!

00:06:35.238 --> 00:06:37.835
Thanks, Tan Sri.
- You're welcome.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.970
To be continued...
