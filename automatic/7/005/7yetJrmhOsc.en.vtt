00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.390
 here 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.270
 retaking what Marisol told us in 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.640
 the previous video today I would like it 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.470
 teach and give them some city they 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.419
 know your beauty products for 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.189
 when they go on vacation for the 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.680
 find and also do not weigh them 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.390
 both the suitcase and remember to stay 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.519
 until the end of this video because we have 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.559
 a gift kit that you will love and 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:37.559
 who can take they go to their vacations 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.010
 the current status of the regulations 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.200
 of travel and the weight of our suitcase we 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.570
 force a little more to organize us to the 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.100
 Travel time to leave is why 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.530
 today I want to share 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.570
 some ideas and products that should 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.060
 carry in your suitcase for when they go to the 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.790
 city ​​or go to the beach I suggest 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.070
 make three bags let's start with 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.620
 the number one this is to take in the 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.660
 plane when we are traveling we are 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.310
 dehydrates the skin we want to touch up a 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.770
 little the concealer and then they 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.180
 I suggest transparent bags so that 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.970
 can see what they bring there 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.250
 inside also bring a powder for that 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.170
 retouch a concealer to also for 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.690
 the dark circles if they got a little bit 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.330
 the eyes to disguise the and finally 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.280
 a lipstick or a gloss for you to have 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.380
 this color and it also works for you as 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.899
 blush at the last minute 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.460
 bag number 2 this is a little more 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.799
 big because this is where you're going to take 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.350
 almost all your products but first 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.630
 you have to see what places you're going to go in 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.850
 this trip if you go to the city ​​maybe 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.829
 you need to be doing makeup often and 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.869
 change the colors of what you're 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.549
 putting you need more variety I'll 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.470
 I suggest bringing a little more 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.810
 you have a variety of colors 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.299
 neutral tones but you also have 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.340
 more intense colors are pallets 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.319
 They also include flushes and bronzers 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.940
 with an enthusiastic illuminator is 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:05.610
 all-in-one and you do not need anything else 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.040
 a trip where you need nothing more 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.930
 be retouching by highlighting your eyes 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.060
 I suggest a palette a little smaller 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.920
 with neutral tones you do not need much 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.990
 you can delineate and you can do everything with 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.510
 this if you're going to carry something a little more 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.600
 small I suggest you take a blush 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.970
 in a neutral tone because this goes with everything 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.710
 after this I also suggest that 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.200
 take your tests is maybe more to walk 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.060
 walking us ride in the taxi then 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.970
 It is important that your makeup looks 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.620
 all day you need a pre-base for 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.200
 the face so that it lasts longer 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.180
 makeup and also one for the eyes 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.780
 This is going to make your eyes always 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.180
 They look intense and beautiful after you go to 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.400
 need to wear your mascara or obviously 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.100
 so that those eyes of those lashes will 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.740
 highlight and finally we will choose a 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.110
 Make up a makeup that works for you 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.330
 for the day that is something light but that 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.490
 Then maybe if you wet it, they give you more 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.440
 coverage for the night so that 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.380
 it's up to you I like older 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.750
 with the liquid but everything depends on you and 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.000
 Lastly, it is here also our 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.770
 brushes you need to carry a set 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.720
 even if it's a few so that the 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.320
 bring in the trip and you can fix yourself 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.660
 lipsticks I suggest 1 pink and one red or 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.400
 can be a null and a red one depends on 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.170
 what you like to use so 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.980
 also carries your favorites but with two 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.230
 they are enough 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.420
 and finally we have our bag 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.519
 number 3 in this bag you must carry 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.349
 all your creams and that depends on you and 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.690
 what you use daily but I suggest it 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.790
 bring a cream to the eyes a cream 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.769
 for the day and a cream for the night 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.230
 here you can also include your protector 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.150
 solar if you want liquid or powder and 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.099
 Finally some cleansing towels 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.170
 soto make-up remover liquid you can 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.660
 take a bag where you can pass 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.489
 your shampoo and your soap for you to bring 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.799
 the things that you like and you know that 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.480
 they work for you too and these girls 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.849
 are the differences that I give them for 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.370
 when they are going to travel to the beach or 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.720
 the city works very well for me and 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.700
 the fact that the bags are 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.890
 Transparent helps me to get out more 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.840
 organized and find faster what 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.379
 I 'm looking for, I hope there's 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:17.129
 liked and I hope your comments too 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:17.129
 I was fascinated by the idea 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.220
 a fruit that you more before the last time 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.290
 I went traveling bag me when 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:33.330
 everything is made a mess 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:36.710
 stirred all the shadows where I've 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.090
 been horrible if you do not have a 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.530
 bubbles what you can do is with a 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.210
 You can wrap us up newspaper 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.550
 especially not the things that are of 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.320
 book or that can be opened I like 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.200
 wrap the external ones I put a bag 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:53.900
 cycle in case it opens like this and all now 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.900
 nothing further in the bag and not between 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.800
 teeth and you have to compress a 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.130
 little bit so they do not move and already with 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.130
 that 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.840
 remember that we have a gift kit 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.210
 for this trip you want me to go in your 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.190
 good suitcase nothing else better
