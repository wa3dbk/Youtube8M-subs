00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
articles so i edit videos plus i went to

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.440 
articles so i edit videos plus i went to
school<00:06:02.870> for<00:06:03.110> that<00:06:03.620> oshkosh<00:06:04.310> i<00:06:04.610> went<00:06:04.880> to<00:06:05.150> school

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
school for that oshkosh i went to school

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.200 
school for that oshkosh i went to school
and<00:06:06.230> I<00:06:06.500> studied<00:06:06.920> video<00:06:07.250> production<00:06:07.880> stuff

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
and I studied video production stuff

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.360 
and I studied video production stuff
these<00:06:08.420> aren't<00:06:08.750> exactly<00:06:09.140> professional<00:06:09.950> videos

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
these aren't exactly professional videos

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.310 
these aren't exactly professional videos
but<00:06:10.760> I<00:06:10.820> think<00:06:11.210> they're<00:06:11.480> a<00:06:11.690> little<00:06:12.500> bit

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
but I think they're a little bit

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.540 
but I think they're a little bit
smoother<00:06:15.320> than<00:06:15.620> some<00:06:15.890> of<00:06:16.010> the<00:06:16.100> stuff<00:06:16.400> out

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
smoother than some of the stuff out

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.690 
smoother than some of the stuff out
